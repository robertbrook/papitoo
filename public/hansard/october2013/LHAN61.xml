There are already provisions in place to protect the
more vulnerable. Utility regulators take steps to assess the quality
and affordability of services for customers, including the vulnerable.
Should companies wish to charge more for a paper bill they must make
such charges transparent in advance and ensure that they reflect only
additional processing costs incurred. The Government are increasing
online access by accelerating broadband rollout, promoting simple bank
accounts and increasing digital skills to use electronic
payments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:49:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Deech" PimsId="4986" UID="13102966000577" xid="1903" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000577">Baroness
Deech (CB):</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his appreciation of
the problem, but is he aware that 16 million people—and
4 million disabled people—are not on the internet? Even if they
were, the cost of printing and ink is such that the companies are
pushing the charges back on to the consumer. Extra charges and
discounts add up to quite a lot a year. Does he 
<?notus-xml column=1444?>agree that every consumer should be able to choose a
paper copy of communications and bills from media companies, energy
companies and so on without being penalised? Will he press the relevant
regulators—Ofcom and Ofgem—to ensure that consumers are
not so

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> Interestingly, this is not an area
where regulators receive many complaints and more vulnerable customers
often have access to special tariffs. However, the noble Baroness
raises an interesting point. I understand, for example, that BT charges
£1.50 for paper bills, which relates largely to its broadband
customers who clearly have internet access and can receive bills
online. We believe that the charge is reasonable, covering costs such
as printing and postage. Customers using a BT basic telephone service
are not charged for paper
bills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:51:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes" PimsId="2202" UID="13102966000579" xid="1374" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000579">Baroness
Oppenheim-Barnes (Con):</Member></B> Is my noble friend aware that the
noble Baroness, Lady Deech, is to be congratulated on raising this
issue? The problem is very widespread. The Government are not to be
congratulated. People of all ages often choose not to go online even if
it is available to them. Charges are made by the utilities because you
have to use that very expensive telephone line, which has the most
often-played recording of all time which starts, “We are
encountering an extraordinary level of calls”. That means the
call will cost even more. That is only one of the things that consumers
have to put up with. The excuse given by all who make those
charges is that it is more efficient and they can therefore charge
lower prices. I have not noticed that happening. This is an urgent
matter and I hope that the Government will take it
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000011"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:52:11"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13102966000580" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000580">Viscount

clearly some people still wish to receive bills through the post.
However, a number of organisations across the UK offer free IT skills
training and cater for the elderly and disabled, including the UK

encourage more people to go

Baroness that I am very much in listening mode and say again that some
people will always genuinely want to receive bills and statements

defensively on this issue. Could he please listen? We are talking about
7 million adults, largely elderly, and vulnerable and disabled people

pushing people in the wrong direction, for example, by renewing
contracts over the internet. People are not aware of this and then

online could, in certain circumstances, amount to indirect
discrimination unless it is a proportionate means of achieving a

choice whether or not people prefer to use the internet: for many

among others, the English representative on the European court. Does it
not show, first, that we are virtually unique in Europe, since every
other European 
<?notus-xml column=1447?>country has either no life imprisonment or the possibility of revising
or reducing it? Secondly, does it not show that the United Kingdom has
a far more punitive penal philosophy in these matters? This philosophy
ignores the possibility of review or, perhaps, of release. It ignores
the basic principle of rehabilitation and denies, in the words of the
court, “the right to hope”. The Minister is a humane and

Opposition because it was under their watch that this right was taken
away in 2003. Whether that happened by mistake or by intention, I do
not know, but it was under the previous Government that the provision

the court clearly suggested that an error had been made, quite
inadvertently, when the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was passed. Prior to
that period, all life sentences were reviewable after a quarter of a
century. It did not mean that anybody was thereby released; it meant
that the sentence was reviewed. That is the narrow point. By failing to
review, we are—according to the judgment of 16 to one, including

My Lords, we are working with retailers through the

<?notus-xml column=1451?>to reduce food waste. We have set targets on reducing food and packaging
waste for food retailers and manufacturers under the third phase of the
Courtauld commitment which runs from 2013 to 2015. This phase targets a
further 1.1 million tonnes of waste reduction. Forty-nine signatories

legislation specifically is not needed. Tesco’s initiative,
which I warmly welcome, shows that the voluntary approach is working.

it and means they can focus their efforts in the right

spiralling, as people struggle with the cost of living crisis. Is there

“Buy one, get one free” deals represent a relatively
small proportion of supermarket promotions. The majority of promotions
are temporary price reductions: for example, “Was £8, now
£6”. “Buy one, get one free” deals are
often on non-perishable items or items with long lives, and WRAP is

perishable foods.</hs_para>

animals, although I am sure he is aware that there are some exceptions
with low-risk foods such as bread, vegetables and fruit. We keep the
situation regarding disposal of food and catering waste under review

well-being. If an individual desired to have their spiritual well-being
promoted, the local authority would be required to do that. On the
other hand, if the individual expressed no desire to have their
spiritual needs attended to then they would not get any form of
spiritual counselling. That works well in the NHS, where you do not
hear of an atheist’s interests being overridden. There is no
reason why it should not work equally well with local authorities.
Indeed, the Home Care Association, the London Borough of Hillingdon and

those in the evening of their lives, for whom this is an exceptionally
important dimension of those lives. I urge colleagues in all parts of
the House to recognise the profound importance of this simple amendment
and, if my noble friend feels inclined to test the opinion of the
House, to react sympathetically. I hope that that will not be
necessary, however; my noble friend has referred to the misgivings of
the Chief Whip over Divisions on Third Reading. Like him, I understand
those reservations, but the fact is that the Minister said that this
was a matter to which we would return at Third Reading, and that he
would try to table something. He has been as good as his word in
tabling it, but I do not believe that he has quite met the points that
concerned my noble friend Lord Hamilton and I, and many others.

support this amendment because I think that the reason that the noble
Lord, Lord Warner, for example, objects to it is that he associates the
word “spiritual” entirely with religious belief. As a
matter of fact, I think the word has a much wider meaning that has
nothing to do with religious belief, although of course for many people
it does refer to religious belief. However, there are many people who
are not religious who would nevertheless accept the word
“spiritual” as covering what, in a sort of 18th-century
sense, might be referred to as matters of sentiment; not belief, but a
deep and profound romantic sentiment connected with the concept of
nature and man’s place in nature. These are thoughts that come
into one’s head in one’s declining

Nevertheless, the principles were well rooted. As a student, I clearly

Barker (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Hamilton, for his kind words about the work I did on this
issue. On Report, I tabled the amendment which stands in his name today
because at that point the Government were working to a definition of
well-being which was about emotional well-being, and it was my view
that it did not sufficiently encapsulate the matters we would define as
spiritual. My name is not on the amendment today because over the past
few weeks I have discussed this at some considerable length with a
number of people, not least with the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord
Warner, on BBC Radio 4 at some unearthly hour a couple of Sundays
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000089">I think
the Minister has met us where we need to be because his amendment
refers to “feelings and beliefs”, which is a fairly wide
and inclusive term. It is important that we take his words, not the
wording proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, because most of the
discussion this afternoon has been about health and healthcare in
healthcare settings, such as end-of-life settings, but this Bill is
about social care at its widest in the community. Therefore we are
perhaps not talking about the well-being of people at the end stage of
their life, and it is important that we stick to a wider definition of
a person’s beliefs because we are not talking just about medical
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000090">The
way the Government have framed the argument is sufficiently wide to
include spiritual beliefs. I think in the normal course of
conversation, when we talk about beliefs, we have almost a hierarchy of
them. Religious beliefs perhaps come fairly high at the top; then
people would secondarily think about spiritual beliefs. They might go
on to talk about political beliefs being important to a person’s
well-being. That is why I think that this time the Government
have got this right. It is sufficiently clear and sufficiently
inclusive to reflect all the concerns that remain legitimate on behalf
of people backing my noble friend Lord Cormack’s
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000091">On
this occasion the belt and braces are unnecessary and the noble Earl,
Lord Howe, has got the House to the point where it wants to be. I will
be quite happy to support that, not least because I think if we reform
it we go with that formulation of words. Then we will be able to do the
one thing which I think the law has to do, which is to be there as a
backstop for those people who believe that their feelings and wishes
are not being acknowledged and are being abused. That is the primary
purpose of this legislation. Therefore, it should be as wide as
possible.</hs_para>

in which such a matter arose and spirituality was not mentioned in the

the Bill was amended as my noble friend suggests. Like the Chief Whip,

interested in this discussion at an earlier stage of the Bill. Our
concern is that the original Government view is that spiritual issues
would be embraced by Clause 1(2)(b) under the words
“emotional well-being”. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker,
and I did not feel that that was sufficient. Indeed, we had some
worries that spiritual well-being could actually be subsumed under the
terms “emotional
well-being”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000094">The
noble Earl, Lord Howe, has, I think, met our concerns. As he said in
his letter to us, adding “beliefs” to Clause 1(3)(b)
enables spiritual beliefs to be encompassed within that term without
excluding any other forms of belief that may not be described as
spiritual. I think that meets the concerns that I had about this
matter. I would like the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, to draw a
distinction between the specific issue that noble Lords have raised in
relation to the health service, which is clearly designed to ensure
that the NHS employs a chaplaincy service and which I absolutely
subscribe to. Indeed, I would tribute to the chaplaincy service up and
down the country. However, this Bill is about a different set of
circumstances. To the noble Lord, Lord Elton, I say that employment
issues do not arise in this regard. We are talking about Clause 1 of
the Bill, which is about promoting the individual well-being within the
context of the Care Bill. I I understand the point that he raised, but
I do not think it arises in this context.</hs_para>

the matter in hand, I thank noble Lords for the tremendous
dedication that they have shown to the scrutiny of the Bill
during its passage through the House. It is a landmark piece of
legislation, and I hope that the House will agree that the changes that
the Government have made in response to the debates that we have had
have strengthened the Bill so that it will pass to the other place in
an even better state. Many noble Lords across this House have dedicated
impressive time and energy to improving the provisions in all parts of

individually, as I would like to. However, I thank again those noble

turn to my noble friend’s amendment. Under Clause 1, local
authorities must promote individuals’ well-being and must also
have regard to individuals’ views, wishes and feelings. As I set
out during our debate on Report, we consider that these provisions mean
that a local authority would take a person’s spiritual views,
wishes and feelings into account in promoting their well-being.
However, in response to concerns raised by a number of noble Lords on
Report, I have now tabled an amendment to make it absolutely clear that
these matters should be considered where they are of importance to the
individual.</hs_para>

“beliefs” to the matters to which a local authority must
have regard when exercising care and support functions. Having regard
to someone’s beliefs includes their spiritual beliefs; for
example, ensuring access to an appropriate figure of religious

as Amendment 1 in the name of my noble friend Lord Hamilton, but I
suggest to him and to the House that the government amendment is
preferable, for two reasons.</hs_para>

quite deliberately does not refer specifically to
“spiritual” well-being, but applies instead more widely
to beliefs, which was the point made very effectively by my noble

noble friend Lord Hamilton compared what we are proposing in the Bill
to the situation in the National Health Service. The NHS does not have
a duty to promote spiritual well-being and, if it did, that potentially
would have the negative consequences that I outlined. Having said that,
the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, is of course right—the NHS
must take a patient-centred approach when planning and delivering
services, and that would naturally include having regard to an
individual’s beliefs where relevant. It is exactly this position
that the Bill will replicate for local authorities when they plan and
deliver care and support. To support the NHS in fulfilling its
functions the Department of Health has produced best-practice guidance
on NHS chaplaincy but I struggle to understand how that can equate to a
duty in primary legislation on local authorities to promote spiritual
well-being as my noble friend would have

as the unremunerated president of the Society of Later Life
Advisers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:11:43"></hs_TimeCode>. Why
has this matter come up again at Third Reading? It is because there
were discussions in progress between the Minister, the two co-signees
of this amendment and me, which had not yet concluded and the Minister
generously agreed that we could bring it up at Third Reading. I think
that the time has been well used. Certainly on the principles of the
matter there is now complete accord between the Minister and ourselves.
We are all agreed that taking financial advice must not be compulsory
but equally we are agreed that it is not enough for the local authority
just to hand over a list of names of advisers and say, “Take it
from there”. In the fashionable words of today, we are agreed
that they have to be nudged into doing what is invariably in their own
interests as well as that of the
council<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:12:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this, that it would be valuable, not only for this House but for
outside interests, if he were to spell out in a little more detail the
Government’s intentions in this regard. We have reached a
position of great harmony. I thank him for all the time he and his

Sharkey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak very briefly in
support of the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, spoke with his
usual clarity in moving the amendment and I shall not repeat his
arguments, which seem to me to be compelling. However, I will point out
that the amendment now before us is in effect the last remaining part
of a discussion that started at Second Reading, continued in Committee
and on Report and in private meetings with the Minister and his
officials. At the start there were, broadly speaking, two concerns
about information and advice. The first was about the Dilnot
recommendation that there should be an extensive public awareness
campaign about the facts and the implications of the cap. Our concern
was essentially about the leadership, the scale and the monitoring of
this campaign. I am very grateful to the Minister and his officials for
all the discussions that they have had with us over this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:14:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:14:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

am pleased that we appear to have arrived at a satisfactory
understanding. The Minister has confirmed in writing that the
department has a vital role to play at national level. He has also
confirmed that the department will co-ordinate the message to ensure a
simple, coherent campaign. He has made it clear that the campaign will
require concentrated effort and resource over a period of time. As to
monitoring the effectiveness of the campaign, the Minister has again
made it clear that the adult social care outcomes framework and the
English Longitudinal Study of Ageing will contain the appropriate
measures and
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:15:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000119">I
was enormously encouraged that the department has begun work on new
questions for the annual health survey for England to enable us to
track public awareness of these measures over time. The fieldwork for
this, I understand, will be carried out in 2014 and the results will be
available to us at the end of 2015, in time to establish a baseline for
the information campaigns which are due to start in 2015 and
2016<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:15:56"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has said, we are still left with a
concern over the provision of financial advice, and in particular over
the provision, where appropriate, of independent financial advice. That
is the issue addressed by the amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord
Lipsey, has said, our discussions seem to indicate that there is not
much, if any, real difference between the proposers of the amendment
and the Government. I hope that that is the case and that the
Government may be prepared to accept our amendment today or to give us
reassurance that its objective will be fulfilled by other
means<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:16:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_29_PT_1/0A061D9D310949A0056146C848C7B307BBFC5B1E" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 October 2013">Tuesday,

was worried about the same points as those raised by the noble Lords,
Lord Lipsey and Lord Sharkey, particularly for the people who need
rather different kinds of advice from that which we take for granted in
financial advice. I refer to those people who might need additional
advice on their housing or other needs that are broader than or
slightly different to pure financial advice. The word
“facilitating” is key. Local authorities must enable
people, as well as they possibly can, to get the correct financial
advice they need for their particular circumstances. I believe that we
have arrived there and I thank my colleagues, and in particular the
noble Earl, for meeting our
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:17:52"></hs_TimeCode> so

Best (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, speaking as president of the Local

a source of finance for meeting care costs.</hs_para>

access to such advice, of course, will add to the duties and burdens on
local authorities. That must be recognised, as with the implementation
costs for the so-called Dilnot arrangements, in the financial
settlement that central government makes with local government. The
costs involved for local authorities may not be very great but they
should nevertheless be acknowledged. With that point in mind, I am
delighted to give firm support to the amendment. I am sure that, as

wisely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:18:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000124"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" PimsId="1076" UID="13102966000661" xid="1755" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000661">Lord
Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may raise a
couple of points with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:19:02"></hs_TimeCode>. First, to
reinforce the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Best, about the cost
falling on local authorities in providing facilitation to independent,
regulated financial advice, there is a much more general point about
the capacity of local authorities to implement the measures in this
Bill. The Bill leaves us, albeit with many amendments, with an
underlying concern about whether local authorities will have the
wherewithal to implement a raft of new responsibilities over the next
few
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000125">Secondly
when the noble Earl argued against similar amendments on Report, he
spoke of the concerns of local authorities that they might be held
liable if they referred a person who comes under the Act to a financial
adviser who subsequently gave poor financial advice. We have heard from
the noble Lord, Lord Best, that the LGA supports the general thrust of
my noble friend’s amendment. Can the noble Earl confirm, first,
that a regulated financial adviser will be subject to FCA requirements
and come under its disciplinary and regulatory codes? Secondly, can he
reassure local authorities that they can offer names of regulated
financial advisers in the way that I understand a 
<?notus-xml column=1467?>number of local authorities do at the moment without
fear of subsequent action being taken against them? I was puzzled by
the argument put forward on Report and it would be good to have this
cleared up at this
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:21:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000126"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13102966000662" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000662">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 3 brings us once again to the
important matter of financial advice. As we have covered this subject
at some length previously, and in the interests of time, I will
endeavour to keep my response reasonably short. At the same time, I do
not intend to make brevity a substitute for
substance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:21:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000127">My
discussions with the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, my noble friend Lord
Sharkey and the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and my
officials’ discussions with the financial services industry have
persuaded me that we are all seeking the same end point for financial
information and advice. I believe that any apparent distance between
the positions of the Government and noble Lords on this issue reflects
only the way that I have expressed our intentions thus far. We want to
ensure that when people take decisions about how to fund their care it
is done in a considered and informed way. We agree that the local
authority has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that this happens. I
want to set out what I see that role as being in the hope that noble
Lords will agree that we are indeed in
concordance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:22:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000128">We
believe that the local authority should take a proactive role. What
does that mean in practice? Under the new system we expect many more
people, a large number of them self-funders, to approach the local
authority to start their meter running. This provides an invaluable
opportunity for local authorities to reach out to these people and tell
them about the support that is out there to help them better plan,
prepare and provide for the costs of their care. It is particularly
important for self-funders that this includes the relevance and the
availability of regulated independent financial advice. To pick up the
word in the noble Lords’ amendment, this should be a
facilitative role for the local authority, providing a nudge in an
appropriate
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:23:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000129">In
trying to define what we mean by facilitation, I wholeheartedly agree
that handing out a leaflet or placing a page on a website is not
sufficient. Instead, local authorities should talk to people and use
the opportunity of contact with self-funders and others to give them
individually tailored advice that suits their personal circumstances.
They are likely to know something about a person’s financial

Lipsey:</Member></B> My Lords, I am afraid that I cannot be so succinct
this time. I might be acquitted of exaggeration if I say that the
House's discovery on Report of the Government's proposed £23,250
limit on the non-housing assets people could have to qualify for the
deferred payment scheme has caused something of a furore. I am not sure
that Norman Lamb, the care Minister—a Minister for whom I
genuinely have huge respect—will think that it was his finest
hour when he described people with £23,250 in non-housing assets
as quite wealthy. They may not be poor, but they are not likely
candidates for the Chipping Campden set
either.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000145">My
amendment would prevent the Government imposing such a limit. I have
moved it in this form because we want to have a free-ranging debate
this afternoon. I do not say that the matter will necessarily be
resolved in this House this afternoon, and I make it clear that I am
not an absolutist in this matter. The £23,250 figure is out for
consultation—and following the furore a lot of people out there
now know that it is out for consultation, which they did not know when
it appeared in paragraph 150 of the consultation document. If at the
end of that consultation, as I hope and expect, the Government decide
to set a much higher figure, I shall reckon that a result.</hs_para>

this scheme is intended to help. It is not aimed at poor people who own
their own homes, because they would not be sensible to avail themselves
of its provisions. If they kept their homes under the scheme, they
would have virtually no money in the bank and could not afford the
little things that make life in a care home tolerable: presents for the
grandchildren, a newspaper, sweets. At current interest rates, someone
with £23,250 would have no more than £700 a year in
income from that capital sum. They might have other bits of income but
they are not going to be living a life of luxury in a care home off an
income of £700 a year.</hs_para>

the Government have tried to argue that it will not exclude most
people. They claimed—or at least newspapers have reported that 
<?notus-xml column=1471?>they claimed—that 35,000 of the 55,000 homeowners who enter care
each year have assets of less than £23,250. These figures are
contestable, as all asset figures are. A very good analysis in the
<I>Sunday Telegraph</I><I> </I>showed that the average 75 year-old had
around £100,000 in other assets—a much higher figure than
the Government were putting forward. However, that is not the main
point I wish to make about the claim that most people have less than
£23,250. My point, which I have been raising throughout, is not
that the limit would exclude most people but that it would exclude most
of the people who would sensibly take advantage of the
Government’s proposal. That is why I have said, and maintain,
that a £23,250 cap would kill the scheme stone dead and that if
that figure remains unchanged, there will be practically no takers for
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102966000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000148">As I have
already said, it makes no sense for the poor to do it. If they went
down this line, they would be left with so little cash that they would
not be able to afford the luxuries of life. But let us be equally clear
that it would not make any sense for anybody at the top end of the
scale to do it—the Chipping Campdens with millions in the bank
who Norman Lamb rightly said would be excluded. If they go into a care
home they do not have to sell their home anyway—they can pay the
fees out of their investment income or by selling a few shares. They
could follow the famous advice that Nicholas Ridley, as Environment
Secretary, gave to people who were having difficulty paying the poll
tax, to sell a few pictures. A cap excluding them will do no harm since
they were not going to take advantage of the scheme anyway.</hs_para>

the question is, “What cap will ensure that these people
benefit?”. The answer is not—I repeat,
not—£23,250. When we look for another figure, there is a
logic that points us in the right direction. Why £23,250? It is
an odd little figure and not something which you would dream up
overnight. It happens to be the present upper limit for getting help
under the means test. If you have more than £23,250 in assets,
you get no help under the means test; if you have less, you get some
help.</hs_para>

quite curious, but I can only explain the facts—the
£23,250 cap is going to increase dramatically. Under the Dilnot
recommendations, as embraced by the Government, the upper limit will
increase to £118,000 in 2016, when the new cap on care costs
comes into force. Many more people will get help with their care costs,
and there will not be the current precipice whereby people who have a
small amount of money—although Norman Lamb describes 
<?notus-xml column=1472?>them as being quite rich—will be disqualified. Instead there will
be a much longer plateau stage, when people lose a little bit of money

the limit is to be £118,000, it seems that the logical thing
would be to say, “Let’s forget £23,250. If the new
means-test limit will be £118,000, let that £118,000 also
be the limit for the deferred payment scheme”. At a stroke, that
would deal with the problem of middle-income people who have worked
hard all their lives, while excluding the rich people who do not need
help. Job done. That may not happen in this House this afternoon, but I
am sure that it will be done when the Bill reaches another

is all quite new stuff, which was only discovered in the past couple of
weeks, and I want to make two points in conclusion. Some people worry
that if we do as I suggest the scheme would impose a high cost on the
state. They need not worry. Loans will be repaid in full with interest
when the old person dies, and the average time in a care home is about
two and a half years. So the Government’s cash flow will hardly
be adversely affected for long, and the scheme certainly will not be
loss-making<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000154">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:41:13"></hs_TimeCode>
second reason why the scheme will not cost much is that not very many
people would be well advised to take advantage of it. For most people
it would mean either leaving their former home empty—with the
roof rotting and the price that it will eventually fetch for their
family, out of which the debt will have to be repaid,
declining—or letting it out, which would not be easy for
somebody in a care home to manage. For some people—those, for
example, who have always had the dream of their children living in
their house—it will be a huge comfort to see that dream realised
when they go into a care home. I speak with some feeling, because my
own mother, who is in a care home, has been able to give her home to
her other son and that gives her, as well as him, huge
pleasure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:42:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000155">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:42:16"></hs_TimeCode>
scheme would prevent forced sales at bargain prices when the market is
particularly depressed. It would also give the old person, who might
initially have said, “Well, maybe I might return home one
day”, time to come to terms with the fact that that may not be
so. That can take a bit of time—and some people, miraculously,
can return home. The scheme would protect some people, but there will

some noble Lords have come up to me in the Lobby and said, “But
surely it’s right that old people should use some of the assets
they have accumulated in their lives to pay for their care”.

Lord O’Donnell, about the benefits that we

people. I empathise strongly with that school of thought. Indeed, it is
what has, entirely unexpectedly, led me to spend the past 15 years
trying to stop the feeble-minded proposal of the majority on the Royal
Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly that the state should pay
for free care for everybody, and then—with my noble friend Lord
Warner—tackling the Government and succeeding in stopping the
insane proposal of the Brown Government

profoundly that a deferred payment scheme will make that easier, for it
will remove an injustice from the present system and therefore pave the

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I am looking forward to the
response of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and hope that he can reassure
the House on this point. It is important that the House should be
reminded that the universal deferred payment scheme was discussed on
pages 65 and 66 of the Dilnot commission report, which set out an
analysis and evidence supporting its recommendations. It
explained why the current arrangements and deferred payment schemes
were not widely used, and why in the main report the commission
recommended extending the current system to a full universal offer
across the country.</hs_para>

its arguments, the commission accepted that local authorities should be
able to charge interest and recover their costs and that a scheme would
be cost-neutral to the state, although it might require an initial cash
injection. Dilnot also made it clear that the Government needed to
strengthen and standardise the deferred payment scheme in the light of
their decision on the level of the cap, means-testing and the
contribution to general living costs.</hs_para>

scheme was not intended to be generally available to the very wealthy
and asset-rich. As my noble friend Lord Lipsey has so convincingly
argued, though, being required to spend your assets down to
£23,250 seems far too restrictive to deliver a viable scheme.
Indeed, as it would be of no use whatever to people of middle income,
it is very difficult to see if anyone at all is going to use the
scheme. My question is: why have the Government been consulting on such
a figure? Does that actually mean that they do not want the scheme to
succeed? Do they recognise that it cannot possibly succeed if you have
to get down to such a low figure before the scheme can
apply?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102966000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102966000161">My only
reading of why the Government have consulted on this low figure is
because of Treasury concern about the initial cash injection. Is that
so? Will the Minister also acknowledge that there is a question about
whether in the long term—or indeed in the short term, because
the scheme will begin to pay for itself within a very short
time—his department thinks that there is going to be a
cost-neutral scheme? It will be interesting to hear from him about why
the Government seem so cautious and have been consulting on what seems
to be such a low figure.</hs_para>

the reasons that my noble friend has persuasively put forward, although
in the end the number of people who will use the scheme may be counted
in their thousands rather than their tens of thousands, there is no

I remind the House that a consultation on funding reform has been
running over the past three months, and it closed last Friday. During
these three months, officials have travelled across the country
explaining our proposals and seeking people’s views. What we
have put forward so far are proposals—something for people to
consider. These are not set in stone. We will listen to what we have
heard through our consultation, and indeed in this Chamber, as we
develop our policies over the next few

purpose of this amendment, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has
explained, is to ensure that anyone—even people with assets of
great monetary worth in addition to their main home—can have a
deferred payment agreement. I have to make it clear that if one takes
this amendment literally, I disagree with that principle. I do not
think the public purse should be helping people who do not need
financial support to pay their care fees. This would seem a long way
from the Dilnot commission’s view that deferred payments should
be used to support people who,</hs_para>

hope that we can therefore agree that the principle of having an upper
threshold for non-housing assets is a sound and a necessary one. If we
agree that this is a sound principle, all that is left to do is agree
on an amount. Our consultation sought views on that amount. The noble
Lord, Lord Lipsey, asked what was wrong with an asset threshold of
£118,000. From April 2016, we are extending means-tested support
for people with up to £118,000 when the value of a
person’s home is taken into account in the financial assessment.
This determines when an individual may be eligible for local authority
support with their care costs. Deferred payment agreements are designed
to help people to pay for their care costs; their ability to meet these
costs in the short term will be dependent on their liquid non-housing
assets rather than housing wealth. I can say to the noble Lord that we
are happy to consider using a threshold of £118,000 as we
analyse the consultation responses. We are happy to consider a range of
figures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000006">The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked why we proposed the £23,250
threshold. We were seeking to identify those people most at risk of
having to sell their  
<?notus-xml column=1475?>home to pay for their care. The reason we proposed £23,250
specifically is because it provides consistency with the threshold for
means-tested support when the value of someone’s home is not
taken into account, and with the principle that people with non-housing
assets under that amount are likely to need state support to pay for
their care costs. Indeed this is the same figure and the same reasoning
that the previous Government applied in their White Paper. Therefore,
from that point of view if no other, it is a little surprising to hear
the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, arguing against
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000007">There is
an interesting point about people with more than £23,250 in
savings. About 60% of people entering residential care are
state-supported, meaning that they have only limited assets. Of the
remaining 40% who enter residential care as a self-funder, less than
half have liquid savings of more than £23,250. This means that
the proposed threshold of £23,250 excludes only the richest 15%
of people entering residential care. By increasing the liquid savings
threshold to £118,000, the scheme would be available to all but
the richest 5% of people entering residential care. I hope that that is
a helpful contextual analysis. However, I reiterate—particularly
to the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey—that we are not wedded to the
figure of £23,250. We will analyse the responses to the
consultation before making any further
decision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000008">To

I sought advice from a range of experts, what I discovered was
extremely worrying. The Prison Reform Trust informed me that it could
not find any PSI or PSO related to adult safeguarding that specified
prison responsibilities. There does not appear to be explicit
identification of the role of prison in adult safeguarding outside the
general expectation to develop appropriate policies and procedures. The
Prison Reform Trust also reported that, although most health and social
services have an adult safeguarding policy, most prisons lack a
cohesive, whole-prison approach to identify vulnerable adults and lack
the training skills and local links with the safeguarding adults boards
to carry out effective safeguarding

Focusing on prisons, there are an increasing number of elderly
prisoners, as has been reported, and it is quite clear that the prison
medical authorities are not capable of looking after all their needs.

not know from the Ministry of Justice is exactly how many people are to
stay with the existing probation service, which has been given a lot of
responsibilities that do not include running probation hostels, which
is currently a probation responsibility. Nor have I seen any mention of

I have no desire to see the local authority relieving the prison or
probation trust of any duty of care. What I was saying—although
it is probably a play on words—was that the <I>No Secrets</I>
guidance 
<?notus-xml column=1481?>seems to suggest that a local authority is probably the only agency that
would investigate or inquire into a safeguarding issue. I am not saying
that probation trusts will not do so but the feeling is that that duty
falls on the local authority at the moment. My big anxiety
is that Clause 75(7) expressly states that Section 42 should not apply.
The Bill therefore actually states that local authorities should not
carry out a safeguarding inquiry for people in prison or approved
premises. The fact that it says in the Bill that they should not do it,
but at the same time we are giving guidance to say that if everybody
works together it should be okay, leads me to ask the Minister how we
square that circle. It gives an awkward flavour to the debate. I hope
that the noble Earl is willing to go back and have a look at both the
guidance and the clause, as I believe that that is where the problem
lies.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102970000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000040">As
regards safeguarding adults boards, I am very pleased that the noble
Earl has said that prisons and probation trusts should join the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this Government have worked to
cut crime and to reform the police, and our reforms are working. The
most recent report of the independent Crime Survey for England and
Wales was published earlier this month and shows that crime continues
to fall. In the year to the end of June 2013, overall crime fell by 7%
to the lowest level since the survey began in 1981. However, we cannot
be complacent. Last year there were still 2.2 million incidents of
anti-social behaviour, with 28% of adults having personally experienced
or witnessed such behaviour. As we know, often the most vulnerable
members of our communities are most affected by these
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000053">Across
the country the police, local authorities, social landlords and others
are working hard to stop anti-social behaviour using a combination of
informal and formal interventions. However, in
order to protect 
<?notus-xml column=1483?>victims and communities, they must have the right
tools available to them. It is clear that the many existing statutory
powers in this area are inadequate and ineffective. Anti-social
behaviour orders, in particular, have not worked overall. More than
half of them have been breached at least once and just over 40% have
been breached more than once. That is why the Government have brought
forward a new, streamlined, more flexible set of powers in this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000054">The
criminal behaviour order and the injunction to prevent nuisance and
annoyance will replace the anti-social behaviour order and a number of
other existing orders, and can be used to stop anti-social behaviour by
individuals. Importantly, it will also be possible for the
courts to attach “positive requirements” to help
perpetrators address the underlying causes of their actions. The
injunction is a wholly civil measure and is intended to be used to
address problems quickly, before they escalate. The criminal behaviour
order will be available for more serious cases where an individual
already has a criminal conviction, although it will also be preventive
in nature. Tough sanctions will be available to deal with breaches of
the injunction or the

the Bill contains important safeguards, including, in appropriate
cases, judicial oversight. Such powers are necessarily always a
balancing act between the rights of individuals who may be on the
receiving end of an injunction, notice or order and those of the wider
community who do not want their lives blighted by anti-social
behaviour. We believe that the Bill gets that balance
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000057">Part 6
will empower local people through two measures: the community remedy
and the community trigger. The remedy will ensure that victims have a
say in the out-of-court sanctions used for low-level anti-social
behaviour. The community trigger will empower victims to hold agencies
to account for their response. Where a victim is suffering from
persistent anti-social behaviour or feels that previous complaints have
been ignored, the community trigger will require local agencies to
conduct a joint review of the response. That is not to say that
agencies do not need to act until there have been several complaints or
until the trigger is used. We continue to expect that every complaint
should receive an appropriate response. However, it is important that
victims have this safety net for when things go wrong. I believe that,
taken together, these reforms will focus the response to anti-social
behaviour on the needs of victims and their communities, ensure that
professionals are able to protect the public quickly and effectively,
and tackle the underlying drivers of anti-social behaviour.</hs_para>

of irresponsible dog ownership. There are two broad elements to the
Bill’s provisions here. The first is primarily preventive. The
anti-social behaviour powers that I have described will allow
agencies—local authorities and the
police—to address 
<?notus-xml column=1484?>emerging problems. For example, when a dog causes a
nuisance because it has not been trained properly, the owner could be
required to keep it on a lead and attend training classes. The Bill
also makes amendments to the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to strengthen the
response where a dog presents a risk to public safety. This includes
extending to all places the Section 3 offence of owning or being in
charge of a dog that is dangerously out of control. Your Lordships will
all be aware of the recent tragic case in which attacks took place at
the owner’s home and therefore no prosecution could be sought
under the Dangerous Dogs Act. These provisions seek to address that
gap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000059">Noble
Lords will also be aware of the debate in the House of Commons on the
penalty for this offence. There was a broad consensus that the existing
two-year maximum penalty for the aggravated offence is inadequate. I
can now confirm that the Government will bring forward an amendment in

involving the death of a person, to five years where a person is
injured and to three years in any case involving the death or injury of
an assistance dog.</hs_para>

Part 8 strengthens the law in respect of illegal firearms to target the
middle men who supply weapons to street gangs and organised crime
groups. While gun crime is thankfully relatively rare in this country,
when it does occur it has a devastating effect on its victims, their
families and communities. The evidence suggests that a reasonably small
number of weapons are used in these crimes, with middle men hiring out
guns to criminals. The Bill will accordingly introduce a new offence of
possession of a prohibited firearm for sale or transfer. It will also
increase the maximum penalties for the illegal importation, exportation
and manufacture of firearms to life imprisonment.</hs_para>

offences. Part 9 of the Bill brings me to measures to protect children
and vulnerable adults from sexual harm. These provisions
respond to an independent report by Hugh Davies QC and to
amendments proposed in the House of Commons by Nicola Blackwood MP,
supported by 67 other Members of that House. They seek to address
serious weaknesses in the existing regime of civil preventive orders
under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Taking a similar approach to the
one we have taken to anti-social behaviour, Part 9 rationalises and
strengthens the powers available. Three existing orders will be
replaced by two new ones: the sexual harm prevention order and the
sexual risk order. They can be used where a person poses a risk, either
following conviction for a relevant offence in the case of the sexual
harm prevention order, or without a conviction for the sexual risk
order. Both orders may impose restrictions that a court considers
necessary for protecting the public from sexual harm. For example,
restrictions could be placed on foreign travel. The new orders will be
more flexible than the existing powers and will help professionals act
to prevent harm. Our aim in making these reforms is to give enhanced
protection to children and vulnerable adults, both in the UK and
abroad.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_29_PT_1/B8EFD60455E86386D2EBCF90D024B0CCB4D2B547" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 October 2013">Tuesday,

11 of the Bill includes measures that continue the important work of
police reform to build on the significant steps that the Government
have already taken in this area. First, it gives statutory powers to
the new College of Policing to prepare regulations, codes of practice
and guidance to support its role in developing the professionalism of
the police. Police leadership is extremely important to the future of
the police and we recognise the need to recruit the brightest and the
best to senior roles. In addition to the college’s work to
nurture talent within our police forces, it may sometimes mean
recruiting exceptional candidates from outside. Part 11 accordingly
enables police and crime commissioners to appoint as chief constables
officers with suitable experience in forces overseas.</hs_para>

these structural reforms to the way in which police forces and other
institutions operate, Part 11 also deals with the powers used by
front-line officers. In particular, it continues the work we started in
the Protection of Freedoms Act to ensure that counterterrorism powers
protect the public but do so in a fair and proportionate manner. The
port and border security powers in Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000
are a vital part of the United Kingdom’s security arrangements
and an essential tool in countering the threat from terrorism. The
provisions in Part 11 will reduce the potential for these powers to be
used in a way that is disproportionate or unnecessary, while
maintaining their operational effectiveness. These include reducing the
maximum period of detention from nine hours to six and
providing for persons detained at ports to have access to legal
advice. We will naturally consider very carefully any
observations and recommendations made by David Anderson QC, the 
<?notus-xml column=1486?>independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, in his report on the
examination of David Miranda, but I am sure noble Lords will agree that
we should wait for his report rather than take any precipitative
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000068">The
Government’s concern to ensure proportionality and fairness also
underpins Part 12, which reforms our extradition arrangements. The Home
Secretary, my right honourable friend Theresa May, announced in the
summer that she would introduce legislation to reform the operation of
the European arrest warrant in the UK and increase the protections
offered to those wanted for extradition, particularly British citizens.
Accordingly, the Bill addresses many long-standing concerns about
extradition. These include introducing a bar to extradition where a
judge considers it is not proportionate, measures to address the
problem of lengthy pre-trial detention and making it clear that dual
criminality must apply in all cases where part of the conduct occurred
in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000069">Finally,
Part 13 contains criminal justice provisions and I will speak briefly
about three of them. The first clarifies the test for determining
eligibility for compensation where someone has been the victim of a
miscarriage of justice. At present, the test is subject to definition
and redefinition in case law, which has led to a lack of clarity for
applicants and numerous legal challenges. The new test will provide
much-needed certainty in this area by putting on a statutory basis the
test that operated between 2008 and 2011. It is not our intention to
reduce the number of applicants who receive compensation—which
at present is around two to four a year—but we want to reduce
the number of complex, expensive and generally unsuccessful legal
challenges that currently
arise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000070">The
second relates to prosecutions for low-value shop theft. As I said
earlier, one of the policing reforms we are making is to
free up police time to focus on fighting crime. Extending police-led
prosecutions—and avoiding the unnecessary passing of cases
between the police and the CPS—is an important element of this
work. Provisions in this part would bring a further 50,000 cases of
shop theft into the scope of police-led prosecutions, empowering
front-line officers and bringing retailers swifter
justice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000071">Finally,
the Bill provides that the Lord Chancellor may set fees for certain
proceedings in the civil and family courts and tribunals, and for
services provided by the Office of the Public Guardian, at an enhanced
level above cost. Enhanced fees are a critical part of our plan to
ensure the courts are properly resourced so that access to justice is
maintained. In the context of the need to reduce spending and
to tackle the fiscal deficit, we believe it is fair that those who use
the courts, and can afford to pay, should make a greater contribution
to the overall costs of these courts. The Government are not proposing
specific fees now. We want to take some time to make sure our
proposals are set at the right level and aim to consult
on detailed proposals before the clause is considered in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0001.htm#13102970000072">I

justice is not denied. Fee remissions will continue to be available for
those who qualify and the clause has a number of safeguards built in.

Members on all sides of the House. The Government have to accept that
they cannot simply legislate to try to cut crime and anti-social
behaviour when they take other decisions that make it harder to tackle
these problems. There is great inconsistency in the Government bringing
in new legislation that they say will tackle crime and then taking
other actions that do the opposite. The issues of the numbers of police
and PCSOs and the huge 60% cuts to community safety budgets come to
mind. Although we have seen crime reduced, we are also seeing
convictions coming down and anti-social behaviour reports
increasing.</hs_para>

focus of the Bill is the issue of victims, which is hugely important.
As I thought about anti-social behaviour, which can have an enormous
impact, I also thought that identifying all victims is not always easy.
Perpetrators may be victims, too. Those who engage in conduct capable
of causing nuisance and annoyance may themselves be the victims of
health problems, learning difficulties or the failings of society. They
may become society’s victims because the response, through
measures such as these, is neither appropriate nor effective. They may
be victims in the traditional sense—for instance, beggars run by
criminal
groups.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102970000102">I
welcome the inclusion of positive requirements to help turn around
behaviour, which, of course, is resource-intensive. However, there
seems to be a blurring of lines between the civil and the criminal. We
have due process for a reason: to differentiate between the factually 
<?notus-xml column=1492?>guilty and the factually innocent, and thus between those who should and
should not be subject to sanction. However, here we are without the
criminal standard of proof that would be appropriate and strict
liability means that we risk using orders against those who do not
comprehend fully their actions or their impact. That, of course, is
once we get past whether we should address through these measures
conduct of as low a level as nuisance or annoyance, in the normal sense
of those words. The terms are very wide; you do not even have to travel

will mention two other aspects. In the criminal courts, the default
position is not to name and shame a child or young person for reasons
of rehabilitation and safeguarding. I would like to see the same
approach here. In my view, imprisonment as a sanction for
breach of a CBO, an IPNA or a dispersal order, particularly in the case
of a child, is not proportionate. Surely any action that justifies
detention will be an offence under other legislation. In 1997, the then
Government said that ASBOs would rarely be used against under-18s but

compensation for miscarriage of justice. Happily, far fewer people are
affected by that than by other parts of the Bill—which is an
argument in itself for not rolling back the law—but it is ironic
that the burden of proof is lowered at the start of the Bill and then
raised at the end when it deals with individuals who suffer a
miscarriage of justice at the hands of the state. They should not have

regulation of individuals employed by the Government to carry out that
extradition on their behalf. That, of course, leads me to worry about
the supervision or regulation of those supervisors who will be employed
in community rehabilitation companies by the Ministry of Justice to
replace the functions of the probation service. Time does not allow me

need for caution in restricting the freedoms of unconvicted people,
will make possible swifter and more effective action to protect

emphasis on communities—people working together for the common
good—has run through the long gestation period of these
proposals. The principles of restorative justice and restorative
practice, especially in local communities, are built into the efforts
of churches in every part of this country to serve their local
communities and especially those who are most vulnerable. In my part of
the world, 80% of young people typically reoffend in the first two
years after their sentence. However, with those who are taken on board
by church monitoring and mentoring groups, even with the more difficult
cases, the rate of reoffending is less than 20%.</hs_para>

local level that community remedies, community triggers and other

conditions, can be made effective and constructive rather than simply
becoming another layer of bureaucracy. On the same theme of practical
attention to local need, I am glad to support the proposal of a

Paper which began this process: to focus the response on the needs of
victims; to empower communities to get involved in tackling anti-social
behaviour; to ensure professionals are able to protect the public
quickly; and to focus on long-term solutions. These were and are sound
aims, and there is much in the early parts of this Bill which supports
them. I hope that we shall keep these four aims clearly in view as we
steer a course between tolerating bad behaviour on the one
hand, and on the other hand taking an overly punitive and controlling
approach to those whose behaviour can just be annoying. I am not here
thinking of street preachers or those who sing hymns very
loudly—though a balance has to be struck even in those

looked at the Bill primarily through the prism of the Human Rights Act,
but even if there were no such legislation, it would still be important
closely to examine the scope of the Bill where it concerns the tension
between civil liberties and the capacity of the police and other
agencies to exercise control over anti-social behaviour. Much has been
said already—and I expect will be said again—about the
need to protect children and vulnerable adults from the potentially
oppressive exercise of powers under this Bill, when their liberty can
depend upon what is inevitably a subjective interpretation of what
constitutes a nuisance and annoyance. This is a source of potential

it is important to focus on the reason behind the legislation: the
acute need to protect the victims of anti-social behaviour. It is in
reality the poor, the mentally ill, the aged and the most vulnerable in
society who are usually the victims of anti-social behaviour and whose
lives can be made intolerable by it. They look to the police and other
agencies to protect them. The Bill attempts to improve on existing
powers and to provide better protection for them. It was to meet this
need that the party opposite introduced ASBOs, and it was significant
that during debate in 
<?notus-xml column=1498?>the other place there was no suggestion from any members of any party
that powers of this sort were not needed. With respect, Members of the
other place, being in touch with their constituents, are in a good
position to help on these issues. In fact, the shadow Home Secretary

weak”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102970000134">Although
there are areas which will need careful examination, I broadly welcome
the Bill. Of those areas that cause concern, one is clearly the
expression “nuisance and annoyance”. It is considered by
many to be too low a threshold, even though it has a pedigree in the
housing context. I, along with many other noble Lords, have been
lobbied by the Christian alliance, naturists and other not very
homogenous groups who are concerned about the potential for their
lawful activities to offend someone and thus fall foul of the
legislation. The Minister will need to reassure your Lordships about
this. The amendment suggested by our committee was not to scrap the
clause, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, but that the
definition should be amended so as to refer to conduct that
“might reasonably be regarded” as being capable of
causing nuisance or annoyance to any person. This imports a degree of
objectivity into the definition and might, together with reassurances
given by the Minister in the other place, serve to allay some
anxieties.</hs_para>

the need for the power to evict those involved in riots. I do not doubt
for a moment that rioters such as we had in the summer of 2011 should
be dealt with firmly and swiftly—but that is precisely what
happened. Evicting them seems a step too far. The current sentencing

sufficient.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102970000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102970000136">I

stop-and-search provisions. It was the committee’s view that the
statutory power to stop, question and search travellers at ports and
airports was not inherently incompatible with Articles 5 or 8 of the
European convention. In our view, the Government had clearly made a
case for a without suspicion power to stop, question and search
travellers at ports and airports, given the current nature of the
threat from terrorism. The question is whether there is a
need for more intrusive powers being exercisable without
reasonable suspicion and whether these powers should be
exercisable only after an examiner or officer reasonably suspects that
the person has been involved in terrorism. The Minister will be well
aware of the evidence that the independent reviewer of terrorism
legislation, David Anderson QC, gave in this regard to

I am concerned about a wholesale challenge to the anti-terror

brought by a Mr Malik, who is apparently seeking to strike out these
provisions, which originally come from Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act
2000, and has obtained permission to go on to a full

Strasbourg court, notwithstanding the fact that the Home Office has
made it clear that Schedule 7 examinations have produced information

a clear case to retain those powers, albeit that their extent might be
questioned. Can the Minister reassure us that the Government propose to

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this Bill is not so much a
curate’s egg as a curate’s omelette, with some distinctly
unsavoury ingredients mixed in with some reasonable proposals. Before
addressing some of the substantive measures included in the
Bill’s 200 pages which have emerged, after scant debate, from
the House of Commons, it is necessary to complain yet again at the
cavalier way in which this Government go about churning out legislation
that deals with sensitive aspects of public and social policy even when
they impinge on important areas such as human rights and access to
justice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000003">Once

proposals in the Bill, I acknowledge the importance of the issue of
anti-social behaviour. It has been a problem in parts of the ward that
I have represented in Newcastle for the last 46 years and it
requires a co-ordinated approach from the courts, the police and the
local authority, by listening to and working with the community
affected. I am currently dealing with a case in which a young council
tenant has been subjected to constant harassment by a group of youths
not resident in the estate. I well recall how two streets in my ward
suffered so badly from the behaviour of a small number of families who
moved in after being evicted from their homes in an adjoining ward
that, in the end, the streets were demolished. These were at all times
private tenants. The Bill extends the procedure to enable such people
to be dealt with to other tenures, subject to an authorised procedure.
As we have heard, however, it worryingly adopts, in effect, the notion
of guilt by association in respect of those who have been participating
in riots—not just for the rioters but for their
families—so that the innocent householder and their family may
be evicted after such a person participates in a riot taking place
anywhere, not even in the immediate locality.</hs_para>

the Bill does little to ensure that the interests of
children—both the practical ones in terms of their
accommodation, and the legal ones in relation to their human rights and
the Convention on the Rights of the Child—are sufficiently taken
into account when sanctions are imposed on their family. Of course,
eviction in such cases may well lead not just to problems for the child
but, in the short or longer term, to increased pressure and cost on
hard-pressed children’s services. The same reservations arise,
as the Joint Committee stresses, in relation to new civil injunctions
on children as young as 10, the use of detention for breach of such an
injunction for children over 14 and the possible removal of reporting
restrictions in relation to children in injunction
proceedings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000007">Moreover,
the shift in the case of these new injunction proceedings, from the
need to show that an order is necessary and proportionate to what is
just and convenient, is deemed by the Joint Committee to be
incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, not least
because the injunction procedures apply to cases where the conduct
complained of is,</hs_para>

is the provision in relation to compensation for miscarriages of
justice, under which someone whose conviction has been overturned will,
as we have heard, now have to prove their innocence in order to secure
their compensation. This effectively reverses the burden of proof.
Indeed, it comes close to importing the Scottish “not
proven” verdict into English law. By chance, the other night on
the radio, I heard part of the serialisation of a dramatised version of
an apparently famous Scottish case in which one defendant secured such
a verdict—“not proven”—which she described
as meaning, “We know you did it but we can't actually find you
legally guilty on the evidence”. Effectively, that is now to be
applied to those seeking compensation for a miscarriage of justice. It
is

areas that we will wish to explore in Committee include extradition,
about which we have heard something tonight, and the notion that costs
in courts and tribunals should not merely be set to achieve full
recovery—itself a challenging concept, given what has happened
to legal aid and advice—but should also generate a surplus as a
contribution to reducing the deficit. This could, of course, be the
thin end of a very large wedge. If that principle is applied to the
courts and tribunals, why not to the National Health Service or to
education? Perhaps the Government already have that in mind. Does the
proposal also imply that the Government will further ratchet up the
fees for employment tribunals so recently and controversially
imposed?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000010">The

shall focus on just a few of the specific issues. There is no doubt
that if the dispersal powers proposed in Part 3 of the Bill are used
well, they can prevent tensions rising in an area, and can also prevent
other serious illegal activity. But although dispersal will give
short-term relief at a particular site, longer-term work will be needed
to avoid displacement to a nearby location. We must also recognise that
“intelligence-led” preventive dispersal orders on, say, a
housing estate may be unfair if those subjected to such an order are
resident on that
estate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000014">Very
significant powers are already available to the police for public order
offences, so care must be taken to see what value will be added by
creating these new powers. The most effective solutions to anti-social
behaviour tend to be community based rather than legislative, so the
focus of our attention should be on rebuilding coherent communities,
which would produce all kinds of social benefits besides reducing
anti-social behaviour. The proposed “community remedies”,
whatever their merits, are not a substitute for this.</hs_para>

5 of the Bill makes provision for the possession of secure tenancies on
anti-social behaviour grounds. In practice, this would usually apply to
social housing. But there could be real conflict about the definition
and threshold of anti-social behaviour. I believe that this is better
tackled by clear application of tenancy terms and by mediation between
tenants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000016">There
is also the question of alternative accommodation. The lack of
alternative accommodation and the capacity needs of many of the tenants
already severely limit local authorities’ capability to evict,

outside densely populated areas. What will be the consequences for

of the Bill covers the problem of dangerous dogs. I very much welcome
the fact that the new legislation will extend current police powers
into private premises, which means offences committed on private
property can now be dealt with. However, I am concerned that the Bill
does not address the problem of dogs being deliberately bred as
weapons, or for fighting, or to be used as “bait” in
fights, which is quite common. This is quite distinct from the problem
of irresponsible owners. The Bill is a missed opportunity to put things
right. Indeed, the proposed “trespasser” defence risks
encouraging the keeping of dogs as defence weapons at home, and
provides an unacceptable defence in court against charges of deliberate
ownership of such
dogs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000018">The
increased powers proposed for the Independent Police Complaints
Commission in Part 11 of the Bill, are broadly welcome, but we must
ensure that any reforms restore public confidence. The main reason for
the lack of public confidence is that the IPCC conducts relatively few

police forces’ professional standards departments and other
relevant areas to the IPCC is the wrong approach. There are already far
too many former police officers working for the IPCC. According to the

investigators have been former police officers or police staff, as have

Australia. I fear that it risks professional arrogance to insist on the

because it is important to demonstrate what the Bill is trying to
tackle. What does it feel like for victims? I can tell the House. In
2007, I lost my late husband through the mindless actions of a group of
alcohol-fuelled and drug-fuelled youths. Before that, though, I was an
activist in my community because of all the anti-social behaviour that
it was suffering and enduring every weekend. My first-hand experience
was that everyone was powerless, as anti-social behaviour was not even
considered important enough to be dealt with. The police and local
agencies did not do enough. All the while, victims of anti-social
behaviour were suffering, and I know both from meeting people and from
the letters that I still receive that many still are, many of them in
silence. I assure the House that anti-social behaviour is not a
low-level crime.</hs_para>

me, it was essential to get a place where these concerns could be
addressed and this behaviour could be brought to a stop. I remember
clearly that as I walked back from a community meeting one day with a
neighbour, I said, “Nothing will change until someone is
murdered”. Sadly, that someone was my late husband, Garry. That
is why I welcome the Bill, and I welcome 
<?notus-xml column=1505?>the powers that will make it far easier for victims to be heard and to
have a say through the community remedy; and for the police and crime
commissioners, local authorities, social landlords and other forces to
be able to deal immediately with the anti-social behaviour that blights
our country and its citizens—that is, the community that is the
majority.</hs_para>

know how devastating the impacts of anti-social behaviour and crime can
be, so it is imperative that communities and professionals have the
right powers to enable them to deal with such matters. I think that the
move from 19 powers to six goes some way towards addressing that. There
is a good range in these powers: the criminal behaviour order, the
public spaces protection order and the police dispersal powers, to name
but a few. These will allow various authorities the power to deal
expeditiously with a number of anti-social behaviour-related matters,
allowing victims a chance for their concerns to be heard and for some
respite. There is a need to publish some of these data so that the
community is aware of the hot spots and can hold their police and crime
commissioners to account; so that we all know how many requests there
were for the community trigger and how many met the criteria; and so
that if adjustments need to be made, in a world that changes and moves
so rapidly, the police and the authorities can move with it and victims
are not left powerless.</hs_para>

have said this before but I believe that it is worth reiterating: as
the first point of contact for most victims of anti-social behaviour,
it is important that police officers and local agencies have the skills
to support and protect them quickly and effectively. This includes
having access to powers that they are familiar with and find easy to
use. I am confident that the powers in the Bill will be used by the
police to good effect. I am pleased that the Government have prepared
and laid draft guidance to support front-line professionals in
understanding and guiding them in the use of the powers set out in the
Bill. I am sure that officials consulted with professionals before
preparing the document, but the fact that it is available in draft is
good indeed because it can be refined where necessary. I hope that the
Home Office is open to taking on board feedback from victims,
professionals and communities if need
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000033">However, I
am concerned about the community trigger and the expectations it could
raise. I fully support the idea of a review of responses to complaints
of anti-social behaviour, and the fact that any individual can call for
a review means that the anonymity of witnesses can be preserved. Even
one incident of anti-social behaviour is too many. Of course I
understand that police and local authority resources are limited, so
there must be a proportionate response, but as each area will have its
own threshold of incidents before a trigger could be activated I remain
of the view that this should be renamed so that it does not raise
expectations. I have previously suggested that this could be
“community review” or “community alert”,
which I hope that the Minister will
consider.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000034">I

provide the depth and breadth of services required to meet the

victims, and to work with their communities to address gaps in

low-level crimes to the police because they have little confidence that
they will receive a proper response. My own view on this is that all

introduction of the proposed changes in the Bill have to be seen in a
wider context, and that wider context is the explosion of out-of-court
settlements that we have seen over the past 10 years. At present,
nearly 50% of all recorded violent offenders receive a caution. I
acknowledge that Chris Grayling has made an announcement on this, and
indictable-only offences will not be able to be cautioned, and that is

take the point made in the Liberty briefing, but we have seen exactly
the opposite effect, particularly in our youth courts, where we have
seen a massive reduction in the number of youths who come to court.
Very often, when they come to court, they are up in front of the youth
court on very serious charges and have a long and established history
of pre-court interventions that have not worked. So there is another
side to the story of fast-tracking people into the criminal justice

shall speak briefly about three specific aspects of the Bill. The first
is Clause 86(5) and covers the point the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, made
about the recovery of possession of dwelling houses. I live in the
London Borough of Wandsworth. I contacted a local councillor, Tony
Belton, about what happened after the riots because Wandsworth was well
publicised for trying to evict council tenants where youths under 18
had taken part in the riots. What actually happened is that nobody got
evicted in that situation. The council, which is a Tory council, did
not pursue the evictions. The only people who were evicted were single
men who were sent to prison for long periods of time. So I ask the
Minister: what is the problem? That seems to me to be a reasonable
outcome. The council did not even pursue the evictions that were so
well
publicised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000050">The
second point I want to make is about theft from shops where the value
is less than £200. There are other pre-court interventions which
can be administered. First, there is a penalty notice for disorder
where you can be fined £80, and the next is a caution, which
requires an admission of guilt, but you do not have to go to court, so
it could be on the third or more offence of shoplifting that you get
into court. That seems to trivialise the offence. In addition, many
shoplifters have drug, alcohol and homelessness problems, and when they
come to court they can be picked up and suitable sentences
applied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000051">My
third and final point is a very specific point about the victim
surcharge for youth offenders. At the moment, magistrates and judges
are obliged to put in 
<?notus-xml column=1509?>place the victim surcharge. I have several times had
cases where a youth has assaulted their parent or guardian, and because
of this order, the court has been obliged to make the parent or
guardian pay the victim surcharge when they were the one who was
assaulted. It is absolutely ridiculous, but the court has no discretion

matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000052">On the

this Bill seeks to address, and I want to share some of that experience

that if everyone had a reasonable standard of living, a
“living” rather than a “minimum” wage and a

all that time, it was of great concern to me that anti-social behaviour

burden of proof. Senior police officers have to strike a difficult
balance between giving priority  
<?notus-xml column=1510?>to what some consider relatively minor offences that

there is no doubt that anti-social behaviour has very serious
consequences for communities and, as we have heard this evening,
individuals. What is more, when anti-social behaviour is allowed to
continue unchecked, it is sadly all too common that those involved go

a Liberal Democrat, I also believe that we need to be responsive to the

anti-social behaviour orders—ASBOs—helped to focus police
attention, the fact that they were originally granted on the balance of
probabilities but breaching them was a criminal offence undermined the
safeguard in our judicial system that no one can be held to be a
criminal, and perhaps even deprived of their liberty, unless their
guilt is proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The Bill goes some way to
addressing this concern through civil injunctions to prevent nuisance
and annoyance without an automatic power of arrest if they are
breached. Further, rather than simply imposing that injunction, the
Bill proposes that the subject should be helped to comply and in the
case of young people, that the local youth offending team is consulted.
Providing this kind of positive support can help steer people away from
negative behaviour and give them the direction they need to get on in

Dholakia:</Member></B> My Lords, let me congratulate my noble friend
Lord Paddick on his excellent contribution. He brings with him his vast
policing experience and it is right that we will have further
contributions from him on these subjects. We also must not forget his
experience as a mayoral candidate in London, which brought him into
contact with our very diverse communities. A word of polite warning to
my noble friend: his experience on the TV programme “I’m
a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!” no longer applies
because he will find that until the House of Lords is reformed he will
remain

objective in looking at any proposed legislation is to see what
priority is being given to crime prevention in its broadest sense and
to diverting young offenders from the criminal justice system. This may
sound a soft approach, but we pay little regard to the strictly limited
contribution that courts and prisons make in reducing crime. The end
product of judicial decision has little impact on the overall pattern
of crime. Prisons, to many, are a revolving door and an expensive way
to regulate behaviour. Public expectation of prisons to prepare inmates
for their eventual release is high, but the ability of prisons to
deliver that is fairly limited. Of course, prison confinement is
appropriate to those whose offending makes other alternatives
unacceptable, but it would solve many problems if we ensured that those
sentenced to prison stay there no longer than absolutely necessary.
That is my starting point in this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000065">I
welcome many of the measures in the Bill, including provisions to
improve the law and practice relating to anti-social behaviour, sexual
offending, forced marriages, dangerous dogs, policing, and extradition.
In common with a number of other noble Lords, I have reservations about
some aspects of the Bill, including those relating to victim support
and the eviction of families of those engaged in anti-social behaviour.
I hope the Government will be prepared to listen to arguments and
consider amendments on these points in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000066">I
am pleased to see that the Government propose to abolish the
discredited ASBO, which is a crude and thoroughly flawed measure. ASBOs
have a high breach rate overall and a particularly high breach rate for
young people. One of the central flaws of ASBOs is that their
provisions are purely negative. In other words, courts can include
provision in an ASBO requiring somebody to refrain from doing something
but cannot require somebody to take part in positive activities to
provide them with support and rehabilitation. It is true that courts
can provide support for a young person by making an individual support
order alongside an ASBO, but in practice they do this only in a small
fraction of cases. In the absence of support, it is hardly surprising
that young people in dysfunctional families with chaotic lifestyles so
often end up repeatedly breaching the
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000067">I
therefore welcome the abolition of the ASBO and various related orders,
and their replacement by the new injunction to prevent nuisance and
annoyance in 
<?notus-xml column=1512?>the criminal behaviour order. I welcome the fact
that the injunction will be a civil order and that breach will be
treated as a civil matter with a maximum penalty on breach of two
years’ imprisonment rather than a criminal conviction and five
years’ imprisonment, as is now the case. This was always a
draconian penalty for behaviour which was anti-social but did not
amount to a criminal offence. The fact that the new injunction is a
civil order will avoid unnecessarily criminalising young people for
breaching the order, which the current ASBO does.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102976000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000068">Although I consider the
orders a distinct improvement on the ASBO, I have some reservations
about the details—these can be considered in Committee. We
should reconsider whether the new injunction should be available for
conduct which merely causes nuisance or annoyance rather than the
stronger test of harassment, alarm, or distress which applies to the
ASBO. I would also like to see a stronger prohibition on the reporting
of names of children subject to this proceeding. The naming and shaming
of children is almost always counterproductive. It can seriously hinder
a child’s rehabilitation. In some cases people react by
regarding this notoriety as a badge of honour. Then they try to live up
to their reputation by increasingly extreme behaviour to look hard in
front of their friends. I would like to see the law include a strong
presumption against reporting children’s names in these
proceedings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000069">There
is one aspect of the new powers in relation to the anti-social
behaviour order which I am unable to support: the provision of the
mandatory eviction of whole families because one of the family has
breached an injunction to prevent nuisance or annoyance. Courts should
have the discretion to order possession when this is appropriate in all
circumstances, but the Bill gives the courts very little discretion.
This could lead to a large number of families rendered homeless and
destitute because one family member has been involved in offending or
anti-social behaviour. As homelessness increases the chances of
criminal behaviour, this is more likely to increase crime than reduce
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000070">There are
other issues that, again, we need to look at in Committee. For example,
there is the provision in the Bill to protect the victims of forced
marriage. By making breach of forced marriage protection orders a
criminal offence, the Bill will ensure that the police always have the
power to arrest those who breach the order. The new offence of inducing
someone to leave the United Kingdom and travel to another country to be
subject to a forced marriage is another valuable provision, but we all
know that changing legal powers is not enough by itself to tackle the
problem of forced marriage. Legal change needs to be accompanied by
much greater efforts to enable people at risk of forced marriages to
seek help in the knowledge that they will receive it. Much more also
needs to be done to educate teachers, health workers and other
professionals to recognise and act on the signs that someone is at risk
of forced marriage if the provisions of the Bill are to have maximum
effect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000071">The
Bill includes important provisions to strengthen the power of the
Independent Police Complaints Commission. I was delighted to listen to
the views expressed by my noble friend Lord Paddick, such as on the
extension of the IPCC’s jurisdiction to include 
<?notus-xml column=1513?>complaints against subcontractors. At a time when an increasing number
of police functions are outsourced to private contractors, this is an
important safeguard. Alongside the strengthening of the IPCC, I am
delighted to see that the Bill makes statutory provision for the
establishment of a College of Policing, which will help to promote
professionalism and standards across the police
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000072">The
Bill includes some important reforms to the powers of the police, and
immigration and customs officers to detain travellers at ports and
airports under the Terrorism Act in cases where there are no grounds
for reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in terrorism. I
particularly welcome the reduction of the maximum period of examination
in these cases from nine to six hours, the extension of the right to
inform other people and consult solicitors, the restriction of the
grounds on which strip-searching can take place, and the repeal of the
power to seek samples of blood and other body

would certainly like to see the Government go further and end the power
to detain people without any suspicion. I also favour further
safeguards for people detained in these circumstances, including the
video and audio recording of these examinations. However, the
provisions in the Bill are a valuable move in the right direction and
the Government obviously ought to be congratulated on taking this
important step.</hs_para>

of the Bill that we have failed to mention so far and on which I hope
the Government will be prepared to think again: the provision to
devolve funding for victim and witness support from central government
to police and crime commissioners. At present the Ministry of Justice
provides funding to a range of organisations which support victims and
witnesses. The central backbone of these services is provided by the
excellent organisation Victim Support. The existence of a properly
funded national organisation guarantees that high quality support from
well-trained volunteers is readily available to victims in all areas of
the country. The staff and volunteers are supported by an experienced
organisation with 35 years’ experience of providing high quality
services to support people who have suffered loss, injury, damage,
abuse and distress from crime. It is difficult to see the sense in
proposals to break up this high quality service and to leave the
provision of victim support provision to the varying decisions and
priorities of police and crime commissioners.</hs_para>

welcome the Bill, which includes many valuable reforms that will
improve the quality of justice in many areas of the law. I trust that
with a constructive attitude on all sides of the House and openness on

UK has a long and proud history of the presumption of innocence in
criminal matters unless guilt is proved beyond reasonable doubt. The
European Convention on Human Rights, which was drafted largely by
United Kingdom representatives, maintains this presumption in Article
6(2) of the Convention. It is one thing to be able to prove that there
is reasonable doubt as to the safety of a conviction, and even that
will normally take years, during which the person wrongly convicted
will serve a prison sentence. The CCRC process and the process of the
Court of Appeal do not involve a retrial. The person seeking to
overturn a conviction is often in a very lonely place—it is not
an easy process. The Minister has told us that Clause 151 is intended
by the Government to bring much needed clarity—as the noble
Lord, Lord Faulks, said, it does. However it is, in fact, a total
change in the law. Never previously has the victim of a miscarriage of
justice had to prove innocence beyond a reasonable
doubt.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102976000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000079">As I
have said, the business of disproving guilt is not easy. A court may,
as the Minister in the other place stated, determine that a
person’s conviction is overturned; for example, because DNA
evidence comes to light showing that they could not have committed the
offence. That may seem a very simple example, but it is not. In many
cases, both here and in Northern Ireland, there will be people
convicted long before DNA testing became available, where the
evidential material, which may well have contained exculpatory DNA
evidence, has been destroyed for a variety of reasons. Most commonly,
evidence such as clothing was destroyed because blood contamination was
regarded as constituting a health risk. That should not happen now, but
the cases in which there is a referral to the Court of Appeal by the
CCRC are not recent cases, and they are only the most serious ones.
People may also be convicted on what turns out to be false expert
evidence, as in the cases of parents whose children died suddenly and
who were wrongly convicted. If it transpires that the evidence is not
reliable, the conviction will be overturned. That will not prove the
innocence of the mother or father. There are many other reasons why a
person may be incapable of proving their innocence to the standard
required by this test. Obviously I cannot give examples of all of them
in the time allowed.</hs_para>

we legislate in the way suggested by the Government, we will create two
types of “not guilty”. There will be those who are
fortunate enough to be able to present evidence that proves
conclusively that they are innocent; they will be entitled to
compensation. Others, not so fortunate, will only be able to prove that
they should not have been convicted. Since they cannot prove their
innocence, while they may assert that they did not commit the offence
they will not be able to claim compensation, and it is inevitable that
some people will conclude that they are not innocent because they are
not innocent beyond all reasonable
doubt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000081">In a
number of cases people were convicted on evidence fabricated by police
officers. I think, for example, of a schoolboy in his late teens who
was convicted of murder on the basis of a confession and other evidence
secured as a result of wrongful behaviour by police officers. The boy
in question did not commit the murder, but could not prove that and
served over a decade in prison before being released. His conviction
was overturned, but that evidence, which should never have been
presented to the court, does not prove his innocence. It is something
completely different to ask the victim of a miscarriage of

victims would effectively have to reinvestigate their own case in order
to prove their innocence. In many cases they would not get the right of

been pointed out that had this clause been law at the time of the cases
of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven, the
Cardiff Three and Judith Ward, they would all have been highly unlikely
to meet the test. In criminal law people do not have to prove their
innocence; the prosecution has to prove their guilt beyond reasonable
doubt. When the state has held that a person was wrongly convicted,
years after the event, it is very likely that it will just not be
possible to marshal the necessary evidence to prove
innocence.</hs_para>

for the wrongful conviction and for the time served in prison. If a

build a life and contribute to society. Above all, they may have lost
contact with their family, or their relationships may have broken down
to the extent that they are not repairable—and all that because
they were wrongly convicted. Now the Government propose to remove the
right to compensation from anyone who cannot prove their innocence

2nd September 2011, my six-year old son was helping my wife bring in
the washing from the back garden of our home in Llandaff North,
Cardiff. Suddenly the fence came down and the dog from next door
bounded into my back garden. The dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback, bit my son
on both sides of his face, taking a chunk out of his right cheek and
hand. I’m told that these dogs were bred to hunt lions. I do
know that it took two men to restrain the dog. The dog has since been
destroyed. My son was rushed to the University Hospital of Wales, then
to Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery at Morriston for
emergency surgery. Miraculously he was not killed but he is scarred for
life and will have to undergo several operations on his face over the
next 10 years. It is over 22 years since the Dangerous Dogs

police forces seizing dogs suspected of being a particular breed

bite incidents continue to rise proving that the Westminster
Government's response in 1991 has not provided a solution. I do not
believe that in most cases it is the dog which is at fault. Whilst
genetics affect a dog’s temperament, its environment and
training are far more important. These issues are down to the owner and
the way the dog is, or is not, cared for. It is time for the law to be

Bill introduces community protection notices for general use in
containing anti-social behaviour, including irresponsible behaviour by
dog owners. All the experts agree that specific dog control notices are
the better tool to give to local authorities to enable them to take
steps to prevent dogs going out of control and to bring dogs back under
control. There are differences between a community protection notice
and a dog control notice. First, a community protection notice can be
issued only after multiple incidents have occurred in practice, after a
written notice has already 
<?notus-xml column=1517?>been given to the dog owner and after someone has
complained about the owner’s failure to prevent persistently
aggressive behaviour on the part of the dog. Secondly, the criteria for
issuing a CPN are broad. They focus on a threat to the quality of life
for whole communities and do not take into account one-off, isolated
attacks that threaten the quality of life of an
individual.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000091">A
dog control notice would in effect be an early warning system allowing
dog owners to address their dog’s behaviour before multiple
incidents occur and punishments are handed out. Intervening early may
also improve dog welfare because DCNs would ensure that dogs are
retrained and owners re-educated in conjunction with the advice of
local authorities. This makes a DCN more specific to an incident and
therefore much more effective. A DCN looks at the warning signs and
puts preventive measures in place. It takes action before an
out-of-control dog attacks and it promotes responsible ownership. Dog
control notices lay greater responsibility on the dog and its owner by
providing a fairer and more balanced law that prevents the need for
punitive measures, and it can save money. Enforcers do not need to
resort to costly court proceedings, notices and prosecutions, thereby
making better use of limited resources and time by nipping the problem
in the bud. Perhaps the Minister can comment on that in his
reply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000092">Clause

own garden? Would this clause deal with such cases—that of a dog
entering a private garden and attacking a person? The Minister said in

Hope of Craighead (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak briefly
on two issues. The first relates to Part 1 and in particular to the
threshold that Clause 1 sets regarding the power to grant an injunction
under it. The second issue relates to the test in Part 13 regarding
compensation for miscarriages of justice under Clause 151.
Of the two, the first issue is much the most important because Clause 1
will enable a court to grant an injunction against a person aged as
young as 10, and because of what the breach of such an injunction,
whatever the person’s age, may lead to.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1518?><hs_para UID="13102976000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000095">Of course there is a
real social problem about anti-social behaviour that must be addressed,
as the noble Baroness, Lady Newlove, in her moving speech reminded us.
However, one must surely be very careful to set an appropriate
threshold for what constitutes such behaviour within the meaning of the
statute. What is or is not appropriate will depend very much on the
context. The nature of any sanction and its consequences will be
crucial to that decision. What is proposed is the granting of an
injunction to stop the behaviour. An injunction is one of the most
powerful weapons in a court’s armoury, never to be granted
lightly because a breach of an injunction will be treated as a
contempt. Here Clause 86 tells us that a breach may lead to recovery of
possession of a dwelling house in which the child lives or which he
visits, which could have damaging effects on the family life of others
who are living there. Indeed, it may affect whole families, as the
noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, told us. Schedule 2 tells us that it may
lead to the person’s detention. These are very serious matters.
I have never, in all my 40 years of experience, heard of a court
granting an injunction against a child, let alone one as young as 10,
so to provide for this by statute is a very significant step, not to be
taken lightly. If a court is to be enabled to do what is envisaged by
this clause, three things surely are fundamental to the way that the
power may be exercised. First, the threshold must be set at an
appropriate level; secondly, the court must be satisfied that
the person fully understands what he is being told to do or not to do;
and thirdly, the language of the court’s order must be clear and
precise so as to leave no room for doubt on that matter in that
person’s
mind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000096">Let us
take first the threshold that appears in subsection (2).
Every word used here to describe what the person has been doing, or is
threatening to do, is important. We find the words “conduct
capable of causing”, “nuisance or annoyance” and
“to any person”. Contrast that phrase “nuisance or
annoyance” with “harassment, alarm or distress”.
Why is the threshold being reduced so much? Will the Minister explain
the problem that has led to the decision to do this? It is a very
significant reduction, let there be no doubt. I have searched the case
law over the past 50 years as much as I can, for some guidance as to
what a court would be likely to make of this formula. Most cases where
the issue has arisen are about noise: shouting, banging doors, loud
quarrels between people. However, it does not have to reach a very high
level to fall within the expression “nuisance or
annoyance”. Those two words, “nuisance” and
“annoyance”, are put together as if they are a reasonably
high threshold. However, the two words mean the same thing; putting the
two together does not add anything. That which is a nuisance will
annoy, and that which annoys will be a nuisance. Let us face the fact
that this clause is simply dealing with people who are thought to be a
nuisance.</hs_para>

no doubt, of judicial discretion. There is a case in the books, from
1958—Raymond v Cook—that illustrates the problem. It was
a case about an ice-cream man. His chimes disturbed the sleep of two
night workers who had to sleep during the day. They complained, and the
magistrate found the ice-cream man guilty of causing a nuisance. The
Court 
<?notus-xml column=1519?>of Appeal had a look at the case and refused to
interfere, as it said that this was a matter of fact for the
magistrates. It was not necessary to prove that the inhabitants
generally were annoyed. The defence led people from the neighbourhood
who said that they were not disturbed at all by the ice-cream van, but
that made no difference: those two night workers found it to be a
nuisance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000098">What

the words “to any person”? Even the best behaved children
are often noisy. Are children whose noise when playing wakes up people
who have to sleep during the daytime to be exposed this regime? I
cannot believe that the Minister really intends that. If that it is so,
surely that should be made clear. Even injecting
“serious” into the phrase would help to some extent, but
surely it would be far better to retain the ASBO formula unless
something is demonstrably wrong with it. Indeed, we find it used in
Clause 21(3) for criminal behaviour orders. At the very least, an
explanation will be needed in Committee as to exactly why the threshold
is being so drastically
reduced.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102976000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000099">It
is also disturbing to find nothing in Clause 18 about the making of
special rules for cases involving children under 15 or persons with
mental disabilities. Should the court not be required expressly to
explain the purpose and content of the injunction, to ensure that
children and other vulnerable people really do understand what the
order means and what its consequences will be if it is breached? The
rather loose wording of Clause 1(4), which uses the words “do
anything” in relation to what may be put into the order, is
another point of concern. These prohibitions and requirements ought to
be related precisely to the behaviour that has given rise to the
injunction. These points are just as valid, whatever the wording of the
threshold may be that must be
crossed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000100">I
turn very briefly to Clause 151, concerning miscarriages of justice. Of
course the number of cases likely to be affected will be very few, but
it is important that we get the wording of the clause right and, as the
noble Lord, Lord Faulks, said, this is quite a difficult issue. The
Supreme Court examined the issue in Adams. I must declare an interest,
as I was a party to that decision. We will of course discuss the issue
much more fully in Committee, but I will make two points now. The first
is that I do not claim any primacy for the majority view in that case
at this stage. I believe that it is right that Parliament should take a
fresh look at this issue and should do so with an open mind. It is also
right to seek to promote clarity and certainty in this difficult
area.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102976000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000101">The
second point, which follows very much what the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Loan, said a moment or two ago, is that it is at least
doubtful whether the test that this clause lays down will cover all
cases of miscarriage of justice where it is just that compensation
should be available. It is not difficult to envisage situations where
sheer proof of innocence, whatever the standard might be—it does
not really matter whether it is beyond reasonable doubt or just on the
balance of probabilities—will be simply unattainable. No doubt
there will be cases where DNA evidence will resolve the issue. However,
that evidence may have been lost 
<?notus-xml column=1520?>or disposed of, and not all crimes are open to proof
of guilt or innocence by that kind of evidence. It may, in the
end, simply come down to one person’s word against
another’s and, if you are dealing with the evidence of a wrongly
convicted person who was not believed by the jury which convicted him,
how can his word alone be enough to prove his
innocence?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102976000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102976000102">These

remarks on two points. The first concerns the contents of the Bill, the
second the process of the passage of the Bill. In regard to
the contents of the Bill, I will confine my remarks to Part
12, which concerns changes to our extradition laws. I immediately
declare an interest as a trustee of Fair Trials International, a
charity which, as its name implies, focuses on miscarriages of justice
and sees some of the practical results of the operation of the
Extradition Act—in particular, the operation of the European
arrest warrant, hereinafter referred to as the EAW.</hs_para>

that Ministers of all parties underline the value of the EAW by
referring to the most high-profile cases: terrorism, child
exploitation—the teacher running off to France with a
pupil—murder, major financial crime. To be sure, the EAW has
been extremely valuable in ensuring the swift return of alleged
offenders to face justice. However, the majority of the cases are,
unsurprisingly, of much lower profile and concern offences where the
circumstances are not always open and shut and, in some cases, are
downright dubious.</hs_para>

ourselves just how speedy the process under the EAW can be. A warrant
served in London will require a preliminary hearing within
48 hours, at which the individual will be defended by the
duty solicitor, who may or may not have a knowledge of extradition law.
Within 21 days, there must be a full hearing and, if the case is
proved, within 10 days thereafter surrender takes place. So the process
can be as short as 34 days. If this were to happen to a Member of your
Lordships’ House, we are all capable of finding the right button
to press to make sure that we are represented properly. However, I am
afraid that not all our fellow citizens are so fortunate. They can
therefore be removed speedily and find themselves in a country where
they do not speak the language, accused of a crime the full nature of
which is not entirely clear to them, operating under a legal system
that is entirely unfamiliar, defended by a lawyer who may or may not be
competent and with a prison and/or judicial system that may in certain
circumstances have features that would not be found acceptable in this
country. Therefore, I argue that we need to ensure that a proper level
of safeguards is built into this

my noble friend on the Front Bench reminded us all of the improvements

the Bill provides an opportunity to take this process further and to
make the operation of the EAW completely fair and balanced. Therefore,
I hope that the Government will look with some favour on amendments to
Clause 137 which will seek to address some residual concerns
about delays in cases coming to court, would remove some of the
ambiguities in drafting and ensure that, in considering whether a case
is trial-ready, judges take into account evidence external to the

In my view, like other aspects of the Bill, they go to the heart of the

its inception under the auspices of the Association of Chief Police
Officers in 1989, Secured by Design has achieved a great deal. Secured
by Design developments—those using the products and materials
that it has approved—are half as likely to be burgled and they
show a 25% reduction in criminal damage. This is at a modest cost. The
additional cost of using Secured by Design standards in the average
home is only £170. In one year alone, some 700,000 burglaries
could be thwarted if appropriate security devices were installed,
representing an annual saving of more than £1.97 billion.
Indeed, the Association of British Insurers has estimated that the
introduction of Secured by Design standards across the UK would bring
more than £3.2 billion-worth of savings to the economy over 20
years.</hs_para>

Office would wish to trumpet. Is it not strange then that this same
Government are now seeking to undermine this success story? The
Department for Communities and Local Government published—in the
depths of August, typically—a consultation document seeking
views on the results of the recent review of building regulations and
housing standards. The proposals it is putting forward on the security
of buildings suggest a two-tiered standard: a basic minimum level that
could be generally required and a so-called enhanced
standard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102986000008">The
basic standard is demonstrably inadequate and has been shown to have
little security benefit. Frankly, there is little point in specifying
stronger locks. They are not much of a deterrent if the door in which
they are located may be so flimsy that it can be kicked in with one
firm kick. Even the enhanced standard would be lower than the existing
Secured by Design standards, and they could be required by a local
authority only where what is described as a “compelling”
case existed for the higher standard to be applied in the case of an
individual development. To make this compelling case, a local authority
will have to demonstrate that the development will be subject to an
“elevated” risk of burglary and that there will be a
higher than normal impact of burglary on the tenants.</hs_para>

goes without saying that this is a test that is almost impossible to
pass in respect of a new development. What is more, the test has to be
applied site by site in a way which is likely to produce confusion and
added uncertainties for developers, who, when they submit a proposal,
will not know whether the authority will be able to apply the enhanced
standard. However, as has already been said, this enhanced standard
will not be as beneficial as the existing proven Secured by Design
guidelines. It will not be open to a local authority to require those
proven guidelines, and to apply even the enhanced standards it will
have to go through complicated processes to demonstrate the compelling
case required by the DCLG, with all the implicit threats of legal
action that that
entails.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102986000010">This
is the antithesis of localism. I may need to be corrected on this but I
believe that it is a policy of this Government that localism is a good
thing. But this is saying that local authorities shall not apply these
higher standards that have been drawn up and are proven to work. Surely
it should be for local people through their locally-elected councillors
to decide what level of security is appropriate for their own
neighbourhoods. Instead, those same local people are being forced to
accept a centrally driven dumbing- down of standards, which puts their
communities and individual householders at

all being put forward as a simplification of the planning process and
that somehow these Secured by Design standards, which on average cost
£170 per dwelling, have been the cause of stalled developments.
What world are DCLG Ministers and officials living in? Have any of them
had to live in an area blighted by excessive crime facilitated by poor
design and inadequate security standards? Local authorities should be
able to choose the level of security standards that they consider
appropriate for the communities that they represent. What is the
problem that Ministers think they are 
<?notus-xml column=1524?>going to solve by preventing that local democratic discretion? What is
more, we can only assume that no consideration has been given by the

my noble friend Lord Dholakia, I welcome the changes that have already
been made by the Government in this Bill to the extreme powers that
were formerly in Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act, but they do not go
far enough. The case referred to by my noble friend Lord
Faulks—of David Miranda, the partner of the <I>Guardian

hours while transiting Heathrow in August—is now the subject of
an inquiry by David Anderson QC. My right honourable friend the Deputy
Prime Minister has said that if Mr Anderson recommends further
restrictions on the Schedule 7 powers, the Government should use this
Bill for that purpose. We understand that his report may be delayed
because of ongoing legal proceedings. I would be grateful if my noble

Miranda is a person of interest to it. It flags up his passport so that
when he presents it to a scanner at a port of entry to the UK, he is

am afraid that he is not the only person to have been stopped under
Schedule 7 because his passport triggers a warning. A friend of mine, a
British citizen of Bahraini origin, has been stopped three times, once
at Heathrow and twice at St Pancras, within a 12-month period. I wrote
to the Security Minister, James Brokenshire, in August and he replied a
month later referring me to the police. I wrote to the
Metropolitan Police and had an acknowledgement a week later. The matter
was taken over by the IPCC on 1 October. On 15 October I met two police
officers for a discussion on the case. That discussion consisted almost
entirely of me giving them further background on the case, underlining
the fact that a black mark existed against my friend’s name on
the computer and that he wanted it
removed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102986000020">Knowing
how friendly we are with the Bahraini autocracy, and that the regime
had asked us to consider an extradition treaty with it to enable it to
harass Bahraini dissidents in the UK, I suspect that the use of
Schedule 7 against my friend and other Bahraini exiles in the UK is
politically motivated. This is a good illustration of the need to amend
the power so that it can be used only to detain a person when there are
reasonable grounds for suspecting his involvement in terrorism, as the
Liberal Democrat autumn conference recommended.</hs_para>

disproportionately large numbers of Muslims being stopped and

good community relations. I took up the case of a distinguished British
imam who was stopped at Heathrow Terminal 1 in December 2008, detained
and compelled to give a DNA sample and fingerprints. There was no
reason 
<?notus-xml column=1526?>why he should have been suspected of terrorism, but it took me 15 months

the privilege of being president of the Northern Ireland Association
for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders for many years. The
association, inter alia, provided services to prisoners’
families and children. It described the impact of sentences, especially
long ones, on the wives and children as “the silent
sentence”. That is why I support the coalition of NGOs in this
jurisdiction that wishes to amend this Bill to ensure that courts, the
probation service and social services have a duty to arrange proper
care and advice for the children and any vulnerable adults dependent on
a person remanded in custody or in prison. Acceptance of an amendment
on these lines will help to break the cycle of offending. We know
already that children of prisoners are twice as likely as others to
experience mental health problems. Some 65% of boys with a father in
prison will later themselves offend. Their employment prospects are
reduced and they are more likely to abuse alcohol or drugs. The impact
on the children of a woman prisoner who suddenly disappears from her
family may be even worse emotionally. We are therefore seeking both
crime prevention and health improvement. An amendment has already been
drafted and I urge Her Majesty’s Government to accept it or
perhaps to take it away and gold-plate
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102986000026">The second
point to which I draw your Lordships’ attention concerns
“annoying conduct” and its definition under Clause 1. The
phrase itself is subjective, because 
<?notus-xml column=1527?>what is annoying to one person will seem quite
ordinary to another. The new injunctions replacing ASBOs will have a
lower threshold, going wider than causing “harassment, alarm or
distress”, and a lower standard of proof. This has already been
criticised by the Home Affairs Select Committee and the Joint Committee
on Human Rights and even by the Association of Chief Police Officers.
The new powers should be examined to ensure they are grounded in
necessity and not just in convenience. The Government should turn their
mind to the standard of proof and to the apparent lack of a defence of
reasonableness.</hs_para>

this having previously argued that acceptable behaviour contracts

matter in this Bill was very welcome and indeed fairly bold. Perhaps
the Government have their finger on the pulse when they propose that to
be a chief of police you do not necessarily have to have been a police
constable in the UK. That is a very welcome proposition because many
professions over the years have been extremely restrictive in their
approach, particularly the legal profession. It took a great deal of
effort to get the law changed and to get the desirability of
competition accepted across the different parties in this country. It
is very useful that the opportunity is being taken to say that, from
time to time, it may be desirable for the police to do what the Bank of
England has done and choose a boss from another country, provided that
he or she fulfils the requirements designated by the police college. I
do not suppose there will be many new chief officers of police who have
not been a police constable on the beat because that is surely
a useful qualification. The difference is that it is only a
desirability to be taken into account and is not necessarily
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:17:26"></hs_TimeCode>. I was

the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan. She referred to
the provisions in the Bill dealing with miscarriages of justice. She
made it quite clear—as would everyone in the Chamber
make it clear—that it is part of the rule of law in this country
that no one can be found guilty of a criminal offence unless it is
proved beyond reasonable doubt. She made a good case for saying that
that proposition is brought into question if on an occasion when
someone seeks to establish a fact after being found guilty of an
offence—someone who seeks to establish a miscarriage of justice
by reference to new facts and new matters that he or she wishes to
bring before a court—there is a clash in the attitudes of the
different stages of the procedure. Yet here we have it.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:19:11"></hs_TimeCode> noble
Baroness, Lady O’Loan, made it quite clear that under
Clause 151 someone can establish a case for a miscarriage of
justice to claim compensation only if he or she can show beyond
reasonable doubt that he or she is innocent. The clash between that and

think that this is an unimportant part of the Bill but I was fascinated

not think the word “shoplifting” has ever previously been
found in a statute to describe what is involved in shop theft or market
stall theft. Nowadays the prosecution is of course conducted under the
Theft Act 1968; in my long and distant days it was the Larceny Act
1916. We got rid of the word “larceny”, which is good
because it is a technical phrase, and the word “theft” is
understood by everyone. To call theft “shoplifting”
rather lends credence to the idea that some people have that
shoplifting is somehow not as serious as real theft. I see no point in
Clause 152 and no sense in distinguishing between the theft of
£200-worth of goods and something less than £200-worth

welcome the initiative brought forward by the Government. Like many of
the organisations that deal with dogs, I would have liked a Bill
specifically focused on dogs and the issues around them. However, I can
understand why the Government have taken the course that they have. We
are looking at the amendment of 12 different pieces of
legislation, which causes problems for those people who try to
administer issues around dangerous dogs. It is complicated and involves
a number of different issues: the breed of the dog, the type of the
dog, the behaviour of the dog, the behaviour of the owner and the
circumstances of the incident.</hs_para>

I welcome this Bill because dogs, like archaeology—another issue
that I have raised over many years—always seem to be tagged on
to the end of other pieces of legislation. It is good to see that many
of the issues are being brought forward. I would very much like the
opportunity to discuss the guidance document on dogs with the Minister;
the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has been most helpful. I understand why
it is a complicated document, but it now runs to around 100 pages. That
gives the impression that we will have difficulty in understanding what
that guidance actually contains, and that is, perhaps, a recipe for
slight issues. I hope that a one-page précis can be given out to
those who try to enforce it, because a number of agencies will have to
administrate it—not just the police but dog wardens and other

want to raise a number of other issues in the very brief time allotted
for these speeches. Considering how many hours I have spent talking
about dogs, I think that six minutes is very parsimonious. I know that
the Dogs Trust is hoping for dog control notices, and that issue will
be discussed. There are also provisions on dogs attacking trespassers
on their own property. While I very much welcome and have pushed for
provisions on dog attacks on private property to solve some of the
problems that we have seen, we need to discuss the defence of owners,
which is an important aspect. We forget that there are 8.2 million dogs
in this country; most owners are extremely responsible and would be
horrified by the idea that they might be labelled as owners of
dangerous

legislation around dogs is that it is the owner who is responsible. The
important point is which end of the lead is actually responsible for
the behaviour of the dog. A key aspect of the legislation that the
Government are bringing forward is to make sure that owners understand
their responsibilities. On that basis, I welcome the severe tariffs
that are associated with owners who have used dogs as a weapon. There
have been several cases, and at least one conviction, where a dog has
been used as a 
<?notus-xml column=1530?>murder weapon. That is totally unacceptable. I
believe, therefore, that the tariff should reflect the seriousness and
the heinous nature of such a
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:27:32"></hs_TimeCode>. Many
people who own dogs for intimidation do so because it does not have the

of protected animals. Under the 2006 Act, protected animals are
specified. I am glad to see that frogs are not included because I have
a cockapoo who lost a fight recently with a frog—it is a long
and complicated story, so I will leave it, given the time of night.
However, there is an issue with dogs attacking other dogs. We know from
the figures that dogs that have been used to attack other dogs often
attack people. The Blue Cross is particularly concerned about making
owners aware that it is unacceptable to use their dogs to attack other
animals, such as cats. I think that that will cause some
controversy.</hs_para>

give the Minister prior notice that “protected animals”
includes farm livestock. This just shows the difficulty of introducing
legislation in this area. As a farmer, the Minister knows that there is
a severe financial penalty for sheep worrying. Indeed, the NFU gave the
figure of £1,500 in some recorded cases. Unfortunately, the
offence is handled under the 1956 Act, where the maximum penalty is
£10. I very much hope that we can revisit this to make sure that
owners are aware of the great burden that can fall on sheep farmers,
especially when the income of hill farmers is not at its highest. I
declare an interest as the owner of two hill farms, so I know that the
income from them is not
high.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_29_PT_1/F4DDFD2555EEB95930ADF2CDCF10389E0C76CD9C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 October 2013">Tuesday,

require the child to do anything described in the injunction. The court

regime, custody could be imposed for breach from the age of 12 and the
Bill raises that age to 14. I note that the maximum sentence of
detention for breach of an injunction is three months under the Bill,
compared to the current regime which provides for five years. Those

police and crime commissioners. This seems to me to be a very worrying
step—not as a reflection on police and crime commissioners as

particular concern is about the response to victims of rape and sexual
assault. When they responded to my report of 2010 on how rape
complainants are dealt with by public authorities, the Government made
a very positive statement about services for victims of rape. They said
that there must be a coherent approach that victims can rely on and
that society has a positive responsibility to help and protect victims,
aside from the operation of the criminal law. The Government have
achieved a great deal with funding for rape support centres, Rape
Crisis and other services. Once these services become subject to
locally, politically 
<?notus-xml column=1532?>driven decisions, rape victims will not get a

allowed to take account of previous offences for which people had
served a sentence. This astonishing idea actually got through. It did
not last very long. Of course, it was removed. Now we have had the
devastating dissection of the drafting defects of this Bill from the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope. We have a Bill that could be argued
as having at least 10 separate Bills contained in it. I am not very

pointed out by my noble friend Lord Hodgson, with the combination of
the guillotine and a standing committee which is appointed and cannot

deal about ASBOs in this debate. When I was in the other place I had an
inner-city constituency and I was brought face to face, very rudely,
with the realities. Quite a small number of people can certainly make a

makes me worried about our approach to such things in terms of
containing and managing, as distinct from solving and overcoming. If we
are to solve and overcome, we have always to ask why: we have always to
ask about the causes of the unacceptable behaviour that confronts us.
If we get that wrong, we are likely to aggravate the situation. We

are the causes? What lies behind it? This is not sentimental stuff;
this is hard thinking, if I may say so. Of course deprivation, broken
and dysfunctional families, domestic brutality and alcoholism are all
highly relevant to the situation. Of course we need a matrix approach
to tackling it. We need an education system that at all levels, in all
parts of society, emphasises social responsibility and citizenship as
much as achieving and success. We also need to introduce, in practical
ways, a matrix approach, which must engage community workers, social
workers, counsellors—and, indeed, local councillors—youth
workers and conciliation services. If we do not have that kind of
matrix approach, just trying to shove things back by managing the
situation with punitive measures will not lead to any kind of
worthwhile future at

course we as a society need to be clear about what is acceptable and
what is not; my own conviction is that the law should be clear on that.
However, in keeping with my own understanding of justice and its
importance to our ethos as a nation, these practical
measures—the steps that we have to take as envisaged in the
Bill—are there to underpin that ethos. I remember that when I
was Defence Minister, a very senior officer said to me once on a visit
to an establishment, “Of course the Queen’s regulations
are important, but the officer or NCO who walks around with a copy of
the Queen’s regulations under his arm is lost”. That

shall finish with four points that I personally shall be watching
carefully as the Bill proceeds. First, we talk about a responsible
society, but how can we claim responsibility when it is still the case
that when parents or carers go into prison, or into custody on remand,
there is not necessarily a proper inquiry about their
children—how many they have, who is looking after them and what
the plans for them are? How can that be responsible? It is likely to
lead to aggravation of the very issues that we claim to be concerned
about. We need to look at whether the Bill helps to strengthen our
behaviour in that respect.</hs_para>

I find myself in agreement with those who say that to talk about
“nuisance” or “annoyance” is very
subjective. One thinks of children playing tag or football in the
street or cycling around in it; one thinks of exuberance in the
community playground; one thinks of cooking aromas. To different
people, these will be very objectionable and anti-social. We must have
clearer language here about what we are really talking

we need to look at the consequences of mandatory evictions. If we are
just driving people into more insecurity and worse behaviour, and
driving children into more disorientation than they have already
encountered in their lives, how does that help? We must have
a social policy that goes alongside any use of evictions. I am not very
happy about evictions anyway, but we cannot just talk about mandatory
evictions in certain
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:53:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0002.htm#13102986000069">Fourthly,
whether directly or indirectly, if any behaviour or consequence of it
is likely to lead a person into the stigma of criminality, we really
cannot go on talking about the balance of probabilities; we have to

689 officers have been injured—something that, if it happened in

absolutely essential that the PSNI has the services of the NCA to help

hoped that there will be fewer ACPO chiefs and former chiefs and it
will give way to a more diverse membership. A good start was made with
its independent chair, but much more needs to be done if it is to shape
the future of the police service. It has a huge job to do with the
recent, awful policing revelations and I hope that it will commit to
developing a strong code of ethics for police officers, the vast
majority of whom give great service to this country and who are now
under severe scrutiny because of the abject failure of some of their
colleagues. The Home Secretary trialled the idea of a code of ethics
back in March when she was speaking about police corruption, and I am
advised by ACPO that it is now out for public consultation. Will the

Independent Police Complaints Commission, the IPCC, will need really
excellent resources if it is to undertake the enormous amount of extra

the tragic case of Fiona Pilkington and her daughter, who committed

her contacting them 33 times over a number of years. It will need
excellent officers to get beneath the horror story that is Hillsborough
and other dreadful events. Dame Anne Owers is the very best person to
chair it, and I wish her well. As we have already heard, we need a
truly independent complaints procedure, something I have been calling

issue facing the IPCC is the importance of business licensing for
people engaged with the private security industry. When these people
work alongside the police, they need to be properly regulated so that
inappropriate people—should I say cowboys?—are driven

taken if it is felt that people working alongside the police are not
properly licensed? It is a shame that the Security Industry Authority

is in a pretty awful place at the moment. In my 35 years of taking an
interest in these matters, I have never known morale to be so low.
Police officers are generally fond of having a good moan, but at the
moment that is becoming a cry of despair. They simply do not think
anyone is listening to them, and the massive changes they are
undergoing are destabilising them. Modernisation is absolutely
necessary. They know that and are prepared to countenance a large part
of what is proposed, but at the moment they also need to be
acknowledged for the good work they do, and they feel as if they are
being particularly targeted and used as scapegoats. So the Bill, while
welcome in many ways, must take account of those parts which relate

Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, I
propose to focus on just one clause in this lengthy Bill. I refer to
Clause 151, in Part 13, concerning compensation for miscarriages of
justice. Let me make plain at the outset that far from opposing this
provision, as a great majority of those who have spoken about it today
appear to do, I support it although, as I shall shortly explain, I
could accept a slight modification to it, a modest dilution of its
effect. Instead of the person seeking compensation having to prove his
innocence beyond reasonable doubt—that is the criminal standard
of proof for guilt to be established—it may be thought
preferable that he need establish innocence only on the balance of
probabilities. But I believe that establish his innocence he must, not
of course, to have his conviction set aside and to go free, but to
secure monetary compensation.</hs_para>

support the proposal and believe that, contrary to the suggestion of
the Joint Committee on Human Rights that this offends against the human
rights convention, it is entirely compatible with the presumption of
innocence. I should perhaps say at this stage that in the Supreme Court
case of Adams, which was decided two or three years ago and has already
been mentioned more than once today, I was in the minority of four to
five—we sat as a court of nine justices. Clause 151 appears
designed, essentially, to give effect to our minority view. I am not
concerned here simply to refight old battles, but rather to support a
provision which to my mind would not only restore clarity and
simplicity in this area but reduce the number of occasions when large
sums of money—sometimes they are very large indeed, up to
£1 million—would otherwise fall to be paid out to those
who, albeit that their criminal convictions have been overturned as
unsafe, are nevertheless highly likely in fact to have committed the
offences for which they are now seeking
compensation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#13102986000081">My
concern thus appears to go rather wider than what the Minister, in
opening this debate, suggested is the Government’s concern to
clarify the law and reduce the number of misconceived claims and the
expense of contesting them. I readily acknowledge that there can be few
ordeals in life more awful than being wrongfully convicted and
imprisoned, sometimes for years, for a crime which one has not
committed. At first blush, one’s instinct is to say that anyone
in that position ought without more ado to be entitled to compensation
for his ordeal and that that should be so in all cases in which the
initial conviction is overturned. That is, however, very far from the
position, and I think that nobody is suggesting that that should be the
position. Certainly it is not necessary, as the underlying section
here, the compensation section in the Criminal Justice Act 1988 seeks
to do, to give effect to our international obligations under the
International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T21:05:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#13102986000082">On
the contrary, it must be recognised that the whole compensation scheme
applies only to a narrow and exceptional group of cases in which
convictions are quashed. There is no right to compensation unless the
appeal was brought out of time. Sometimes that is a matter of
chance—for example, if a lawyer has missed the time limit. No
right to compensation arises unless the appeal succeeds on the ground
of a new or newly discovered fact, for the previous nondisclosure of
which the appellant is in no way responsible. No right to compensation
exists unless the new fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has
been a miscarriage of justice. As the international covenant provides,
the claimant has to show conclusively that there has been a miscarriage

one suggests that all those whose convictions are overturned on a late
appeal because of new facts have by definition suffered a miscarriage

Notes to this Bill, what this new clause does is to restore the
position generally thought to have been established some while back
whereby the claimant had to show that he was clearly innocent.
Classically that would be the case where, for example, new DNA
techniques showed that he could not have been guilty or where,

problem with the test, even as reformulated, is that all too easily it
can require compensation to be paid to those in fact guilty of the
offence. I will illustrate this by reference to a case called Maxwell
which we had in the Supreme Court in a rather different context. Two
brothers had been jointly convicted of two robberies and a murder. They
had been targeting a number of elderly, vulnerable victims. The
conviction was largely based on the evidence of a supergrass although
it was generally supported by a jigsaw of other evidence. Some 12 years
later their convictions, everybody agreed, had to be set aside because
it became apparent that the police, behaving disgracefully, had secured
the supergrass’s continuing co-operation in the prosecution by
conferring on him a whole raft of benefits, including taking him to a
local
brothel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T21:09:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#13102986000086">As
it happened, one of the brothers had, in the years after his

guilty, probably in the hope that his case for parole would be
improved. On the basis of those confessions, in his particular case a
retrial was ordered at which he eventually pleaded guilty, but no such
order for retrial could be made in the case of the brother who had
remained silent, and he simply went free. However, under the test laid
down by the majority in Adams, and since reformulated, I can see no

approach, the lesser test also would offend the convention. The

approach that would be compatible with the presumption of innocence on
that approach would be to compensate everybody whose convictions are

Kennedy of The Shaws (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Bill sailed
through the other place without much fuss, but I am glad to see that
there has been a bit of fuss here with regard to some of the changes
advocated. I, too, welcome the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, to this House

have always had very deep reservations about the ASBO because there are
plenty of laws and by-laws that deal with real anti-social behaviour:
criminal damage charges, breach of the peace, vandalism, drunk and
disorderly, insulting words and behaviour—there are lists of
crimes that can deal with the sort of behaviour we are talking about. I
have always felt that it was a measure introduced to compensate for
inadequate policing, and that good community policing should deal with
anti-social behaviour under existing law. However, politicians always
want to reach for new ways of restricting liberty. There was a
particular temptation, encouraged by the police, that the lowering of
the standards of proof would be a good way forward. We created a hybrid
in law, a legal development that should have caused us much greater
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#13102986000092">However,
I have real unease about its replacement. Some aspects of it may seem
to be an improvement but there is a real problem when you have
something that is so ill-defined. At least with the ASBO as created by
Labour the law required you to have caused or been likely to cause
harassment, alarm or distress, whereas this new law says that you just
need to be capable of causing nuisance or annoyance. This House is full
of people capable of causing nuisance or annoyance, and long may it be
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#13102986000093">I am
therefore very concerned about this new invention, and I am not sure
that it is a very real improvement. What is even worse is that the test
will be that the police think that the injunction is just and
convenient, and that it will be on the balance of probabilities whether
a person might be a nuisance or not. The conception of the provision is
flawed and I hope that we will test it hard in this House.</hs_para>

the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, who gave some credence to the
idea in Clause 151, which I think is totally disreputable and contrary
to the high standards that we should be proud of in our common law. The
noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, described it well. Quietly and in
measured 
<?notus-xml column=1541?>tones she made a powerful speech about the real problems with this
clause. I acted in the Guildford Four appeal. I had colleagues who
acted in the case of the Birmingham Six. I chaired an inquiry into the
sudden infant death cases involving young mothers convicted of killing
their babies and who were ultimately acquitted after it was clear that
there had been miscarriages of justice. I acted for a woman who was
convicted and spent 11 years in prison for causing the death by arson
of two people, and it became clear that she was totally innocent. There
was something I always remember about acting in those cases. After the
Irish miscarriages of justice—those mentioned by the noble
Baroness, Lady O’Loan: the Maguires, the Birmingham Six and so
on—the senior judiciary ran around the Inns of Court insisting
that the defendants were probably all really guilty, despite the fact
that they had had the hell beaten out of them by the police. Lord
Denning disgraced himself by suggesting that it was a vista that was
too terrible to imagine that the arm of the state might have behaved in
such bad ways. Members of the judiciary found it very hard because they
had been in their own way at fault due to the ways in which they had
allowed those miscarriages of justice to take place.</hs_para>

are something terrible in our system. Happily they happen rarely but
when they do they are a source of shame. When people seek compensation
it does not matter whether we think that they may in fact be guilty.
The point of compensation is to remind the state of its responsibility
to hold those who act for it to the highest standards. That is the
purpose of taking compensation out of the state’s
coffers—to make sure that we do not let it happen too easily.
That is why we, constitutionally here in this House, have to maintain
very high standards when it comes to the whole issue of criminal
justice. I therefore remind the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown,
that there are good reasons in place for saying that when someone is
acquitted ultimately after it has been shown there has been a
miscarriage of justice, particularly because of police bad behaviour,
it is right that that person should be compensated because the state
has to hang its head in shame. That is the purpose of
compensation.</hs_para>

of the Terrorism Act, which is also dealt with in the Bill. It
introduces a number of other factors. Many of the changes are designed
to rein in the powers available to police officers and other
authorities. That is a good thing. However, what remains is the
exceptionally broad discretion that allows for individuals to be
stopped for no good reason. That should be a cause of concern to us as
civil libertarians. In our legal system the norm is that the police
should stop and search people only when there is a reasonable suspicion
that they have committed a crime or might be about to do so. Under this
proposed law, people can be stopped whether or not any grounds exist
for suspecting that they may have been involved in terrorist activity.
There does not even need to be a suspicion. It is almost as though
everyone becomes a suspect and so you are stopped in order to rule
yourself out. It is rather like that business of having to show that
you are really innocent. I ask the Minister why this extraordinary
power is deemed 
<?notus-xml column=1542?>justifiable. Of course we are seeking to deal with
terrorism, and that is an important and challenging problem for our
society, but maintaining high standards in the law is one of the best
ways of countering the insult and assault made by terrorism. This is a

is a large and wide-ranging Bill that, like the curate’s egg, is
good in parts but also raises considerable grounds for concern. I
intend to confine my few remarks to the anti-social and criminal
behaviour orders, in particular as they relate to young people and
children. I had a quick look at the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill of 2003
and found that the same issues persisted and concerned us then as now.
Indeed, I was momentarily tempted just to lift my speech from that
occasion as it would have fitted now. If we really are going to make
the right changes to improve the situation, we must look at what is
relevant and proportionate to the needs of both victims and
offenders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#13102986000103">There
are elements in the Bill that are interesting and to be welcomed. The
notion of the community remedy, where each local policing body will be
required 
<?notus-xml column=1543?>to draw up a document with a list of appropriate
actions that might, in its opinion, assist in a person’s
rehabilitation and make reparation as well as punish, is interesting.
Its aim will be to promote public confidence and it will be carried out
in consultation with appropriate community representatives and others,
which is an excellent way of bringing communities together in
addressing essentially local problems in a restorative and reparative
way. This is a proposal to be
applauded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#13102986000104">The
plan to simplify the current range of orders also must be a good thing,
particularly the use of positive requirements to make them more
effective, which is always more likely to be the case than with
negative ones. There are currently no less than 19 powers to
deal with anti-social behaviour, of which the ASBO is but one. These
are being rationalised to six, of which the injunction to prevent
nuisance and annoyance, the IPNA, and the criminal behaviour order are
the ones most prominently under
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#13102986000105">The
roots of anti-social behaviour inevitably are established in early
life. You just do not have happy, thriving, well adjusted, achieving
young people from supportive families persistently out on the streets
at night, causing havoc through anti-social behaviour. Instead, these
are likely to be people with a complex range of significant needs.
Theirs is behaviour which can be deeply unpleasant, often very
unnerving, frightening and dangerous for those in whose communities it
is prevalent. It is a real scourge. It also reflects social and
emotional alienation, where they neither give nor get any respect, and
they require an integrated response not only from the police but from a
range of agencies, services and communities working together. This is
in part, as I understand it, what the community remedy seems to be
suggesting and it offers a very constructive way forward, particularly
in its restorative implications, which I
welcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102986000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#13102986000106">However,
the crux of the Bill revolves around the new definition of anti-social

realised. These young people need all the guidance they can get, but
the widening of the definition through an IPNA inevitably opens the
door to still more children being scooped up and caught up in what
could, potentially, become criminal activity created by these new
designations. Difficult, vulnerable children and their families need
help, but a route via injunctions and the subsequent criminalising of
children is only damaging. However keen the authorities are to take
positive remedial action through a range of possible positive or
negative requirements, which are not clearly specified, inevitably more
children will be drawn into the world of injunctions, courts and
possible breach. Seven out of 10 children currently breach their

<?notus-xml column=1545?>behaviour that blights lives and, in terms of my profession, affects
property values and utility. It distresses people and persecutes them.
More particularly, from the point of view of public resource, it causes
disproportionate costs to social landlords, the police and others, and
is a burden on the public purse. We have to deal with it, but the
question is whether the means are proportionate. Bypassing the legal
safeguards, as appears to be apparent in Part 1 of the Bill, is rarely
the appropriate way forward. That has been mentioned by many other
noble Lords.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000004">As
I say, I come to this from a property angle. I am often involved in
neighbour disputes. One thing to realise is that it has nothing to do
with the property; it has to do with lifestyle, dogs, noisy children,
music, and maybe with race or colour, and things like that. These are
the things that feed into some of the loose legislation that we already
have, and in that context I think of the Protection from Harassment
Act. I was recently sent some correspondence highlighting just how
variable the approach to enforcing that Act is. Indeed, the test for
what constitutes harassment is so loose and undemanding of proof that
it almost seems to be a fibbers’ charter. That probably explains
why it is so often the case that with the benefit of hindsight the
person claiming to be harassed turns out to be the primary
perpetrator. I cannot tell noble Lords the number of occasions when I
have felt that that was the situation, so definitions are
vital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000005">In this
Bill we risk falling into the same trap. I acknowledge the huge
problems caused by anti-social activity but we have to have plausible,
possible and legally proper procedures. I am not a lawyer so all my
information on this is totally second hand. The Bill has the potential
to make a difficult situation worse. It has the novel invention of
making what used to be, or certainly as I understood it, the last
resort equitable civil remedy of an injunction the first resort
coercive measure or tool of behavioural compliance, if you please.
Forgetting for one moment the legal test for something that is also
tied in with criminal sanctions ultimately and with criminal
activities, under this Bill one has to consider the lower civil
standard of legal proof. Putting to one side the legal practicality,
precedent and social propriety of attaching an injunction to a minor,
Part 1 of this Bill promises to do something that it cannot in practice
achieve. I would have much preferred to see some alteration to the ASBO
regime. If ASBOs are considered to be substantially inoperative, why
should anyone imagine that what we have here will cut any more mustard
with the typical offender? That escapes
me.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000006">Under this

flimsiest evidence you could possibly come across. It will generate
numerous appeals and be a burden on public expenditure.</hs_para>

recommend a solution: introduce proper triggers, tests and defences

Clause 32(2) seems equally lacking in substance on its trigger
provision. The bottom line is that an officer needs only to be
satisfied on reasonable grounds that there is likelihood of someone
being alarmed or distressed. No wonder all sorts of fair-minded and
sober types such as the Open Spaces Society and, dare I say it, the
naturists, have been on to me, concerned that it might be used against
them. In fact, it could be used against a wide variety of people
engaged in quite straightforward activities. Part 4 is no better. It
rests on a concept of undefined detrimental effect. The process seems
to be based on strict liability and the authority implementing it seems
to have complete non-recourse powers.</hs_para>

briefly. This is nearly my final point. In March I raised matters to do
with crime figures, policing and the concept of police accountability.
That is the pivotal point. It seems to be the nub of what has happened
since, what has been through the press and what we have heard about
evidence before the Home Affairs Select Committee and so on. That
cannot go unuttered in the context of this Bill. Accountability rests
on several key principles. First, there will be a completely
independent referral body over which there is no police influence. The
noble Baroness, Lady Doocey, mentioned aspects of that. Secondly, there
will be a power to recommend and insist on adoption of recommendations.
Thirdly, when there has been a failure, even without criminality or
malfeasance—which are actionable anyway—there will be
consequences and sanctions so that the public have confidence in what
is being done in their name. At the moment, none of the checks and
balances we have match that template.</hs_para>

question. Two weekends ago, one of the Sunday papers put forward the
suggestion that many civil actions taken against the police for poor
performance or injustice of one sort or another have been settled out
of court with the details never divulged. Of course this cuts both
ways: is it people taking a free-bet pop at the police or are the
police at fault? We do not really know. I am sure some of them must be
worked on a no-win, no-fee legal principle. Can the Minister inform the
House, or perhaps write to me, of what the numbers are by category in
the period since May 2010, and whether he has any view, or can obtain
any figures, on what the cost is to the public purse? As I say, the
police should not be subject 
<?notus-xml column=1547?>to free pot-shots, but also the citizenry need to know where they stand.

long the music was blaring, which other people witnessed the dog
defecating for the umpteenth time on your front doorstep, and who else
can confirm that the cannabis smoke that was wafting into your
children’s bedroom was indeed cannabis. However, sometimes the
threshold of tolerance apparently just grows so that none of the above

communities, so criminalisation could assist individuals in those
communities to defy the leaders or families and assert their own
wishes—in fact, their own human rights. Sadly, however, this
legislation recognises an anomaly in Clause 108(3). For the purpose of
the criminal offence of forced marriage, it does not matter whether the
marriage is a religious ceremony that is not a legally recognised
marriage under UK law. As I understand the legislation, someone can be
forced into a marriage, which would be a criminal offence, and the
spouse who forced them into the marriage would be imprisoned. However,
if it was merely a religious ceremony, then the woman—it is
usually the woman—has none of the protection of the division of
family assets available in our divorce courts. Will she suddenly be
entitled to be given the family assets under the Proceeds of

Brenda’s first night in custody she was not even aware of her
child's whereabouts. Her support worker had to contact four different
local authorities before eventually discovering that her daughter had
been hospitalised. That is a horrific situation for any parent to be
in, compounded

the very clear moral case, there is also a strong economic argument for

is left without care and their health deteriorates as a result, the
cost invariably falls upon the public purse. Yet many such situations
could realistically be averted by requiring courts to make a
straightforward inquiry about dependants and an appropriate referral if
necessary. Early intervention is always best for those concerned and
invariably the most cost-efficient measure. It would not require any

of issues which I am sure will be covered in full elsewhere. I intend
to focus my comments on the Bill’s provisions on forced
marriage. Forced marriages in the UK came to light in the past 15 to 20
years. The full scale of the problem is still not known, as only cases
of challenged forced marriages become public knowledge. However, forced
marriages must not be confused with arranged marriages, which are quite
common in some of the minority communities of the United Kingdom and
have a very high success rate. I must declare an interest as someone

the lives of many young people—most of the victims are known to

these communities. We need to look carefully at whether, by declaring
those involved in forcing others into a marriage against their will to
be criminals, we are going to help resolve the issue or are going to
push it more under the carpet. I welcome the fact that the Government
are taking this issue as seriously as it should be taken, and I
understand why they have come to the conclusion that forced marriage
should be criminalised. However, my opinion is that many victims would
not want to see their parents, who are normally the main culprits in
forced marriages, behind bars. Thus, many cases may not get reported

counterproductive.</hs_para>

Dear (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, in addressing this omnibus, complex,
200-page Bill, I am conscious that it seeks to shine a very bright
light indeed on anti-social behaviour. We have heard a lot about that
in your Lordships’ Chamber today. It is behaviour that, at its
worst, can cause an absolute blight on society and on the individuals
caught up in that action. I think that the words of the noble
Baroness, Lady Newlove, moved us all when she explained just how, in
extremis, that can affect individuals.</hs_para>

I think that the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede, shares my
view—that there was some evidence that the existing law, held in
the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, was beginning to work with regard to
anti-social behaviour orders. I have a couple of questions, not for the
Minister to answer today but to hang in the air as we go through to the
Bill’s later stages. Are there any compelling reasons why we
should redraft sections of that Act? Is there anything that cannot be
addressed by changes in policing practice, better targeted policing and
embracing to better effect the other statutory services? I will not go
on at great length as much of what I had planned to say, inevitably at
this late stage, has been said but I, too, am concerned about the
imprecise wording which, as we have heard, has already been criticised
by Justice, Liberty, the Home Affairs Committee, the Joint Committee on
Human Rights and others. The Bill seeks to extend the number of
potential claimants originally set out in the Act. It is a fact that it
is quite unprecedented to authorise injunctive relief in civil
proceedings, even though the public authorities concerned may not have
a direct interest in the relief that they seek. That is a very
considerable extension of power.</hs_para>

further on the burden of proof. The McCann case brought in the enhanced
civil burden—the criminal burden of proof under the existing
Act—and we are now seeking in the Bill to drop that onto the
balance of probabilities. Taking that particular point, I want to focus
on one set of words and to remind the House again that for anti-social
behaviour orders under the existing Act the operative words are
“harassment, alarm or distress”. I have no problem with
those, and I think that the courts and the practitioners have no
problem either. The concept of harassment is very well rooted in
various statutes in our lexicon of law, “alarm” means
fear or fright, and “distress” is fairly obvious as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T22:05:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000050">Yet
under what we are now calling IPNA—the injunction to prevent
nuisance and annoyance—we drop all that and go back to using the
words “nuisance or annoyance”. There is no ready
reference to those terms in the criminal law, only in housing law. I
have a distinct feeling of déjà vu in connection with the
words “nuisance “ and “annoyance”, because
it is almost exactly a year ago that I stood on the Floor of the
Chamber to talk about an amendment that I had 
<?notus-xml column=1554?>tabled to remove the word “insulting” from Section 5 of
the Public Order Act 1986. Noble Lords might remember, if they were

is no problem, “abusive” is no problem, but the
definition of “insulting” had been widely abused for many
years. It was used by vindictive complainants to urge the police to
take action when otherwise they would not, and by over-zealous police
officers to deal with something that could have been dealt with by the
exercise of common sense. Whether or not the individual went to court,
it had a distinct chilling effect on the exercise of free speech. The
amendment was whipped against, but it was solidly backed by many

direct entry to the rank of superintendent. All that is wrapped up
together in an envelope called “leadership”. Noble Lords

the urgent need for a far higher standard of leadership across the

matters most is not the fight against international drug and human
trafficking but the quality of their everyday lives. For those who do
not live in houses as grand and isolated as Downton Abbey, the quality
of their lives depends largely on the behaviour of their neighbours.
When those neighbours engage in vandalism, graffiti, street drug
dealing, drinking in public or worse, the lives of everyone in those
communities become almost unbearable. Parts 1 to 6 of the Bill aim to
deal with this kind of anti-social behaviour. It is clear from
tonight’s speeches that we are to have some very lively debates
about these proposals, but I am not going to anticipate them
now—I merely commend the Government for addressing this subject

also commend the Government for giving our police and crime
commissioners a key role in their strategy for tackling anti-social
behaviour. It is less than a year since the 41 PCCs took office, but
already we are seeing signs of a more holistic approach to crime
prevention and public safety at the local level. Giving PCCs power to
provide or commission services, particularly support services for
victims and witnesses of crime and anti-social behaviour, as the Bill
proposes in Clause 129, is very much to be welcomed. I hope that in due
course the Government will go much further along this road of giving
PCCs more responsibility for local criminal justice and emergency
service systems. For further reading on this subject, I recommend that
the Minister get hold of the recent Policy Exchange

am also delighted to see that the British Transport Police have found a
place in the Bill. It is a first-class force which does a great job in
keeping us safe and secure on our rail and underground networks.
Putting that force on the same footing as the 43 Home Office forces in
respect of firearms is long overdue, and recognises that the BTP
supplies the same standards as those forces when it comes to selection,
training and assessment. I have long thought that it would be sensible
to make more use of the specialist skills and unique national coverage
of this force by extending their responsibilities beyond our rail

Lords may not be surprised to hear that I welcome the provision in
Clause 126, which makes it possible for someone who has not served as a
constable in a UK force to be appointed to lead a Home Office force. I
also welcome the support for this clause from the noble Lords, Lord
Condon and Lord Dear, both of whom have held very senior posts in our
local policing system with great distinction. Therefore, both may be
assumed to know a thing or two about the role of the chief constable
and what it takes to be good at it. However, I wonder why this
clause specifies appointment as a chief constable rather than as a
chief officer. Might it not sometimes be useful to be able to appoint
someone from abroad as a deputy chief constable or an assistant?

I want to say a few words about the new College of Policing, which
features prominently in Part 11. Among its other responsibilities, the
college is responsible for identifying, developing and promoting
ethics, values and standards of integrity for the police service. It is
in this context that the college is preparing the code of ethics for

ranks; and another two, both appointed as independent members, have
worked closely with police forces for many years. Of the remaining five

British Transport Police Authority. Only one member of that board, the

It is the public, after all, whom the police are employed to serve. If
there is a principal customer for the work of the college, it must
surely be our police and crime commissioners and their equivalents in
London. It is they who have statutory responsibility for keeping us
safe by maintaining efficient and effective police forces. It is they,

in supporting children who are victims of or at risk of sexual abuse
and exploitation. They generally support the sexual harm prevention
orders and sexual risk orders as set out in Part 9. The two new orders
will replace existing powers, and the threshold for risk will be
lowered to cover any case of sexual harm, not just cases of serious
sexual harm. These orders seek to improve the protection of vulnerable

orders simplify the current system, they are to be welcomed. In
relation to non-conviction behaviour, reducing the number of acts of
harm required for an order to be used from two to one means they can be
more easily obtained. Extending the ability to use these orders to
protect all children under 18, including 16 and 17 year-olds recognises
that older children are still vulnerable and can be subject to child
sexual exploitation and abuse. The inclusion of vulnerable adults in
the SHPO and SRO is welcome because we know that young adults with
learning difficulties or special educational needs are targeted by
individuals looking to exploit
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000074">It seems
likely that further work needs to be done in relation to how young
people under 18 subject to the orders are supported. Some young people

exploitation themselves or may have become involved as a means of
self-preservation, as the brief describes. We will be seeking
safeguards from the Government for young people under 18 who are
subject to the orders to ensure that they receive the support they
need, including an assessment of their emotional, welfare and
behavioural needs, and therapeutic and/or educational

concerned that breach of the child SHPO without conviction or the SRO
can result in five years’ imprisonment when a child has not
actually committed a criminal offence. We know that custody may not be
the most effective way to tackle children’s criminal behaviour,
and custody for under-18s should be used only as a very last resort in
the most serious and violent offences. One therefore has to question
whether it is appropriate where children have not been convicted of an
offence. We are very concerned about the use of custodial sentences for
under-18s, and we hope the Minister can give us some guidance on this
either now or in Committee. For example, what measures do the
Government propose for under-18s subject to these orders? Will the
Government consider prescribing in guidance the use of therapeutic
support and/or education and an assessment of needs when the orders are
applied to under-18s? Will the Government review and evaluate the
effectiveness of the orders when applied to under-18s, such as the
rates of reoffending and the effectiveness of any assessment of needs?

confine myself to coming back to the concerns I share with the
JCHR—and with many others who have spoken in this debate and in
another place—about the proposed new injunctions and criminal
behaviour orders. With others, I fear that these new orders are likely
to affect children and young people disproportionately. The Ministry of
Justice’s own statistics show that in 2011 38% of ASBOs were
imposed on children and young people aged between 10 and 17, who
together comprise only 13% of the

is true that for adults these injunctions are to be granted by civil
courts and so may be called civil injunctions. For lawyers, the
distinction between civil injunctions and criminal sanctions may be
clear and meaningful, but for those who will be subjected to these
injunctions I suspect that it means nothing. For children and young
people they will be granted by the youth courts. That is understandable
and probably right, but it illustrates the point that for the young
people on the receiving end, injunction proceedings will be in practice
almost indistinguishable from criminal proceedings. They may not get a
criminal record, but even that protection is undermined by the fact
that the courts may allow them to be
named.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000089">There is
a serious risk that young people, whose misbehaviour might never have

cover almost anything, as many noble Lords have pointed out. Speaking
for too long in this Chamber would clearly suffice. The noble Lord,

others, I cannot understand why the imposition of a sanction for
misconduct imposed by a court, which for those involved is effectively
a criminal sanction, can require only the civil standard of proof,
which is that a court finds that the conduct is more likely than not to
have occurred. Not just the imposition of the injunction is at stake;
there is the prospect of a power of arrest in any case involving the
use of violence or the threat of violence or a significant risk of harm
to others. I agree that a power of arrest is an appropriate way to make
injunctions effective, but its availability serves to increase the need
for full proof of the conduct concerned. The prospect of breach,
contempt proceedings and punishment is at stake, and presents a real
danger in a process that starts with an evidential test that most
lawyers would regard as failing to meet the demands of
justice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000092">The

a very low hurdle, which risks encouraging courts to grant such

insufficiently demanding and poorly defined, implementation is likely

also suggest that there should be a statutory maximum term for all such

proceedings against adults and of proceedings under Schedule 2 against
children and young people in breach. Although there are restrictions on
detention for those aged between 14 and 17, the fact that it is
perilously easy to be exposed to the imposition of an injunction in the
first place carries with it a serious risk of substantial injustice. I
also agree with my noble friend Lord Dholakia and the noble Lord, Lord
Judd, in particular that it is simply unfair that whole families should
face eviction from their homes because one resident or even
a visitor has breached an injunction or criminal
behaviour
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000097">There is

described by several of your Lordships as a Christmas tree Bill. I am
not sure where dogs come on the tree but perhaps they are around the
bottom of it, legs cocked. This is by way of saying that I wish to talk
about Part 7, which amends and improves legislation applying to
so-called dangerous dogs. I declare my interest as a veterinarian and a

to remember that dogs provide great value to human society and we
should not lose sight of that, but unfortunately they occasionally can
frighten, injure and sadly even kill people or animals. It is
important, too, to realise that only a tiny proportion of the 8.5
million dogs in this country are responsible for that harm. The
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 was an attempt to deal with this problem but is
widely recognised, as I am sure your Lordships will agree, as being a
less than adequate piece of legislation. The fact is that an estimated
210,000 people are attacked by dogs each year; last year approximately
6,500 incidents resulted in hospital admissions and a cost to the NHS
of £3 million a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T22:38:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

rightly appreciated that the problem with dogs is not so much the dogs
but their owners, as several noble Lords have mentioned, and that
aggressive dogs are but one tool by which aggressive people express
their aggression. As such, it is logical to embrace measures directed
at dogs and dog owners within measures directed at other forms of
anti-social behaviour, howsoever expressed. However, in designing
generic solutions there is a risk of losing the merits and benefits of
specific measures. I will elaborate on that in a
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000102">The
other general point of concern is that while inappropriate training and
care by an irresponsible owner may create a potentially dangerous dog,
even the most benign dog owned by the most
responsible 
<?notus-xml column=1563?>owner may find itself in a situation where the dog
exhibits aggression. As a vet, I well appreciate that—try
bringing a dog into a strange environment and sticking a needle into
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1310306000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000103">So,
legislation needs to balance protection of the public with common sense
and pragmatism. In the context of this legislation, this is
particularly important with respect to aggressive behaviour by a dog on
its own property towards an intruder. In general, I welcome the attempt
here to enhance the legislation relating to dog behaviour. The
extension to private property, for example, addresses the fact that 70%
of dog attacks currently occur on private property. However, there are
two areas that I will highlight where the proposals fall short of what,
in my opinion and that of the BVA and a number of animal charities, is
desirable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000104">With
dog-related aggression, our key objectives should be to prevent
apprehension, injury or death. It is little comfort after a serious dog
attack to know that one can prosecute the owner. There is a view widely
held by those most interested in this subject that low-threshold,
prophylactic intervention, as provided by dog control notices, would
specifically and more effectively prevent problems than the proposed
generic community protection notices, which would be served after
problems of a “persistent or continuing nature”. Dog
control notices can be used in a constructive way as improvement
notices and of course they have been adopted in the Scottish
legislation on the control of dogs in 2010. Moreover, community
protection notices relate to various non-specific threats and the
seizure of a dog, for example, requires rather more specific knowledge
and experience than the seizure of some inanimate object. I do,
however, appreciate that dog control notices require dedicated, trained
personnel to serve and enforce them
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000105">There
is a second area where I feel that the Bill falls short of the
desirable, for while it extends protection beyond humans to assistance
dogs, it stops there. There are countless cases of serious injury to
animals as a result of unprovoked dog attacks. A vet practitioner whom
I was speaking to recently recounted how in his Lancashire practice
alone they had seen four or five dogs which had been
“shredded” by dogs this year. Indeed, one had died.
Bearing in mind that there are some 4,500 practices in the UK, while we
have no accurate statistics of non-human injury, aggression against
other animal species, with the attendant distress that causes to the
owners, certainly is a considerable problem. Moreover, it is important
to note that it is likely that the owners who allow aggressive
behaviour against other animals will also be irresponsible with respect
to protecting humans. So action against dog-on-dog or other animal
attacks arguably is a constructive measure that could reduce and
prevent injury and distress to
humans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000106">In
conclusion, I welcome a number of measures in this Bill, but feel that

The Bill is either wide-ranging or a dog’s breakfast, depending

this possible Pandora’s box of a Bill a theme in a bid to
generate an appearance of cohesion to their proposals. That theme
appears to be putting victims first. That can certainly be an

annoyance—IPNAs—as helpful or a forward move. The
Government assert but have yet to produce the hard evidence that
anti-social behaviour orders have not been an effective solution and
claim, once again without hard evidence, that the lack of criminal
sanction in future under this Bill will not weaken but rather
strengthen the ability to tackle anti-social behaviour. It was, after
all, the Minister who told us in his opening speech that crime had been
falling—falling, he could have added, each year since ASBOs were

some landowners to regard walkers on a footpath through one of their

least the first example is a ridiculous one and would not come within
the terms of the wording in the Bill. But I am not so sure about the

doubt to balance of probabilities. That message is surely that the
Government want much more behaviour—some would say including
normal behaviour of many young people—to be liable to be caught
under the terms of the IPNA with a much lower threshold necessary to
establish and prove the case. That is a message that could result in

will also want to be clear about the possible consequences of a breach
of an IPNA. I appreciate that the Government made some amendments on
Report in the Commons, which mean that the ability to exclude a person
from his or her own home will be available across all tenures and not
just to the social housing sector. I am not sure that this principle
applies in other circumstances. It appears that for those living in
rented housing a breach of an IPNA could result in eviction. If that is
the case, could the situation then arise that a family in rented
housing could be evicted following a breach of an IPNA by one member of
the family on the basis that the conduct of that individual was making
life intolerable for nearby neighbours living in owner-occupied
property, but that if a family next door who owned their own home also
had one member of the family who had breached an IPNA, and the conduct
of that individual was making life intolerable for nearby neighbours
living in rented housing, they would not be evicted? Perhaps
the Minister could say whether that could or could not be the case
under the breach of an IPNA clause in the Bill. If it could happen,
could he say whether the Government do or do not believe that these
clauses potentially treat some sections of the community rather
differently from others for the same
offence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T22:54:49"></hs_TimeCode>? The
same issue would appear to arise in connection with possible eviction
for those in rented housing who have been convicted of an offence at
and during a riot, wherever that involvement might have taken place.
The Government say they want to put resources into sorting out the
problems that overwhelm so-called problem families. I am not
sure that that objective will be assisted if the ultimate effect of the
IPNA proposals in this Bill proves to be that more such families end up
on the

discuss the issue of legal highs and reducing their availability in our
communities, and the redefinition of the compensation test for those

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a wide debate,
which is not surprising given the content of the Bill. It is a
testament to the House that we have been able to hear, from the direct
experience and judgment of its Members, interesting and useful
observations on the Bill. I hope this will help us in our scrutiny of
it as it goes through the House. I thank all noble Lords who have
contributed. As I say, it has been a good debate. I was particularly
pleased to hear the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Paddick. He
brought to it a touch of humour, good grace and a wealth of knowledge
from 30 years in policing. When we come to Part 11 of the Bill, I look
forward to hearing of his experience and knowledge in that
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000131">The
evidence from today’s debate is that there is widespread support
for a number of the measures in the Bill. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord
Rosser, identified a number of areas where the Benches opposite are
happy with the proposals, which is a helpful start. These include the
measures to tackle illegal firearms and forced marriages; the extension
of the Dangerous Dogs Act to cover dog attacks that take place on
private property; and the measures to strengthen the IPCC and to
reinforce the College of Policing in professionalising the
police.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000132">As is
to be expected, we also heard some concerns around the House about
certain aspects of the Bill, in particular the test for the new

well in the housing sector since 1996. It is readily understood by the

by the previous Government in the ASB legislation passed in 2003. So it
is not a new

considering an application for an injunction, the court must have
regard to the principles of proportionality, or fairness, in deciding
whether it is just and convenient to grant the injunction. There is a
judicial test against which the injunction is granted. As my noble

<?notus-xml column=1569?>needs of victims of anti-social behaviour. I wholeheartedly agree, and
this view has been widely expressed by noble Lords around the House.

number of noble Lords—including the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Lichfield, the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, and my noble friend Lady Linklater—mentioned
their concern about the impact of the new injunction on young people. I
share their desire not to criminalise young people at an early age. We
are keen that professionals have the discretion to use informal
measures such as restorative justice or acceptable behaviour contracts
where they are appropriate for the victim and the community. I believe
that such measures will be appropriate for many young people, and our
draft guidance makes this clear. Normally a Minister stands here trying
to persuade the House to accept that draft guidance is coming, usually
saying that it will be here shortly or after the passage of time.
However, we actually have the draft guidance and I will make sure that
all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate get a copy of it. I
think that in some ways it will assuage some anxieties that noble Lords
have expressed. With the guidance in place, I believe it will assuage
some of those
fears.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000137">The
professionals and the courts also need to have the necessary powers to
protect victims from the small minority of young people who
persistently behave anti-socially. Where an injunction is appropriate,
it is right that strong sanctions should be available if it is
breached. However, unlike the ASBO, these will not result in a criminal
record. I am sure that will be seen as a welcome step by the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000138">I hope

including the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, and my noble friends Lady
Hamwee and Lord Faulks, expressed concern about the strength of the
powers to evict persons convicted of a related 
<?notus-xml column=1570?>offence. As we saw in 2011, those who riot and trash
communities can take away people’s livelihoods and homes.
Although the law currently enables the landlord to seek to evict those
who riot in the locality of their home, it does not capture the sort of
riot tourism that we saw in 2011. The Bill puts that right. It will
allow for landlords to apply to evict tenants where they or members of
the household have been convicted of an offence at the scene of a riot
anywhere in the United Kingdom where the behaviour takes place. That
unashamedly sends out a strong message that rioting will not be
tolerated and may carry

I reassure noble Lords that we expect landlords to seek to evict in
those circumstances only exceptionally and, where they do, important
safeguards will be in place. In particular, the court needs to be
satisfied on a case-by-case basis that it is reasonable to grant
possession. The impact on the whole household and any young children is
likely to be a relevant factor. Existing eviction powers make it clear
that tenants are responsible for the anti-social behaviour of members
of their household. This provision follows that well established
principle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000143">The

once an attack has occurred but to prevent such attacks.

contains a number of anti-social behaviour powers which can be used in
exactly the same way as a dog control notice. The community protection
notice, for example, can be used to require a dog owner to have their
dog neutered, to keep it muzzled, to keep it on a lead in a public
place and to attend dog training classes. The draft
practitioners’ manual explains that comprehensively. To provide
for another class of notice that does exactly the same thing as
existing provisions in the Bill would undermine one of our key

existing, complex mix of overlapping

makes sense for support for victims of such crimes, which have high
impact but are low in volume, such as homicide, rape and human
trafficking, to be commissioned centrally, the majority of victim

comments on the compensation for miscarriages of justice. The
provisions in the Bill in respect of compensation were raised by a
number of noble and learned Lords. It has been good to hear the
Rolls-Royce minds of lawyers at work. As a number of noble Lords
pointed out, the concept of a miscarriage of justice is not a
simple one. Over the years, that has been left open to interpretation
by the courts. This has resulted in a lack of clarity for applicants, 
<?notus-xml column=1573?>leaving Governments susceptible to frequent unsuccessful legal
challenges and their associated financial implications, with the
taxpayer footing the bill. The amendment to current legislation will
ensure that compensation is paid in cases where the new fact on which
the applicants’ conviction was overturned shows them to have
been innocent of the offence. This is a clear, open and transparent
test, and one that was successfully operated between 2008 and 2011.
That being the case, we are satisfied that it is a perfectly proper
test to enshrine in statute. I welcome the support of the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Brown, in this
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310306000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-0003.htm#1310306000158">I have

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, in moving this Motion,
I shall speak also to the next Motion standing in my name on the Order
Paper—that is, on the Representation of the People (Ballot
Paper) Regulations 2013. I shall speak to those regulations first. They
amend provisions in the parliamentary elections rules set out in the
Representation of the People Act 1983 to make changes to the
form of the ballot paper used at UK parliamentary elections. The
changes are being made following widespread consultation involving a
programme of public user testing and are designed to make the ballot
paper clearer and easier to use, and so to facilitate electors’
engagement with the voting process. The intention is for the new ballot
paper to take effect for any UK parliamentary by-election arising on or
after 22 May 2014, and for the general election scheduled for May
2015.</hs_para>

are being made as part of a wider exercise that will see the
introduction through secondary legislation of a set of up-to-date forms
and notices to be used by voters—including poll cards, postal
voting statements and the ballot paper—at UK parliamentary,
European parliamentary and local elections and also other statutory
elections and referendums, which are intended to make the voting
process more accessible. This reflects moves in recent years to
modernise the appearance of forms used by voters at newly created
polls, such as the police and crime commissioner elections and the 2011
referendum on the parliamentary voting
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000004">The
revised material—including the ballot paper we are considering
today—has been produced following a programme of public user
testing and consultation with the Electoral Commission, the Association
of Electoral Administrators, territorial offices, electoral services
suppliers and with Scope. The regulations make changes to the layout of
the ballot paper. They do this, first, by, for example, providing for
the left alignment of candidates’ details, which reflects the
way in which people read English—that is, left to right.
Secondly, they introduce a requirement for the ballot paper to display
the title of the election. The 
<?notus-xml column=550?>title of the election must also be printed inside a box to give it
prominence. This helps to remind people which election they are voting
in, which is particularly important if the election is combined with
another

regulations replace the traditional grid pattern on the ballot paper
with horizontal rules that allow the voting box to float freely between
them. This will help electors with certain eyesight problems who found
the old design difficult to use. Additionally, the regulations
require a final bold horizontal rule to be added to delineate
strongly the end of the ballot paper. The regulations amend the
directions for the printing of the ballot paper to support the changes
being made to the layout, wording and design of the ballot
paper.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102978000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000006">As I
have indicated, the Government have consulted the Electoral Commission
and other stakeholders over the new ballot paper. Further, in line with
what has become established practice for new voting forms, the ballot
paper has been subject to public user testing. Representative samples
of members of the public in different parts of the UK have therefore
had the opportunity to input their views on the clarity and
accessibility of the current ballot paper and the proposed new ballot
paper, and to influence the proposed changes. This resulted, for
example, in the pictorial depiction of the cross to be put by the voter
in the box next to their choice of candidate to be more prominent in
the guidance to voters on the ballot paper. The Electoral Commission,
stakeholders and members of the public involved in the user testing
have all been supportive of the proposed changes, agreeing that
they are an improvement on the current design.</hs_para>

participation in elections and effective electoral administration. The
proposed changes to the form of the ballot paper provided by the
regulations will make it clearer and easier to use and therefore will

Political Parties, Elections and Referendums (Civil Sanctions)
(Amendment) Order 2013. The Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 places a number of requirements on parties and
officers. These include the provision of quarterly donation reports and
annual accounts. The Political Parties and Elections Act 2009 provided
the Electoral Commission with new investigatory and civil sanction
powers. These powers were introduced to remedy the practical
difficulties the Electoral Commission found with the limited
investigative and sanctioning powers provided for by the 2000 Act. The
Electoral Commission has been able to use these additional powers since
2010. They include fixed or variable monetary penalties, compliance
notices and stop notices. The Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums (Civil Sanctions) (Amendment) Order 2013 makes two
technical amendments to this regime. These changes have been requested
by the Electoral Commission in the light of its experience of using
these civil sanctions.</hs_para>

the Electoral Commission to impose a fixed monetary penalty or
discretionary requirements on a registered political party and similar 
<?notus-xml column=551?>bodies in circumstances where a party office holder or responsible
person has committed a prescribed offence. The Electoral Commission has
highlighted a concern that it is unable to sanction a party for breach
where an individual has committed an offence; only the individual. In
certain circumstances it is more appropriate to sanction the party, for
example, where the individuals responsible for compliance are
frequently changed or where the breach arises from the individual
following a party
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000010">Secondly,
the Electoral Commission will be able to recover a non-compliance
penalty in England and Wales as though it was payable under a court
order. This means that if such a penalty is unpaid, the Electoral
Commission does not need to make a claim in the courts in order to
enforce payment. Instead, it can proceed straight to taking enforcement
action as though it had already obtained a judgment following such a
claim. Presently, this power is available to the Electoral Commission
for various financial penalties under the civil sanctions regime, but
not in relation to non-compliance penalties, which the order
seeks to rectify.</hs_para>

Maxton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I will be brief. I welcome the
order and the regulations because any changes that make it easier for
people to vote are to be welcomed. However, we live in an electronic
age, we no longer live in a paper age, and we certainly do not live in
an age where we use a pencil. As I said in an earlier debate, the last
place where an adult actually uses a pencil will be when they put a
cross on a ballot paper. Even golfers will have turned to electronic
means to keep their scores rather than recording them on a piece of
paper. Surely it is time to wake up to the fact that our younger
generation, who we are concerned to get involved in the political
process, are moving further and further away from us in terms of how we
carry on our democracy. This building is an example of how far behind
the times we are in that we still practise our democracy in a building
that is so out of date, being 18th or 19th century in its

involve younger people, not only do we have to educate them, we have to
change our democracy so that it takes them into account. They now use
electronic means to do a variety of different things, as do some
elderly people such as me, and use all forms of electronic devices. Why
on earth are we not moving, rapidly, towards electronic voting and
using ID cards—which this Government of course stopped—or
smart card technology in order to ensure that the right people vote and
the register is automatic? If we had some form of smart card, anybody
could simply turn up and vote anywhere—eventually, even at home,
by putting their card into their computer or their finger on their
iPad, or whatever it might be, to prove who they are and then
voting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T15:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Maxton:</Member></B> I am quite happy to take that intervention. The
benefits are twofold. First, you have an automatic register and do not
have this problem of people committing offences by not registering.
There would be a register, and you would have an ID card that included
your address, which would therefore be on the register in each
constituency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000017">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T15:42:08"></hs_TimeCode>,
the benefit of voting electronically through some form of ID card is
that you increase the number of people who vote because you make it
possible across a whole range of outlets and places, such as
supermarkets or wherever it might be. People can vote provided they can
prove their identity. At the same time, that does away with the problem
of fraud because you cannot vote unless you have an ID card or some
form of fingerprint, eye scan or whatever recognition you might use.
That will ensure that we have a system which stops fraud from taking
place. It will not stop all fraud but it will dramatically reduce the
amount of fraud that, supposedly, takes place in elections
at
present.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000018">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T15:42:37"></hs_TimeCode>

welcome the first draft order, for which the Electoral Commission
asked, as the Minister told us. It allows civil sanctions to be used
against the relevant organisation, whether a political party or a third
party, rather than simply the “responsible person”.
However, it does rather beg the question of why, under the other bit of
mischief that he is up to at the moment—the “Lobbying and
Interference with Civil Society” Bill that he is steering
through the House—the Minister is introducing criminal
sanctions. I am not quite certain what the thinking is behind that. I
am also not certain, under that Bill, to whom the criminal sanctions
would apply. Would it be the “responsible person” or, as
with this order at the moment, the body rather than the individual
concerned? In other words, is it the hapless officer who happens to
have spent £20 over the cap on travel costs, their boss or the
trustees of the charity? It is interesting that the distinction being
made in this order between the individual and the organisation is not
as clear as in the other bit of mischief he is up to. 
<?notus-xml column=553?>It would therefore be useful if the Government could
provide clarity as to who the responsible person is under that Bill, as

not think he mentioned organisations such as the RNIB, which deals not
just with those with no sight but also with those with restricted
sight, and organisations dealing with people with other physical
difficulties who may have difficulty casting a vote. Have those
organisations been consulted? Secondly, can he indicate the date when
we can expect to see the Welsh version of the ballot paper? I know that

amend the current rules for European parliamentary

parliamentary and local elections in Northern Ireland. We consulted the

the implementation of EU Council Directive 2013/1/EU, these regulations
amend the European Parliamentary Elections (Northern Ireland)
Regulations 2004 to transpose, for Northern Ireland, the changes made
by the directive. The Council directive concerns the right to stand as
a candidate in elections to the European Parliament for citizens of the
Union who live in a member state of which they are not nationals. In
the UK, this means an EU citizen who wants to stand for election in the
UK but is not a UK, Irish or Commonwealth citizen—in simple
terms, an “EU
candidate”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000031">At
previous European elections, each EU candidate had themselves to obtain
a certificate from their home member state that they had not been
disqualified from standing in European parliamentary elections by a
decision in that member state. They had to provide that certificate
when submitting their nomination. This was perceived to be a barrier
preventing EU candidates from standing for election, so the law was
changed at EU level. From the 2014 polls, under the new directive the
UK Government will be obliged to request information from the
candidate’s home member state, instead of the candidate being
required to do so. This requirement will be applied across all EU
member states. Similar legislation for Great Britain was brought
forward by the Cabinet Office and debated in this House
on 15 October. However, the use of the single transferable vote
system in Northern Ireland means that the implementation of the
directive must be slightly different in Northern Ireland. I reassure
the Committee that Irish citizens in the UK are treated on the same
basis as British citizens for these purposes; the changes apply only to
citizens of the Union who are not British, Irish or Commonwealth
citizens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T15:54:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000032">I
now turn to the changes being made by these regulations which reflect
changes that have already been made for other elections in Northern
Ireland. First, as noble Lords will be aware, the Electoral
Registration and Administration Act 2013 provides that persons who are
inside the polling station, or queuing outside the polling station, at
the close of the poll—that is, at 10 pm on polling
day—can apply for a ballot paper. These regulations make the
same change in respect of European Parliamentary elections in Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000033">It is
also worth noting that no provision is made in these regulations in
relation to the delivery of postal ballot papers by persons queuing at
polling stations. This is because, in contrast to Great Britain,
delivery of postal ballots to polling stations is not permitted. In
Northern Ireland postal ballot papers must be delivered directly to the
returning
officer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000034">Secondly,
as noble Lords will know, voters applying for a ballot paper in
Northern Ireland are required to present identification. In 2010,
amendments were introduced to include European Community licences
within the definition of a “driving licence” in the 
<?notus-xml column=556?>prescribed documents that can be produced when a voter applies for a
ballot paper for parliamentary and local elections. These regulations
make the same change in respect of European parliamentary
elections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000035">Thirdly,
amendments were made to absent voting provisions in 2010 for
parliamentary and local elections. These regulations make the same
changes for European parliamentary elections. Applicants for a postal
vote are now required to give an explanation when applying for a ballot
paper to be sent to a different address from that in the
register.</hs_para>

regulations make two further necessary amendments relating to the
conduct of European parliamentary elections. Polling districts and
places designated for European parliamentary elections in Northern
Ireland were previously the same as those used for parliamentary
elections and, in turn, polling places for parliamentary elections were
based on those for local elections. As a result of local government
reform in Northern Ireland, the local government boundaries will no
longer be the same as the parliamentary boundaries and so the polling
station schemes for local and parliamentary elections will need to be
different.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000038">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:06:10"></hs_TimeCode>
regulations provide that polling places for European parliamentary
elections will now be the same as those for local elections. However,
they also give the chief electoral officer the flexibility to use some
different polling districts and places if special circumstances make it
desirable to do so. For example, if a parliamentary or Northern Ireland
Assembly election poll were combined with a European parliamentary
election poll, it might be more appropriate to use the parliamentary
polling districts.</hs_para>

final amendment being made by these regulations is to make it an

Randerson:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for his comments and for
indicating his support in general terms. I also thank him for his
questions. I shall address first the issue of the five-day timetable
and how tight it is. The timetable is the same as that used in Great
Britain and the system will be familiar to other member states. That is
because the obligation is on every member state of the EU to behave in
a similar manner. All member states will be alert to the need for swift
action on this. It is also worth pointing out that in these days of
electronic communications, referring back to the previous debate in
this Committee, the timetables can be very much tighter than in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:12:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

a disqualified candidate appearing on the ballot paper and the
possibility of finding a different way of dealing with it than simply
reallocating the votes. Of course, in Great Britain the system of
elections is different in that it consists of party lists, so the vote
would simply pass on to the next candidate on that list, but with STV
in Northern Ireland, obviously that is not possible. However, it is
also possible for the chief electoral officer to take any measures he
sees fit in order to alert voters to the situation. For example, it 
<?notus-xml column=558?>would be perfectly reasonable, in those circumstances, to expect the
chief electoral officer to put up posters at polling stations to inform
voters that one of the candidates appearing on the ballot paper had
been disqualified. In terms of the tightness of the timetable all round
in these issues, it is worth pointing out that the whole process cannot
be put into place until the nomination forms have been received. There
is a set of rules to determine how many days are available from
nomination to the election. The period cannot be made too long for
obvious reasons, and all these procedures have to be fitted in. I hope
that the noble Lord will agree that the suggested solutions are a
practical way forward.</hs_para>

ballot paper, or a similar party, failed to meet the system but
remained on the ballot paper, where would the votes go? Perhaps it is a
bit far-fetched but, as an experienced election agent, I can think of
ways of confusing the public by the manipulation of names of candidates
on the ballot paper, but maybe I am being too

My Lords, the purpose of this order is to designate
the UK Green Investment Bank for the purposes of Sections 3 to 6 of the
Enterprise and 
<?notus-xml column=559?>Regulatory Reform Act 2013. Designation means that
certain statutory requirements provided for in that Act will apply to
the bank.</hs_para>

Act will apply, preventing the bank from altering its objectives unless
this is either required by law or approved by the Secretary of State.
This will ensure that the bank’s articles of association always
remain consistent with the green purposes provided for in the Act.
Secondly, Section 4 of the Act provides the Government with a bespoke
power to fund the bank. Thirdly, Sections 5 and 6 impose on the bank
certain enhanced reporting and publication requirements, including a
requirement to report to Parliament if the operational independence
undertaking is revoked or materially
altered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000050">This
enhanced reporting requirement means that the bank must, for example:
report as if it were a quoted company; as part of this, include in its
annual report information on its impact on the environment and on
directors’ remuneration; and, finally, report on the likely
effect of its investment-related activity on greenhouse gas
emissions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000051">The
Act specifies that certain conditions must be met before the bank may
be designated. I am satisfied that each of these conditions has now
been met. I would like to go through these. First, the bank’s
objectives, provided in Article 3 of the bank’s articles of
association, provide assurance that the bank will engage only in
investment-related activity it considers likely to contribute to the
achievement of one or more of the statutory green purposes. Secondly,
the bank’s objects provide assurance that the bank’s
investment-related activity, taken as a whole, is likely to contribute
to a reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the
approach agreed during passage of the Bill. Thirdly, the bank’s
operational independence undertaking was laid before Parliament in
July, at the same time as the draft order. Finally, I can also confirm
that the bank is wholly owned by the
Crown.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000052">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:20:12"></hs_TimeCode>
June, the Secretary of State placed a copy of the bank’s first
annual report in the House Libraries, providing detailed information

future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000053">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:20:45"></hs_TimeCode>

of offshore wind, energy efficiency, waste recycling and waste to
energy, with the projects supported located throughout the United
Kingdom. The bank has to date committed a total of £714 million
and has brought alongside over £1.8 billion of additional
private sector finance. Information about individual commitments is
routinely made available on the bank’s website and in its annual

<?notus-xml column=560?>reports. It has made a good start on delivering green impacts, and we
would expect this to continue as more of the projects that the bank has
supported become operational. There is clearly an important role for
the Green Investment Bank to play in mobilising additional private
capital into green sectors. That is why at the recent spending review
we allocated a further £800 million to it, meaning it
now has £3.8 billion of funding for the period to March 2016. We
are in the process of seeking European Commission approval for this
additional funding and hope to make progress with that further approval
in the early part of next
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000055">By<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>

Worthington (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for his introductory comments and for setting the context for
today’s debate. It is to be welcomed that the bank is to be
designated and is to fall under the statutory controls that were set
out in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act. This gives us an
opportunity to reflect on some of the events that have occurred over
the past 12 months, now that it has been operating for a year, as the
Minister
stated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000057">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:23:22"></hs_TimeCode>
what degree does the Minister feel that the bank’s ability to
perform its task has been affected by recent messages coming from the
Government about the desire to roll back on support for green energy
taxes and
levies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:23:38"></hs_TimeCode>? My
concern is that the green bank will be only as successful as the policy
environment in which it can operate. We will increase risk and reduce
profitability for the bank if we do not create the right investment
signals about our commitment to low-carbon investment and projects. In
the review that we are told is taking place on green levies and taxes,
will the impact on investor confidence be fully taken into account and
will the Green Investment Bank’s advice, comments and thoughts
be sought in that
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:24:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:22:32"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000058">To
reflect, we are in a fast-changing environment and energy policy is now
at a far more critical stage than it has been. It is important that we
do not change course in an unconsidered manner without thinking through
the impact that will have on other government policies, including on
the Green Investment Bank, which has received many plaudits and
cross-party support as regards its objectives and the way it has been
set
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:24:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000059">Secondly,
given that we have now had a year of operation, to what extent are the
priority areas that have been identified for the bank sufficiently
broad to enable it to invest in a wide enough portfolio of projects?
Despite the fact that £740 million has been committed, I have
heard that that investment has slowed down in recent months. The
investment is very much front-loaded and a large part of it is taken up
with one investment in the Drax biomass conversion project. However, in
recent months fewer projects seem to have come forward. Is that because
the range of investments is too narrow? I would be interested to hear
from the Minister what could be achieved if the list were broader. I am
sure that that would involve discussions in Brussels around state aid
and what is 
<?notus-xml column=561?>allowed to be invested in. I would be very
interested to hear whether discussions are already under way as I am
sure that it will take time for any changes to be secured in
Brussels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:26:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000060">The
other question I would like to raise is around the Green Deal. I
understand that the Green Investment Bank has a role to play in
supporting the Green Deal. However, as we know, the Green Deal has not
got off to the flying start for which we had hoped. That is
regrettable. There is a question for the Government now as to what we
can do to improve the performance of the Green Deal. One of the
problems is that the interest rates being offered on the financial
package are far higher than those set by the Bank of England, and that
is deterring people from taking out the financial package. I think
people are interested because a large number of people are seeking the
advice of Green Deal assessors but they are not going on to take out
the financial package. Can something be done under the Green Deal to
help that? Given that the profit margin it needs to return is only
3.5%, could there be a way in which the Green Investment Bank could be
used to bring down the cost of financing? I think that we would all
welcome that and I am sure that it would drive more people towards
taking up the Green
Deal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:27:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000061">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:37:45"></hs_TimeCode>
we have said a number of times before, a bank needs to borrow in order
to be a bank. It is regrettable that we do not have a bit more clarity
over when the bank will be allowed to borrow. If the supply chain of
projects is not as great as we had hoped, the Labour Party would want
to give the bank more flexibility in relation to borrowing. In fact,
the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech at the conference this
summer that he would give the bank full borrowing powers. The
Government have set criteria to be met after which the bank will be
allowed to borrow but it seems to me that those criteria are rather
harsh. It could be that they are never met and that our deficit
reduction plans curtail the bank too much. However, if we were to free
up the bank, that might well help us to meet our deficit reduction
plans quicker, so there is definitely something to be said for looking
at that again and providing more clarity as to when the bank can become
a more fully fledged bank. I look forward to the Minister’s
response.</hs_para>

the noble Baroness brought up the effect of a desire to roll back green
taxes. She asked whether the tax review would damage investor
confidence and whether the Green Investment Bank would contribute to
the review. The Government are looking at how to get people’s
energy bills as low as possible to help hard-pressed families; she will
know that this is a tack that we are taking. We have already increased
competition and brought new players into the market to offer consumers
real choice, and the most vulnerable are getting direct help with their
bills this winter. We will continue this work to make sure that
consumers are getting a good deal. No one is talking about changing
support for large-scale renewables or feed-in tariffs, which are
essential for investor confidence in the 
<?notus-xml column=562?>renewables sector and our commitments to a low-carbon economy. It is a
bit too early to say what the review’s outcome will be, but it
will take account of the effect on green
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:30:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:30:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102978000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000300">4.30

Baroness also spoke about the damage to the Green Investment
Bank’s success if the Government do not continue to support
green policies. The bank is a discrete measure that supports and
complements wider green policies. I assure the noble Baroness that
there is no question of the Government moving away from their policies
in support of renewable energy and green growth. I know that the noble
Baroness has supported this over many years, and I hope that I can go
some way to reassuring her on our
stance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:31:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000065">I
turn to the question of funding. The noble Baroness brought up an
important point about borrowing. She will know that we have provided
the Green Investment Bank with all the funding that it requires for the
period up until 2016 to the tune of £3.8 billion. In the longer
term, we will keep under review the position on Green Investment Bank
borrowing from the capital markets as levels of public sector debt
begin to fall. We have said this before, as I know. In the interim, the
Green Investment Bank has the option of borrowing up to £500
million of its £800 million provision for the 2015-16 year from
the HM Treasury’s National Loans
Fund<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:31:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000066">The
noble Baroness also asked about the priority areas and as to whether
they were sufficiently broad. The priority sectors agreed by the
commission are sufficiently broad to enable the Green Investment Bank
to invest in current green sectors. We will, of course, discuss the
addition of other sectors as technologies
develop<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:32:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000067">The
noble Baroness also spoke at some length on the Green Deal, and I will
attempt to answer her question. The Green Investment Bank has invested
in the Green Deal Finance Company; it played a key role in negotiating
financing of that company and will contribute, via that, to the Green
Deal. The bank focuses on investing in non-domestic or non-residential
energy efficiency where it has notable successes
already<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:33:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000068">I
think that I have answered nearly all the noble Baroness’s
questions, but there was one that I wanted to pick up on in particular.
She is completely correct that we are seeing a general slowdown in
market activity in the green economy; she will probably know more than
I do about this, from her experience. This means that there are fewer
transactions being done that meet the Green Investment Bank’s
investment criteria—being additional, having a green impact and
achieving profitability. So it is possible that our original targets
for capital deployment in 2013-14 will not now be met, but the Green
Investment Bank has full flexibility to carry forward funds within the
current spending review period, and it can carry forward into the next
period up to £1 billion of funds, committed but not actually
drawn down. I hope that provides a more expansive answer to a well made
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:34:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000069">I

thing that I did not quite hear an answer on was: could something be
done using the Green Investment Bank to bring down the costs of

is important that the use of the Green Investment Bank is maximised to

the pipeline of projects, I hope that the Green Investment Bank is able
to provide feedback to the Government on how it perceives this conveyor
belt of projects can be improved. I sense that this is all tied up with
the Energy Bill that is currently being finalised. One of the key
issues in the Energy Bill is strike prices—what the level of
support is going to be for different technologies. Knowing how
interested the Green Investment Bank is in offshore wind, I encourage
the Minister to listen to what it says about the number of projects
that can come through under the current proposed strike
prices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000073">With
regard to the Government’s backing of offshore wind, we have
seen a steady decrease in estimates of how much offshore wind we are
going to see. That has unsettled the investment community and might
have something to do why there is not the healthy conveyor belt of
projects that we might want to see. I do not expect a reply on that
either, I just urge the Minister to consult the Green Investment Bank
and to work with colleagues in DECC to ensure that the offshore wind

have some key facts. There are 3,243 libraries in England and 4,265 in
the UK as a whole. Authorities in England spend £820 million on
their library services. There were 256 million visits to libraries in
England and 244 million book loans in England last year. However, these
figures mask the fact that this is a service in crisis. This is a
service, together with others, which is delivering against a backdrop
of significant public sector financial difficulty. It seems to many
people that we are failing to deliver a “comprehensive and
efficient” service to a population which, despite other
competing attractions, retains an appetite for
reading.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000081">The
Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 places a statutory duty on
library authorities to provide a “comprehensive and

Department will use the reports to look for ways in which we can help
local authorities. I must emphasise that this is not an attempt to
sanction local authorities and certainly not a return to top-down,
inflexible library standards. But if we see wildly diverging opening
hours between two similar authorities with similar budgets and
infrastructure, there will be an opportunity to ask questions and look
at how opening hours could be improved … Or if one authority is
spending twice as much on book stock as another, but providing a
similar number of books, we can ask if there are ways to improve
efficiency in the authority in
question”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13102978000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000227">This

to the Library Campaign, many communities are now trying to run their
own libraries as the only way they have of saving them.
CILIP—the Chartered Institute of Library and Information
Professionals—published a survey in March which found that 13%
of councils had set up community-managed libraries, and that 38
libraries became or planned to become community managed in 2011-12. The
way in which libraries are managed varied from area to area. For
example, in Doncaster, volunteers run Warmsworth library but can
telephone a staffed branch if they need advice. However, handing over
libraries to volunteers continues to divide opinion.</hs_para>

Minister is aware of the Women’s Institute campaign, Love Your

libraries and received overwhelming support from delegates at the 2011
AGM. Much of what I want to say in the remainder of this speech is

report starts by talking about the value of libraries to WI members.
Some WI groups have grown up directly from links with local libraries
and many depend on libraries to run their book groups or form other
links with local libraries. Members with young children value the free
and low-cost activities provided by libraries. Those who are older have
found the library an important enabler for lifelong learning, et
cetera. There is a great deal of involvement of the Women’s
Institute with the library
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000089">The
NFWI conducted research with WI members on what made their libraries so
important to them, which is included in the report. I will not go into
it in detail but it is very useful and very interesting reading. The
research found that women in households with children are more likely
to access library services than men or households without children,
which means that there is also a bigger effect when libraries are
closed. That is obviously an important equality point. It points out
that libraries are a key service at a time when 20% of households do
not have an internet connection. We heard about that in the House this
afternoon during Question Time.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102978000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000090">The research also
reports that there is a strong case for libraries because increasingly
children do not own books. A recent survey shows that every third child
now does not own a book. That is the 2011 figure, up from one child in
10 in 2005. There is obviously a real concern about the use of library
books by young people. The research found that the impact of budget
reductions on a local level is such that the future of the public
library service is at risk through the gradual erosion of the service.
There is insufficient scrutiny of the broad impact of such changes on
the network as a whole and the result may be a postcode lottery, with
significant variations in service quality across different local
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000091">The
research also found that the proliferation of community-managed
libraries is in danger of creating a two-tier network of library
services. Professional staff must be at the heart of a 21st century
library service and, while volunteers have an important role to play in
public libraries, many communities do not have the capacity or appetite
to run services themselves. The report looked at the experience of
volunteers from the WI who worked in libraries and community libraries.
It found that the piecemeal development of community-managed libraries
and inadequate guidance of good practice have resulted in many
volunteers receiving a chronic lack of support from local authorities
and facing a range of unrealistic demands. Volunteers were navigating a
complex obstacle course of responsibilities and often struggling to
discharge these responsibilities effectively, raising questions
about the long-term sustainability of community-managed 
<?notus-xml column=567?>libraries. These are serious concerns and I would be grateful if the
Minister could comment on them as much as he is able
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000092">As the

Hollins (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord
for securing this important debate. I am going to focus my remarks on
the role of volunteers 
<?notus-xml column=568?>in supporting people who traditionally have made little or no use of
libraries, people who could form a completely new audience for them.
But volunteers would need to be an additional resource to support such
extended services, not a replacement for fully qualified librarians.
Not surprisingly, the Chartered Institute of Library and Information
Professionals has concerns about the use of volunteers to replace
qualified staff, stressing that they would be unable to serve the
community comprehensively—and the word
“comprehensively” is key here.</hs_para>

consider the role of libraries in the lives of people with learning

difficulties leave school with very low literacy skills, I suggest that
their need for library resources in the community should be a priority,
but they need support to access these resources. The 2011 <I>Future

school library. The report, however, failed to address the need for
access to libraries for children attending special schools—who,

will give an example of how a grant-funded scheme in Kent has enabled
librarians, working with volunteers, to open up public libraries to
this hitherto neglected group. Six libraries in Kent have established
book clubs for non-reading adults. Volunteers are also getting involved
without additional funding in libraries elsewhere, including in
Worcester, where I believe the first joint university and city library
has been established. It is known as The Hive, and is a venue where a
range of services are co-located. Other libraries pursuing these 
<?notus-xml column=569?>projects include those in Ealing, Thurrock and
Merton. The Hive was an early adopter of book clubs for people with
learning disabilities, who find pictures easier to read than words.

at this point as the executive chair of a charitable organisation
called Books Beyond Words, which publishes picture books without any
words on topics of interest to older children and adults. The 40 titles
in the Books Beyond Words series cover many health, social care and
criminal justice topics such as going to the doctor or being mugged, as
well as social issues such as falling in love and books about sport and
exercise, healthy eating, and moving house. These pictorial stories are
especially powerful when read in a group, prompting fascinating
discussions and amusement for the participants and the group’s
facilitators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000103">Beyond
Words book clubs in libraries open up a free resource to people who
cannot read conventional books and provide them with an enjoyable and
stimulating local activity to enliven their week and help them to be
more included in their local community. The members choose which book
to read, and their choices may sometimes seem surprising. Despite
initial concerns about the sensitive nature of many of the books, the
experience in Kent is that once the groups have read some of the more
everyday stories, they choose tougher ones, too, and relate well to
them with help from the group discussion and facilitation from the
volunteers. Two groups have now invited community police and shown them
some criminal justice books in the series. One group has been invited
back to the police station, while one group has invited a professional
from the local hospital to a session and then run a book group at an
event at the local hospital on improving awareness of the health of
people with learning disabilities. Volunteers provide essential support
for these extension activities,
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000104">The Arts
Council CEO, Alan Davey, says that the libraries’ role in the
community, reaching vulnerable and excluded people, will extend to
being invited into other community services or workplaces to meet
particular needs—just as these new book clubs in Kent and
elsewhere are discovering. Beyond Words group members are becoming
regular and positive users of library services and see it as their
right, rather than a privilege or something that is not for them as
they cannot read, although some of them are beginning to borrow books
with words as well. However, when local people were invited to a Beyond
Words taster session in Wimbledon library as part of the 2010 Wimbledon
BookFest, of the 12 people with learning disabilities
who attended, only three recalled ever having been in a library
before.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000105">Some
book club members are taking part in Kent Libraries’ Six Book
Challenge, which incentivises readers with a certificate and small
gifts if they read six books. Kent librarians now recognise that
reading through pictures rather than words is a valid approach.
Participating in a book club in the library means that members can be
drawn into other community activities. For example, in Dover, the
library and community cafe are in a complex called the Discovery
Centre, and the Discovery book club last week spent the first
10 minutes of its session adding to the voices of what 
<?notus-xml column=570?>the people of Dover like and do not like about their
town, and helping to think about what its £1 million lottery
grant should be spent on. The co-leader of this book club is a

is still much to learn, particularly about how to support networks to
become more self-sustaining, how to develop book clubs that integrate
with other book clubs and link to other community activities, and how
to include even more excluded individuals and reach particular
populations, such as those in prison, in education in special schools

book clubs are free to the members, there are costs involved in
recruiting, training and supporting volunteers, as well as in covering
the cost of the Disclosure and Barring Service. Who are these
volunteers and what do they get out of the experience? The Kent
Libraries Time2Give volunteering programme has been invaluable in terms
of recruiting suitable volunteers for work within the libraries, and a
grant-funded project manager. The grant has enabled the librarians and

One volunteer was recently thanked with a huge smile and gentle touch
to her arm by a man who does not speak; it was a much-cherished moment
for her. But they are also given positive encouragement by other casual
library users, who see the groups as they are passing through. There is

Warwick of Undercliffe (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend Lord Stevenson for providing an opportunity to debate this issue
as we await the outcome of the review promised by the Government in
their response to last year’s Select Committee inquiry into
library closures. That review promises to tell us what the cumulative
effect has been on library services of the reduction in local authority
provision, and the growth of alternatives, such as community libraries.
In the mean time, as my noble friend eloquently outlined, we have the
benefit of insights from the Women’s Institute, whose
perspective on the contribution made 
<?notus-xml column=571?>by community-managed libraries was published earlier
this year. This drew on the direct experience of its many members who
are library
volunteers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000111">The
WI does not believe that community-managed libraries should be used as
a substitute for the publicly run network. In particular, it recognises
that not all communities have the resources to set up and run a
library, warning that if the community-run model becomes the norm, it
will lead to a postcode lottery of library services. We know how
effectively the WI can make its views known to political leaders. As I
read its report, I could hear the echo of a slow handclap of more than
a decade ago. When an organisation the size of the WI tells you that
you are getting something wrong, you would do well to listen. So while
I wholeheartedly support my noble friend’s tribute to the
tremendous work of the WI and other volunteers, I also echo his
warnings about the potential dismantling of the whole infrastructure of
our library
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000112">Everyone
appreciates that libraries are delivering their essential services in a
hard financial climate. In 2011, CILIP, the Chartered Institute of
Library and Information Professionals, showed a net reduction in total
revenue expenditure of £39 million; almost 1,000
posts removed in one year; library hours per week reduced by 3,000 in
one year; diminishing book stocks; and reductions in the range of
services offered. Its 2012 survey showed a continuing trend of
reductions, alongside changes in how services are delivered, including
increasing numbers of community-managed libraries. While library
closures were fewer last year, more are now being considered. Given the
number of community libraries that might need to take over, if these do
not materialise, the network of public libraries faces even more
closure by
stealth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000113">It is
sadly true that without a willing group of campaigners to fight for
their library service, the future of the library itself hangs in the
balance. Often communities find that the only way to retain the service
is to step in and take over the management of the library. What these
volunteers seem to be telling us is that they need more support and
guidance than the Government or the Arts Council have yet provided. The
Arts Council England guidance published earlier this year does not go
far enough.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000114">We
know that the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 places a statutory
duty on local authorities to provide a “comprehensive and
efficient” public library service for their local community. As
the Select Committee inquiry into library closures last year uncovered,
this is open to wide interpretation and discretion at local level. What
is clear is that more and more authorities are keen to adopt the
community-managed model. However, volunteers are warning that
authorities’ disparate approaches mean that a piecemeal library
service is developing, so varying levels of service provision exist
within, and between, localities. Can the Minister assure us that, in
his promised review, he will provide more guidance and mechanisms for
delivery to assist the growing number of communities which find
themselves delivering front-line library
services?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000115">There
was a lot of discussion during the Select Committee inquiry about the
1964 Act, and I certainly do not propose to repeat it here. But does
the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=572?>agree that the 1964 Act is outdated, with its
reference, for example, to the provision of gramophone records? Surely
we need new statutory guidance that explicitly references the provision
of access to digital media and the
internet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000116">I
will make one further point on the contribution of volunteers in our
public library system. I know that volunteers can provide wonderful
services that paid library staff often do not have the resources to
deliver. I know of one elderly, housebound resident in a north London
borough who is enormously appreciative of the volunteers who staff the
home library service. A volunteer visits her every fortnight with a
hand-picked selection of up to 30 books, often staying for a cup of tea
and a chat. Indeed, the librarian says that without these marvellous
volunteers this service would inevitably put impossible pressure on
existing paid staff and would in all likelihood eventually
close.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000117">There
are great examples of community libraries reporting that they are
delivering improved opening times, a more flexible and fuller use of
facilities, and better outreach services. But we should not be so busy
applauding evidence of localism in action that we are blind to the
consequences when there is no such band of willing volunteers
available.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102978000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000118">If
the drive to cut budgets means that we damage our national public
library system irreparably, the consequences will be far-reaching. The
e-Learning Foundation says 1 million children in the UK live in homes
without computers and 2 million children do not have access to the
internet at home. According to a 2011 National Literacy Trust report,
23% of children do not have access to a desk at home, and this figure
increases among children who receive free school meals.</hs_para>

have access to books or a desk at home are more likely to struggle with
reading. Libraries are places where children can overcome these
barriers, through free access to books, computers and the internet, and
to study areas with desk space. Libraries also offer assistance with
homework. When a library closes, children have one less place where
they can have a desk on which to study, one less place where they can
have support to do their homework and one less place where they can
read.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102978000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000120">I do
not need to point out the far-reaching consequences of illiteracy, both
for individuals and society, but I was struck by a point made in a
speech earlier this month at the Reading Agency, a charity whose
mission is to give everyone an equal chance in life by helping people
become confident and enthusiastic readers, given by the author Neil
Gaiman. In it he talked about private prisons in America, a huge growth
industry in that country. He said that when the prison industry plans
for future growth—in other words, how many prisoners there will
be 15 years from now and how many cells they will need—it found
that it could predict this very easily using a simple algorithm based
on asking what percentage of 10 and 11 year-olds could not
read.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000121">For
adults, particularly the elderly, libraries are community hubs.
Research shows that they are the trusted place to go for health support
and that public library staff are second only to doctors in terms of
the trust placed in them. Libraries provide non-stigmatised
community space, skilled staff and assisted online 
<?notus-xml column=573?>access. They are also an important information hub,
somewhere you can freely use the internet to find out about and apply
for jobs or benefits—all information which is increasingly
exclusively online. Of course, you can do all this with your mobile
phone, although those of us more challenged in this area usually need
the help of a grandchild or younger colleague. In libraries, that help
comes in the form of trained, skilled and experienced
librarians.</hs_para>

library service is not something we can deliver through untrained and
poorly supported volunteers. There are limits to what unskilled
volunteers can offer and what can be asked of them. Volunteers need to
be given training, advice and support if they are expected to deliver
library services. Without systematic support systems and a clear vision
of where volunteers fit within the library network, our new models for
a public library system will not serve the purpose. Can the Minister
give us an assurance that he will take the opportunity in his report on
the growth in community libraries to develop fresh thinking on how
these volunteers can play the fullest part in a library service fit for
the 21st

noble Lord would expect my reply to look to the Government’s
response to the report of the Culture, Media and Sport Select
Committee. I remind your Lordships that the Government have transferred
responsibility for supporting and developing English libraries to Arts
Council England specifically so that libraries are more closely
associated with cultural institutions. We have worked with Arts Council
England to establish £6 million of funding to encourage cultural
activities in libraries, and continue to fund the Reading Agency and
Booktrust, two charities that undertake a great deal of work about
which I will speak more fully.</hs_para>

with Arts Council England and the Department for Education to pilot
automatic library memberships for children and young people, to

also important. We are piloting different approaches, in both the
previous academic year and this, to test the most effective ways of
supporting children and their families to use libraries and read more
widely. We are also co-ordinating and working with Arts Council England

of the problems. Launching an independent review of e-lending in
libraries is also a factor. I was particularly struck, having been to a
number of libraries, by the increasing number—from a small

feature of the future.</hs_para>

us the task of discussing particularly the contribution and importance
of voluntary staff in the public library system. This is fully
recognised by the Government and other stakeholders. I have read the

the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Warwick of Undercliffe, stated, every local authority in England
is required to provide a “comprehensive and efficient”
library service under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964. Public
libraries are run by local authorities, which receive their funding
from three main sources: grants from central government, council tax,
and other locally generated fees and charges for services. It is for
individual local authorities to determine how best to
provide that public library service to their local community
within available resources, including the use and role of
volunteers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000129">Having
sensed some concern in what the noble Lord said, I will say
straightaway that professional librarians are at the core of any local
authority-run public library service. These highly qualified and
skilled people play a key role in delivering the public library service
to the community, including literacy and information services, as well
as providing support and information for small businesses and homework
classes for children who need extra support outside school hours. Those
are obviously key examples that highlight why professional librarians
are very important and, indeed, essential to the library
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000130">The
origins of the public library service date back more than 150 years,
and volunteers have been a feature of most library services for
decades. There is nothing new in that, whether it is local volunteers
running educational activities within a library, a “Friends
of” group raising funds for new projects or a library run by the
community. The involvement of volunteers in library services is not
new, but their role and numbers have changed over time as library
services have responded to many drivers of
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000131">Those
drivers include—I do not hide the fact—financial
challenges, which no one can ignore, as well as the Government’s
localism agenda, which has prompted local authorities to look afresh at
the public library service they provide and at what role communities
might be able to play. In recent years, library service reviews have
been undertaken by many local authorities, which have resulted in a
reshaping of library services with significantly more community
involvement and a subsequent increase in the number of volunteers. The
growth in numbers is reflected in the annual survey of public libraries
conducted by CIPFA for 2011-12. The 
<?notus-xml column=575?>survey indicates that more than 22,000 volunteers were involved in
England’s 3,243 public libraries, an 88% increase since
2006-07.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000132">The
role of volunteers may vary in each local authority. In some community
libraries, volunteers provide support to local authority professional
staff. In others, the community library is completely run by volunteers
or may be fully funded by the council but delivered by a
not-for-private-profit community or social enterprise or mutual
organisation. Roles traditionally undertaken by volunteers that may add
value to library services are numerous. The noble Baroness, Lady
Hollins, raised a number of examples, and I will mention some. There
are the “Read to Me” volunteers, who provide reading
services, often to the infirm, visually impaired and physically
disabled. There are children and young persons volunteers. While
researching for this debate, I was particularly struck by the number of
young people who wish to help and volunteer in their local libraries.
That, I hope, will encourage many to go on and become professional
librarians. Those young people assist library staff and promote reading
to younger children. Then there are volunteers who organise extra
activities for all age groups and assist new and unconfident internet
users with online resources. I experienced that myself in the Diss
local library. I pleaded ignorance as to how this worked and was very
quickly gathered up and given some very important instruction. Finally,
there are home book volunteers delivering books to housebound
readers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:23:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000133">Noble
Lords can see that volunteers help in many ways and add value, working
with professionals in so many places. More recently, there has been a
notable growth in public libraries that are either community-managed or
community-supported. A community-managed library is largely delivered
by the community. It rarely has paid staff but often has some form of
ongoing local authority support and can be part of the
public library network. A community-supported library is led and funded
by the local authority, and its paid professional staff are supported
by volunteers. There is a place for both in our communities, although
the Government continue to believe very strongly in the importance of
professional
librarians<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:24:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000134">Some
library authorities have embedded community libraries as a core part of
their service. Indeed, in Buckinghamshire, the 14 community-managed
libraries are a significant part of the statutory network of
34 public libraries across the county. Based on some
discussions with residents in Buckinghamshire, I am assured that those
community-managed libraries are providing a very strong service to
their local
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000135">Research
undertaken by Arts Council England in July 2012 indicated that the
number of operating community libraries was 178, with the number rising
to more than 250 by the end of the year. One such example is the
library service in Croxteth, Liverpool, which was taken over by the Alt
Valley Community Trust. It receives funding from the local
authority.</hs_para>

libraries are changing and innovation is going to be extremely
important as new technologies come forward. I want particularly to
refer to the Summer Reading Challenge. The Reading 
<?notus-xml column=576?>Agency runs this annual programme to encourage children aged four to 11
to read six books during the long summer holiday. Last year, it saw 98%
of libraries involved, with 780,000 children participating. Moreover,
some 4,382 young volunteers were involved in and supported the Summer
Reading Challenge. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, raised the issue
of literacy rates. The promotion of a love of books from the earliest
age is essential to a child’s life, and I think that the success
of the Summer Reading Challenge has been immense.</hs_para>

should applaud volunteers for giving up their time freely and for their
dedication and support, and I hope very much that they in turn derive
satisfaction from all that they are doing. There are more than 3,200
libraries in England, and the Government invested £820 million
in 2011-12. Libraries remain very popular, and three-quarters of all
children visit a library. There are many strong links between schools
and libraries, and local authorities continue to invest significantly
in public libraries. These include facilities in Birmingham and The
Hive in Worcester, as well as community-run libraries such as Wilsden
library in Bradford. It is a service that remains hugely important to
so many, it is a part of the fabric of our society and the communities
within it, and it is down to the dedicated professionals and volunteers
to whom we owe so
much.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_29_PT_1/F41B9EC74FCB4475122DDB2956F74509DAAA9580" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 October 2013">Tuesday,

in the Middle East since the start of the Arab spring have been a
challenge not only to those living in the region but to all of us.
Many, myself included, have viewed the series of uprisings which
started in Tunisia through the lense of our experience of the Cold War.
We wrongly assumed then that the fall of the Berlin Wall would usher in
an era of tolerance and political pluralism throughout Europe. The
reality was very different. Released from the uniformity of
authoritarian rule, the former states of the USSR struggled with weak
Governments to meet the diverse and competing aspirations of all their
people. Often, as in the case of Balkans, those struggles turned
horribly violent, with religion politicised as a marker of identity. Of
course, the lessons of our own European history are seminal when trying
to understand  
<?notus-xml column=577?>the transformations shaping the Middle East today. Revolutions are never
simple and straightforward affairs. The Reign of Terror and the
Vendée in France at the end of the 18th century were perhaps the
beginning in our own modern
era.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000141">Revolutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:30:22"></hs_TimeCode>

cannot expect the Arab spring to be any shorter lived or less
traumatic. These societies are grappling with fundamental questions
about identity, how they should be organised, the relationship between
what we would call church and state, and about the rights of
individuals and minorities. They are attempting to face their past even
as they negotiate their
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000142">How<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:30:51"></hs_TimeCode>
should the international community respond? Perhaps two fairly obvious
words are wisdom and patience, with a focus on core values and some
kind of shared moral purpose. Getting the policy right is not an easy
task; it has certainly been made harder by the complicity of some
Governments in the past in their support of authoritarian regimes. At
times, our leverage seems slight. But a key point which needs
emphasising time and again is that legitimate government can be based
only on consent. There may be many ways to achieve and measure such
consent, and while, as we have seen in Egypt, the ballot box is an
important part of any democratic system, it is clearly not the end of
the
story.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000143">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:31:54"></hs_TimeCode>
is easy for nations such as our own to judge on the basis of our
history and tradition. Core values and morality have been hammered out
over centuries. Increasingly these have given to our society a security
which honours the rights of minorities. Indeed, that very security,
produced by an assumption of core values, allows us the sense of
freedom to allow those minorities to prosper. In this context, the
freedom of religion and belief is a primary barometer of the social
health of a nation. States that respect this freedom are more likely to
respect other crucial freedoms, particularly because an
individual’s sense of his or her identity is generally
fundamentally driven by their beliefs and religion, if they have
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:32:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000144">Against<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:33:17"></hs_TimeCode>
this standard, the record in Arab spring countries to date is all too
often weak and troubling, even in those countries that can claim to
have made some kind of transition from the oppressive regimes of the
past. As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:33:49"></hs_TimeCode> just
one more human being, I am concerned about the fate of all minorities
in the Middle East, religious or otherwise. As a bishop, I am
understandably concerned by what is happening to the Arab Christians.
My time with Robert Runcie, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, when I
worked as his international affairs person in the early 1990s made me
realise how little the story of Arab Christians is understood in the
West.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102978000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000145">They<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:34:37"></hs_TimeCode>
have a claim to be seen as the oldest of Christian communities. The
Assyrian Christians in Iraq, the Orthodox Christians and Melkites in
Syria, the Armenians in Iran and the Coptic community in Egypt, not to
mention the Arab Christians in Palestine, all fall into this historic
background<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:29:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:33:28"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:34:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
They can easily find themselves caught between conflicted forces. In
Egypt, Coptic Christians are targeted for the part they 
<?notus-xml column=578?>played in the overthrow of President Morsi and the subsequent return to
quasi-authoritarian rule. In Syria, churches are politically targeted,
just as they were in Iraq at the time of the fall of Saddam Hussein,
having been seen in the past as supporting a brutally repressive
regime. Either way, the result is the same. In Israel, Arab Christians
are fleeing their ancestral land and homes. Many of your Lordships will
know the statistics, and the numbers seem to increase as the weeks,
months and years go by. Alongside the events in Syria, Iraq and Egypt,
it is a human tragedy of historic
proportions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000146">In
many ways, I fear that this vulnerability is a reflection of a wider
societal insecurity, as I have already hinted. How can we assist?
States need to feel comfortable and confident enough in their own
skins, as one might put it, to uphold their core values for all
citizens regardless of religious or non-religious background. Even in
our own nation, it can sometimes appear to be a fragile commodity but
we have the comfort of two centuries’ experience of relative
tolerance. If freedom of religion is in many ways the fundamental right
upon which all other rights turn, it is important for our and other
Governments to remain actively engaged over the long term, pressing for
the rights of all religious minority communities. At their best, such
nations can offer something of their own experience of tolerance and
freedom—of security in their own core values—with the
ability to be more generous to
minorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000147">On

concluding, I merely note that we need to be aware of a growing sense
of Middle East fatigue that might lead to international disengagement.
As a country, we should never forget our own deep involvement in
setting the boundaries and establishing the states that are now
struggling to cope with these complex problems. Alongside that, as a
member of the United Nations Security Council, our responsibility is to
foster international peace and security. The longer these
problems linger, the greater the risk of further
destabilisation—in Jordan, Lebanon and even Saudi Arabia. I

democratic Governments believing in the rule of law should have the
presence of mind to raise the matter whenever basic human rights are
flagrantly abused, contrary to the terms of Article 18 of the UN

vigorously condemned. I therefore ask the Minister to endorse the
message given by the previous Archbishop of Canterbury that we are not
seeking special treatment for any one denomination but merely the
application of the rule of law for all. By inference that necessarily
means that religious minorities should be protected. If a country
cannot conform with Article 18 of the UN charter, the matter should be
raised with the country concerned so that rational discussion can take
place and the problem be rectified, if at all possible. I believe that
the United Kingdom has a good record but it would not be acceptable for
other democratic Governments to behave like ostriches and bury their

2006. This tempo is increasing. Yes, Christians joined with Muslims in

Falkner of Margravine (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, want to
thank the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Wakefield for securing
this debate. There are some points that are worth making about the Arab
spring in general. The uprisings were not motivated by religious
sentiment or indeed through any kind of ideology per se. The report of
the Foreign Affairs Committee in the other place on the British Foreign
Office’s responses to the Arab spring showed clearly that what
the protests did was to unite discontented citizens from across the
political spectrum and the economic, class and religious divides,
simply in opposition to the long-standing authoritarian regimes that
existed in those countries. Irrespective of the subsequent popularity
of Islamist parties, as we saw, Islamism was not what those overthrows
of government were
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000166">There
was chronic economic underperformance across the region. The United
Nations Development Committee reports of 2001, 2002 and, I think, 2004
showed that demographic expansion in the late 1970s has resulted in 60%
of the population now being under 25 years of age. High unemployment,
rising food prices and a widening inequality with endemic corruption,
particularly among the elites of the countries, meant that it was
inevitable that any kind of trigger could well result in mass
uprisings. It was also predictable that the only organised groups that
would have any credibility in protesting against the regimes were those
who had made personal sacrifices in the past. They were the Islamists,
whether the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt or the Shia minority in Bahrain
and so on. These were people who had credibility because they had
worked in towns and villages with the people who had had none of the
privileges of the elites that were rising up over the period. As we
know, they were elected with great popular support.</hs_para>

Turkey with its secularist constitution, there is no tradition in these
countries of choosing between different ideologies. The choices are
mainly between clan, communal and religious loyalties. Illiteracy among
these populations is sometimes as high as 50%. Figures recently
released for Egypt indicate that in the rural areas, illiteracy is
running as high as 60% or 70%. Half the electorate, notably women, are
either excluded or told who to vote for. The only unifying factor
across a country as diverse as Egypt or Syria is Islam or variants of
it, according to your communal ties.</hs_para>

just like the population as a whole, tend to opt en bloc for the system
that best protects them. While they supported the Arab spring
initially, they have witnessed the impact of political Islam on their
own survival in these countries. I emphasise 
<?notus-xml column=583?>that I am talking about political Islam, with its emphasis on “us

Islam in government—pace Egypt under President
Morsi—finds that it has to overturn the status quo ante: it has
to overturn women’s rights and reform the structures of state;
it has to challenge liberals and secularists, as it has done over the
past 16 months, in order to implement Islamist
constitutional processes and norms; and it sees minorities as easy to

subsequent removal of President Morsi has led to unprecedented
violence. Just a few days ago, as the members of a community prepared
to celebrate a wedding, they sorrowfully returned to their church to
bury four of 
<?notus-xml column=584?>the guests, including two little girls: Mariam Ashraf Seha, aged eight,
and Mariam Nabeel, aged 12. They were shot dead as two men with
automatic weapons opened fire on guests outside the Virgin Mary Church
on the west bank of the Nile. Another 17 people were wounded. The most
senior cleric at Al-Azhar University, the world’s primary seat
of Sunni Islamic learning, described the killings
as,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13102978000287" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000287">“a

November 1938, in an orgy of violence that would become known as
Kristallnacht, Jewish synagogues, homes, hospitals and schools were
ransacked and pillaged. The sledgehammers and petrol left more than
1,000 synagogues burnt and more than 7,000 Jewish shops and
businesses in ruins. The streets were covered in shards of smashed
glass from broken windows. If noble Lords compare pictures of the
charred husk of the Fasanenstrasse Synagogue in Berlin, in 1938, with
those of the blackened walls of Degla’s ruined Virgin Mary
church, taken two months ago in Egypt, they will readily understand why
August 2013 represents Egypt’s Kristallnacht. One can also
compare the terror of 1938 with the fear among Copts as members of
their community have been left dead and others assaulted. Their 118th

practice of religion. It also adopted a transitional article that will
cancel existing restrictions regulating the building of new churches.
All this is very welcome, although there is pressure to restrict this

Parekh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the right reverend Prelate
the Bishop of Wakefield for securing this debate and introducing it
with such wisdom. We need to remember that the Middle Eastern countries
are negotiating several transitions: not just one from authoritarian
regimes to democracy but from a pre-industrial to an industrial
society, from a hierarchical to an egalitarian society and from a
thoroughly and dogmatically religious to a moderately religious or
secular society. The transition to democracy has to be seen in this
wider context. Sometimes democracy gets blamed for things for which it
is not responsible, because it has to pick up the pieces that the other
transitions have
provoked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000181">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:05:09"></hs_TimeCode>
this context, there is one important historical lesson to bear in mind,
which I call the paradox of democracy. Wherever democracy has appeared,
in the first few years you always tend to have this kind of
discrimination against religious or ethnic minorities. I cannot
think of one example to the
contrary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:05:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:05:08"></hs_TimeCode> are two
related reasons for
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:05:02"></hs_TimeCode>. First,
with the rise of democracy, long-suppressed groups that have been
denied their legitimate rights begin to claim them; once they have
claimed them, the majority, which is not in the habit of conceding
them, is forced to grant them, which leads to a certain amount of
resentment.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102978000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000182">However, there is also
a deeper<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:05:24"></hs_TimeCode>
cultural process. When there is democracy, you require a sense of
community, which has to be given an identity and defined in a certain
way. The majority therefore has a tendency to claim the ownership of
the country. I saw that in the case of India, where the Hindus will
say, 
<?notus-xml column=586?>“This is our country, isn’t it?
Muslims are simply here to live on our sufferance”. This happens
in many places, where the majority begins to claim proprietary rights
over a country; when it begins to do that, it defines the identity of
the country in majoritarian or religious terms, with the result that
religious minorities become the first
casualty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000183">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:06:18"></hs_TimeCode>
need to remember the inner dynamics of what goes
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:06:22"></hs_TimeCode>. When
discrimination takes place, as it is taking place in the aftermath of
the Arab spring, it takes place either against other religions or
against sects within one’s own. A classic example of the latter
is what we saw in Bahrain. In 2011, the Government instituted the state
of national safety law, under which the security forces detained and
tortured thousands of Shia protestors. They destroyed Shia mosques and
thousands were dismissed from public and private sector jobs. In Egypt,
it has not taken that kind of form; by and large, it has been directed
against Coptic Christians. Even there, it has been much more muted;
nevertheless, it takes
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:07:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:06:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000184">In
my remaining two minutes, I do not want to detail what goes on in
different countries but to ask what we can do to address the problem.
The first point to bear in mind—and here I introduce a note of
slight disagreement with the right reverend Prelate—is that we
should not single out a particular religious community. When the bishop
said that as a Christian we would expect him to be concerned with
Christians, I thought that, on the contrary, as a Christian I would not
expect you to be concerned with Christians, who take all religious
communities in their stride. I thought that the ecumenical state was
inherent in Christianity. Of course, I understand what the bishop is
saying, but I wanted to emphasise that singling out a particular
religious minority, as we have tended to do, makes it a target in the
eyes of the local community and makes our motives seem
suspicious<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:08:08"></hs_TimeCode>. We
come to be seen not as genuinely concerned with religious minorities
and their freedom but rather with one particular
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:08:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000185">Secondly,
we need to bear in mind that these countries require a sympathetic
understanding. In some cases, minorities may be discriminated against
not because they are religious but because they were in league with the
previous authoritarian regime or with outside powers, or are in command
of resources and therefore resented not as a minority but as a
particular class. Sometimes there are genuinely religious reasons why
this is happening; the important thing therefore is to understand each
situation in its own terms and not simply to
generalise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:08:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000186">The
third important thing to bear in mind is that Governments have limits,
and we should work through NGOs in our own country as well as in the
countries that we are trying to address. It is also important to bear
in mind that religious conflicts by and large are never sui generis;
they are never entirely religious in origin but have political and
economic causes. The best way in which to solve them, as in the case of
Lebanon, is through constitutional mechanisms, such as giving
minorities adequate representation in the institutions of the
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:09:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:09:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000187">Finally,
it is also important that, in so far as religious leaders have an
important say, we find some way in which to get them together
and get them to
talk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:09:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:09:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:08:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:09:34"></hs_TimeCode>. 

<?notus-xml column=587?>I sometimes wonder why the Ditchley Park experiment,
which we have tried in some situations, has not been tried in relation
to foreign countries. I have attended a couple of sessions there with
about 20-odd people from different walks of life who are interested in
a common problem. They stay for three days, work and knock their heads
together and arrive at some kind of mutual understanding. It ought to
be possible to get religious leaders from Middle Eastern countries to
travel to Ditchley Park in Oxfordshire to meditate together on problems
of common interest. All this will work only if our own record is
honourable. By and large, it is, but sometimes it is not. Unless we can
say that we have treated our religious minorities with equality and
justice, be they Muslims or others, we will not be able to lecture
other

Morgan of Ely (Lab):</Member></B> I, too, congratulate the right
reverend Prelate on securing this debate on the situation of religious
minorities in the Middle East and north Africa. Religious persecution
in these areas is not new, but the turmoil and instability that we have
seen recently have certainly exacerbated the problem. The big
difference is that the turmoil and the upheavals have meant that many
of the attacks have gone unpunished, which, of course, fuels extremists
to carry out further atrocities. The good thing is that, although this
persecution has been happening for a long time, the increased focus on
the area means that we are shining a light on this issue, thereby
giving it the attention which it
deserves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000189">Although
I accept the point that the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, made, it is
important to note that 80% of the acts of religious discrimination in
the world today are directed against Christians, according to the
International Society for Human Rights, based in Frankfurt. However, of
course, it is not only Christians who are suffering. The Jews, the
Baha’i, the Yezidis, the Sabeans, the Ahmadias, and others are
all suffering and it is right that we draw attention to the plight of
all of them. In the region, they number about 12 million
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000190">I
would like to start by making it clear that the Labour Party condemns
all instances of violence and discrimination against individuals and
groups because of their faith or belief, irrespective of where this
occurs. The area that we are talking about today is huge and diverse so
it is not possible to give a blanket response on this persecution.
There are some instances in the region where religious persecution is
endorsed and accepted by the relevant Government, while in other
countries religious persecution is frowned upon formally but little is
done by state authorities to castigate those who carry out these
repugnant acts of violence. That, of course, fuels the extremists. It
is imperative that we have the confidence to tackle both these issues,
and that we continue to challenge and confront the authorities in those
countries where we do not think enough is being
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000191">However,
it is also important that we do not fall into the trap of inflaming a
battle of civilisations and religions in the heat of these
exchanges. I do not believe for a moment, as some have claimed, that
there 
<?notus-xml column=588?>is a worldwide war on Christianity. There are more than 2.2 billion
Christians in the world and the idea that this group is facing a
collective siege is a long way from the truth. Moreover, I think that
the kind of talk that we have heard from some members of the Tea Party
tendency in the USA risks doing a disservice to Christians
around the globe who are suffering repression and persecution by
misrepresentating and mischaracterising the real threats that many
Christians face today. This is not a global phenomenon and it is
certainly not a war but it is an increasing problem in the Middle East
and north
Africa.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000192">Many
noble Lords have made the point about the post-war Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of religion as set out in the
United Nations charter is absolutely crucial. However, it is important
to remember that some of the countries in the area have not signed the
charter; what they have signed is the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights
in Islam. That declaration also forbids discrimination on the basis of
religion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000193">I
would like to focus on four specific countries where there is clear
evidence of discrimination against religious minorities. Iran is one of
the countries where there has been a steady increase in cases of
Christian persecution. It is of course a theocratic republic with 98%
of its population being Muslim and the highest number of Shia Muslims
in the world. Under 0.5% of the population is Christian. Many of them
suffer from societal ostracism, and nearly all Christian activity,
including proselytizing and Bible publishing, is illegal. The Iranian
constitution gives nominal protection to members of the Christian,
Jewish and Zoroastrian faiths by recognising them as minority
religions. However, the number of Christians and Christian converts in
Iran who have been arrested or detained has increased significantly
over recent years. Moreover, under Iran’s strict interpretation
of Islam, anyone converting to another religion could face the death
penalty or at least life imprisonment. Other religious minorities such
as the Baha’is do not receive even this slender protection.
Seven members of the Baha’i leadership in Iran have been
sentenced to 20 years in prison. In May this year, four high-level
United Nations human rights experts called on Iran to immediately
release the seven imprisoned Baha’i
leaders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000194">The
situation in Iraq is different as in many instances the state is trying
to do its best to protect Christian and other churches, but they are
being targeted in particular by al-Qaeda extremists. Multiple attacks
by these extremists on St George’s Church in the capital have
prompted the Iraqi Government to set up three checkpoints to protect
it. This demonstrates that the Government appear to be serious about
attempting to uphold their international commitments. However, the
violence targeted against Christians in Baghdad and elsewhere in the
region continues to increase. In the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq
10 years ago, Christians were targeted as an alien minority and accused
of being in league with the West. In October 2010, gunmen attacked the
Syrian Catholic cathedral in Baghdad, killing 56 worshippers. The
number of Christians in the country has reduced from 1.5 million to
around 200,000 today. It is something that we need to take
seriously.</hs_para>

indispensable element of any society. I join the right reverend Prelate
in the thanks that he extended to my noble friend Lady Warsi in her
continuing work, and of course the excellent work of my right
honourable friend Alistair Burt.</hs_para>

and belief, let me be clear that the Government condemn all instances
of violence and discrimination against individuals or groups because of
their faith, regardless of the faith concerned. Several noble Lords
have rightly pointed to Article 18. We base our position on Article 18
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13102978000275" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000275">“Everyone

assure all noble Lords that the Government are fully committed to
protecting this precious right. Indeed, the promotion of human rights,
including religious freedom, is an important part of British foreign
policy. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s embassies and high
commissions have a responsibility to monitor and raise human rights in
their host countries, and they do. Government Ministers and FCO staff
raise concerns with host Governments regularly. We take action on
individual cases and lobby against discriminatory practices and for
such laws of discrimination to be changed.</hs_parafo>

with leaders of different religious minorities from across the world,
UK faith groups and civil society organisations to understand their
concerns. Several noble Lords mentioned the Baha’i community; I
have also recently met members of the Baha’i community and will
come on to talk about Iran, where I know that that community is 
<?notus-xml column=590?>particularly persecuted. We work with all these groups to promote the
universal commitment to religious freedom. I assure my noble friend
Lord Selkirk that Her Majesty’s Government will continue to
encourage religious leaders to defend publicly the religious freedom of
all groups and to promote tolerance and respect between all faiths. As
the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, said in eloquently reminding us of the
words of President Roosevelt, the rule of law should prevail.</hs_para>

working with the international community to combat religious
intolerance and protect human rights. This includes working with Canada
to hold an international conference on this subject at the end of 2012.
We also support the work of the UN special rapporteur on the freedom of
religion or belief and held talks with him at the FCO earlier this

discussion focused on international structures in place to combat

touched upon a number of specific concerns about the Middle East. The
issue across the region is more poignant because we are
discussing the birthplace of Christianity, Islam and Judaism.
It is a region also particularly precious to many other religious
beliefs. The Government recognise that the period since the Arab spring
has been difficult for many religious minorities across the Middle East
and north Africa. It is a tragedy that so many religious communities
across that region are now suffering so badly—and, indeed, that
some countries risk seeing the disappearance altogether of some
communities which have existed there for centuries. The causes are
complex. The key issue is how we and the international community work
with the region to address these
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:23:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Syria is particularly in our minds. Life in Syria for Christians and
other minority communities is extremely difficult. We have serious
concerns about rising sectarian tensions and believe that President
Assad’s actions include an attempt to stir up tensions in his
efforts to hold on to power. Non-Alawite minorities, including
Christian communities, are in a vulnerable position, being neither
Sunni like the majority of the opposition, nor Alawite like the core of
the regime. They are also vulnerable because of the relatively small
size of their communities and their geographic
dispersal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:24:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Kurds. Three Christians have positions of leadership within the

<?notus-xml column=591?>We are therefore working hard together with the

will turn to some of the questions raised during the debate. My noble
friend Lord Selkirk talked of endorsing the message of Aid to the
Church in Need, to repeat the report of the persecuted and forgotten. I
agree that we are not seeking special treatment for any particular
minority. We raise religious freedom issues whatever and wherever they
occur. For example, we make use of the UN Human Rights Council’s
universal periodic review process to raise these particular
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:25:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Alton of Liverpool, who, perhaps I may say at this juncture, has done

welcome the report of the APPG on international religious freedom and
its particular focus on Article 18. I believe that my noble
friend Lady Warsi met members of the APPG only last week for a very
productive discussion. I can assure the noble Lord that all our work is
framed on the full definition of the right to freedom of religion or

Tahrir Square is a memory, perhaps, in our minds now. The waving flags
have long faded and the Coptic Church in Egypt has been experiencing
many challenges since the Arab spring. Pressures and attacks have
increased since 2011, but following the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak
there have been a number of reprehensible incidents—for example,
we have just had the second anniversary of the Maspero massacre, in
which 28 Coptic Christians taking part in the demonstration were
killed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:26:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102978000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-gc0001.htm#13102978000210">Following
the military intervention to remove Mohamed Morsi on 3 July, there has
also been a rise in the number of violent sectarian attacks. Churches,
homes, businesses and individuals have been attacked and the Foreign
Secretary has publicly condemned such attacks and urged an inclusive
political dialogue. Most recently, the FCO Minister for the Middle East
and North Africa, Hugh Robertson, condemned the killing of four guests
at a Coptic Christian wedding on 20 October. The noble Lord, Lord
Alton, also raised this

to points raised by my noble friend Lady Falkner, it is clear in
contact with Egyptian authorities that the constitution should uphold
the human rights of all including women and all religious minorities.
We frequently raise these matters with the human rights issues under
Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood rule. My noble friend mentioned
political Islam. It is not for Her Majesty’s Government to
indulge in how people should vote in other countries, but perhaps if I
could reflect as a Muslim and suggest to many across
the Islamic world that, if they looked at early
Islam and issues such as the Medina agreement, they might find there
the solution to some of their
troubles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:28:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to Iran briefly, we are deeply concerned about the situation for
religious minorities in the countries of the region. In Iran, the
Bah’ais, in particular, are not just under mounting pressure,
they have been clearly persecuted and detained for a long period of
time. According to the Bah’ai international community, currently
more than 100 Bah’ais remain in detention in Iran. The noble
Baroness, Lady Morgan, also raised this point. On 23 September, the
Foreign Secretary met the Iranian Foreign Minister in the margins of

Department consulted this summer in England, and in Wales on behalf of
the Welsh Government, on possible increases to the maximum penalties
for aggravated offences under section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.
These relate to a dog being dangerously out of control and a dog
killing or injuring a person or an assistance
dog.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102967000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-wms0001.htm#13102967000016">We
undertook a short, online survey of people’s views on options
for an increase in maximum penalties which currently stand at two
years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine for aggravated
offences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102967000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-wms0001.htm#13102967000017">3,180
people and organisations completed the online survey and a number of
organisations sent written representations. In summary, some 91% of
respondents considered that maximum penalties should be increased. 83%
thought there should be an increase for injury to an assistance dog or
a person, 69% for the death of an assistance dog, and 76% for the death
of a
person.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102967000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-wms0001.htm#13102967000018">In
coming to a decision on new maximum penalties for dog attacks, we have
taken into account the responses to the consultation and the need for
maximum penalties to be proportionate to the offence. We have also
compared the current maximum penalty with the maximum penalties for
other offences. The maximum penalty of causing death by dangerous
driving is 14 years’ imprisonment 
<?notus-xml column=123?>and the maximum penalty for causing actual bodily
harm is 5 years’ imprisonment. Anyone who deliberately sets
their dog on a person and kills them – in effect using their dog
as a weapon – could be charged with murder or manslaughter,
which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Government
proposes, therefore, to increase the maximum penalties for aggravated
offences under section 3 of the 1991 Act in England and Wales
to:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>14 years’ imprisonment if a person
dies as a result of a dog attack,</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>5

increase in maximum penalty for a dog attack on an assistance dog, such
as a guide dog for the blind, reflects the devastating effect such an
attack has on the assisted person. As now, each of these offences could
also be punishable by an unlimited fine instead of, or in addition to,
imprisonment. An amendment to the 1991 Act to effect these changes will
be tabled for consideration during Lords Committee Stage of the
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill.</hs_para>

consultation, the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill
(clauses 98 and 99) includes amendments extending the Dangerous Dogs
Act 1991 to private property and provisions that extend the offence of
allowing a dog to be dangerously out of control to all places,
including people’s homes. This will give protection to family
members, friends and visitors including postal workers, nurses, utility
workers and other professionals who visit homes as part of their job.
At the same time, there will be an exemption from prosecution for
householders whose dogs attack trespassers in or entering the home.

includes new measures for local authorities and the police to take
action before a dog attack occurs. These measures can require dog
owners to take any reasonable steps to address their own or their
dog’s behaviour, including, but not limited to: attending dog
training classes, requiring the dog to be on a lead in public,
repairing fencing to their property to prevent the dog escaping, and
even requiring the dog to be neutered. These measures supplement the

and we will seek to guarantee this through
legislation.</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• The
process through which we expect to set the Roads Investment Strategy
(RIS), which will contain a clear performance specification, a
guaranteed statement of available funding and a defined funding and
investment programme. This will make the company more transparent, and
let road users and the public hold it to account for what it has
promised to deliver. It will also give confidence to suppliers over
investment plans and future funding levels, enabling them to plan
ahead, drive down costs and recruit and train the workers needed to
deliver the increase in road projects over the coming
years.</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>•
Establishing a road user watchdog and efficiency monitor, using
existing organisations such as Passenger Focus and the Office of Rail
Regulation to make use of existing experience and avoid creating
unnecessary new bodies. Together, these functions will ensure that the
interests of road users are well-represented and given a strong voice
in influencing what the company delivers, and that the company’s
performance is subject to effective independent scrutiny and
challenge.</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>•
Transferring the necessary powers and duties to the company in order
for it to effectively operate, manage and improve the strategic road
network with day-to-day operational freedom and flexibility, by
designating the company as the statutory “highways
authority” and adjusting other legislation where necessary. This
includes ensuring that the company will continue to work in partnership
with local authorities, emergency services and others bodies, and
safeguarding current protections regarding environmental and safety
standards.</hs_WAIndent><hs_para UID="13102967000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131029-wms0001.htm#13102967000075">The

modelling analysis does suggest net benefits from lower levels of
warming but others, such as Professor Nordhaus’ and Dr Chris
Hope’s respective models, suggest net economic costs even for
moderate levels of warming. These modelling frameworks inherently
require vast simplifications of the climate system and associated

global greenhouse gas emissions, the world is likely to be on course

recognised method of calculating toilet provision. The Workplace
(Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 stipulate the minimum
statutory requirements for how many toilets should be made available in
a workplace. The British Standards Institution also produces different
pieces of guidance on toilet provision, which vary depending on
the use of the premises. The House of Lords part of the Parliamentary
Estate has a range of uses and could be classified as providing
a variety of accommodation, including office accommodation, restaurant
and banqueting facilities, a tourist attraction and an event venue.

extremely difficult to calculate accurately the toilet provision just
for Members in particular areas. On a whole House basis (excluding
toilets and people in the House of Commons), the Parliamentary Estates
Directorate has calculated that the House of Lords contains enough
toilets for Members and staff (including the Members recently
introduced into the House) in a variety of scenarios, according to both
the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 and the
British Standards Institution standards. However, given that the number
of Members, staff and visitors in the House fluctuates greatly from day
