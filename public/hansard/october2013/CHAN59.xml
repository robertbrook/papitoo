under the previous Government planning was something that seemed to be

Tiffey valley, which South Norfolk district council, with a five-year
land supply, is defending. What assurance can my hon. Friend give me

amount of effort, managed to scrap the regional strategies that the
previous Government used to impose entirely unwanted plans on local
communities. The best way to ensure that local decisions will be
supported and will stick is for local authorities to have a clear plan
which sets out how they will meet their objectively assessed needs.
That means that they can pick and choose where and how those needs will
be
met.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000035"><Member ContinuationText="Ann Coffey" PimsId="2661" UID="1310215000438" xid="123" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000438"><B>Ann
Coffey</B> (Stockport) (Lab):</Member> Planning guidance about a
material change of use from a residential house to a children’s
home necessitating a planning application is unclear. Last July, in
response to my Adjournment debate, the then Under-Secretary of State,
Department for Communities and Local Government, and now the
Comptroller of Her Majesty’s Household, the right hon. Member
for Bath (Mr Foster), said that he would continue to keep under review
the planning guidance in relation to that. Has there been any progress?
As the Minister will appreciate, many local people would welcome the
opportunity to contribute to a planning application because of the
safeguarding issues surrounding children.</hs_Para>

whose local plans have been found wanting find themselves under siege
from opportunistic developers. The result is planning applications in
places such as Evercreech which are the reverse of what local people
want. Can the Minister say that emerging local plans will have material
impact on planning decisions, and can he make sure that local

showed me a map revealing that the 2011 Act had been incredibly
popular, with more than 50 assets so far having been registered as

through neighbourhood plans, local communities should be able to
identify areas for special protection and use a local neighbourhood

local authorities have a responsibility. When my own local authority
introduced half an hour free parking throughout the borough, it made an
enormous difference. Expensive parking is cutting off the nose to spite

it becomes and the better it is and the more people feel it is

Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Mr Edward
Davey):</Member></B> I would like to make a statement on the
UK’s nuclear energy programme. I am pleased to inform the House
that the Government and EDF have reached broad commercial agreement on
the key terms of a proposed investment contract for a new nuclear power
station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. This paves the way for the
construction of Hinkley Point C—the first nuclear power station
in the UK for a
generation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:33:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000197">Nuclear
power has been part of Britain’s energy mix since the 1950s,
responsible at points for as much as a quarter of our electricity, but
since Sizewell B connected to the grid in 1995, no new nuclear power
stations have been commissioned. Eight of the nine operational nuclear
power stations in the UK will reach the end of their planned life in
the next decade. So the agreement today is a demonstration of the
Government’s commitment to a new fleet of nuclear power stations
to replace those due to close and to protect Britain’s future
energy
security.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000198">A
contract for Hinkley Point C under the key terms set out today would
provide significant benefits for the UK, including up to 25,000 jobs
for skilled workers over the course of construction and 900 long-term
jobs during the 60-year lifespan of the plant; and a
£16 billion injection into the economy, with the
potential for British firms to get the majority of the work, and over
£4.5 billion paid in corporation tax. EDF estimates
that £100 million will go into the local economy every year
during peak
construction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000199">Hinkley<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:34:33"></hs_TimeCode>
Point C would supply a stable source of low-carbon, climate-friendly
power to nearly 6 million homes—nearly twice the number of homes
in London—and would supply 7% of the United Kingdom’s
electricity by 2025. It would reduce emissions by the equivalent of
about 5% of the UK’s annual carbon dioxide emissions from energy
supply compared with unabated gas-fired generation. It would increase
energy security and resilience from a safe, reliable, home-grown source
of electricity, reducing electricity bills by about 10% compared with a
non-nuclear future. With clean-up costs included from the outset, we
would be avoiding the mistakes of the past. This is good news for jobs,
good news for the economy, good news for bill-payers, good news for
energy security, and good news for the
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000200">This
announcement also represents a significant vote of confidence in the
Government’s reforms to the electricity market. We are creating
one of the most attractive electricity investment markets in the world,

I go into the details of the terms of the agreement, I want to put on
record my gratitude to all who have worked so hard to bring us to this
point, in EDF and in the Government, including those in my Department.
I specifically thank Lord Deighton and his team for the strong
contribution that they have made supporting the DECC negotiating team.
I believe that, working together, we have agreed the basis of an
arrangement that would provide a good deal for UK consumers. It would
meet the requirement for value for 
<?notus-xml column=24?>money, accord with our “no public subsidy” policy, and
provide an attractive proposition for EDF and its investors, offering a
reasonable rate of return for the risks that they are
taking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:36:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000202">Let
me set out the key terms on which broad commercial agreement has been
reached. Hinkley Point C would be the first nuclear power station to be
built under the new system of contracts for difference that is being
introduced by the Energy Bill. CfDs provide low-carbon energy suppliers
with predictable future revenues, making it easier and cheaper to
secure development investment and finance while protecting consumers
should prices rise. The duration of the payments under the CfD for
Hinkley Point C would be 35 years, which is about 60% of the 60-year
operating life of the plant. That is proportionally similar to the
length of the CfDs that are being offered to most renewable
technologies.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1310215000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000203"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:37:36"></hs_TimeCode>Under
CfDs, low-carbon generators receive a stable price for the electricity
that they sell, which is known as the strike price. We have agreed a
strike price of £89.50 per megawatt-hour, fully
indexed to the consumer prices index. Hinkley Point C will be the first
of the new European pressurised reactors in the United Kingdom. This
strike price benefits from an upfront reduction of £3 per
megawatt-hour, on the basis that EDF’s subsidiary NNB Generation
Company Ltd would share the “first of kind” costs of the
European pressurised reactors on the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C
sites.If a final investment decision on Sizewell C were not made, the
strike price for Hinkley would be
£92.50<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:38:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000204">An
agreement on those terms meets the Government’s value for money
requirement. Hinkley Point C would compete with other low-carbon
technologies, including onshore wind—the cheapest large-scale
renewable—and with new unabated gas plant, including carbon
costs, that commission in the same time
frame.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000205">Other<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:38:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:38:46"></hs_TimeCode>
terms on which broad commercial agreement has been reached provide a
series of protections for both sides that together represent an
appropriate allocation of risks, including gain share arrangements
whereby, if the developer achieves savings during construction or
through refinancing or equity sales, the strike price will be reduced;
operational cost review arrangements, including reviews after 15 and 25
years to reassess operating costs and adjust the strike price in either
direction if necessary; “change in law” arrangements
whereby the strike price would be adjusted to reflect cost changes
arising from certain changes in law; and compensation arrangements in
the event of Hinkley Point C’s being shut down as a result of a
political decision, rather than a decision on, for instance, safety
grounds.</hs_Para>

and for the first time ever, to deal with the clean-up costs of new
nuclear, developers will be required to put money aside in a protected
clean-up fund to pay for eventual decommissioning and a share of the
waste management costs. This is anticipated to account for around
£2 of the strike price. The Funded Decommissioning Programme
would need to be approved by the Secretary of State before construction
starts. All the terms are subject to contract and form the basis for
further negotiation.
EDF<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:40:20"></hs_TimeCode> and Her
Majesty’s Treasury will continue discussion regarding the terms
of a potential UK guarantee. Ultimately, an investment contract would
only be offered to NNBG if we consider the contract to be value for
money and in line with our no public subsidy policy. Any investment
contract would also be conditional on 
<?notus-xml column=25?>any required state aid clearance being obtained, and on Royal Assent of
the Energy Bill. If agreed, the contract would be laid before
Parliament in accordance with the Bill.</hs_Para>

has announced today the intent of two Chinese companies, CGN and CNNC,
to invest in Hinkley Point C as minority shareholders. This follows the
signing last week of a memorandum of understanding on civil nuclear
co-operation between the UK and Chinese Governments. The UK and China
have a long-standing bilateral agreement to co-operate on the peaceful
uses of nuclear power. Chinese companies have an established track
record in delivering safe nuclear power over the past 30 years. Any
company getting involved in the UK’s nuclear power industry does
so in accordance with the most stringent regulations in the world and,
on this basis, we welcome companies that can demonstrate the capability
to contribute to safe nuclear power generation in the

conclusion, I respect those who have long been opposed to nuclear
technology on principle. As the record shows, I personally have had my
concerns in the past, and so has my party, but I am
satisfied—and I am sure Opposition Members who have had their
concerns in the past are satisfied—that the safety and legacy
issues relating to the new nuclear power programme are manageable,
particularly with the protected clean-up fund.</hs_Para>

pay over the odds for new
nuclear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:42:42"></hs_TimeCode>. The
price agreed for the electricity is competitive with the projected
costs for other plants commissioning in the 2020s, not just with other
low-carbon alternatives, but also with unabated gas. As set out to
Parliament in October 2010 and again in February this year, new nuclear
will receive no support unless similar support is also made available
more widely to other
technologies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:43:09"></hs_TimeCode>.

This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:43:38"></hs_TimeCode> agreement

thank the Secretary of State for giving me early notice of his
statement and congratulate him on making it back from Hinkley this
morning looking slightly less damp and dishevelled than he did earlier.
At the outset, let me make it clear that we support new nuclear power
in Britain as part of a balanced, diverse and lower-carbon energy mix.
Of course, we will look in detail at the agreement, and those aspects
of the agreement yet to be concluded, but in principle we believe that
nuclear power is safe, and that it contributes to our energy security,
reduces our carbon emissions and makes us less vulnerable to the
vagaries of wholesale gas
prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000214">Today,
I want to ask the Secretary of State about three aspects of his
statement, the first of which is the very important one of value for
money. He has announced a strike price of £92.50, of which
£3 will be shared as “first-of-a-kind” costs with
Sizewell C, should that development go ahead. Can he explain how that
figure was arrived at, and why he believes it represents good value for
money for consumers? Will he also confirm that any change to an
investment contract will be published, and that any change which
results in an increase in cost to consumers in the view of the panel of
independent experts will be classed as a “varied investment
contract” and therefore laid before Parliament for debate? EDF
has also said that its £16 billion budget included a contingency
fund. If that fund is not used, or if costs underrun, what mechanism
will there be to ensure that compensation goes to consumers, rather
than to the general Treasury
pot?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000215">Secondly,
let me turn to the impact of the announcement on our environment, on
the local community and for the economy. The Secretary of State will be
aware that the Energy Act 2008, passed by the last Labour Government,
means that before consents for new nuclear power stations are granted,
the Government have to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist,
or will exist, to manage and dispose of the waste they will produce. In
January, although Copeland and Allerdale borough councils were in
favour, Cumbria county council voted to withdraw from the process to
find a host community for an underground radioactive waste disposal
facility. I understand that his Department has started a new
consultation exercise to find a host site, so is he satisfied that the
arrangements to manage and dispose of the waste produced at Hinkley
Point C are in
place?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000216">There
is also agreement across the House that communities that host
nationally significant infrastructure should be compensated. In July,
the Government announced a package of community benefits, but those
come into force only when the plant is operational and not during the
construction phase, when disruption is likely to be greatest. What
consideration has the Secretary of State given to the Select
Committee’s recommendation, which I know is shared by Sedgemoor
district council, to extend community benefit to the construction
period?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000217">The
Secretary of State also mentioned the wider economic benefits of the
investment. We share his desire that today’s announcement will
help to create a strong British supply chain and secure highly skilled
engineering, construction and operating jobs. Last week, the Government
signed a memorandum of understanding allowing Chinese 
<?notus-xml column=27?>companies to take a minority stake in nuclear developments in Britain.
Given the nuclear expertise that exists in this country, can the
Secretary of State tell the House what provisions were made to allow
British firms to advise on and be involved in nuclear build in
China?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000218">Thirdly,
we hope that today’s announcement is the first in a series of
new nuclear projects in Britain, so let me finish on the lessons of
these negotiations and today’s agreement. Today’s
announcement is subject to EU state aid approval, so will the Secretary
of State tell the House whether he has received any indication from the
Commission about whether approval is likely to be granted and in what
time scale? What are the Government doing to ensure that other
potential nuclear sites are developed? Does he also accept that
today’s agreement shows that long-term certainty is what really
matters to unlock the investment we need, not allowing overcharging to
continue now? The Government say that they cannot freeze electricity
prices for 20 months, but he has just set them for 35 years for
companies producing nuclear power. So does he therefore further accept
that when on 24 September he said that our 20-month price freeze
proposal would put “investment in doubt”, today’s
announcement shows him to have been completely
wrong?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000219">Finally,
as this comes on the same day as npower became the third big energy
company to announce another price rise, and in light of the potential
costs of this agreement, does the Secretary of State now accept that it
is all the more crucial that we reform the retail energy market so that
it is clear, fair and transparent, and so that consumers can have
confidence that prices as well as investments provide value for what
is, after all, their
money?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000220"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Davey" PimsId="2851" UID="1310215000594" xid="154" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0001.htm#1310215000594">Mr

welcome the support of the hon. Gentleman and of the Labour party. Let
me go through his questions. He asked first about value for money and
how the figure was arrived at. We have had a huge amount of
negotiations. The hon. Gentleman will have noticed that many people
thought that we would end up with £100, £97 or £95
per megawatt-hour. We have done a lot better than that—we have
got the figure under £90, and I do not think that anyone thought
that we would do that. We have got a good figure through hard, tough
negotiations.</hs_Para>

for the hon. Gentleman’s question about value for money tests,
he will know that as we have said on the record we have compared what
we have achieved with the price of low-carbon generation and gas plus
the carbon price. We believe that we will be able to show, both now and
when we sign the final investment contract, that we have met that test.
He asked whether any changes in the future would be published and I am
sure that that will happen. It is very important that Parliament is
kept abreast of those big changes.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if the construction costs,
including the contingency fund, were not used. If EDF and NNBG make
savings on the construction plan, as projected, the good news is that 
<?notus-xml column=28?>we have negotiated a gain-share for the consumer. The consumer will have
no pain-share: if the construction costs go higher, that risk is taken
by the developer, by EDF, but if the construction costs are lower, the
consumer will benefit. That has not happened before, and it is a
welcome protection for the consumer.</hs_Para>

about community benefits and he is right that the package we announced
last July comes into play only when the power station is operational.
We have heard the Select Committee’s recommendation and,
although I cannot prejudge our response to it, we will listen to it
carefully. I will only say that EDF is already benefiting the
community, investing in skills and young people in the area, and
economic benefits will flow during the construction phase. EDF has
already said that during the peak construction £100 million will
go into the local economy every year. The local community will benefit
even before the community benefit package is in place.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman asked about the memorandum of understanding and how it
relates to UK companies going to China. He is absolutely right: the
purpose was to ensure that UK nuclear companies, and there are many,
get some benefits from exports and from working in China and other
markets. That is important.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman made an important point about state aid. Of course, we
were in touch with the Commission before the notification. Now we have
formally notified, we will continue that contact. The Commission does
not tell a member state ahead of notification whether it will grant
approval—of course it does not—and it will not commit
itself to a time scale. I am pleased that Commissioner Almunia has told
us that a team will be in place in a timely fashion and will treat the
issue with the priority it deserves.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman went on to ask how other nuclear sites are doing. I
could go into a lot of detail, but let me simply give him one example.
He will know that Hitachi bought the Horizon site and its nuclear
reactor design is in the generic design assessment phase with the
Office for Nuclear Regulation. Hitachi wants to proceed with its
investments and, in due course, will enter negotiations.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman wanted to relate today’s deal with
Labour’s price fix con. He was trying to argue that
Labour’s price fix con must be possible if we can offer a fixed
price for nuclear for 35 years. Once again, the Labour party shows its
economic illiteracy. Given that the Leader of the Opposition did my
job, he ought to know that even if a part of the electricity generation
mix has a fixed price, the majority of generating costs remain variable
and will be for some time. The fact that generating costs and wholesale
costs are variable, often unpredictably so, means that prices sometimes
have to change to avoid firms’ going bust. The
fact that the Opposition’s energy price fix con cannot address
this is bad news for consumers, bad news for competition and bad news
for investment. It is genuinely worrying that the Opposition cannot see
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_21_PT_1/FE8436426A6306CCB7DD928355FB448B4E5B840F" __version__="1.12"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="21 October 2013">Monday

extremely disappointing. I would say to Npower’s customers, as I
have said to British Gas customers: thanks to this Government there is

was not a choice of independent suppliers. There are now 15 independent
suppliers taking on the big six. There is a real choice now—real
competition—and that is a new development. It was not the case
under Labour. So we are reforming the market in the Energy Bill,
creating competition and getting a much better deal for the consumer.

of the arrangements that I believe will be particularly welcomed by
consumers and taxpayers is that the operator will have to start meeting
the clean-up costs from day one of generation, which has not been the
case in the past. Two thirds of my Department’s budget is spent
meeting the decommissioning costs of past nuclear power stations that
have long finished generating electricity. That was a scandal and past
Governments failed. This Government have learnt the lessons and ensured
that the decommissioning costs are up front. There will be oversight of

realise that the NAO would be looking at this so early. She asks about
the public share of waste management. The truth is that the public will
have to shoulder a large amount of the cost of nuclear waste, because a
vast amount of nuclear waste that has to be dealt with is from the
past, from the first two generations of nuclear power stations and from

two points in response to his comments. First, 7% of Britain’s
electricity needs will be secured when the two reactors are working at
capacity, which is expected in 2025. That is a huge bonus for our
long-term plans for energy security in this country, something that was
not happening before the coalition Government came to power. Secondly,
on his point about the Liberal Democrats, our party changed its policy
at our recent conference in Glasgow, and I will explain to the House
why we did that. The reasons are similar to those that led me to change
my view. Climate change is a huge challenge for our country and for the
world. Some people believe that we can combat it simply by using
renewables and energy efficiency, but I do not believe that we can. I
believe that it is such a serious threat to our world that all forms of
low-carbon electricity need to be used. I urge environmentalists in the
House to reflect on that.</hs_Para>

more cost-competitive. We are having to subsidise it as a new immature

Although the nuclear deal is competitive, onshore wind is a very
cost-competitive, low-carbon generator in comparison with nuclear.

approached by nuclear companies who asked about political commitment in

<?notus-xml column=38?>this country. I gave resounding support from the Labour party, so I

me say this: owing to the botched privatisations of the ’80s and

this deal ourselves; it will be led by French technology and

the Sizewell C opportunity. He will know that, because the European
pressurised reactor has gone through the generic design assessment
process for Hinkley Point C, it will not have to do so again for
Sizewell C. That should shorten the period involved. EDF is hoping to
be in a position, after obtaining consents from us, regulatory

we need a global treaty on climate change. One country cannot tackle it

recognise that the BBC holds a unique place in British society. That
should be welcomed. It produces and broadcasts world-class programmes
and excellent news and current affairs outputs, and it would take me
too long to list them all. All this success does not automatically make
it special and certainly does not put it above scrutiny, however. The
BBC rightly plays an important part in scrutinising public and
independent organisations. Some of its journalists are among the best
in the country and possibly the world. Its investigative reports have
exposed wrongdoing and failure by many individuals, organisations and
private and public bodies, yet it seems that none of these skills are
encouraged when it comes to scrutinising in-house matters. The BBC does
not interrogate its own internal affairs with the same rigour as it
does so well of outside bodies. How many investigations of scandals or
examples of wrongdoing involving the BBC have been made or 
<?notus-xml column=51?>prompted by the BBC? Some may argue that that is not the BBC’s
job, but I would disagree. It receives £3 billion a
year in public money from the licence fee payer—the fee is
probably the UK’s most regressive tax.</hs_Para>

do not blame the individuals within the BBC for not pursuing these
matters, because this is about the culture within the organisation. The
“officer class” of executives, as they were described by
Lord Hall, need to engage and communicate better with those working at
the sharp end, who are the ones usually left to manage the
fallout and who are often frustrated and angry at the changes they see
that simply will not work. Because of the BBC’s resources and
its unique place, BBC executives should encourage its programmes to act
where it feels there is wrongdoing, wherever that may be. I recognise
that the BBC reports issues when they have come into the public domain,
but that usually happens as a result of other press activity and, I
suggest, when there is little alternative because of the prominence of

am describing the issues that the BBC should be actively examining from
a management or journalism point of view, as that would be not only
good management practice, but in the interests of the licence fee
payer. I hope the House will allow me to demonstrate the point a little
further. Recently, the BBC has not been seen in a positive light on a
range of matters. The Jimmy Savile scandal was the ultimate
demonstration of that, but I could mention so many examples. Why was
£100 million wasted on a now-abandoned digital media initiative?
Has anyone lost their job as a result? How do executives pay millions
of pounds in severance payments to themselves? Why are staff allowed to
leave the BBC on significant pay-offs only to return in a freelance
capacity? Why, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:09:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr Evans) mentioned, are BBC talent
salaries not published? What about the extent of BBC talent—is
it used as a way of preventing the publication of salaries of other
senior appointments, because BBC talent is not simply restricted to
broadcasters? How can presenters interview organisations that pay them
handsomely to speak at conferences in a private capacity outside their
employment with the BBC? Is that not a conflict of
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:09:46"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

hope the BBC can pursue the protection of children online. It is
ideally placed to help families protect children online. Few
organisations are better placed to educate and inform on a mass scale.
A number of newspapers have led the campaign to protect children

responded admirably and have led the way in policy change. However,
many children understand technology and the range of filter settings
better than their parents. Many parents do not even

BBC’s mission statement and stated public purposes fit perfectly
for it to become the trusted source of advice on how to protect
children online. The BBC has a responsibility to educate, to inform and
to use new technology for the benefit of the licence fee payer. What
better way to do that than to commit part of its vast resources to help
parents understand the risks that their children face online and show
them how to act to protect them? The BBC has an even more direct reason
to do that: BBC iPlayer allows watershed programmes to be downloaded
and viewed at any time of the day. I recognise that the system raises a
warning, but it merely asks for the OK button to be pressed. Combining
the need to improve filtering options and to educate parents about them
could therefore easily kill two birds with one

must have the ultimate choice, but the BBC can play a significant part
in communicating the risks and how to act to reduce those risks, should
a parent want to—be it grooming on a social media site,
protecting children against legal adult content, or simply explaining
how SafeSearch can be switched to filter outcomes. Encryption, virtual
private networks—VPNs—or peer-to-peer networks are ways
around the filter and there need to be innovative ways of explaining
these to parents 
<?notus-xml column=55?>and explaining how to protect children against them.
There are several benefits to this approach. I am conscious of the
time, but I hope that is one example where the BBC can use the licence

confused one, I think—on BBC governance, which I must say is not
at the top of the list of issues that preoccupy licence fee payers. The
BBC, despite the publicity surrounding the recent torrid and terrible
revelations, has shown itself to be a remarkably resilient institution.
It is important that we recognise and respect the reasons for that
resilience. First, there is the high level of public support and trust,
which I must say this institution and politics would be very satisfied
with, even after the fallout from the terrible revelations following
the Jimmy Savile inquiry and the degree of public distaste about the
level of payoffs for senior managers.</hs_Para>

one of the most important reasons for that high level of resilience is
the public’s devotion to the BBC’s high-quality content,
which is almost taken for granted. I think that it is fair to think of

licence fee income that comes to the BBC is the public’s money
and not public expenditure in the normal sense, so I argue that it
should be dealt with differently. This is an opportunity to rehearse
some of the often cited arguments, so I should also say that of course
the BBC distorts the broadcasting market. However, it exists, by
consent of the public, as a deliberate market intervention. When I was
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, I realised the
importance, at a time of rapid innovation, of ensuring that the power
of the BBC was not chilling in its effect on other areas of investment
and innovation. We need constantly to keep a close eye on that
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0002.htm#1310215000413">I
want to say a couple of things about the recent revelations. They are
historical, but disturbing none the less. There was much in Lord
Hall’s speech on strategy to be optimistic and enthusiastic
about, but the BBC as an organisation has to be concerned about
culture, as that will always trump strategy and undermine the ability
to deliver a strategy aligned to the licence fee payer. There has to be
a sense that the Augean stables have been cleaned out. Transparency and
shining a bright light on such practices is one of the ways of doing
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310215000414" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0002.htm#1310215000414">I
turn briefly to the BBC Trust. There has been a profound
misunderstanding about its role. The BBC Trust is the cheerleader not
for the BBC, but for the licence fee payer. That places a different set
of expectations and responsibilities on it. I want to set out some ways
in which it might cheerlead in that way more effectively. As we move to
charter review, which the Secretary of State will be thinking closely
about, one of the big threats to the independence of the BBC is
interference by Government—any Government. That is why the BBC
must be structurally reinforced against the temptation of Governments
to intervene and unduly influence it.</hs_Para>

the BBC should indeed be owned by its licence fee payers and should
become the country’s biggest mutual. I do not want to take too
much of the House’s time going through the detail of how that
would work, although I have given a lot of thought to that. I offer the

is public concern about Government involvement compromising the
independence of the BBC. I believe that there is public support for the
kind of proposal that I am making, which would strengthen the
Trust’s hand in relation to the executive and make it absolutely
clear that the Trust is the cheerleader for the licence fee
payer. There would have to be further public consultation. However, in
the public consultation that I oversaw in the run-up to the
current charter, it was absolutely clear that the public wanted a break
from the BBC being run by the usual suspects from the establishment or
governing classes, and we should respect and respond to that.</hs_Para>

second argument for mutualisation is that while members of the Trust
continue to be appointed via DCMS, the question of independence from
Government will remain. It is clear that the public greatly value the
BBC’s reputation and its charter responsibility for accuracy and
impartiality. Respondents to the 2005 pre-charter consultation welcomed
the lack of advertising in BBC sport and drama and the fact that the
BBC set the standards for other news programmes. Therefore, a stronger
Trust, backed by licence fee payers’ support, could provide a
greater bulwark against those who seek to put undue political influence
on the BBC or cut corners under pressure from the rest of the
broadcasting

Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)—is that it would give the
public more of a say over programmes and direction. It is a simple
principle that if we pay for the BBC, the institution should be more

hope that this is a debate whose time has come. The BBC, along with
most of our national institutions, is under scrutiny at the moment.
What better opportunity and better time to think innovatively about how
it can change, not just in response to crises such as Savile but in
reflecting the shifting relationship between the citizen and the public
service, with a stronger voice for those who pay and ultimately own
their public broadcaster? Reith said that the role of the BBC was to
“inform, educate and entertain”. I believe that only
radical public ownership by the people of this country themselves will

absolutely right that there has been a change in terms of the amount

hugely successful, means that Radio 3 should no longer need to occupy
the same space, but concentrate, as it does most of the time, on a
little more challenging and difficult classical music than the more

would create a multi-million pound compensation deal? The trouble is
that that bill would, once again, be paid by the taxpayer. The BBC has
a commercial arm. Does my hon. Friend have any thoughts on how the
confidence of the public, who pay a tax to the BBC, is affected by
these matters? It is not just the salaries that outrage them, but the

flow from the various cases. He made the point earlier that the BBC has
been fined for breaches of the broadcasting code. If a publicly funded
organisation such as the BBC is required to pay a fine, it of course
comes out of the licence fee. It may be that we have to consider other
measures. A fine is not necessarily the best way or even a sufficient

the severance payments are a serious issue, the amounts of money
involved were relatively small. By far the worst financial failure of
the BBC is the 
<?notus-xml column=60?>digital media initiative, which has cost the licence fee payer
£100 million, to no benefit whatsoever. It angers people in the
BBC, as much as people outside, that they have been required to deliver
savings in front-line programming, when they see huge amounts going on
senior management salaries and pay-offs, and the huge waste of money in
the digital media initiative. It worries me that, in making efficiency
savings, the BBC has made cuts in some of the areas that it is most
important for it to invest in, such as news and current affairs and
local radio. It is no wonder that there is serious anger throughout the
BBC when its employees have been told that investment in certain types
of programming cannot be afforded, but they then find that £100
million has essentially been thrown away on the digital media
initiative. That reflects a failure of

intervention and that it might interfere with editorial independence.
That is absolute nonsense. There is no reason why the NAO should not
examine the accounts of the BBC—that does not represent

part of the debate concerns whether the licence fee is still the most

large number of people. The BBC director-general is now announcing that
some programmes will be made available on the iPlayer before they are
broadcast. That raises questions because the traditional licence fee
model means that someone needs a licence if they own a television set
in their corner. More and more people are now accessing content through
iPlayer on catch-up, which is outside the original definition of what
the licence fee should be for. Whether the licence fee is sustainable
is cast into question in that different world. There is no easy answer
to the question of what we put in its place—perhaps straight
Exchequer subsidy is a better solution than a flat-rate poll tax, which
is what

disagree with the hon. Gentleman on fundamental principles. First, I
believe that, nearly always, broadcasting tends towards monopoly. It is
in the nature of the business because it costs an awful lot to make one
hour of programming. It costs a lot to broadcast it to five people, but
it does not cost that much more to broadcast it to 10, 10,000, 5
million or 20 million more people. That is why the state must intervene
in the market, which is why I support the licence
fee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102117000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0002.htm#13102117000028">Secondly,
risk-taking in the broadcasting industry—it is expensive to make
one hour of broadcasting—is very expensive, especially in two
notable genres, drama and comedy. Making drama is expensive. If people
get it wrong, they might end up making 10 or 13 weeks of a programme
that nobody wants to watch. Everybody will chuck mud at them for weeks.
Comedy is even worse. For every “Fawlty Towers”, there is
a “Miranda”—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I
do not like “Miranda”, although some Government Members
obviously do. It could be the other way round for people who do not
like “Fawlty Towers”—for every
“Miranda”, there is a “Fawlty Towers”. My
point is simply that, in matters of taste, it is difficult to jiggle
all the nation’s funny bones at the same time. State
intervention is therefore important, because the market would not
otherwise
provide.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102117000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0002.htm#13102117000029">Australia
abolished the licence fee, and what happened? The first thing that

However, I worry about the future because, all too often, there is only
one broadcast voice outside London and the south-east. Let us face it:
if the BBC excels in one thing more than anything, it is local radio.
Nobody else produces the same quality of local radio—it is

Public service broadcasting is not about making programmes that nobody

believe that Radio 3 prevented Classic FM from coming into existence.
If anything, Radio 3 enabled Classic FM to come into existence. There
was competition at the start, but Classic FM found a different way of
presenting classical music. It relied on an audience that was already
out there—an audience created largely by Radio 3—and on
players, singers and concert halls that, effectively, were subsidised
by the BBC. There is a double benefit from the BBC. The licence fee
paid by my constituents in the Rhondda pays for the hon. Gentleman to
watch all the highbrow, intellectual stuff he watches, and to listen to
the wonderfully intelligent and academic stuff he appears on and
contributes to. My constituents are

hon. Friend is absolutely right. In many cases, the only training
programmes in the industry are run by the BBC. For example, its
contribution to the high arts, by funding orchestras and choirs, is one
of the things that manages to keep many of our concert halls and
classical concerts going. Broadcasting is one of the things we can
rightly say, without any sense of British arrogance that often applies
to many other things, we do better than any other country in the world.
I am conscious that that is not just about the BBC. I once worked for
the BBC in Brussels. I got into a taxi and the driver asked me who I
worked for. I told him I worked for the BBC and he said, “I love
the BBC. I love ‘Midsomer Murders’, ‘Inspector
Morse’ and ‘Brideshead Revisited’.” I did
not point out to him that they had been made by ITV. We get a double
benefit from the BBC, because it creates a competition for
quality. It is not anti-competitive—quite the reverse. It is
profoundly competitive, because it creates a competition for

that the Committee has thought about. I agree that sometimes the two

the risk we run by adopting the other strategy is
that the chair appears and says, “That is entirely a
matter for the director-general, so I’m not willing to answer
it,” and half an hour later the director-general says, “I
am not going to answer that, because it is a matter for the

detractors are right that it is not perfect and sometimes gets it
wrong. For instance, spending £25 million on severance payments
for 150 senior managers—an average payout of
£164,000—simply cannot be justified, and people were
rightly mystified to hear of a £500,000 payment to the former
director-general, George Entwistle, given that he had apparently
resigned and that this exceeded his terms and

under the leadership of Tony Hall, the new director-general, there are

these shortcomings. For instance, the £150,000 or 12-month
salary cap on redundancy payments is very welcome, as is the commitment
to removing so-called gagging clauses from BBC contracts and compromise
agreements. The BBC needs to draw a line under these damaging
revelations and concentrate on what it does best: providing top-quality

roll-out of superfast broadband, but at the same time, the BBC was
guaranteed its funding over that six-year period, which provided

rises for at least the next five to six years. I realise that that
would not be popular with some hon. Members, who believe that the
licence fee should be scrapped altogether or reduced, but the current
£145.50 fee works out at about 40p a day to watch the BBC,

quality public service broadcasting sets the bar high and ensures good
quality commercial broadcasting, because the commercial quality needs
to be good to compete. Where public service broadcasting is poor, the 
<?notus-xml column=70?>commercial sector does not need to provide
high-quality programming to gain market share. The BBC sets the bar
high, and needs to continue to do so. Recent research shows that public
service broadcasting raises audience expectations and forces the

opportunities and challenges. I shall briefly mention four of them. One
opportunity relates to the success of BBC Worldwide and the need to
encourage it to do even more. It generated more than £1 billion
in revenue in 2011-12, and there is plenty of scope for improving on
that figure.

Thirdly, we need to end the anomaly whereby the BBC pays Sky to have
its programmes on Sky’s platform. That is a ludicrous situation
and it needs to come to an end. It should be the other way round,
because Sky benefits from having BBC programmes on its platform. At the

there is a need to protect public service broadcasting through

allowed to get away with shocking behaviour right under the noses of
senior management, so have no faith that complaining will bring any

bullied because of their sexuality, or their race; women have been
subjected to the most awful sexism; journalists have been openly
reviled because of their age; and there are many others whose lives

also came out of this dossier was that a former human resources manager

during those negotiations, the management were putting active union
members under pressure, monitoring union ballots and e-mails. That was
from the dossier submitted to management. Individual cases are now
being taken up and formal complaints are being investigated. However,
many of the formal complaints lodged nine months ago have still not
come to any conclusion. That is a long period of time in which to

thus believe that Lord Hall has a job to do in sorting out this
atmosphere of bullying and intimidation within the BBC, and I doubt
whether BBC management will be able to focus properly on the
organisation’s future unless it restores morale, which is at an
all-time low as a result of some elements of mismanagement that have
gone on. When the Select Committee meets tomorrow and interviews the
director-general of the BBC and the BBC Trust chairman, it must first
of all get a grip on those matters of executive pay and excessive
pay-offs, and it must then challenge the bullying culture revealed by
the Rose review. It is important to recognise that the BBC lost the
confidence of the work force because it was distant from the work
force—not listening to the trade union representations made to
it about a number of these issues and not understanding that the
workers within the organisation wanted to make a contribution. I would
welcome it ensuring that, whatever structure is established, if things
continue with a board as at present, staff representation must be part
of that board so that the workers can be involved in the future
direction of the BBC.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) said he found the BBC to be
quite right-wing. I was monitoring the twitter feed after he said that
and I do not think many members of the public agree with him.
However, I sometimes think it is wrong to say the BBC is too
left-wing. That very much depends on the individuals who are presenting
the show, not the corporation as a whole. There is no doubt that the
BBC attracts liberal-minded people to work for it. Anyone who has done
BBC interviews, especially at regional level, cannot fail to notice
that the newspapers available to read while waiting to go into the
studio are usually <I>The Guardian, The Mirror </I>or <I>The
Independent—The Guardian </I>has almost become the in-house
newspaper of the BBC. Setting that aside, however, this question very
much depends on the show and the interviewers.</hs_Para>

think that one of the most politically neutral shows on the BBC is the
“Today” programme. Some people will gasp at that comment
and say, “It’s outrageous: John Humphrys sits there
berating the Tories but never gives Labour such a rough ride.”
However, when Labour was in power that was exactly what it said, and I
think that when both sides of the House believe there is favouritism

Shelbrooke:</Member></B> We know that there was a serious editorial and
management change of direction for the “Today” programme
in 1987, when it was decided that the show should shape the coming
day’s agenda rather than report what happened the previous day.
From that moment on, it became a more controversial show among
politicians. I feel there is less bias in it than people on the right
of politics think. However, it is clear that there are presenters who
have deeply held left-wing political views. For example, we all
remember the Jim Naughtie comment on the “Today”
programme: he said “we” while interviewing a
representative of the Labour party, rather than “you”.

like to share a panel with, and who would you least like to

they would not like to share a panel with Nick Griffin. My answer was
different. I said I only want to share a panel with people who have
been put there because they have been elected by and are accountable to
the public. I want “Question Time” to have elected, and
therefore accountable, politicians from across the political spectrum
so that the public get to hear how the issues of the day are addressed
by those representing the range of political opinions in
this country. I get sick to the back teeth of opinionated
comedians et al going on and spouting forth when they are
not in any way accountable to the public. That is

how the various radio and TV stations feed into the whole organisation,
and how it serves the public.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Rhondda made an important and interesting point when he said that
public service broadcasting should be there for the highbrow
programmes—and I certainly do enjoy them and the education I get
from them—but then asked why people who pay that tax and do not
want to enjoy those programmes should have them taken away. The idea
that it is the role of a public sector broadcaster
to entertain and to be informative is laid out in the charter, 
<?notus-xml column=80?>but I believe that it is surely the role of a public sector broadcaster
to enrich the people it serves.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102120000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0002.htm#13102120000002">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:09:28"></hs_TimeCode>
then get into the argument about what lets such a broadcaster enrich
the people it serves, and, thus, whether it is wrong to say that any of
the BBC’s programmes or content should be commercialised. The
BBC may have led to Sky Arts being formed and having a high-level arts
output, but I would argue that BBC News followed Sky News. On stations
that should be changed and either commercialised or kept in the public
sector—I will deal with that point in a moment—BBC News
24 could seize the opportunity to split its content each hour between
the half-hour rolling news that it does on the hour and having the next
half hour become, in effect, the televised version of the World
Service. This is an important point for the BBC, because it should not
be competing with Sky News and its like. We hear the argument all the
time that “We need to feed the 24-hour rolling news.” The
BBC is a very important brand, which people feel does deliver knowledge
in a way that they appreciate. It therefore has a prime
opportunity to enrich people’s knowledge of what is
going on politically in the world by making half of that
broadcast output on BBC News 24 a televised version of the
World Service.</hs_Para>

areas would I commercialise? I often feel that BBC 1, Radio 1 and Radio
2 could easily exist in a commercial environment. Why do I say that? I
say it not in order to cut the TV licence, but to bring in more money
for investment in the things that will enrich our lives. Let us examine
some of the most successful television comedies, such as “Little
Britain”. It made a journey from Radio 4 to BBC 2 to BBC 1,
whereupon it was hugely successful in its sales of DVDs, books, CDs and
so on, as many BBC programmes have been. I would like the BBC to focus
its resources much more strategically, rather than taking a scatter-gun
approach across many a television station. I feel that BBC 3 and BBC 4
are excessive and are not actually needed. BBC 2 used to have the
content that BBC 4 and BBC 3 show, and it was often seen as the feeder
channel into BBC 1, along with its having the highbrow content. A lot
of the stuff on BBC 1 can survive in a commercial environment because
it has the ratings, but that is not to say that we should bring in
commercialisation to cut the television licence; the BBC should be able
to gain as much revenue as it can in order to invest that back and
carry on investing in British comedy, British drama and news. Although
the BBC has cut its funding to news, it did not need to do that and
should not have done it. I hope the Secretary of State has heard what I

does, but it often puts those things on early in the morning or late at
night, and we also have Radio 6, Radio 1Xtra and so on. Other radio
stations are involved in bringing in new talent, and some of the things
on Radio 2 would probably be commercially

Shelbrooke:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising
that important point. The question that will need to be assessed by the
Secretary of State and her Department is whether the BBC has that
effect now on the commercial radio sector. For example, I am a great
fan of Absolute Radio, which attracts only 1.9 million listeners. It
has diversified over the years; it does things decade by decade, and
plays rock and different genres. Given that it has 1.9 million
listeners, one must question how it is viable. It must be viable
through the commercial airtime that is available. We know that
commercial revenue has reduced in the year, which is why ITV now has
four minutes of adverts compared with the two minutes there were some
20 years ago, as it needs to meet the costs along the way. However, a
fear of allowing something into the market should not change our
approach; we should allow the commercial operators to say, “If
that is there, we have to compete.” That might raise their
game.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102120000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0002.htm#13102120000007">The big
“but” is that it comes down to this: do we want a public
service broadcaster to enrich our lives? I believe we do, as that is
very important. I believe there will always be a role for Radio 3,
Radio 4 and the World Service, and, of course, for Radio 5 and local
radio stations. When the cutbacks were coming to local radio stations,
the point had to be made that there is no better broadcaster in this
country during a time of crisis, whatever that may be—nine times
out of 10 it is weather-related—than BBC local radio to inform
its listeners of what is happening in the area. That service must be
protected, as must the content on Radio 5 and Radio 5 live sports
extra. We have had the discussion about sport, and over the years
televised sport has gone from terrestrial television to the
pay-per-view satellite broadcasters, but the same has not happened to
radio sport; we get a wide range of programmes on the radio. That is
one of the key reasons why Radio 5 should always remain on medium wave,
because it has a greater reach than FM.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102120000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0002.htm#13102120000008">That reach is
also why the BBC, this Government or any future Government must not
allow the FM or analogue broadcasting frequencies to be switched off in
favour of digital. We had this argument in 1992, when the BBC was
talking about turning Radio 4 long wave into a 24-hour news channel,
and we heard about the areas that Radio 4 FM cannot reach whereas
long wave can. The analogue stations may be crackly and hissy
every now and again, but we do get something. I drive down the M1 every
week to this place and I very much enjoy listening to Radio 5, the
World Service and Absolute Radio on my in-car digital radio, but there
are plenty of places along the way where the signal is completely lost.
We may get hisses, cracks and bangs with an analogue signal, but with
digital we either get all or nothing. So when we talk about the future
of the BBC, it is very important that the BBC makes sure that, above
all, it is there for everybody and there to enrich life. I hope that I
have given the Secretary of State many a point to
consider.</hs_Para>

already difficult for many people to afford, even in instalments.
Recent accounts of embarrassingly high senior management salaries,
severance packages and relocation to Salford payments would make any
increase in the licence fee absolutely unjustifiable in the eyes of the

is the creation of what he called BBC Store, whereby people can access
programmes in the BBC back catalogue digitally through the iPlayer and
pay a fee to do that. In the same way as they might pay to buy a DVD of
programming that they were particularly interested in, they will be
able to pay a subscription to watch it through BBC Store instead. This
creates very interesting and exciting commercial opportunities for the
BBC and raises some fair questions. If the BBC is allowed to develop
more commercial properties and allowed to make more money from its back
catalogue, how is this money used in the organisation? Can this be
offset against future demands for a freeze or reduction of the licence
fee if it is decided that that is the best way to go

Additional scrutiny through the National Audit Office may well be the

do not criticise Chris Patten for that. I think he did what anyone

speak for the organisation had to take charge at that difficult time,
and he did that. But that is not the same as being the chairman of the

regulator. It raises questions about whether the current chairman of
the Trust should be seen more as the chairman of a board of governors

that has more of an independent voice, whose members are perhaps
selected with broader consent from the public, but is clearly a

Glamorgan (Alun Cairns) on securing this debate which has, as other
hon. Members have said, come at a timely moment. Obviously, the BBC has
special funding arrangements. The licence fee is unavoidable for

an average week.</hs_Para>

other hon. Members have said, a series of scandals have rocked the BBC
in the past few years. The most serious was clearly the Savile scandal.
It looks now as if perhaps 500 people were victims of this man, and the
initial horrors have been followed by wrong editorial decisions. Then
there were serious financial problems—£100 million
squandered on the digital initiative, and massive executive payoffs. It
was not just the sums of money, but the mismanagement of the agreement
to these payoffs that was criticised. Those massive payoffs were partly
caused by the fact that there was excessive pay at the top of the
management of the
organisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102121000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102121000022">We

externally has turned out to be an extremely useful way of promoting
and supporting other creative industries, and indeed exports, in this
country. His proposals for a partnership with the British Library and a
digital space with other institutions were extremely positive, as were
his proposals for increasing the number of apprenticeships and the
amount of education for young people in new technology. He mentioned
something that I think we have all agreed with over the course of

reporting. He also wants to strengthen the BBC’s global news

the issue of top pay, we will obviously look at governance

we are looking at transparency and public accountability, I think that
it is worth thinking about ways in which the public can be involved in
commissioning. The best job in television must be that of commissioning
editor. I think that a more open approach to the public on
commissioning would be extremely welcome. The director-general says
that he wants the public to feel that they are the owners of the BBC
and that it is theirs, and we say amen to that, but we do not want it
to be a piece of rhetoric; we want it to be a piece of
reality.</hs_Para>

spoke<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:39:31"></hs_TimeCode> about the
serious cases of bullying that the National Union of Journalists has
highlighted to us. One of the things that the NUJ has said—it is
a good and reasonable point—is that the BBC should have an
independent, external process for handling bullying or harassment
cases. Doing everything in-house does not give members of staff the
confidence that they need in the
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102121000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102121000039">I
want to raise an important point about standards. There is a clear
watershed on television; the content is suitable for children earlier
in the evening and suitable for adults later. My impression is that the
BBC does not operate radio to the same standards and that, from time to
time on Radio 1 and Radio 2, there are songs, lyrics and language that
are really not suitable for children. We cannot expect families always
to put children into a silo of separate channels—that is not how
people lead their lives, and the BBC must take that into
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102121000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102121000040">I
felt that the criticisms made about BBC bias by some hon. Members, in
particular the hon. Member for Hornchurch and Upminster (Dame Angela
Watkinson), were a little unfair. We can all think of occasions when we
have been enraged by what we have heard on the BBC, but feeling extreme
irritation sometimes does not mean that there is bias
overall.</hs_Para>

tackle the issue of top pay and strengthen accountability, but we must
acknowledge that three quarters of the population believe that the BBC
maintains high standards. The most important guarantee of that is
continued editorial independence. Although I completely understand that
the BBC must evolve with changes in technology, in the end what we look
for from it are values and commitment to truth and
independence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102121000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102121000042">I
end on a personal note. My mother is Danish. During the Nazi occupation
of Denmark in world war two, the Danish relied completely on the BBC to
get the truth. Those high standards of editorial independence and
truthfulness are as relevant today, and will be as relevant in 10

However, I will join my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Gareth
Johnson), who struck the right tone in paying tribute to the majority
of BBC staff, who produce world-class content. I particularly thank
staff at the Salford offices, whom I met recently at our party
conference. We should not confuse the poor judgment of some of the
management —the failure of the few—with the world-class

have contributed to making the past 12 months an annus

digital media initiative to exorbitant severance payments. To say that
as a nation we have been disappointed is an understatement. What we all
want and expect from the BBC, now and in future, is relatively
uncontroversial: a BBC focused on producing programming of the highest
quality, setting the highest standards of behaviour and respect
throughout its organisation and having an independence beyond question.
However, we also expect it to be accountable to the public, who pay for
it, for how it spends licence fee money. It is absolutely to be
expected that both the public and this House should react when those
standards are not met and that the BBC Trust and management should not
only act effectively to address the issues of real public

Pollard review and the MacQuarrie report both concluded that a lack of
clarity and accountability in editorial decision making created an
environment of uncertainty in which such errors could be made. Dame
Janet Smith’s inquiry has yet to report, but I expect the BBC to
act swiftly in response to its findings. As the Chair of the Culture,
Media and Sport Committee said absolutely rightly, with a sagacity that
I always expect from him in debates such as this, the culture
that pervades is critical. Importantly, the BBC has already
instituted some changes to reform its management culture—for
example, through its Respect at Work review and changes to its own
whistleblowing policies.</hs_Para>

is crystal clear that more has to be done. The events surrounding the
Savile report on “Newsnight”, the failed digital media
initiative and the remuneration of senior executives all seem to share
a common theme: confusion around where the roles and responsibilities
of 
<?notus-xml column=92?>the executive stop and those of the BBC Trust start.
That is where I part company from the right hon. Member for Dulwich and
West Norwood (Dame Tessa Jowell), who is not in her place. She seemed
to focus on the people rather than the processes. There are issues
around the ambiguity over the chain of command within the BBC, whether
editorially or financially. That has had serious consequences for the
corporation itself, and more importantly for licence fee payers, who
all of us in the Chamber
represent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102124000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102124000014">The
issue must be addressed, and it is no good waiting until a new charter
in 2017 to act. The right hon. Lady floated the idea of mutualisation.
It is right that she should have such ideas; as she reminded us, she
was one of the architects of the current situation. Perhaps it is
attractive to think in the abstract about changing structures, but I
believe that here and now we have to make what we have got work. It is
important that we get in place the right management who have the right
judgment but also have the right governance structures to ensure that
we can be proud of what the BBC is doing and are not concerned about
how it is being

was right that following the catalogue of failures that we have all
talked about the BBC Trust and the BBC’s executive announced a
comprehensive review of the BBC’s internal governance system and
structures and the culture surrounding them. They are re-examining the
relationship between the Trust and the executive with the aim of
simplifying it and providing better, clearer oversight of the way our
licence fee is spent. The review will build on the work that has
already been done by the BBC’s new executive team to simplify
the organisation, reducing not only the head count of senior management
but the number of boards and committees to help get to a position of
more transparency over the lines of accountability. As every Member of
this House would expect, I will continue to keep the BBC’s
structures and effectiveness under close review to make sure
that it has effectively addressed these very serious and
unacceptable

have said and what has been agreed in principle that there are no
proposed changes to the role of Government and Ministers in what has

into a whole range of things, but I would like particularly to focus on
the BBC’s vital role in our creative industries, which are a
growing part of our economy. At a time when we are all focused
on growing the economy and prosperity for the future, the BBC’s
figures demonstrating that for every £1 spent on it through the
licence fee there is £2 of value added in relation to the
economy is a good story to be telling for jobs, expenditure in the
economy and economic opportunities. This represents the BBC generating
some £8 billion of economic value for the

my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford explained extremely eloquently,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:54:38"></hs_TimeCode> impact of
the BBC goes far beyond the economic. My hon. Friend the Member for
Vale of Glamorgan mentioned the BBC’s role in public health and
the part that it played, extremely effectively, in raising awareness of
AIDS. He asked whether the BBC could do further work on child safety

an initial piece of work in that area; perhaps more will be

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:55:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:55:46"></hs_TimeCode> would like to
touch on the impact that the BBC can have on
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:54:53"></hs_TimeCode>the
international stage in representing us and playing a key role in how we
are perceived as a nation. As well as stimulating the interests of
businesses and tourists alike, through the work of the BBC we are
spreading Britain’s reach and enhancing our reputation as a
nation. In a recent survey of about 900 business leaders in the United
States, India and Australia, nearly two thirds of respondents said that
the BBC was the main way in which they found out about the UK, and over
half said that they were more likely to do business with the UK because
of what they knew about the BBC. That is extremely powerful, and
important to understand. Therefore, when the BBC fails to adhere to the
standards we expect, and does so repeatedly, the potential for damage
is great and goes well beyond our shores. That is perhaps another
reason why this debate has been so heated at times. As a brand and as a
business, the BBC has an important and powerful role 
<?notus-xml column=94?>in helping us to preserve what is great about our nation and taking to a
wider audience what Britain stands for
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102124000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102124000023">The
BBC also has an important role to play in helping to preserve the
culture and languages of our nations. In Cardiff, the BBC has built a
drama production village in Roath that is now the BBC’s biggest
drama centre in the UK, home to “Doctor Who” and
“Casualty”. BBC Scotland’s presence on the banks
of the Clyde has an equally positive impact. In terms of Welsh language
broadcasting, in which my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan
has <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:57:34"></hs_TimeCode>a keen
interest and about which we have many conversations, the BBC became
S4C’s major funder in April this year. The BBC has an existing
statutory obligation to provide at least 10 hours of programming a
week, at a cost of roughly £20 million per year, and BBC Cymru
content is regularly at the top of S4C’s viewing figures. This
can be in the form of “Pobol y Cwm” or rugby coverage,
the latter of which draws over 100,000 viewers, possibly confirming a
stereotype about rugby being such a part of Welsh DNA—something
that I can certainly agree with.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:58:21"></hs_TimeCode> was extremely
pleased with the recent spending review settlement in which the
Government were able to confirm our support for minority-language
broadcasting, maintaining S4C’s Exchequer funding at its current
level and investing a further £1 million in MG Alba, north of
the border. It is important that we are doing this given its

debate was inspired by the first report by the natural capital
committee, chaired by Professor Dieter Helm. The report provides a
framework—and a call to arms—for the Government to place
a value on natural capital. Natural capital is the stock of resources
derived from the environment in addition to geological resources such
as fossil fuels and mineral deposits. These goods and services include
material and non-material benefits such as crops, timber, water,
climate regulation, natural hazard protection, soil function, mental
health benefits from contact with nature, and
biodiversity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:06:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102124000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102124000041">Without
an economic price, too often natural capital has been treated as if it
is of no value, yet it is a fundamental component of every
country’s portfolio of wealth. For example, the UK has treated
North sea oil purely as an income flow, with no allowance made for the
fact that its use today depletes a national asset that cannot be
replaced. By using it, we are, in effect, eating into our capital
reserves, and it is right that we should acknowledge that when
compiling our national
accounts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:07:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102124000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102124000042">A
private company is judged by both its income and its balance sheet, but
most countries compile only an income statement showing their GDP and
know very little about their national balance sheet on which it all
depends. Even the income measure itself—GDP—fails
properly to represent natural capital. Forestry provides a good example
of this. Timber resources are counted in national accounts, but the
other services forests provide, such as carbon retention and air
filtration, are simply ignored. This all matters

NCC’s report also recommends that the Government should initiate
a programme to provide high-quality evidence on the economic value of
changes in natural capital to inform cost-benefit analyses. Let us
consider land use change. That may involve alterations in agricultural
outputs, which have market prices, but it may also lead to changes in
other factors which do not, including outdoor recreation, carbon
storage and water quality. The best way to compare changes in such
vastly different goods and services is to compare them in common,
monetary terms. Developing a system that can achieve that reliably will
not be straightforward.</hs_Para>

recent progress in this area. The Government’s 2011 natural
environment White Paper made a welcome commitment fully to include
natural capital in the UK environment accounts, with the first changes
coming into effect this year. On the international stage, the adoption
by the UN Statistical Commission of the system for environmental
economic accounts has been a major step
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102124000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102124000052">The
prize is considerable. Measuring and accounting for changes in natural
capital assets, and improving the valuation of those changes, would
help to support better economic decision making. It would improve the
delivery of major public policy goals, such as food and energy
security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and public health
and well-being. In saying that, it is crucial that natural capital
accounting is explained as a way of providing detailed
information for better management of the economy. That needs to be done
in a way that is coherent internationally but that resonates at home

discussion of the natural resources and natural capital in Wales must
concentrate on the fact that the powers over this important area are
still hoarded at Westminster in the centralist grip of the British
state. Wales should be able sustainably to exploit its natural and
mineral resources for the greatest possible environmental, social and
economic gain. However, the National Assembly for Wales has limited
powers over natural resources and energy generation. The people of my
country are thus unable fully to benefit financially from the
exploitation, extraction or transfer of natural resources. Such
financial benefits could be used to create a stronger Wales that is
more economically self-sufficient. Responsibility for the planning,
licensing and oversight of all resource extraction, exploitation and
transfer in Wales should therefore be devolved. Some aspects of
environment and natural resource policy are devolved to Wales, but the
crucial ones are not. Today, the Westminster Government are threatening
a grab for Welsh natural resources in the form of shale gas
exploitation, water extraction and energy production, all without Wales
being in control or her people fairly
compensated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102124000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102124000067">Water
is a highly emotive issue in Wales, and the flooding of the Tryweryn
valley to provide a reservoir for Liverpool Corporation casts a long
shadow over the modern history and politics of Wales. Many still see
that as the catalyst for Welsh political self-realisation, and it
spurred on a generation to secure an element of home rule, convincing
them that Westminster would never truly work for Wales. That culminated
in the struggle for a national assembly at the end of the last century,
and the process carries on today. It is safe to assume that I would not
be here today representing Plaid Cymru were it not for the episodes in
Tryweryn. Only last night on S4C, there was a terrific programme about
the fight against the potential flooding of the Gwendraeth valley in my

currently not in full control of its resources. The Crown Estate and
energy planning above 50 MW remain the preserve of the British state,
meaning that we are unable truly to have ownership in any sense or
fully to benefit from our natural capital. That is why Plaid Cymru has
been making the case for those areas to be devolved as part of the
cross-party UK Government Commission on Devolution in Wales. Polling
carried out by the commission—the most detailed ever undertaken
in Wales since devolution—revealed that an overwhelming 70% of
the people of Wales want full devolution on energy policy. Any

<?notus-xml column=101?>“stimulating” the market in water, present a real threat
to the natural capital of Wales. The water of Wales may not match
Scotland’s oil in terms of wealth, but it is a resource with
value and the people of Wales should receive a fair return. Although
the upcoming Water Bill intends to leave Dwr Cymru—or Welsh
Water—intact, Severn Trent Water cuts a swathe into Welsh
territory, and could mean that the water of Wales is
extracted for vast profit in future. With Gulf state sovereign

territorial integrity should be recognised, and it should be for the

full devolution of water policy in the Government of Wales Act 2006,
leaving the power of veto with London Ministers. Full control over
water would finally end the grossly unfair system enshrined in the
Water Act 1973, and perpetuated by the 2006 Act, in which water was
lent to Severn Trent Water at a scandalously low rate of 5p a year for

be underestimated because it comes against the backdrop of an
accelerating loss of species, with natural capital being lost at an
ever-faster rate. The United Nations Environment Programme has
calculated that for the UK, although overall wealth increased up to

stewardship of those natural assets, but that must be hardwired into
the normal way we do business. Water companies have understood that
rather than pouring chemicals into water to make it drinkable, simply
paying farmers to keep the upland catchment clean can save money and

measure natural capital. As the GLOBE initiative shows, that approach
should be considered around the world as far as possible. I am not
saying that every country should approach the matter in the same way,
but legislators around the globe should recognise the importance of
accounting for natural capital. It is salutary to recognise that some
of the best practice does not come from the largest countries. Costa

a happy coincidence, when we launched the natural environment White
Paper, a new tool—the national ecosystem assessment—was
developed with the help of no fewer than 200 scientists from around the

words, as a result of that excellent scientific work, we can put a
financial figure on what we previously thought was free. I would go so
far as to say that, were such an assessment applied to the use of land
in Europe, the common agricultural policy could be made far more
efficient. There is certainly scope for that. We currently pay farmers
for stewardship schemes at entry and higher level. If funds were
directed to payments for ecosystem services, there would be a tangible
benefit to the farmer, other ecosystem users, the taxpayer and nature.

understand which ones are most at risk, so we can prioritise our
efforts to protect them. The committee’s report lists the wide
range of those natural assets, from soil, water, air, carbon, energy

recognising the irreplaceability of some wild species and habitats.
There is a significant opportunity to demonstrate that with the
proposed high-speed railway. As there is an inevitable loss of green
space to build the new line, it should be possible to create a
significant offset for the loss of that natural capital. Not everything
can be replaced. Ancient woodlands along the line of route will be lost
for ever—more’s the pity—but new woodlands could
be planted to buffer those at risk of being eroded and address the
fragmentation of woodlands, which makes it difficult for species to
migrate and sustain themselves. There could be a significant
restoration of damaged natural capital. For example, we could restore
the Tame valley, a polluted river valley on the 
<?notus-xml column=104?>east side of Birmingham that follows the spur of the
new line into Birmingham city centre. Plans to deliver such natural
capital regeneration have been drawn up by Arup, the engineers, and a
professor of geography from Birmingham university—I commend them
to my hon. Friend the Minister. Offsetting is a tool that could do a
great deal to bring that vision

conclusion, I strongly support the recommendations of the natural
capital committee, in partnership with my hon. Friend the Member for
Beverley and Holderness; the framework within which to define natural
capital; the risk register we need; and embedding natural capital fully
in the UK’s national accounts. In addition, I wonder whether we
can reach across from the public to the private sector and develop
guidance on best practice in natural capital accounting and improve the
treatment of natural capital in cost-benefit analyses. We should also
take up a recommendation of the ecosystem markets taskforce and explore
how natural capital accounting could be included in guidance on
strategic directors reporting under the Companies Act 2006. I hope the
Government urgently explore offsetting and other forms of compensation
to restore and replenish lost natural capital. Together, we need to
nail the myth that preserving and enhancing natural capital is somehow
incompatible with economic

a key test of the White Paper’s ability to truly achieve the
step change in how we value nature as a society. As Chair of the
Environmental Audit Committee, a key issue for me is whether the
Treasury is central to that process. I believe that it should be. The
right hon. Lady set out how the NCC was established in May 2012 as an
independent advisory body to Government, reporting to the economic
affairs committee of the Cabinet Office, which is chaired by the
Chancellor. In an ideal world, a Treasury Minister would be sitting
side by side with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs Minister to answer the debate, because this is a cross-cutting
issue. We are intent on drawing to the Government’s attention
that is no good DEFRA having ownership of the agenda; it has to be

there is a need for a long-term policy framework that supports and

generalities and intentions than about clear recommendations. As the

Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman) gave an excellent speech on
the value of pollinators to British agriculture, in which she 
<?notus-xml column=111?>said that the cost would be £400 million a
year were they to stop doing their valuable work. The benefits that
wetlands provide to water quality are estimated at about £1.5
billion per year. Other examples of natural capital include the value
of natural flood plains in terms of flood defences. The UK national
ecosystem assessment in 2011 calculated that if the UK’s
ecosystems were properly protected and enhanced, they could add an
extra £30 billion to the UK economy. The assessment also warned
that:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102130000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000163">“Neglect

now, at this early stage, we can see practical examples of what happens
when natural systems are valued. We have heard about some examples, but
I wish to give a couple more. Old flood defences on the Humber estuary
have been re-engineered to allow controlled flooding in order to
prevent further flooding of towns and land downstream. The
scheme has created 440 hectares of valuable new wetland habitat and
provides about £400,000 each year in flood protection benefits.
That is a straightforward example of what valuing natural capital
means. In Cornwall, South West Water has found that paying farmers to
reduce the amount of pollutants from their land entering rivers
provides benefits that, I am told, are 65 times more than the initial
cost. So the farmers benefit, the environment benefits and the water
companies benefit—this really is win, win,
win.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000042">I
wish to mention one other example from slightly further
afield—since we are talking about the world and not just this
country, I am sure that I will be allowed to do so. Vietnam has had a
policy on payment for forest services since 2008, through which hydro
plants, water companies and tourism companies must pay for the use of
forest services. So, for example, more than $2 million is paid each
year for the protection of the 276,000 hectares of forest in
the Quang Nam province, of which 85% goes directly to local residents.
The hydro companies protect their capital investments, because the
trees prevent siltation and erosion, which ultimately shortens the life
of their investment; the water companies have steady supplies of clean
water; tourism flourishes; and local people have jobs and security.
Again, everyone wins; the policy is a beautiful example of what this
slightly abstract thing we are discussing means on the
ground.</hs_Para>

acknowledge the work of Dieter Helm and the independent natural capital
committee, and of my right hon. Friend the Member for Meriden, who
showed real, direct commitment in her time in office and has, without
doubt, moved this issue on profoundly. However, this thinking needs to
become much more mainstream in government and much more embedded in the
decision-making process. We can all agree that we have a long way to go
on that. To see that, we need only consider the Government’s
impact assessment for the first 31 marine conservation zones, which
calculated the costs to industry—about £1,000 per
year—but failed to quantify the wider benefits of improving the
health of the ecosystems. It did not look at how the zones added to the
value of tourism and the fact that a healthy marine environment creates
seafood. Those things were left out of the calculations.</hs_Para>

the work of the NCC begins to have a real impact on decisions made

exercise. I am not 
<?notus-xml column=112?>yet convinced that the key Departments have properly
bought in to this. Only a few weeks ago, a number of senior civil
servants from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
appeared before the Environmental Audit Committee. I asked them at the
end of our session, while things were still being collected and
recorded, whether any of them had met up with anyone from the NCC. Not
only had they not done so, but I think we can safely assume from the
response we got that they did not even know what the NCC was. Would it
not be wonderful if next time we debated this issue—I mean this
as no disrespect to the great Minister we have on the Front Bench
today—the Benches were packed and we were talking directly to
the Chancellor? That would be a whole new ball game.</hs_Para>

is not in doubt—and I know that other countries are watching our
progress. My one request to the Minister is to persuade us, and anyone
watching this debate, that the Government as a whole really are ready

for all our cleverness we remain dependent on the extraordinary bounty
that nature provides. The food and water that sustain us, the air that
we breathe, the raw materials that we use as fuel and clothing or to
construct our homes are only the most obvious of nature’s
benefits. Equally important are the processes and services that purify
our water, break down our waste, pollinate our crops and provide us
with recreation and aesthetic or spiritual fulfilment. We have the

is one of the imperative responsibilities of Government to be good
stewards of the present and even better guardians of the future, yet
the facts show how far we are from being good stewards. In the UK our
native flora and fauna have been in decline for over 50 years.
Agricultural intensification in the 1970s is often pointed to as a key
turning point, but the truth is that for more than 200 years, as we
chopped down our forests and used coal to drive the world’s
first industrial revolution, we moved from a pastoral agrarian society
to an advanced city-based economy that has failed to value
biodiversity. In that time hundreds of species of plant and animal have
been lost from our country. We need a radically different approach not
just to halt, but to reverse that decline.</hs_Para>

great advances in these two centuries is the progress we have made in
classical economics. When Adam Smith wrote “The Wealth of
Nations” or even when Karl Marx wrote “Das
Kapital”, they understood capital to mean simply plant,
machinery and money. But we have come to understand that there is such
a thing as human, social and intellectual capital. We have come to
realise that a well-functioning judicial system or an excellent
education system are just as much a part 
<?notus-xml column=114?>of the wealth of a nation as its roads, its ports or
its factories. The irony is that economists and economies have not yet
caught up with the most important capital of all—natural
capital. Virtually every other form of capital is derived in some way
from natural capital and we can define it as the benefits that accrue
to human society from the different species of life that inhabit the
natural
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000056">The
right hon. Member for Meriden, to whom I pay tribute, spoke about
pollination services. I remember that in 2006, when I was Minister with
responsibility for biodiversity, I put £6 million into the
Department’s budget submission for research into diseases in
honey bees. When it came to agreeing DEFRA’s budget, the
Treasury was not impressed. It insisted that times were hard and that
with my £6 million it could create a new community hospital for
people’s diseases, rather than worrying about bee diseases. I of
course told the Treasury officials that I would be happy to cut the
£6 million, but I asked them if they were aware that it would
cost them £194 million a year. I explained that a recent
National Audit Office report had pointed out that diseases in the honey
bee population had reduced the pollination services that bees were able
to carry out. This had reduced the yield from our arable crops, which
in turn had reduced the revenue paid to the Exchequer by £200
million a year. The Treasury gave us the £6
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000057">The
thing about Treasury officials is that they are simple beasts. They do
not want to know about the environment or ecosystem services, but show
them a way to save money and they become entirely reasonable. Classical
economics values things in a very simple way. Take forests, for
example. Classical economics simply adds the sale price of the timber
that can be harvested and the alternative use to which the land may be
put and says that this is the value of the forest. What utter nonsense.
The true value of a forest lies in far more than that. Forests stop
soil erosion. They prevent flooding by absorbing moisture and they
control climate, often regulating local as well as global weather
patterns. They are a source of medicines and food and they have
recreational and aesthetic value, and all that is before we even begin
to consider
sequestration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000058">In
the millennium ecosystem assessment, 1,360 of the world’s top
scientists showed that classical economics captured only one third of
the actual value of the services that forests provide. The same is true
for rivers, reefs, salt marshes, mangroves and all other natural
ecosystems. We fail to factor their actual economic value into our
policies and decision making, but because most of the other services
that they provide are not bought or sold in markets, they are not
normally taken into account, so the forests, reefs and rivers are lost
or
degraded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000059">Another
important consideration is that those wider benefits, although
immensely valuable, do not accrue to an individual property owner. The
benefits are experienced by the community at large. They are regarded
as free goods by the wider community and the wider economy. In
classical economics such free goods are called externalities, and
because they are not directly captured by the landowner they do not
feature directly in the landowner’s decision of how and whether
to dispose of
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000060">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T21:19:24"></hs_TimeCode>
use nature because it is valuable, but we abuse it because it is free.
A nation’s GDP certainly increases every time money changes
hands, but a growing GDP 
<?notus-xml column=115?>does not always create wealth. Many economic activities actually deplete
wealth. The irony is that nations count that depletion as income,
whereas they should see it as liquidation of capital. In fact, the
TEEB—The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity—report,
edited by Pavan Sukhdev, has already shown that at current rates of
decline the cumulative loss of ecosystem services from 2000 until 2050
will be equivalent to losing 7% of global
GDP<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T21:20:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
Here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T21:24:22"></hs_TimeCode> is the
challenge: how do we explain to those focused on GDP growth that they

in more detail a little later—is to get each Department to

that we must sacrifice the environment in order to achieve growth. But

is simply put the other way around: that economic growth is the enemy
of the environment. Their conclusion is that we must sacrifice growth
to achieve environmental protection. Both are wrong, of course, and
they are wrong because they are locked into the same language of
economic growth and environmental protection. They have failed to move

biodiversity offsetting knows that there is a hierarchy of principles
that it must follow, foremost among which is that offsetting cannot
downgrade or amend the existing levels of protection for biodiversity.
The Secretary of State, by his ignorant, 
<?notus-xml column=118?>unscientific and dogma-driven approach, has shown himself to be
incapable of leading the Government’s important work on natural
capital and has probably done more to undermine the undoubted benefits
that could flow from a proper system of biodiversity offsetting than
any of the open-toed-sandal anti-development campaigners whom he so
clearly despises

every Member who has spoken has said, the state of natural capital is a
crucial issue and the scale of the problem is great. Recent studies,
such as the national ecosystem assessment and the “State of

volunteers across the country. They have reinforced the

are constantly learning more about the complex mutual dependencies that
underpin our vital ecosystems, but we are also finding evidence that

the overall condition of the natural environment is a cause for
concern, we should also acknowledge that there have been some
significant success stories that demonstrate what can be achieved when
there is a will to do so. For example, environmental legislation has
helped to transform many of our watercourses, and rivers that were once
notoriously polluted now sustain a variety of wildlife.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T21:35:55"></hs_TimeCode> course,
although these successes are heartening, important aspects of our
natural environment are still in decline. The status quo is therefore

I reassure Members that the NCC is currently in discussions with the
Treasury and DEFRA about developing the green book so that we can take

matters. It underpins fundamental aspects of all our lives. We rely on
natural capital for the air that we breathe, the food that we eat and
the water that we drink. It is also a crucial source of energy and
well-being. It will play a central role in mitigating the potential
impacts of climate change. It may even provide the key to scientific

appreciation of nature’s intrinsic value, the importance of
which many Members have highlighted, is demonstrated by the large

However, it is important that we do not see valuing nature as just a
dry, academic exercise that is performed by accountants. The natural
capital agenda must, and will, have a practical application that will
lead to real outcomes in our natural environment. If we want to protect
nature, we need to make better decisions about how we use it. Those

and corporate accounting, which was mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T21:46:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brent North, good progress is being made. On national natural
capital accounting, the NCC is working closely with the ONS and DEFRA
to implement the road map to 2020 that the ONS published in December
2012, setting out its timetable for producing natural capital accounts.
On the corporate side, the NCC is engaging with a series of major
businesses and landowners. It is about to undertake a series of pilot
projects with a selection of those businesses in order to trial natural
capital accounting in a real-world context and see whether it is an
effective tool for encouraging businesses to operate on a more
sustainable
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000104">Let
me touch on some of the points that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T21:47:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Beverley and Holderness raised at the end of his
contribution. He asked for a response to each of the 13
recommendations, and as I have said, I will take his comments back to
my noble Friend Lord de Mauley. A lot of those recommendations are
being taken forward by the NCC, and many others are addressed in the
good “Accounting for the value of nature in the UK”
report by the
ONS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000105">A
number of Members asked whether we believe that the framework should be
developed, and the Government agree that it should be. That is a task
for the NCC, which is working further on that. Importantly, the
committee is not doing just a single one-off report that is then placed
in the Government’s hands; it is continuing to work on many of
these elements. Many hon. Members raised the importance of developing a
risk register, and I confirm that the second report from the committee
will look further at a risk register and at highlighting those areas
where we use our natural environment in an unsustainable way. The next
report will contain the first steps in that direction.</hs_Para>

we are very much looking forward to the NCC’s second report, due
to be published in spring 2014, and to the more specific

his finger on one of the most important challenges that we face. For
the most part, we are a group of the usual suspects, talking about
natural capital late at night. In the Tea Room earlier, a colleague
said, “In eight years in this place, I have never looked at the
title of the debate and not known what it was about—until now.
Well done, Graham, you’ve got a debate I don’t
understand.” My hon. Friend correctly identified the importance
not only of the Breconshire young farmers, but of communicating
properly with them so they understand what on earth we are talking
about. If we do not achieve that, in a few years, the same group of
usual suspects will be discussing the topic without wider

reversing environmental loss. He spoke with both passion and knowledge

people in the Treasury could be reasonable as long as we speak to them
in their language. He gave us two quotes. First, he said that we use
nature because it is valuable, but abuse it because it is free, which
goes to the heart of the debate. Secondly, in defence of that approach,
he said that promoting the concept of natural capital was not to
commoditise nature, but to ensure its
protection.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0003.htm#13102130000116">We

I was in my early twenties, my father had a stroke. He was sent home
from hospital, an extra rail was put on the stairs, he was given a
walking stick and consigned to the care of my mother. He received very
little help and support, and we did not know what to expect or how best
to help him. I watched him struggle desperately hard to get better, but
we did not know how best to support him.</hs_Para>

father had a second stroke and died. Nowadays, his chances of a
physical recovery would be very much better. The previous Labour
Government’s investment in stroke networks and specialist stroke
units have improved the outcome for stroke patients hugely. More people
are now admitted to a specialist stroke unit, more people who can
benefit from clot-busting drugs get them, and two thirds of people get
a brain scan within 24 hours. There is a lot more to do, but there is
no doubt that great progress has been made. However, our investment and
progress in the psychological and emotional support of stroke survivors
has not kept pace with physical care, despite the fact that stroke is
the biggest single cause of severe disability in adults.</hs_Para>

cannot prepare for a stroke, because it is a sudden and catastrophic
event. If the part of the brain that deals with emotions is affected,
many people find themselves thinking, feeling and behaving in an
entirely different way. Many suffer feelings of anger and frustration
because they can no longer work, care for their families or do even
simple tasks. It is not surprising, therefore, that anxiety and
depression often result. Families, too, can find themselves in a
difficult position, sometimes in the worst cases grieving for the
person they have lost while still taking care of that person.</hs_Para>

emotional and psychological effect of stroke was set out by the Stroke
Association last year in its report, “Feeling

people who came to the parliamentary reception we held and were kind
enough to share their experiences with me. The effects can be seen in
all age groups, but are particularly severe in the 30 to 59 age group,
where 76% of people who responded to the Stroke Association’s
survey reported feeling severe anxiety and 69% suffered from
depression. People find that they lose control of their emotions after
a stroke, and it is estimated that two thirds suffer from
post-traumatic stress. Despite that, we do not have the services in
place to support them. In response to the survey, 42% felt abandoned
when they left hospital, and two thirds said that their psychological
care did not match the physical care that they received.</hs_Para>

properly led, multidisciplinary team could save £108,000 in NHS
social care costs in two years. When the King’s Fund researched
the link between long-term conditions and depression, it found that
care costs for those who suffered from depression and a long-term
condition were about 45% higher, typically, than for those who did not
suffer from depression. Moreover, depression can increase the risk of
another cardiovascular incident—in other words, of a stroke. A
person is one and a half times more likely to have another stroke if
they suffer from
depression<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:02:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000135">We
should be taking seriously the need for psychological and emotional
support after a stroke. We ought to be doing three things in
particular. First, we need to see psychological support as an essential
part of the care pathway for stroke survivors. At the moment, only half
of stroke units have access to psychological support. That needs to
change, and I should like to hear from the Minister what she plans to
do about recruiting more 
<?notus-xml column=127?>clinical psychologists and putting in place those multidisciplinary
teams to support stroke
survivors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:03:33"></hs_TimeCode>. We
ought to recognise, too, that the need for support is not a one-off; it
might occur throughout life. That is particularly true, for instance,
for children or young people who have suffered a stroke. We do not
think of stroke as a disease of the young, but it can be, and young
people often need support at particular moments in their
lives—when they start school or dating or when they move away
from home, for example.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102130000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000136">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:04:06"></hs_TimeCode>,
we must ensure that people get timely and accurate information about
the services available to them, whether in the voluntary sector or in
health and social care. At the moment, trusts differ enormously in the
information they provide to people. We must also ensure that those who
suffer from aphasia are talked through the information and helped to
understand what is available to them. The voluntary sector has an
important role to play in this. Many people find stroke clubs extremely
helpful, for example. People who have suffered a stroke often feel
alone, and mixing with others who have been through the same thing,
learning from their experience and going out and socialising with them
can be of enormous benefit.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102130000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000137"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:05:00"></hs_TimeCode>Thirdly,
I should like the Minister to pay attention to the need for all stroke
survivors to get a proper assessment of their health and social care
needs, and a written care plan. Although that should happen at the
moment, people are telling the Stroke Association that they do not
always get that assessment. In fact, one survey discovered that only
39% of respondents had had such an assessment, and that of those, only
60% got a written care plan. Good practice means that people should get
an assessment six weeks after leaving hospital, then at six months, and
annually thereafter. In fact, 47% of the people who said that they had
had an assessment only ever had one. That needs to change.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:06:00"></hs_TimeCode>It is also vital
that we support carers, and that they know the services that are
available to them. At the moment, two thirds of carers say that they
have received no support, help or advice on dealing with their
emotional problems, and only a quarter say that they feel supported
after the person they are caring for has left hospital.</hs_Para>

chair of the all-party parliamentary group on stroke, it has been my
privilege to meet some remarkable people. I have met young people who
are setting out on life with enthusiasm despite what has happened to
them, determined to make a life for themselves, to work and to be part
of the community. I have met people who have struggled with severe
disabilities but still gone on to help others. I have met people who
are determined to put something back into the community by setting up
stroke clubs or using art to help others, and who see that as their way
of paying back for the care that they have received. It has been an
enormous privilege to meet people like that, but at the moment, we as a
society are failing them by not giving them the help and support that
they need to make a life for themselves after stroke.</hs_Para>

hope that the Minister will see the importance of bringing about change
in this area by improving psychological services for stroke survivors
in the same way that we have improved their physical care in the past.

is one of England’s biggest killers. It is the single largest
cause of adult disability. Its effects can be devastating, both for
those who have a stroke and for their families and loved ones. It is
worth reiterating the great progress that has been made in tackling
stroke, particularly the physical aspects, in recent years. Many
thousands of people have benefited from that. Fewer people now die from
stroke; mortality rates dropped by 37% between 2001 and 2010.</hs_Para>

for stroke has improved in a number of areas, as the hon. Lady
mentioned. Stroke patients do better when they are treated on a stroke
unit, and over 83% of stroke patients now spend the majority of their
hospital stay on a stroke unit. Access to immediate brain scanning is
vital, and has improved considerably, as has access to clot-busting
drugs, which give people a better chance of regaining their
independence following a stroke. We all want that progress to continue,
and that is why stroke remains a priority for the Government and the
NHS. We also know, however, that we need to do more to improve support
for people after stroke, which is the subject of tonight’s
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000143">When
it comes to national incentives to improve outcomes, stroke is covered
in two parts of the NHS outcomes framework and the mandate to NHS
England. Through the mandate we are monitoring how the NHS performs
both in reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease, including
stroke, and in improving recovery from stroke. Some stroke survivors
are unfortunately left with long-term disabilities, as was said, so how
we support people with long-term conditions will be important to them.
Through the mandate, we are monitoring how the NHS is performing in
supporting people to look after themselves; whether a person is able to
live as normal a life as possible; and how successfully the NHS manages
long-term conditions by looking at unnecessary hospital admissions and
excessive length of stay in
hospital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:10:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000144"><B><Member ContinuationText="Helen Jones" PimsId="1207" UID="13102130000206" xid="316" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000206">Helen

Ellison:</Member></B> Quite. Because the focus of the framework
is about recovery from the stroke, it includes exactly what she
says—not just physical recovery, but psychological and emotional
recovery, too. Much of what we are trying to do is to set about getting
people on that full pathway towards recovery, not focusing only on
acute symptoms and the immediate aftermath of the
stroke.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000146">The
clinical commissioning group outcome indicator set mirrors the areas we
are monitoring for stroke and for long-term conditions. This is the
indicator set that will be used to hold CCGs to account and to provide
information for the public on the quality of
services and the health outcomes achieved
through that local 
<?notus-xml column=129?>commissioning. The CCG indicator set also contains
measures to ensure stroke survivors are discharged from hospital with a
joint health and care plan, and receive follow-up assessments within
about six months. I have heard what the hon. Lady said—that this
is not happening. I have taken note of it, and it will be discussed
with NHS England and all those responsible. It is our clear objective
to do that. I appreciate the information the hon. Lady has given us
about the Stroke Association’s work in monitoring whether it is
really happening. It is obviously a priority. The new Sentinel stroke
national audit programme will also monitor the outcomes of stroke care
in all patients six months after stroke.</hs_Para>

adult social care outcomes framework is helping us to gauge the
progress made by local services and to promote improvement in standards
across the country. A key area of the framework is to reduce the need
for care and support—exactly as the hon. Lady said—and
delay any dependency. Those measures will support the sector to
maximise people’s level of independence and minimise their need
for ongoing support. Under the framework, local authorities will be
able to compare their performance with that of other authorities around
the country—we obviously want everyone to match up to the
standards of the best—and to make improvements based on what has
been proven to work elsewhere. Through that common focus for
improvement, the NHS, public health and adult social care outcomes
promote joined-up, integrated care, driven by the needs of the
individual. For stroke survivors, this means providing access to the
support they need to get that better quality of
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:13:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000149">I
shall now deal more specifically with the issue of emotional and
psychological support for people who have had a stroke. The
cardiovascular disease outcomes strategy, published earlier this year,
recognises that stroke services that incorporate psychological care
deliver the best outcomes for people who have had a stroke. There are
also national stroke strategy recommendations and evidence-based
national guidance that patients should be routinely screened for mood
and cognition after their stroke. These recommendations are included in
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence quality standard
on stroke. That answers the question the hon. Lady posed about whether
these were at the heart of what we saw as best care—very much
so.</hs_Para>

course, the responsibility of NHS England and CCGs to ensure that
stroke patients receive the psychological and emotional support they
need. NHS England recognises that this area of stroke care is of great
importance for many patients. Improvement in community services with
greater access to early supported discharge teams and longer-term
rehabilitation is also high on NHS England’s
agenda.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000151">NHS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:15:24"></hs_TimeCode>
England is also exploring ways of improving the use of existing
resources. The hon. Lady will be aware of Improving Access to
Psychological Therapies, 
<?notus-xml column=130?>an NHS programme that is rolling out services across
England that offer interventions for people with
depression and anxiety disorders. Many areas now have IAPT, which
benefits people including those who are suffering from symptoms
following a stroke. I understand that there have been discussions about
how the IAPT teams might increase the proportion of the time that they
spend with people whose psychological problems are secondary to
physical disease, but are none the less important and—as the
hon. Lady said—sometimes become more important as time goes
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:15:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000152">Some
IAPT services have developed psychological support skills through
enhancing the training of nurses and therapists, and some have employed
the services of counsellors to support people who have had strokes in
the community. I know that some of the good local examples of support
for stroke survivors and their families are in the hon. Lady’s
constituency. She will be well acquainted with initiatives such as the
family support service, which helps stroke survivors and their families
to adjust to life after a stroke, and the communication support
service, which helps people with aphasia and other communication
problems to cope. Stroke sufferers and their families can also receive
emotional and psychological support via the local IAPT
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T22:16:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102130000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0004.htm#13102130000153">It
is for NHS England to consider how to spread best practice from
services such as those in Warrington, using some of the frameworks that
I have described. However, I am glad that the hon. Lady has taken this

November 2010. We have also made available to the NHS additional
funding of £400 million between 2011 and 2015 so that carers can
be given much-needed breaks to sustain them in their caring role.
Carers are central to the Government’s proposals for care and
support, and, as the hon. Lady will know, the Care Bill offers
significant improvements in that regard. I am sure that we shall hear

with the Stroke Association. I have read the association’s 10

the passage of the Bill, there has been much debate about the needs of

also met with various health organisations and charities and parents
and children (with long-term medical conditions) to listen and discuss
this issue. While a vast majority of schools take these issues
seriously, it is clear some families have had poor experiences. This
new duty, underpinned by statutory guidance, will help schools to
ensure that they are taking reasonable action to support children with
medical conditions, where necessary. It will also give parents of such
children confidence that support should be in place while they are at
school.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1310211000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/wmstext/131021m0001.htm#1310211000037">It

and family planning. This is based on our work through the 3 millennium
development goal (3MDG) fund, to which the UK has allocated up to
£80 million. The 3MDG fund also supports the national response
to TB and malaria in Burma and works to strengthen important systems
for the delivery of health services. The UK also supports a regional

Underhill review also examined the costs regime in detail and concluded
that there was no reason to change the substantive criteria for
awarding costs or wasted costs. Government has accepted this
assessment. However, from 29 July, claimants now have to pay a fee to
bring an employment tribunal case. Fees will help claimants consider
whether alternative forms of dispute resolution, such as the free
conciliation service provided by ACAS, would be more appropriate for
resolving their workplace disputes. Also, from April 2014, prospective
claimants will need to contact ACAS and consider early conciliation
before they are able to proceed to an employment tribunal. Both
measures should help to discourage individuals from bringing unfounded
claims.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13102135000008" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/text/131021w0001.htm#13102135000008">Housing

Wright:</Member></B> The Government is committed to implementing
section 139 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders
Act 2012, which reforms the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. The
essential prerequisite for the commencement of the reforms is to put in
place a system for producing basic disclosure certificates, which show
unspent convictions, which reflects the new rehabilitation periods for
England and Wales. Until we do that there would be no way for an
individual to obtain an official statement of their unspent convictions
under the new
rules.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102135000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/text/131021w0001.htm#13102135000083">Currently,
basic disclosures reflecting the existing rehabilitation periods are
only available from Disclosure Scotland and this service is provided to
residents of England and Wales as well as Scotland. However, the
reforms to the 1974 Act only revise rehabilitation periods for England
and Wales, leaving the position in Scotland unchanged under its
legislation. This complicates matters and creates two different
rehabilitation regimes within the UK, which means that there are
significant business and technical issues to work
through.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102135000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/text/131021w0001.htm#13102135000084">The

In Household Below Average Income, a household is defined as a single
person or group of people living at the same address as their only or
main residence, who either share one meal together or share the living
accommodation. This differs from a benefit unit (family), which is
defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting couple, plus any
dependent children. From January 2006 same-sex partners (civil partners
and cohabitees) are also included in the same benefit unit. A household
will consist of one or more benefit units. The figures above are based
on
households.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.
The data provided is for households containing families with pensioners
and for households containing families with children; rather than for
pensioners and for families with

BHC refers to income before housing costs have been deducted; while AHC
refers to income after housing costs have been deducted. Housing costs
include; rent (gross of housing benefit); water rates, community water
charges and council water charges; mortgage interest payments;

McVey:</Member></B> At the current time the establishment of a single
fraud service within DWP is a recommendation and we are now working
closely with HR and legal colleagues to establish the full staffing
impacts. The Single Fraud Investigation Service business case includes
an assumption on potential transfers if transfer of undertakings
(protection of employment) regulations (TUPE) was deemed to apply. This
volume was simply an assumption and should not be seen as a target or
limit. If we proceed on the basis that TUPE will apply, the actual

appropriate for resolving their workplace disputes. Also, from April

early conciliation before they are able to proceed to an employment

Population estimates for Woodchester are not available for the time
periods requested. Population estimates are calculated by catching the
animals, marking them and then subsequently recapturing them, in order
to calculate probability of capture for a given time period. Robust
population estimates for the current year, 2013, can only be made once

using non-human primates is a small, but currently vital, part of work

primates are used for the safety assessment of novel pharmaceuticals in
cases where they are the most appropriate and scientifically justified
species. They are also used in basic research to better understand how
the brain works. In fact, 2011 figures were unusually low, so the
apparent increase in 2012 is largely a reflection of

number of animals likely to be used in any given year is dependent on
many factors, including investment in research and development,
strategic decisions by funding bodies, global economic trends and
scientific innovation. Although progress is being made with alternative
methods, increased funding of scientific research has the potential to
increase both animal and non-animal work. The increased animal use in
recent years reflects new research trends, increased investment, and
changes in regulatory requirements and does not mean that efforts to

failing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310223000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/text/131021w0002.htm#1310223000329">In

consulted, following the High Court judgment in the Hughes Chang case,
and made revisions to Code C under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984 (PACE) to comply with the ruling in that case in relation to
17-year-olds and appropriate adults. Some responses to the consultation
suggested amending primary legislation associated with juveniles,
specifically in sections 38(6) and section 65 of PACE. We will consider
all legislation which appears to treat 17-year-olds as adults in the

caring on the carer, and the outcomes that they wish to achieve. This
