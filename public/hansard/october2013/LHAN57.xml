Zero-hours contracts are not new, but since 2005 there has been an
increase in their use. More recently, government has been made aware of
anecdotal evidence that has highlighted instances of abuse. As a
result, the Business Secretary of State announced that his officials
would undertake a fact-finding exercise to explore how these contracts
work and what the issues are. This was undertaken over the summer. On
16 September, the Business Secretary said that he would publish a
consultation seeking views on zero-hours contracts and on how to
address the concerns raised in the summer fact-finding exercise. The
consultation will be published in
mid-November<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:11:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Opportunities for zero-hours contracts allow, for example, students to
enter the labour market. I have heard about instances of workers who
used to work on the Tornado project using their legacy engineering
skills in just such a way. They were particularly happy to do that.
Also, zero-hours contracts particularly help the partially retired, who
can work in a scaled-back

zero-hour contracts—this is one thing that the consultation will
look at—is how employers and employees enter into them. Although
there is nothing wrong per se with the contracts, you get opaqueness
where there are differences of opinion or a lack of transparency in the
contracts between the employer and the

Razzall (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may follow up on the
supplementary question of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley
Abbotts. I am sure that the Government recognise that zero-hours
contracts are absolutely essential in the pub and restaurant business,
and often suit young people who want to work only certain hours. Does
the Minister accept that this makes it even more important that the
Government get the balance right between the use of these contracts and
the abuse of the

consultation is designed to be wide-ranging. We do not have a closure
date for it because it is important that we go into all the issues
surrounding zero-hours contracts, including who is involved in them and
the numbers of people. There is definitely opaqueness there; my noble

point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Morgan of Ely" PimsId="5924" UID="13102355000284" xid="2134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000284">Baroness
Morgan of Ely (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, Wales has a higher
proportion of people working on low pay than the rest of the UK,
including many who are in insecure jobs. About 50,000 of them are on

not know from one day to the next whether they have work, they are

moment?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000013"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:15:15"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13102355000285" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000285">Viscount

Baroness to the fact that there is a recovery going on. Indeed, the
employment rate was 71.7% and 
<?notus-xml column=997?>the unemployment rate was 7.7%, so progress is definitely being made,
but there is more work to do. In terms of the contracts in Wales to
which the noble Baroness referred, again, this is one of the issues we
will be looking at as part of the consultation. It is not a good thing
if contracts are entered into with both parties being unhappy with the

Christopher (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, there is an issue that goes
beyond that of zero hours. It was revealed today that the Revenue is
investigating around 120 care homes and care-worker firms
where the contract is not really one of zero hours—although that
is technically what they are calling it—but zero minutes. They
are not paying the full basic wage or for travelling time. The
implication there goes beyond the issue of zero hours, which I think is
disgraceful; there are also the possible consequences in care firms if
they go out of
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:16:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> The noble Lord raises an important
point; we are aware that low pay is an issue for workers in the care
sector. HMRC, which enforces the minimum wage on behalf of the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, has been actively
conducting enforcement activity in this area. Some investigations are
very much ongoing and HMRC has identified relatively high levels of
non-compliance, particularly with the national minimum wage. A full
project evaluation is being carried out by HMRC and will be completed

Hunt of Kings Heath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps we can come
back to the issue raised about care workers. It is widely reported that
thousands of care workers are employed under zero-based
contracts—often, as my noble friend Lord Christopher said,
delivering care visits of no more than 15 minutes while not being paid
for transport or time costs between visits to 
<?notus-xml column=998?>different care settings. Much of that arises from the commissioning

(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, we want all schools to follow the example
of the best and provide inspiring careers advice for young people. The
new statutory duty is an important step towards this. However, evidence
from Barnardo’s and Ofsted’s review of careers guidance
confirms that there is considerably more to do to bring all schools up
to the standard of the best. On 10 September, the Government announced
further support for schools in this regard. Proposals include
publishing revised statutory guidance and improving national careers

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister
very much for that reply. Clearly, the best is regular individual
face-to-face sessions with all young people from key stage 3 when they
enter school. Unfortunately, that is the very thing that Ofsted and
Barnardo’s say is lacking in many schools, particularly for the
middle-attaining inbetweeners who are still expected to get their
career advice from computers. How much longer will the Government stand
by and let this poor practice continue when what is needed is a very
simple guarantee of face-to-face careers guidance for all young people
who would like

Nash:</Member></B> I think that the noble Baroness’s ambitions
and objectives for careers guidance are the same as mine. However, I
disagree that the gold standard is a face-to-face interview with a
careers adviser. The gold standard is what all good schools do, which
is to seek to identify their pupils’ passions, interests,
aptitudes, strengths and weaknesses at an early stage and to work with
them throughout their time at school to provide a direct line of sight
and contact with the 
<?notus-xml column=999?>workplace. That is what a good education is all about. A few interviews
at the end of your time in school is a poor substitute for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:21:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Brinton" PimsId="5945" UID="13102355000298" xid="2149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000298">Baroness
Brinton (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, given that the Ofsted report said
that three out of four schools were not working well with the new
arrangement, despite a handful of excellent examples, this is a
devastating indictment. The Barnardo’s research shows that
pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds need that face-to-face quality,
independent advice. In the recent Education Act, the new code of
practice said that vulnerable pupils need this face-to-face advice.

“a devastating indictment”. The previous Connexions
regime did not work and hardly anyone, from Ofsted to Alan Milburn, had
a good word to say about it. That is pretty devastating. There is clear
guidance on pupils who will specifically benefit from face-to-face
advice—disadvantaged pupils and those with learning difficulties
or disabilities. I think that I have made my position clear. What we

recommendations was that intergenerational equity could be improved if
pensioners paid a higher share. That has not been the view that the
Government have taken. Particularly given the very high levels of
pensioner poverty, against which many noble Lords have campaigned over
many years, we have taken the view that the real value of pensions
should be protected during this period of fiscal consolidation.
However, we accept that there may be more to be done. Indeed, for
people who receive payments such as the winter fuel allowance, there
are now a number of voluntary schemes under which they can make that
payment available via charities so that it can be used for people on

as the commission points out, is to get more people into

NEETs has fallen consecutively over many quarters, the number of people
in work increased by 155,000 in the last quarter and the proportion of
the population in work is at a record level. We on this side of the

today, Ineos made a statement confirming the decision of its
shareholders to place the Grangemouth petrochemicals plant into
liquidation, which puts 800 jobs at risk. The Government are
saddened by this move, particularly because of the uncertainty it will
bring for the workforce and all those who indirectly owe their
livelihood to the Grangemouth plant. The Government do not
underestimate the plant’s importance to the local community.
While respecting the right of Ineos to make this decision, it is
regrettable that both parties have not managed to negotiate a fair and
equitable settlement that delivers a viable business model for the
plant. Even at this late stage, the Government urge them to continue a
dialogue, and we will offer all possible help and support on that. We
want this petrochemicals plant to stay open if at all possible, but if
redundancies are made, support will be available from the Partnership

agreement on the way forward? Quite frankly, the idea of finding a
purchaser is a complete red herring. This plant is losing money on a
substantial scale and it will be necessary for both sides to give way.

I may be forgiven, I will go back a little bit in time to when I was
Chancellor in the 1980s. As a result of what came to light with the
collapse of the Johnson Matthey bank, and the total failure of
supervision exercised by the Bank of England, which at that time had
that responsibility, I became concerned about the quality of banking
supervision in this country. I therefore introduced what became the
Banking Act 1987 in order to greatly enhance the quality of bank
supervision and bank regulation in the United Kingdom. If I may say, it
was not helpful that the Labour Government tore that system up in 1997,
but that is another
story.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102355000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000257">4

things that concerned me was the lack of any intercourse between bank
supervisors and bank auditors. Indeed, it was prevented because the
duty of commercial confidentiality in those days meant that bank
auditors could not speak to the regulators or the supervisors. That
seemed extremely damaging. A dialogue between the auditors and the
supervisors is particularly important, not just because the risks are
far greater when things go wrong in banking than in the automobile
industry or any other industry—as we know to our cost—but
because if the auditors of another kind of company are very concerned,
they might well qualify the

good reason, extremely reluctant ever to qualify the accounts of a
bank—I cannot even remember when it has ever been
done—because of course that might lead to a run on the bank and
cause a banking collapse, which would have huge repercussions. So it is
all the more important that they can talk confidentially to the

the Banking Act 1987, I broke down the iron curtain of confidentiality
between the auditors and the bank supervisors. I did not make it a
statutory duty—which I regret—because at that time the
Bank of England did not want it to be. But I wrote into the Act the
expectation that there would be—because there should
be—this dialogue between the auditors and the supervisors. So if
the auditors were troubled about something that was going on at a
particular bank and the bank did not seem to be remedying it, they
could tip off the supervisor. Equally, if the supervisor had reason to
be concerned about something that was happening at a particular bank,
they could ask the auditor to take a good look at
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000100">That
worked to begin with—but it did not work. This is documented:
the meetings between the bank auditors and the bank supervisors became
less frequent over the years. In the run-up to the great crisis in 2008
there were virtually no meetings at all, and we all know that the
auditors were among the dogs that did not bark. They did not alert

major banks.</hs_para>

is not enough—we have been there before. We had the expectation
before, following the 1987 Act. To begin with that expectation was
fulfilled but increasingly it was not, and we know what disasters arose
from that. I therefore ask the Government—there is no difference
between us on the necessity of having this continuous, active dialogue
much more than once a year; we probably should have it on a quarterly
basis—whether there should be a statutory requirement. Given the
lamentable history of the period when it was not a statutory

104D concerns the form in which bank accounts are prepared and the
requirement—because we felt very strongly that the new
accounting system, IFRS, was totally inadequate, certainly so far as
banks are concerned; indeed, that proved to be so in the run-up to the
crisis—that there should be a requirement 
<?notus-xml column=1012?>in law for a second set of accounts. Those should not be prepared on the
IFRS basis but in a way that the supervisory and regulatory authorities
feel is necessary in order to give them the information they require.
They should be for the benefit of the regulators and supervisors and
should not be published in the first instance. However, if the PRA felt
that it was in the public interest that the second set of accounts be
published, it could require them to be published.</hs_para>

There were different difficulties with the historical cost basis but
the result of mark to market has meant that in many cases, purely
fictitious paper profits are in the accounts. Not only does that make
the bank look stronger than it really is but, of course, these are then
distributed in bonuses or whatever. It is a disaster. And

is probably true that there is a grudging acceptance of that throughout
many of the leaders of the accountancy profession. The problem is that
IFRS is enshrined in European Union law. Therefore, it cannot be

was chair in 2007 when the Treasury Committee looked at Northern Rock.
There were no meetings between the regulators and the auditors. The
auditors of Northern Rock received more income from consultancy for
Northern Rock than they did from audits. If I remember correctly, the
auditors wrote 10 letters on behalf of Northern Rock, from which they
gained £800,000. That is £80,000 a letter: not bad for a
day’s work. Again, if I remember correctly, there were about
seven meetings between the regulators and Northern Rock. At the time
the mentality in the Financial Services Authority was the bigger the
bank, the bigger the risk; the smaller the bank, the smaller the risk.
Of these seven meetings, four were conducted by phone. Three were
face-to-face, with no minutes taken. If you were the secretary of your
local community council or your golf club and came up with such
practice, you probably would not be the secretary at the end of the
year. The regulator, however, kept on swanning along. That practice was

what the risks were before. First, there has to be a duty on auditors
to raise these issues early with the supervisor. They knew
what lay ahead if the reckless approach continued. Secondly, and very
importantly, the auditors need to become more professional and sift
large numbers of high-impact, low-probability events so that the
regulator can understand what the risks are. Remember that the
regulator was operating on the basis of business models—the
profits and loss accounts of companies—which had nothing to do
with the regulator, so they never looked at that. That is why we ended
up with such huge scandals as PPI, interest rate swaps and whatever
else. Business models are crucial to the regulator, as they should be

earlier about nobody taking heed, there needs to be an increase in
credibility to ensure that all stakeholders pay attention to what

between auditors and the regulator, there has to be a less
compliance-driven and more comprehensive approach. There has to be an
enhanced role for the auditor as an independent expert to check and
challenge all the trivial and complex issues that banks present. There
has to be clear and unequivocal communication from the auditor to the
company, and it is important that the regulator is aware of that
information. From the auditors there has to be an insight into the
company’s risk management system. More than anything, there has
to be a universally consistent interpretation and application of

Flight (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly
support these two amendments and the points made by the
noble Lords, Lord Lawson and Lord McFall. I will add only the point
that IFRS renders accounts virtually impenetrable, and fund managers
have to convert them into a more understandable form of accounting to
understand what on earth is going on within the organisation. I have
been critical of IFRS for more than 10 years. The point was
made to me initially that this was not a matter for Parliament but for
the profession. It is of crucial importance to Parliament, because if
it leads to things such as the banking mess, the nation at large is
responsible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:24:08"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, pointed out, not only did it
exaggerate profits in good times and create fictitious profits on the
back of which excessive bonuses were paid, but it also exaggerates the
other way in bad times, and therefore arguably can lead to
an underappreciation of a bank’s strength. I had thought that
France and Germany had some sympathy with this view and,
notwithstanding other criticisms, I had been hopeful that the EU was
looking to address this issue. I am disappointed that, to date, nothing

also make the point that, going back 20 years, Switzerland actually put
a legal obligation on the auditors to do the compliance regulatory
checking. The auditors were then liable if they had not done their job
properly. I think it is a pity that Switzerland changed from that
practice because I thought that it worked extremely well. I am not
necessarily recommending it for this country but it was a novel idea,
and the auditors ought to know what is going on within a bank if they
have done their duty in auditing that bank properly. Switzerland has
since changed its approach. Indeed, it was after it did so that
Switzerland, too, encountered problems.</hs_para>

Something serious will have to be done by the Government or by the
profession about there being only three or four firms which audit all

arrangements for relationships with auditors, and indeed actuaries.

wholly resolved to make the arrangements for working closely with
auditors work extremely well. That is the nature of what they have done
in producing their codes of practice. If the noble Lord, Lord Lawson,
or any other noble Lord looks at the codes of practice, they will see a
very different intensity of engagement from any previous code. In
particular, for category 1 firms—which, I am sure, are the firms

Flight, made clear, investors have a completely different set of

meaningless. It is completely pro-cyclical in banking, which is the

bank—as a number of Members of this House do—you see a
different set of accounts as well. You see the management accounts
about how the bank is trading. You look at the bankbook and try to
assess the risks. Before IFRS came along, when times were good it was a
practice for prudent bankers to say that some of the loans might turn
bad and that it was necessary to put some provisions to one side. IFRS
has stopped that practice, although we were told in our committee that
IFRS is reconsidering the rules; its rules committee has recognised the
shortcomings of IFRS. A Member of this House has also written a very

McFall, noted that many accountancy firms provide both auditing and
consultancy services. Sometimes, the non-auditing services are more
valuable than the auditing services, which is a crazy situation. It is
a pity that the Bill does not address that because if, as auditor, you
ought to be saying some things with “rigour”—the
word quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, from an article by Mr
Woolf—how can you avoid a deep conflict of interest? I suggest,
and experience bears me out, that you cannot bring to the very
difficult task of auditing the rigour that is on occasions necessary to
bring a bank or a large company to heel and to ensure, as far as any
audit can, that some of the disasters we have seen are thereby
avoided.</hs_para>

I say, I am sorry that we are not addressing that issue in this Bill.
Perhaps it is not too late to table such a provision on Report.
However, I fear that a great deal is lacking. I think I am right in
saying that all the big four accountancy firms have been penalised or
fined many millions of pounds in the past few years. I remember that in
America, KPMG was fined more than $450 million for running fraudulent
tax schemes for years on end. What happens to these firms’
reputation and business? Very little does, as far as I can see. I
suggest to my noble friend Lord Lawson and his co-proposers of
Amendment 92 that it is not clear beyond peradventure that the bank
under consideration should not be present at these statutory meetings.
It may seem an obvious common-sense point that you cannot have such a
statutory meeting with somebody from the relevant bank being present.
However, given the cynicism of our world, we should make that clear.
Given that we are at a flexible stage of our consideration of the Bill,
if Amendment 92 goes forward, I recommend that that provision be
included in

disagree with the arguments put forward by my noble friend Lord Lawson
that the regulators should have access to the best available
information from the auditors and should be able to request the
information relating to the accounts that they want. What I am less
clear about from this discussion is whether there is a need for that to
be built into this legislation. I should be very grateful to my noble
friend the Minister if he would clarify whether there is anything in
the current law that prevents regulators doing exactly what these

my noble friend Lady Noakes, I sit on the board of a bank and on its
audit committee. Things have moved on considerably since
2008. It is clear to me that as regards the major banks, the PRA has
frequent confidential discussions with the auditors; and those are
perfectly proper. It is also clear to me that the PRA can, and does,
request information from the relevant bank in any form that it feels it
needs to have to perform its duties. Therefore, the question
is whether there is anything in the current legislation that would
allow an auditor to refuse to meet the PRA or to refuse to provide
information on the grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict.
Are those powers extant in existing legislation? Is there anything that
allows a bank to withhold financial information if it is requested by
the PRA? If those powers are already available, I am less clear what
these amendments would

Eatwell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is clear from remarks made
around the House that noble Lords support the intention of these
amendments—that there should be regular dialogue between the
regulators and auditors, and that accounts submitted to the regulators
should be fit for purpose and provide the relevant information to
inform their decision-making. I understand that the contested issue is
whether these meetings take place at the moment, and whether there are
sufficient codes of practice—or simply what is regarded as
normal practice—to enable these meetings to take place. However,
I do not think that that is enough. As my noble friend Lord Hollick
said, we have a responsibility to the

appropriate accounts are provided to the

92 seeks to strengthen quality engagement between auditors and
supervisors. We agree we want to accomplish that and the noble Lord,
Lord Eatwell, made the same point. The question is about the most
effective way to ensure it is consistently brought about and the
difference between us is about how we accomplish that. It may appear
attractive to require greater engagement in statute as a guard against
complacency in the future, but the clause risks weakening the auditor
dialogue and perpetuating the tick-box approach that was found wanting
in the last financial crisis. That was one of the most important
lessons about regulation we learnt from that crisis. The FSA was widely
criticised for measuring adherence to its rules—like how many
times you met the auditor—but not coming to an informed judgment
about the risks in individual companies and the wider market. That is
where the focus of our regulation needs to be.</hs_para>

private sector too long, but solving a major problem by legislating for
a number of meetings has never been the best way to get quality
outcomes to serious problems. The FSA was criticised, beforehand, for
not engaging enough with the auditors of the banks they supervised. The
then statutory requirement for regulators to meet with auditors at
least once per year simply became another process and the wider purpose
of the meetings was not properly developed. The whole point of the
Financial Services Act 2012 was to make sure such failing was addressed
and that the regulators follow a judgment-led approach to supervision.
This means that all enforcement activities must enhance the
regulators’ understanding of the business and the wider market
to better enable them to detect risks before problems become
serious.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000151">FSMA
now includes a new Section 339A—which deals with the powers to
which my noble friend referred—requiring the PRA to have
arrangements for sharing information and opinions with auditors of
PRA-authorised persons, and to publish a code of practice setting out
the way in which it will comply with this obligation. This code of
practice, which we have talked about, sets out the principles governing
the relationship between the regulators and bank auditors. The code has
been laid before Parliament, so provision has already been made, both
in and under FSMA, for a regular dialogue between the regulator and the
auditor. These requirements mark a change in focus away from 
<?notus-xml column=1021?>process—stipulating the number of meetings—to actual
outcomes: getting them to do the job properly. This requires regulators
to consider serious engagement with auditors and subjects their stated
approach to scrutiny so we can see if they are complying with the code
of conduct: it does not just fall away. This process is not
only more rigorous in the short term, but gives the opportunity for
parliamentary scrutiny when the codes of practice are laid before
Parliament and provides a check on potential complacency in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000152">My
noble friend Lord Lawson referred to the need to make sure the dialogue
was at least quarterly: the PRA code says that it should be. Most noble
Lords will not be familiar with the details of the code of practice,
but for the major firms—the ones that are perceived to represent
the greatest risk to the stability of the financial system—at
least three or four meetings per year are encouraged. This is a
risk-based approach and the meetings are: at least one routine
bilateral meeting between the lead audit partner and the supervisor;
one routine trilateral meeting between the lead audit partner,
supervisor and the chair of the firm’s audit committee; and one
bilateral meeting between the lead audit partner and supervisor in the
lead-up to and during the annual audit of
accounts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000153">Conversely,
the amendment’s legal requirement for more regulator meetings
with auditors would just follow in the footsteps of the tick-box policy
from before the crisis. I am really talking about the smaller, much
lower-risk firms, where the guidance is, generally speaking, for at
least one meeting a year. Having two meetings a year would simply
increase the workload of regulators and take them away from exercising
judgment and away from prioritising the most concerning engagements.
They would simply be setting up meetings, irrespective of individual
circumstances, just because they needed to fulfil a rigid requirement.
In our view, such rigidity would weaken engagement and impair the
regulators’ ability to adapt their approach as circumstances
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000154">Because
of all that, the Government remain unconvinced of the need to define
the frequency of this dialogue in statute, as the PRA code

relation to the second amendment, the Government have been clear that
the crisis highlighted deficiencies in accounting standards and the
fact that there was room for improvement. We all agree with that, and
that is what we said in our response to the final banking standards
report. The regulators must have the information they need to do the
job of safeguarding financial stability, and in some instances that may
require disclosure of financial information on a basis different from
that used by other audited bodies. In response to the noble Lord, Lord
Hollick, the PRA will have access to management accounts, for
example.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102355000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000156">In

of the initiative, and international requirements. From 2014, the new
Capital Requirements Directive IV will require banks to disclose
supplementary information which goes beyond the international financial

additional, separate set of accounts in the light of the extensive
prudential and other regulatory reporting requirements that are being
imposed through the CRD IV

I can assure noble Lords that, whatever the outcome of this review, the
powers that have been given to the regulators under the Financial
Services and Markets Act, as amended in 2012—this, again, goes
back to my noble friend asking about the existing powers—are
already sufficient to permit the regulators to do everything that this
amendment gives them the power to do. Their current powers would permit
the regulators to make rules requiring banks to prepare additional
accounts, to the extent that this is permissible under EU law, to
specify the principles that should govern the preparation of such
information and to make it public. To the extent that the amendment
merely gives the regulators the powers they already have and does not
require anything else of them, it is unnecessary. I therefore ask the

closer than he is on the first one, and he is very close to what I was
trying to say. He said that the Government are going to see whether
they can get an improvement. He referred to CRD IV, which goes some of
the way but is not entirely satisfactory. The only way that we will get
accounts in a form that is satisfactory for the regulators and the
supervisory requirements is if they ask for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:54:09"></hs_TimeCode>. He is
absolutely right that they can do that now. In practice, they could
have done it before the 2008 crash, but they did not. That is the
problem. Those of us who support the amendments are saying: once
bitten, twice shy. It could have been done before; it can be done now.
But it was not done before. Therefore there should be a statutory duty,

to do with box-ticking. They will be meetings of the kind that the
supervisor and the regulator find most useful. Those people will use
their discretion; there is no box to be ticked at all. That idea

<?notus-xml column=1023?>encouraged them to do so. However, although meetings

regulatory and supervisory system clearly failed badly. The regulators
were not primarily responsible; the bankers were primarily

badly, as did the auditors. We are all of us seeking to prevent that
sort of problem from occurring again, and part of that endeavour is to

subject was considered by the Independent Commission on
Banking—the Vickers commission—and one of its conclusions

risk-weighted assets was unsatisfactory. That is, incidentally, also
the considered view of the Bank of England and the PRA. One of the
reasons why that is unsatisfactory is
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:59:11"></hs_TimeCode> the amount
of risk with which
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:59:11"></hs_TimeCode> weights
particular assets is to a large extent subjective. It is done by the
banks, using their own models. The Basel people set a test for a whole
lot of different banks. They gave them all the same portfolio of assets
and asked the banks to risk-weight them. The difference between the
risk weighting of the overall package in one bank was getting on for
three times that of another. Indeed, for particular classes of assets,
the difference between the risk weighting of the banks was eight times.

commission, the Bank of England and the banking commission concluded
that a more robust and reliable basis for ensuring that banks are
prudent would be to lay down a leverage ratio—as our American

straightforward; it is the ratio between the capital of a bank and the
assets on its books. The Basel committee said that the capital should
be at least 3%, which is a very low level. That is why it is not
surprising that the Vickers commission, the Independent Commission on
Banking, said that it should be a little over 4%. The Government
rejected that on grounds which I and, I think, the commission found
inadequate. It is striking to note that in the United States, looking
at the major banks where there is a potential for systemic risk, the
ratio varies between 5% and 6%. When this was pointed out at Second
Reading, my noble friend the Minister replied that the Americans work
it out differently. I looked into this carefully and consulted the Bank
of England, and am assured that the difference in practice is

with the United States because the responsibility for setting the

Turnbull (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment and the
account given by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson. I shall add a bit of
background to this matter. For probably two decades, up to about 2004,
the leverage ratio of the British banking system fluctuated between 20%
and 25%. It then rose, reaching a peak in 2008 of somewhere over 40%.
The Government’s wish that the number of the leverage ratio
should not be greater than three implies that the limit of their
ambitions is to get this leverage ratio back to 33%, which is still, by
historical standards, a very high
ratio<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:09:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

very interesting chart in the Vickers commission report shows how risky
people thought assets were. It shows that they fell—this is the
assessment that banks put into their own models—between 2004 and
2008. How can anyone believe that 2008 was a year of greater financial
stability? I believe the way this came about was as follows. You said
in 2004, “I have a portfolio of commercial property and have not
lost a penny on it in the past 10 years, so I will give it a
weight of X”. You come to 2008, four or five years later, and
say, “I have still not lost any money on this, which tells me
that this portfolio is not as risky as I thought it was in 2004, so I
will give it a lower risk rating”. What is happening all the
time when you have an upswing is that, as the upswing gets riper and
riper, the risk weights go down and down, until there is a clash. The
whole purpose of having a leverage ratio is to provide a backstop to
that. One or two people argue that we should run on basic leverage
ratios alone but, in my view, both the leverage
ratios—unweighted and risk-weighted—should run in tandem.
Each provides a check on the other. Relying solely on risk-weighted
assets leads you into the farce of banks marking their 
<?notus-xml column=1026?>own homework and doing the opposite of what they
should be doing by marking things as less likely at precisely the
moment in the cycle where they become more
likely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:11:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000172">Another
argument that has come up in relation to 3% and 4% is that we must not
get out of step with regulation abroad. However, when it comes to
risk-weighted assets, the Government have accepted that they want to
impose a higher figure—partly because we have more systemically
important banks and it is important for a medium-sized economy running
a very large banking sector for that sector to be safe. When you say,
“Does that not mean that what we thought was a 3% figure should
move pari passu”, the answer is, “Oh no, we can’t
do that because we will get out of line with what everyone else is
doing”. But if you can do it for one of these measures, why can
you not do it for the other? I find that argument completely
unconvincing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000173">There
was a view in the commission that higher leverage ratios were a good
thing. However, that is not what this amendment is about. Although we
thought that, the amendment says that it should be the FPC that makes
the judgment. As my noble friend Lord Eatwell has pointed out, the
absurdity of hiring this super-duper, global-standard central banker
and then not giving him this essential tool until the very point at
which his contract ends is beyond
belief<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:12:44"></hs_TimeCode>. It seems
an absolutely simple point that the FPC should start this. Elsewhere in

is an argument that certain kinds of banks, particularly those with
low-risk assets, will find that this 4%, or the leverage ratio, becomes
the binding ratio. People making that argument cite, principally,
various former building societies. You have to look around and ask
where the biggest failure in Britain was. It was former building
societies thinking that they had a portfolio that was a good deal safer
than it really was. Some of them also got into quite a lot of
commercial real estate. Northern Rock, for example, would have been
well advised to have followed a leverage ratio of this kind. If it
turns out that the supply of mortgages is not adequate—although
we are doing lots of other things to promote it—you might want
to differentiate between one kind of organisation and another. That
should be done by the regulator as a derogation from a world in which
we are working with higher leverage ratios than the Government
currently
envisage.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102355000262" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000262">5.15

Blackwell:</Member></B> My Lords, from the discussion, I am once again
not clear on whether this needs to be built into the legislation in the
way that is being suggested. As the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, has
said, I do not think that anyone would now dispute that it is a useful
backstop to have a leverage ratio alongside the risk-weighted assets
calculation of capital. However, that is built into CRD 4, and the PRA
and FPC have recently demonstrated that they are perfectly capable of
anticipating that in terms of the capital guidance that they give to
institutions on the capital that they are required to hold.</hs_para>

about whether 3% is the right level or not. I can assure my noble
friend Lord Lawson that in the UK at least, whatever banks may have
done in the past, they would not get away with applying whatever risk
weighting they chose to devise against their own risk assets. All the
risk weightings applied in the risk-weighting process are reviewed
intensely by the PRA. It has to approve the internal model in order for
it to be used to assess your own risk capital, and that process is now
extremely well scrutinised by the
regulator.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102355000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102355000177">Nevertheless,
there is a good argument that, because the process is bound to be
imprecise, having a backstop of an overall leverage ratio makes sense.
I think that is generally agreed. However, if you make that leverage
ratio too restrictive, you may distort behaviour in a way that you do
not desire by encouraging banks and other financial institutions to put
too many of their assets into risky assets. If you have only a leverage
ratio that does not discriminate by risk, and you are allowed only to
hold that amount of assets, then you will stop risk weighting them and
simply go for the riskiest assets you can get within that overall
leverage ratio. The two have to work together. We should be careful
about believing that having too hard a biting overall leverage ratio
will reduce banks’ risks as it may work in the other

but I was responding to the points that were made by him and other
noble Lords in advancing their arguments. If you come down to the
question of “Does the PRA need more powers in order to enforce a
higher or more restrictive leverage ratio?” then it can, under
its existing powers, require capital add-ons to banks if it is not
satisfied with the risk weightings. That is the way it would deal with
it. It seems a slightly tangential point as to whether it is setting
the overall leverage ratio or whether it is setting the capital ratio
by other means. I should like to hear the Minister’s response on

financial institutions are appropriately capitalised. There is no

no dispute about that. That standard comes into force in 2018,
following a final calibration of the leverage ratio in the first half
of 2017 so that we get it right. Separately, at the European level the
European Banking Authority will undertake a review of the leverage
ratio with a view to the European Commission introducing legislation in
2017. The Government agree, and have consistently argued,
that banks must be subject to the binding minimum leverage ratio

have to take action on leverage between now and 2018 in advance of the

regulators already have extensive powers to address the issues raised
by this amendment. The FPC has broad powers to make recommendations to
the regulators, on a “comply or explain” basis, including
on leverage. The PRA has all the powers necessary—which we have
talked about—under Section 55M of the Financial Services

one day after the publication of the PCBS report containing this
recommendation—the PRA announced that it would require eight
major UK banks to meet a tougher leverage ratio than that prospectively
required by Basel III. They have already done that. That action
followed a March 2013 recommendation from the interim FPC to the PRA to
consider applying higher capital requirements to any major UK bank or
building society with concentrated exposures to vulnerable assets, or
where banks were highly leveraged relating to trading activities. Put

Eatwell:</Member></B> I am intrigued by that argument. The noble Lord
started off with a powerful argument for the necessity of a leverage
ratio that is allied with risk-weighted assets and other measures. He
is now saying that we do not need it because it is all there already.
Why, then, are we even bothering to think about introducing it in 2017
or 2018? As he said, we have all the powers already. He is absolutely
contradicting himself in a single speech. Will he also address the fact
that the Bank of England’s response today to the banking

Deighton:</Member></B> There was nothing contradictory in what I said,
but I will clarify it. For the longer term, we absolutely agree that we
need an internationally consistent standard that will work with a
minimum leverage ratio. In the mean time, before we are able to employ
that in a way that is consistent with how those rules work out, we have
the powers individually to make sure that leverage ratios exist which
protect the system. I do not think that there is anything contradictory
about that. It simply shows that in the short term we have the capacity
to protect the financial system, and that is exactly what the
regulators have done. There is nothing contradictory in that at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:44:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The
regulators have the powers to do what they need to do and
will continue to have those powers after international
agreement has been reached, at which point we will integrate them
through the power that we will give the FPC to set the varying leverage

to give noble Lords the international context, that international
agreement is on its way. It is in this context that the
Government’s commitment to providing the FPC with this
additional tool in its toolkit should be understood. Once the baseline
minimum level has been set, the Government have made clear their
intention to give the FPC an express power of direction to vary through
time the baseline leverage requirement for deposit takers and
investment firms, subject to it never being below the requirement, as
you would expect, determined by Basel III. The precise design of the
tool will therefore depend on the provisions of the relevant European
legislation. This is a mechanical reserve to ensure that they fit
together effectively. It would not make much sense to add this
macroprudential tool to the toolkit until the baseline has been
set. Indeed, as the FPC noted at its September meeting in
response to a recommendation directed to it by the PCBS,</hs_para>

work on the international standards is under development, in addition
to the powers described the FPC will also have specific powers
available to tackle systemic risk stemming from, for example, excessive
leverage or any identified issues with risk weights on one or more
classes of assets. In particular, the Government have already agreed
that the FPC should be made responsible for policy decisions on the
countercyclical capital buffer, which I think was a point raised
strongly before. That will be in the hands of the FPC. It will also be
given a power of direction over sectoral capital requirements. Those
would be deployed if concerns of bubbles in certain asset classes took
place—for example, in commercial property. The statutory
Financial Policy Committee gained its powers over sectoral capital
requirements on 1 April 2013, so that is already in place. For the

Deighton:</Member></B> I apologise to the noble Lord.
I was so excited about the first question that I forgot about the
second one. It is consistent with what I have already said that the FPC
intends to address this recommendation in that timescale, but a full
assessment will depend on the definition of leverage agreed
internationally, so it all rather depends. In terms of who is going to
implement it, as I said, the regulators already have the power to do
so. In June this year, they changed the ratios on our key eight
institutions to protect them in the mean time, so they have these
powers and they have exercised them. I think that is a killer

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, in some ways this has been a
rather puzzling debate. I warmly endorse what the noble Lord, Lord
Eatwell, said. This is one of the most important—if not the most
important—issue that we have to discuss in the course of this
extremely long Bill. For that reason alone, I think it likely that we
will wish to come back to it at Report. Meanwhile, I am encouraged to
some extent by what my noble friend the Minister said. However, he
seemed to be saying at least two completely different things, if not
three. One was that we would have to have the leverage ratio—we
are all in agreement that we have to have a leverage ratio—that
was internationally agreed. Then he said that we would also have
discretion, with the FPC, to decide the leverage ratio, and therefore
that there was no need for the amendment because the provision was
already
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102361000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102361000018">First,
I am not convinced that it is already there. I shall read very
carefully what the Minister said. When my right honourable friend the
Chancellor responded to the recommendation of the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards, he said nothing of the sort. Nor did
he say whether he disagreed with it. He said the first part of what my
noble friend said: namely, that we have to accept the international
standard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102361000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102361000019">There
are only two major global financial centres: New York and London. It is
important that we do what is right for our financial centre—and
the United States takes the same view. We should not rely on
international agreements. Too often it is the lowest common dominator
that is agreed. The United States is going its own way, particularly
with large banks. It realises that it is a major global financial
centre and that New York is so important to the American economy that
they have to get it
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102361000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102361000020">In the
United Kingdom, the banking and financial sector is even more important
to the British economy. In relative terms, it is five times as
important to our economy as the American banking and financial sector
is to theirs. Therefore, it is all the more important, if we are to
have a strong and successful financial centre and a strong and
successful economy in this country, to do what is
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102361000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102361000021">It is
quite clear that that means that we should have a leverage ratio that
may be the same as what is agreed internationally—if it is
agreed internationally—but may well be a more prudent one. It
certainly would not be a less prudent one, but it may be in the
interests of the City of London and the British economy that it should
be more prudent.</hs_para>

amendment states that the decision should be taken by the Financial
Policy Committee of the Bank of England. In a sense, my noble friend
agreed with that when he said that the duty was already there and that
we had given it to the committee. If that is so, it is good news.
However, I suspect that it is not entirely the case. Therefore, it is
very likely—in fact, more than likely—that we will come
back to this very important issue on Report. In the mean time, I beg
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13102361000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102361000062">Amendment

trading is speculative activity conducted by an institution entirely
for its own benefit, where no clients are involved at all. It uses its
own financial resources to conduct the speculative activity,

are two main reasons for this. One is that it can be exceedingly

other reason that it is dangerous for banks to do this is the issue of
culture. When the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards was set
up, one thing that we were charged to do was to look at the issue of
banking culture, because it was clear that it had gone radically wrong.
Two aspects of banking culture in particular are relevant here. One is
prudence. It always used to be the case—and it should now be the
case—that this is an essential part of the culture of any bank.
People put their deposits in banks thinking that it is a safe thing to
do because bankers are prudent. The other aspect of the culture is
service to clients. Of course, with proprietary trading, by definition
there is no client; there is no service to clients at all. It is pure
speculation on the financial markets, and on the
bank’s own books, without any clients being
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102361000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102361000027">That
is why my old friend Paul Volcker—whom I have known for many
years; he was chairman of the Fed when I first became Chancellor, and I
had a lot to do with him—lobbied the American Government to
introduce what was called the Volcker rule, which forbids American
banks from conducting proprietary trading. He did this for the same
reasons that I outlined. However, we did not go that
far.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102361000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102361000028">Incidentally,
it is interesting that proprietary trading was rife in British banking
before the crash. As much as 30% of the business of some banks was
proprietary trading. Now it has almost completely disappeared, in the
aftermath of the crash. The banks are saying, “Why are you
bothered about proprietary trading? We don't do it any more”.
That is true—they do not. But they will. They will come back, as
they did before. When they feel that they have got over the aftermath 
<?notus-xml column=1038?>of the disaster, and the blood is coursing rather

and that in three years’ time there should be a serious review
of this, which will take into account what is happening in the banking
world and will see how the Americans have got on with banning
proprietary trading for banks. I am not totally optimistic, because the
Americans have a crazy legislative system in which, once a piece of
legislation has been introduced, the legislators festoon it like a
Christmas tree with all sorts of baubles of this, that and the other.
The simple rule that Paul Volcker wanted has been encrusted

a review in three years’ time when the appropriate information

this clause in the legislation to ensure that that review takes place,
because it is so easy—given the exigencies of the
moment—for major issues, which were recognised as major in the
past, to be neglected because of day-to-day pressures. Therefore,

Higgins (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I also support my noble
friend’s amendment, but with some qualifications and a request
for some clarification. The amendment simply refers to
“proprietary trading by banks”; that does not distinguish
between one part of a ring-fenced bank and another. The arguments on
this issue are so clear that we should take a perfectly clear view that
there ought to be no proprietary trading whatever by any ring-fenced
bank.</hs_para>

need to wait three years for such an inquiry. My noble friend referred
to the Volcker rule in America; not all of us in this Chamber have Paul
Volcker as a personal friend, but I have great respect for him. He is
absolutely right that this should not be carrying on in the United
States. Although it may be that there has been a decrease for the
moment, over a period of three years the situation might change
somewhat. Therefore, we could take a clearer view on this between now
and Report than is set out in the amendment. As my noble friend has
pointed out, this is effectively the banks’ carrying out risky
trading on their own behalf—in the past, not infrequently, it
was risky trading on their own behalf with clients’
money—and this, again, is a crucial point. Perhaps we should
clarify that aspect of the matter, but I have not the slightest doubt
that this is a move in the right direction and I hope that we can make
rapid progress on

Turnbull:</Member></B> I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that it
is certainly not intended, while this activity might remain within a
banking group, that it should be done, under the plan, by a ring-fenced
bank. One of the reasons why we took the view that we should wait and
see is that the dividing line between a proprietary trade and a trade
on behalf of a customer is not straightforward, which is why it is very
difficult in the US. For example, if I lend the noble Lord money he may
seek some kind of hedge which I would provide. That might mean that my
position as the bank is no longer what I really want it to be. As a
bank, I would look around to see what my colleagues have done during
the course of the day, and we would then add up all the positions that
we have taken. We may well find that that position is not where we
really want to be, so on the following day the bank goes out and
undertakes a trade which gets it back to the degree of hedged position
that it wants. Was that a proprietary trade or was it a trade that was
a consequence of serving a
customer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:04:15"></hs_TimeCode>? That
is why this is actually very difficult and why we are wise to wait and
see whether workable definitions could be found of what constitutes
real proprietary trading and of what constitutes trading in response to
a customer. This measured amendment enables us to do precisely
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:04:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, the ICB considered in detail the case
for a ban on proprietary trading in the UK, but decided in favour of
ring-fencing. The PCBS heard evidence from a wide range of sources that
prop trading does not appear to play a large role in the UK at the
moment—as my noble friend Lord Lawson pointed out—nor did
it play a significant role in the financial crisis. The noble Lord,
Lord Turnbull, has already addressed the question of my noble friend
Lord Higgins, but it should of course be noted that the ring-fenced
banks will be banned from proprietary trading as well as from
market-making and other forms of trading activity that would expose
them to risks from global financial markets. Therefore, from a
prudential perspective, much of the risk posed by prop trading can be
addressed by a suitably robust ring-fence which is, of course, the
thrust of our legislation. This was the point made by the PRA in
response to questions from the
PCBS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:05:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the evidence heard by the PCBS also suggests that prop trading is
not necessarily the sole avenue for the cultural contamination of
banks. For example, the PCBS highlighted in its excellent report the
serious failings in culture and standards at HBOS, a bank which did not
engage in any prop trading at all. Indeed, it is perfectly possible to
run an integrated securities business with full integrity in a way that
manages any potential conflicts of interest quite satisfactorily, so
they do not necessarily follow. It is far from clear, therefore, that
prop trading is the real problem facing the UK financial system, or
that structural solutions address cultural problems. In light of that,
and of observations about the practical difficulties of a ban on prop
trading, as it is being attempted in the US through the Volcker rule,
the PCBS did not recommend a ban on prop
trading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:06:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102366000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102366000008">It
is not wholly clear what further evidence would support a different
conclusion to that reached by the PCBS in its own assessment, so it is
unclear what a further review into proprietary trading within such a
short period of the PCBS’s own report would add. Still less is
there a need for such a review to be followed immediately by an
independent review of the same question. Of course, we have no issue
with reviews as a matter of principle: we are just not sure that, in
this case, legislating for one in advance really does much for
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102366000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0001.htm#13102366000009">As the
findings of the PCBS do not suggest that prop trading presents a
serious prudential risk at this time, I do not think we need to
legislate for the regulator to carry out a further review. The
absolutely valid point made by my noble friend Lord Lawson was that
this could change in the future. That is what we are trying to address.
Should that happen, the PRA has made it clear that it already has the
powers it needs to bear down on prop trading where it endangers the
safety and soundness of a firm or where the risk incurred is not
consistent with the publicly stated risk appetite of a
bank.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102366000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102366000010">Moreover,
monitoring and reviewing all risks to a bank constitutes an essential
part of the PRA’s work. The PRA’s approach is to insist
that firms adopt and follow a risk appetite that is consistent with the
PRA’s statutory objective to promote the safety and soundness of
firms that it regulates. This will include regular monitoring and
review of all risks, not limited just to those associated with prop
trading. Therefore, to require the PRA by legislation to undertake such
a review seems unnecessary. Should we legislate for a review of how
reference rates are set, for example? Should we legislate for a review
of mis-selling practices? Why, therefore, should we do it for prop
trading? It is not apparent to me what problem a review would solve.
While I think that reviews can play a useful role, in this case we are
not sure that it is justified in advance.</hs_para>

need to give the regulator the space to allocate its resources in a way
that is appropriate and proportionate when considering all the

particular risk. Our more widely framed reporting requirements allow
for this. For all of these reasons, I do not think that a review on the
particular issue of prop trading is necessary. The regulators are
already subject to extensive 
<?notus-xml column=1041?>reporting requirements. I expect the PRA to make the
Treasury, and Parliament, aware of any emerging risks it identifies,
whether through prop trading or anything else. The deputy governor for

my comments. I think this issue was covered on the first day in

that proprietary trading for ring-fenced banks is not allowed; it is an
excluded activity, as defined. As my noble friend implies, there are
some exceptions to that which are predominantly related to a
bank’s own hedging activities to deal with its own surplus
liquidity. My noble friend’s phrasing was accurate and the issue

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, I think that there has been a
slight misunderstanding. My noble friend the Minister said that we have
gone down the ring-fencing route instead. That is a different matter
altogether. The idea of ring-fencing is to put a sharp barrier between
the commercial banking operations of a universal bank—the
lending to individuals and to small businesses and, indeed,
medium-sized businesses—and the investment banking activities.
There should be a line between them. There is also the great question,
which we debated earlier, as to whether there should be a total
separation. This is about whether a universal bank—I agree with
my noble friend that it would not be done in the ring-fenced
part—should be permitted to engage in proprietary trading at

is all very well to say that there may be cultural contamination as a
result of proprietary trading but that, as there are other forms of
cultural contamination as well, we should not bother about this one. I
do not buy that. If we can significantly reduce the amount of cultural
contamination by making proprietary trading by banks illegal, that is a
plus. There may still be other problems with the banking culture, but

conducting its inquiry was that it would be a very good idea
for banks not to engage in proprietary trading for some of the reasons

desirable and workable, that carries a great deal of weight with me. He
said that if a chief executive of a bank did not know whether or not he
was engaging in proprietary trading he ought to be fired. At one level
that is a perfectly good answer. Nevertheless, there is a complicated
issue of definition. That is why we have said that we should see how
things develop over the next three years and see whether there is a
workable system in the United States or whether those who say that it

operated continuously and has, hitherto at least, created a presumption
of being too big or too complex to fail, thereby creating an implicit
guarantee which can be exploited. Banks are highly interconnected and

are also very highly geared, as has been mentioned today. Their capital
structure is not at all like that of the general run of FTSE companies.
Equity counts for low single figures. Like the noble Lord, Lord Flight,
I read <I>Essays in</I> <I>Money and Banking</I><I> in Honour of R S
Sayers</I>, and the ratios were vastly higher in those days. As a
result, those running banks are incentivised to take risks and their
shareholders are incentivised to support them. Therefore, I think you
can rely less on countervailing pressure from shareholders to achieve
restraint in bank
remuneration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102366000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102366000023">Banks
are also special in the way they behave. Total remuneration has
increased hugely and takes a very high share of the total surplus
compared with dividends, taxation, retentions, building up capital and
so on. As has also been said today, cash bonuses have been paid on the
basis of mark-to-market profits which, in the end, proved ephemeral.
There is unlimited upside when remuneration takes the form of equity
but, unlike the old partnerships which have gradually been superseded,
there is limited downside.</hs_para>

premise that there should be something special for banks, what should
be the content of this regime? The first thing that should not be there
is what the EU and the European Parliament are trying to put

be counterproductive, pushing up base pay and reducing the quantum
which is provisional and, therefore, at risk of clawback. What should
be there is something about the proportion of variable pay that is
deferred and the time period over which it is deferred. The commission
recommended that some, not necessarily all, could be deferred for up to
10 years, in recognition of the cyclical nature of

strengthen clawback. The terms “clawback” and
“malus” sometimes get muddled up. Most of what people
have said is strengthening clawback is better described as malus. It is
where remuneration has been conditionally offered but not yet vested
and there is still the option of cancelling the vesting. This clause
suggests that, in the really serious case of a bank being run so badly
that it fails and ends up being taken into public ownership or
requiring the commitment of public money, even sums that have been
vested should be at risk. Some of this could be pension money. If
someone has paid for a pension regularly, through contributions, I
would, by and large, say it was their money. However, we have seen
instances where very large, discretionary amounts are paid into
people’s pension funds precisely in order to put them somewhere
where, hitherto, they have had immunity.</hs_para>

components of the amendments. You could go further. For example,
Charles Goodhart has argued that it is a mistake, in the case of banks,
to make variable pay take the form of shares because the shares are
highly geared and it would be better if a significant amount was not in
shares but in bailable bonds. This would limit the upside but that
value would not be transferred if the bank
failed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102366000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102366000027">What
is the scope of these arrangements? How far down the bank should they
go? They should certainly cover the senior managers’ regime.
What is offered below is not the licensing regime that we suggested

other issue is about which parts of banking should be covered. We came
across this argument and are still uncertain about whether it is those
people who work in entities which take deposits or whether it should
also cover people engaged in investment banking, which is the common
sense view. Another amendment in my name attempts—probably
unsuccessfully—to produce a definition which is wider than
simply those who are in banking entities which take deposits. However,
the noble Lord, Lord Newby, has written to a number of noble Lords
recognising this problem and undertaking—I hope he will confirm
this—to work with us to find a definition which covers the kind

whether this all needs legislation. I can confidently predict the noble
Lord’s response as we have had it at least three times today. I
think he will say, “We agree there is a need for a special
regime for 
<?notus-xml column=1045?>banks and we agree on lots of the components that should be
in it. We will work with you to agree the coverage, but we do not agree
that it needs to be in legislation as the PRA has all the powers that
it needs”. I think that is pretty much what is in his folder.
Why is the commission pressing for legislation? In the whole of the
financial crisis, two issues have infuriated the general
public. The first, which we dealt with last week, is the
absence or extreme weakness of personal accountability. The second is
the sense that the banks made the money but did not lose it in the bad
times. They were incentivised to excessive risk-taking: too
much upside, not enough downside. The public find the existing regime
incomprehensible and they want something done about it. In particular,
they want assurance that it cannot happen again. The way to ensure that
there is no backsliding is to provide the powers proposed in my
amendment. We should also set some of the parameters of what that
covers.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_23_PT_1/92408317660F3B428D3675CE92B574D77AD84036" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 October 2013">Wednesday,

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, we have already, on
some previous amendments, begun to discuss the issue of the culture
within banks and the culture which contributed significantly to the
disaster in the banking system of the past four or five years. Nowhere
does that bite become more evident than in the issue of remuneration.
There has been considerable disquiet about the sheer scale of
remuneration but this amendment, particularly in terms of the elements
listed under subsection (3), goes to the heart of the matter which is
the relationship between remuneration and risk-taking and the way
in which
remuneration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:20:00"></hs_TimeCode>
systems incentivised, to an extraordinary degree, risk-taking which
went way beyond the ability of the financial institution to manage it
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102370000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102370000002">If
we are to persist with the banking structure we now have in this
country, with very, very large banks—which are extremely
difficult to manage—dominating the banking scene, then it is
necessary to de-incentivise the risk-taking which did so much damage.
That is the most valuable element in this amendment. The elements to
which the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, referred are also important, but
we need to provide a clear statement that a remuneration code will be
developed which does not incentivise selling insurance or financial
instruments that individuals or firms do not need. This has been a
characteristic of banking in this country over the past four or five
years and has been directly incentivised by remuneration structures. We
have to remove that sort of structure by giving the FCA and the PRA the
responsibility to develop a code, expressed here in quite flexible
terms, without the excessive rigidity in current European Union
proposals. This is a very flexible structure but it focuses on the
exact issue of incentives and risk-taking. In that sense, I think that
it could achieve an enormous amount in changing the culture in British
banking and in ensuring that banking is more stable and significantly
safer than it has been in the

the wake of the economic debacles following 2008, one of the greatest
areas of concern among the public was the apparent lack of change in
the financial fortunes of those whom they viewed as being most
responsible for the banking crisis. As we have heard, the salaries of
senior bankers seem to remain high and bonus levels have quickly
regained their old levels, while for many ordinary people and ordinary
businesses across the country, it has been a matter of tightening the
belt and looking very seriously at difficult household and commercial
budget decisions. The submission of the Church of England’s

disjunction between these disconnected groups—the wider public,
who need the services of good banks, and those who lead those

been very sensible this afternoon, one with another, about what needs
to be done: striking an appropriate balance between risk and reward;
looking to the long-term benefits of decisions made by key figures in
the banks; and giving incentives for a trustworthy and productive
culture, rather than one that promotes excessive risks, ending in
disaster. Deferred remuneration, which we have in this proposal, and
clawback provisions —central components of the proposed
remuneration code—are technical terms, but at the heart of these
principles is a simple question: what sort of culture, as has been
mentioned by several noble Lords, do we want to establish in these
organisations? As the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of
Canterbury has already pointed out to the Committee, one rather well

many of our large banks may at last begin to enter not just the
policies of the banks and their structures and cultures but the
policies, structures and cultures of the leading executives in those
banks. I shall mention just one of those banks where these values
appear; in fact, I may not mention which bank it is because I think
that noble Lords should try to work out which one I am talking about.
Those values read: “Serving Customers”; “Working

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:48:32"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I am
not sure that I agree entirely with what my noble friend Lord Phillips
of Sudbury said about what happened 25 years ago in that the senior
management of investment banks—merchant banks, as we called them
then—did not enjoy variable remuneration. I worked for Kleinwort
Benson for 23 years, and then for Fleming for four years, and more
recently for the Japanese bank Mizuho for five years. To me, the
culture of Kleinwort Benson was absolutely excellent, honourable and
upright, even though it was doing investment

was a considerable cultural difference between the banking department
and the bond trading department, but that reflected the environments in
which the various 
<?notus-xml column=1050?>people were carrying out their activities. We should also remember that
even the asset management business was not separated at all at that
time, and there were obviously enormous conflicts between underwriting
securities and buying those same securities for clients’ managed
portfolios. Those conflicts were dealt with internally, because of the
overall culture, which was excellent. That was one of the reasons why
the City of London earned respect around the world, and other places
have attempted to model their own financial centres on what they
perceived to have been London’s

disasters that have befallen us, quite a lot of that regard and respect

In a command economy that may be the normal thing to do, but I do not

years, the interference in setting the variable remuneration of

increase in fixed salaries in all banks, including small banks and
Japanese banks which do not pay multimillion pound bonuses. The senior

ordinary hardworking people in this country. That is understandable
because they do not accept that a banker is worth thousands of times
more than a comparable engineer or anyone else. Inflation in salaries
has occurred over the past three or four years because of the limited
interference in variable remuneration that has already happened, and I
am certain that if we go as far as this amendment would take us, that

it was not one of the original accepting houses. The Bank of England
had an influence on the accepting houses, but they were rightly highly
regarded. Of course there were slip-ups from time to time, and there
always will be, but if we set up a framework that creates an

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support the
amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull. I know that my noble
friend Lord Higgins wants to give us the benefit of his wisdom, but
perhaps I may intervene now because I would like to explain to the
noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, why he has got completely the wrong end
of the stick in terms of what this amendment is about. I must say that
I was puzzled when he said that one of the reasons we got into
difficulties with banking was because of interference with
bankers’ remuneration. There has been no interference with
bankers’ remuneration at all. It is true that there is a
proposal from the European Union to cap bonuses, but that is not
something we have in this country and the Commission was explicit in
saying that we do not want to see it. This amendment has nothing to do
with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:53:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the structure of remuneration, not the quantum. We are not making a
statement about the quantum, but about the structure. I shall explain
why that is so. I am sure that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Birmingham will accept that nothing in this world is without flaws. I
yield to no one in my conviction that, for all its flaws, the market
system is the best system for conducting an economy and securing
economic prosperity for the benefit of the people of a country. One of
the essential elements of the market system, without which it cannot
work, is the fear of failure. However innovative, adventurous and
enterprising industrialists may be, they always know that if they get
it wrong, they will fail. The fear of failure is vital because it is an
essential market discipline. The problem in banking is that when you
have banks that are too big to fail, that fundamental discipline does
not work. That is the difficulty. If it is the case, as it was in the
management of the banks up to the crisis, of “Let’s
gamble, because heads I win, and tails the taxpayer loses”, you
are encouraging gambling. You are bound to see more recklessness, which
is exactly the reverse of what banks should be
doing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:55:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

referred to the good old days of the merchant banks. I knew them very
well. While I did not have the privilege of working in a merchant bank,
for a time I wrote the Lex column in the <I>Financial Times</I>, so I
got to know them. One of the reasons for their great success was that
although they were extremely innovative and they were staffed by very
clever people, on the whole they were partnerships, and the partners
had their own fortunes at stake. That was the vitally important
discipline, but that is not the case with the banks. Incidentally,
however, it is the case for hedge funds. I can recall, as will many
noble Lords, that some years back there were a few people who thought
there were dangers in the City and that some things might go wrong.
What did they point to? They pointed to the so-called shadow banking
system—the hedge funds. They thought that the big banks were
fine, but that those dodgy hedge funds might cause problems. In fact,
there were very few problems with them. Why was that? First, the hedge
funds knew that they were not too big to fail. They knew that they
would not be bailed out by the taxpayer. Secondly, on the whole, the
proprietors’ own money was invested in the hedge
fund<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:56:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

set out in the amendment is not the whole solution to this problem. We
have to make it possible for banks to fail, and that is part of what
the Government have been doing with the resolution procedures and the
bail-ins; we have read page after page on that. We have to enable banks
to fail because that is the only way we will get the right kind of
system; not that we want them to fail, but it has to be possible for
them to do so. But unfortunately, at the present time, I do not think
that they will be allowed to fail. They believe that they will always
be bailed out by the taxpayer, so we have to buttress this in another
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:57:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important aims of the amendment is to replicate after a fashion the
discipline of the partnership. It provides that the PRA will be able to
insist that bonuses—saying nothing about how much they
are—would have to be deferred for a number of years in order to
ensure that top management is more careful. It will know that it cannot
grab the all bonus money in one year in the knowledge that the
institution will be bailed out later on. Management will have to think
a bit longer term. In a sense, it is like top managers’ own
capital being invested in the company because their bonuses will be
deferred for a number of years. The amendment provides a remuneration
code to act as a sort of buttress. On its own it will not do much, but
it could serve as an important buttress to other measures that the
Government are introducing—there are a few more that I would
like to see introduced. That will give us a banking system which is not

of the stick. I would like to make just two points. With regard to my
noble friend’s assertion that there has been no interference in
variable remuneration by the state until now, unfortunately I believe
that that is not correct. I have served on the executive committee of a
bank since 2009 and the regulator has definitely interfered with the
variable remuneration in terms of its ratio to fixed remuneration. Over
the past three years, that has led the firm to increase fixed salaries
considerably, and that has been going on in many banks all over the
City. I am just saying that that has already happened and that the
attempt to apply restrictions on the proportion of variable to fixed
remuneration has led to inflation in fixed
salaries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102370000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102370000029">The
second point is that Kleinwort Benson was a listed company when I
joined it and that the other merchant banks were mostly companies by
that stage. I agree entirely with my noble friend that the partnership
ethos was still there, but the listed nature of the businesses enabled

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:03:30"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, we
have had a fascinating debate within a debate between the noble
Viscount and my noble friend Lord Lawson. I merely make one or two
points. It seems to me that there is a case for a 
<?notus-xml column=1053?>remuneration code. In a way we could let the
amendment end after subsections (1) and (2) and leave it to the FCA and
PRA to take a view. It raises the question of whether, after they have
done so, the code they come up with ought then to be considered further
in this House. I leave that on one
side<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:01:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000002">As
far as culture is concerned, what my former constituents regard as
unfortunate is the whole culture of bonuses. I think that they take
very strongly the view that the people concerned should be paid a rate
for the job and then get on with it. Rather than specify, as this
amendment does, that a proportion must be in the form of remuneration
which is variable, I think they would rather the opposite—or at
any rate, that the proportion which is variable should be
limited.</hs_para>

are, of course, very real practical problems concerning remuneration in
a company which is clearly going on the rocks, when one
needs to recruit someone to sort it out. That is a particular case.
More generally, we could usefully consider the points made by the noble
Lord, Lord Turnbull. The argument for his attitude, if I understand it
correctly, on variable remuneration is, “If it is variable, we
can claw it back at some later stage”, but that may be a long
while after the actual events have taken
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:02:42"></hs_TimeCode>. There is
also the problem of companies being not just too big to fail but, as
has been said on previous occasions, too big to manage. Part of that
problem is that we are looking at remuneration for banks which are in
that situation. What has become clear in recent events is that people
have been paid very large sums when the organisation they are asking to
manage is not capable of being managed at the size that it
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:03:14"></hs_TimeCode>. Be that as

requirement on regulators to prepare another remuneration code aims to
implement a set of remuneration reforms similar to those recommended by

remuneration code addresses the commission’s objectives for
regulating remuneration in a way that combines a concrete legal basis
with a rigorous system for application. The remuneration code is made
under the rule-making powers given to the regulators in the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, including Section 137H, which extends
the provision which may be included in remuneration rules. Any breaches
of the regulator’s rules, including 
<?notus-xml column=1054?>breaches of the remuneration code, can be punished with serious
sanctions. The code reflects the Financial Stability Board’s
principles and standards for sound compensation practices, and European
legislation under CRD IV. So this is a code established under statute

content proposed in the amendment and, where that is not the case, the
regulators have indicated their intention to consult further on any
necessary changes. So, for using profits to calculate pay, the existing
code states that firms must assess current and future risks, and the
need for consistency with the timing and likelihood of the future
revenues. This clearly requires firms to calculate profit-based
remuneration carefully with regard to risks to the bank. On the
balancing of risk and reward, the code makes extensive reference to the
close relationship that remuneration and risk considerations must have.
Reward calculation based on profit and non-financial metrics must

deferral, the code specifically requires that at least 60% of variable
remuneration above £500,000 or to a director of a

three to five years. On top of the existing requirement, the regulators
have said in their response to the PCBS that they will consider adding
to their code requirements on deferral. In this area, the existing code
is already rigorous and set to become even more so. Regarding the issue
of variable pay for non-executive directors, the PRA has stated clearly

the subject of the clawback of deferred remuneration at banks in

recognise, perhaps more than that of any other country, the
consequences of bailing out financial institutions. We have been clear
that individuals must be held accountable for misconduct and that there
should be no rewards for failure. The Government agree that there
should be specific powers available for the regulator in relation to
remuneration at banks where they require state assistance. The ability
to reduce or revoke deferred remuneration when a bank requires state
aid would further strengthen accountability and complement the
extensive reforms which the Government have undertaken to remove the
implicit taxpayer guarantee.</hs_para>

already have the power to require the cancellation of deferred
remuneration and loss of office payments where a bank requires
state-aid support under their existing powers. In the PRA code,
specific provision is made for the reduction of deferred remuneration

reforms introduced under the EU capital requirements directive IV have
reinforced existing rules on pay at banks in receipt of state support
so that: bonuses are strictly limited where inconsistent with the
maintenance of a sound capital base and timely exit from government
support; regulators will be able to require banks to restructure
remuneration in a way that is aligned with sound risk management and
long-term growth; and directors should not receive a bonus unless
justified.</hs_para>

Canterbury referred to as doing the three Ps, or, “Print, pin up

to various speakers. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, made two comments.
One was to ask about all the other people in the City. The remuneration
code which exists—I declare an interest as a director of an
insurance company—still applies 
<?notus-xml column=1057?>and will apply. The issue here is whether a kind of upper tier is to be
created that relates specifically to banks. I believe there is a case
for that. He also asked why anybody needs variable remuneration. A
number of noble Lords have given the answer to that. One is that in
builds in fixed costs. In the case of banks, why do you defer? One
reason is because, particularly given the way that they are accounted
for, profits which look okay today vanish tomorrow—they are
ephemeral. You suddenly find that a series of trades that you had
valued at a certain level just disappears. You wait and see until the
profits are actually made and then you can pay it out. The argument has
also been made that this would tend to raise base pay. A degree of
variable pay is actually a beneficial part of the system, although it
needs to be
controlled<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:17:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000022">The
noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, asked about leaving the responsibility
to shareholders. If shareholders own only 3% of the business, are they
really going to be a sufficiently powerful force, particularly when
their investment is highly geared? They share the same incentive as the
managers. The managers are, in a sense, over-incentivised and the
shareholders are the same. The other thing that has come out is that
there are strong externalities working in this world. The failure of a
bank, and particularly the banking system, has the ability to create
havoc over a wide area. The impetus and responsibility on the state to
see that the banks provide a continuous service means that other people
have a locus in this. You cannot simply allow banks to be run with the
entire remuneration system being put into the hand of one set of
stakeholders, such as the
shareholders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:18:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000023">As
for inflation over the past two or three years, my reading is that bank
pay has probably plateaued in that period. Most inflation came in the
decade before that, when there was precious little intervention from
either the state or investors. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins,
said that my support for variable pay was based on giving it to them so
that you can then claw it back, but the deferral is really there
because you want to make sure that these profits have actually been
delivered and the benefits then shared with the bank, in terms of its
capital, and through dividends.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:19:05"></hs_TimeCode> absolutely
agree that many banks are too big to manage. At the moment, a lot of
them are shedding activity, although we will have to wait

institutions. This crisis owed nothing to the rest of the City; if

generally.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102372000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000025">It

otherwise it really is a case of “Trust us, we’ll get
round to it”. But this crisis is six years on. Time is moving
on, so simply saying “We will get some further proposals next
year” is not enough. A better job needs to be done in informing
people of what is currently being considered. They will then be in a
better position to make a judgment on whether that is good enough or
whether we need to go further. Preferably, to pick up the point that
the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, made, if there was quite a lot more time

about pensions. If you say, “What is in someone’s pension

discretionary payments that the company has decided to put in. Perhaps
it has put another £1 million into someone’s pension
fund. If that is done on a contractual basis, by saying, “Here
is the regular contribution we make to your pension fund and here is
the addition that we are making. You should be aware that that bit
could be clawed back”, then I do not really accept the argument

Turnbull:</Member></B> Amendment 97 would create a regime of special
measures. In the report of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards, from paragraph 966 onwards, we argued that
regulators should have a power to give notice to a bank where they
believe that the bank’s systems, professional standards and
culture do not provide sufficient safeguards. First, they could require
an independent investigation, and then require a remedial programme of
corrective action. This would be seen as a precursor to enforcement. It
is basically a way of trying to avoid getting into the morass of
enforcement. A similar regime is operated in the US by the office of
the controller of the currency. It is called the safety and soundness
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000029">Although
the amendment refers to the PRA or the FCA, I believe that it would
work best if the special measures plan was jointly owned. The twin
peaks system of regulation has its advantages but there was always a
danger that with each regulator focusing on its specific areas of
concern, between them they would fail to capture the bigger picture.
There could be a more generic problem of standards and culture and this
would be an opportunity to work collectively and engage with the
bank.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000030">It may
well be that yet again
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:25:51"></hs_TimeCode> response is
that regulators have these powers already. Indeed, if they believe that
the way that a bank is being run is a risk factor, they can impose a
capital add-on. However, the argument against all these cases where we
have these powers already comes back to if that is case, how did we get
into this problem in the first place? What we are trying to establish
is whether things will be different in the future. It would help us
judge that better if the PRA/FCA could produce a working document on
how they envisage using powers of this kind—a special measures

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, we agree with the spirit behind the
special measures proposal, as the noble Lord expected, but we do not
believe it is necessary to give the regulators new powers in this area.
They already have the powers to do everything the PCBS has asked. We
have therefore been working with them on how they could respond to the
recommendation using their existing powers.</hs_para>

regulators published their responses earlier this month. These
responses explain that both the FCA and PRA can, and in fact do, use
the powers that they already have to do many of the things that the
PCBS recommended and that are included in the amendment. The regulators
have a significant range of powers to identify and tackle serious
failings, either to rectify existing problems or prevent further
consumer loss or reputational damage to markets. In fact, the
regulators are able to replicate all the steps outlined in the
amendment using their existing
powers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000033">For
example, the regulators already have the ability to give notice to a
firm through an appropriate mechanism, be it a letter or an e-mail, as
a matter of course if they have any concerns or think there may be a
problem. The regulators will look to engage with the firm to address
the concerns they raise. Whenever it is appropriate, the regulators may
request information from the firm under Section 165 of
FiSMA. If, following an investigation, the regulators believe further
action is needed, the PRA and FCA can use their powers under Sections
55M and 55L of FiSMA to impose requirements on firms to undertake or
cease a particular action. These powers can certainly be used to
require a bank to adopt additional safeguards or to strengthen its
existing
safeguards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000034">Similarly,
the regulators can appoint an independent person to undertake
investigations using their power under Section 166 of FiSMA to
commission a skilled persons report, or under Section 167 to conduct an
investigation into the business of an authorised person. Both the PRA
and FCA are committed to doing so in instances that they believe add
substantially to their understanding of an issue. However, we do not
think it is appropriate that the use of an independent person should be
a requirement in all cases. There are some instances where the
necessary information will be available from other supervisory sources
making any such requirement unnecessarily costly and
counterproductive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000035">Finally,
there are already duties in regulations made by the regulators that
require firms to deal with their regulator in an open and co-operative
way. It may be that the noble Lord has not had a chance to look at the
responses from the regulators and that, having done so, he will be
satisfied, or, equally, that he would like further clarification. I
suggest to him and any other noble Lords who have a particular interest
in this matter that, if they have any further concerns having looked at
those documents, we would willingly arrange a meeting with the Treasury
to discuss any further elaboration that the noble Lord feels would help
clarify how the system is going to work. Given that the powers exist,
we really believe that the special measures powers envisaged in the
amendment are unnecessary, and I therefore ask the noble Lord to
withdraw
it.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102372000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000119">7.30

other point that I agree with concerns the use of Section 166. At

plight of the children of Syria and in so doing raising the enormous

speech about the successor agenda can be delivered without referencing
the historic impact of the MDGs. They motivated global action around a
common cause: that absolute poverty was indeed beatable. The
13 years since the millennium declaration have witnessed
some of the largest and most successful development impacts in history.
The target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half was met five years
ahead of the 2015 deadline. The target for access to improved sources
of water has already been reached and there have been drastic falls in
deaths from malaria, and in maternal and child mortality. Fewer people
are dying of AIDS, malaria and
TB.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000047">That said,
there is much more to do and it is important that we do not forget that
there are still two years left to deliver on the current MDGs. The need
to finish the job is one from which we should not be distracted.
However, as the high-level panel itself said, we must go beyond the
current MDGs because, commendable as they are, they did not focus
enough on reaching the very poorest and most excluded. Reaching the
target to halve poverty is a staggering achievement but one that leaves
half the people in poverty
behind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000048">The
report states clearly that we can and must eliminate extreme poverty
from the face of the earth by 2030. The Prime Minister helped to steer
the panel to a consensus on the five big shifts required to achieve
this visionary aim. Although everyone in this Chamber will be familiar
with these shifts, they are worth restating. First, we must leave no
one behind. We can end poverty by 2030. We can eliminate preventable
infant deaths and we can make dramatic reductions in maternal
mortality. Secondly, we must put sustainable development 
<?notus-xml column=1063?>at the core, bringing the environmental and
development agendas, which have been separated for decades, back
together. Thirdly, we must put a focus on transforming economies for
jobs and inclusive growth. As we all know, growth is the only real exit
from poverty, meaning a much greater focus on promoting business and
entrepreneurship, infrastructure, education and skills, and trade.
Fourthly, we must build peace and effective, open and accountable
institutions for all, ensuring that we tackle the causes and not just
the symptoms of poverty. Fifthly, we must forge a new global
partnership that brings national Governments, businesses, community
groups, donors, local government and others to work
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000049">It
is also true that ending poverty is not a matter for aid or

behind” has been the spirit of the millennium development goals
since their inception. Yet the fact remains that, even after 15 years
in which the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has been
halved, 70 per cent of those not lifted out of poverty are
women.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000063">As the
deadline of the millennium development goals hovers into view, it
becomes clear that areas that require critical examination are those
that affect women and girls most sharply. For example, only two
countries out of 130 have achieved gender parity in education.
Development is not always held back because of a lack of resources;
sometimes it is held back because someone is holding it back. It is
certainly crucial that women and girls are taken into proper account in
every single one of the new goals. The lives of millions of girls are
blighted by violence, whether that is armed conflict, domestic violence
or the gender-based violence faced by girls in their own communities in
the form of female genital mutilation. By categorising FGM as something
done a long way away, in cultures we do not understand, we resist
helping those who have suffered and those in danger of
suffering.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000064">The
current generation of millennium development goals lets down girls and
women. The omission of a goal to eliminate violence against women is a
glaring one. This can be cultural violence, the abbreviating of the
potential of girls who die when they become pregnant. It can certainly
be physical violence, as with the example of FGM. Robbery is also
violence; the refusal of some Chinese universities to allow girls to
study engineering, as recently reported by the BBC, is to steal from
them their potential earnings and status in society. Few of those
goals, therefore, can be leapt towards by the simple act of changing
one’s
mind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000065">Ending

Earl of Sandwich (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the MDGs were
overambitious, but the post-2015 agenda is reaching beyond the bounds
of the possible. Through the high-level panel we are promising not to
reduce extreme poverty but to end it altogether, in all its forms; to
transform economies; and to build peace and good governance, involving
civil society. The UN and its various panels have a huge task in
reconciling the updated MDGs with the sustainable development goals.
There are now almost too many concepts coming out of these panels, and
I doubt that we will end up with the clarity of the original MDGs.
Sustainability can, however, be a test of effective, lasting
development, in which the beneficiaries become the principal actors,
such as farmers putting new techniques into action or health workers
drawn from the local population.</hs_para>

activity required is going to mean even greater commitment to
development assistance. Some of the documents referred to increased and
more effective methods of finance. The EU is suggesting a range of
options and says that investments towards 
<?notus-xml column=1066?>the goals “should work seamlessly together”. Here we hit a
snag. Economic recession has meant that aid from the EU has fallen,
despite the calls for 0.7 per cent. The Minister might like to comment

are likely to be rated much higher in future development goals. Climate
change is another priority. I welcome also the likely new emphasis on
gender, given that women make up about two-thirds of the world’s
poorest. Enabling local people to improve their own environment and
health is one of the most cost-effective forms of development, saving
three or four times its investment in economic productivity.</hs_para>

believe it could be strengthened in two areas. The first area is
environmental sustainability. The millennium goals are weak on climate
change and the high-level panel report does not make it sufficiently
clear that global warming already damages the economies, and therefore
the poor, in poorer countries such as Bangladesh. The panel has the
laudable aim of eliminating $1.25 a day poverty but that needs to be
inextricably linked with a new climate equilibrium, which we are far
from attaining. Do Her Majesty’s Government agree that there
needs to be a legally binding global climate deal in 2015 in line with
the scientific
consensus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:50:38"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000071">Secondly,
the emphasis on absolute poverty must not hide the danger of increasing
inequality in our world. Income inequality is rife in both richer and
poorer countries and is one mark of the increasing power of elites at
the expense of those in poverty. I regret that the powerful analysis of
Pickett and Wilkinson’s <I>Spirit Level</I>, that less equal
societies do worse, has almost disappeared from our political debate.
This inequality within and between nations is exacerbated by the
failure of tax justice so far to ensure that multinationals pay a

I greatly welcome the first principle in the high-level panel’s
report—“leave no one behind”. That is as true for
richer countries as for poorer. Think of food banks for hungry children
in our own country. It shows that there really is a global agenda here
and no longer a “them and us”. Leave no one behind does
not mean a lower priority for growth, quite the contrary. It means a
policy that ensures that in all countries the fruits of growth reach
those who need it. Making certain that that happens is key for all of

introduction of the millennium development goals in 2000 was greeted
with enthusiasm by those involved in international development. A
target-based programme designed to address poverty and exclusion in all

chart a way forward,

part this will be achieved by enabling women to move into positions of
influence. This could be at local level, playing a part in the
determination of priorities, or regionally or nationally.
Decision-making bodies from which women are excluded are most likely to
contribute along a traditional path, with little attention being paid,

Crisp (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lady,
Baroness Jenkin, on setting out so well the background against which we
all speak. I want to make two points in two minutes. First, leaving no
one behind, or the UN Secretary-General’s version of it, a life
of dignity for all, are absolutely wonderful ambitions. I draw
attention to how this applies to disabled people. I do so in part as
chair of Sightsavers, which deals with blind people. I am very well
aware that too often disabled children and blind children in particular
are left behind in our current MDGs. The crucial point here is not just
the political will. It is also about the data and about gathering the
data so that we know how these things are being applied not just to
disabled people but to other minorities. What is the
Government’s assessment of how these data can be collected and
how well they can be collected over the next
period?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102372000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000089">My
second point, following others, is that the MDGs in health have not
been fully met. HIV/AIDS is not yet beaten. Child mortality is too high
and maternal mortality is absolutely appalling in too many places. I
ask the Government two things. First, what are they going to do to
ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the independent
expert review group chaired by Joy Phumaphi and Richard Horton which is
arguing for greater acceleration on progress to the health MDGs,
particularly MDGs four and five at the moment? Secondly, how can the
Governments of the world collectively ensure that the current MDGs are
carried forward and progress continues to be made after 2015, as it
will need to
be?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102372000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102372000130">8.02

not us, the wealthy, telling the poor what to do, but ensuring that the
poor themselves are involved in the ownership of the programme that is
put forward and to which they are expected to respond and that they
feel that it is theirs, not ours. It also recognising the interplay
between specific targets and the matrix. What is the matrix? Let me
rattle through the points to illustrate it: children and women,
education, ecosystems and sustainable management of natural resources,
climate change with the consequent vast movement of people, gaps in
achieving MDGs within individual countries, and also the inequality and
injustice in income levels between men and women, social groups and the
able and disabled, universal public services, redistribution of wealth,
effective and progressive tax systems, strengthening resilience and
advancing human rights, sustainable peace and state building, conflict
resolution, and analysing the causes of conflict. There is a huge list.

a key enabler to reducing poverty. However, as several noble Lords have

rapid urbanisation in many developing countries poses problems of its
own. It is estimated that in several African cities the population will
treble in the next 35 years. That will have the inevitable result of
the proliferation of squatter camps and displaced families. The recent
global partnership report highlighted 12 goals to end poverty by 2030
but scant mention was made of what measures were being taken to improve
effective communication. Measuring poverty continues to be a barrier to
effective policy making. While more than 80% of Africans have access to
a mobile telephone, less than 4% have access to reliable and affordable
broadband. Africa is well serviced with undersea fibre optic cables but
has totally inadequate connectivity to the mainland. My simple call
today is for more measures to promote universal affordable broadband,

Craigavon (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I will go straight to what I
believe—which the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, also seems to
believe—is the most important part of the MDGs and an integral
part of sustainable development: population dynamics and reproductive
health. In the recent special event meeting in September, heads of
state and government confirmed that they will target the existing most
off-track MDGs and those where progress has stalled, such
as,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13102376000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102376000009">“universal

post-2015 goals in this field, there has been widespread advocacy of a
stand-alone target on universal access to sexual and reproductive
health and rights. Those in this field believe that sustainable
development can only be underpinned by meeting the widely acknowledged,
unmet need for reproductive health services and by giving women the
choice in freely planning the size of their families. At the same time,
it has to be acknowledged that another side of sustainable development
is reflected in our western overconsumption and excesses. However, to
put it rather simply at this stage, the benefits of family planning do
not have to wait until levels of education have improved or stable
economies are in place. As Marie Stopes International in particular has
shown, reproductive health provision, if provided in the right way at
any stage of development, can be successful and beneficial to
all.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102376000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102376000003">For the

its failure to recognise the marked increase in income inequality is
concerning, as the right reverend Prelate mentioned. That was
a major omission from the MDGs. Many leading economists
believe that tackling inequality will be essential to achieving the
goal of eradicating extreme poverty. However, despite this, the
Government have refused to back measures to tackle it. Perhaps the

reticence to endorse such

2065, and will not make up half the world’s leaders until 2134.

will be prioritised and sharpened. However, it was very important to
get the maximum amount of consensus around what the targets needed to
be. The noble Lord also pointed out that contributions and aid from EU

McFall of Alcluith (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it
is my pleasure to move Amendment 98 on behalf of my parliamentary
banking standards colleagues, the noble Lords, Lord Lawson and Lord
Turnbull. Essentially, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards is saying that banks must put in place mechanisms for
employees to raise concerns when they feel discomfort about products or
practices, even where they are not making a specific allegation of
wrongdoing. It is instructive to note that during the whole financial
crisis, not one whistle was blown. Why was that? The issue of fear of
damage to one’s career is central. Therefore, we must ensure
that we have a system that rectifies those
deficiencies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102382000002">One
recommendation from the parliamentary commission is that a
non-executive board member, preferably the chairman, should be given
specific responsibility under the senior persons regime for the
effective operation of the firm’s whistleblowing regime. We
would like the Government to consider that. I am sure that the noble
Lord, Lord Lawson, and I feel that that recommendation does not go far
enough, particularly when one considers the situation in America. My
noble friend Lord Brennan informed me earlier that under the Dodd-Frank
Act, the SEC has an Office of the Whistleblower within individual
companies. The United States is far ahead of us on that, and, if we do
not allow the chairman to undertake this, we are ducking one of the
main responsibilities that we want to give to the chairman, which is to
accept individual
accountability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102382000003">We
were littered with examples of chairmen putting their hands up and
saying, “Nothing to do with us. We didn’t know about the
mis-selling scandals. We didn't know about the LIBOR scandal. We didn't
know about the interest-rate scandals”, et cetera. If
the system is to work properly, the chairman must be
responsible. We consider that it is important that the chairman 
<?notus-xml column=1077?>should be held personally accountable for protecting
whistleblowers against detrimental treatment if we are to have a system
that is worthy of the name in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102382000004">We

FSA should be right at the centre of the issue. As a commission, we
concluded that not only did internal compliance and formal control

fear prevented employees from speaking out about serious
wrongdoing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T20:37:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

several years while this practice was going on. At UBS we found that
there were up to 100 people who were there for a decade and that there
was a clear e-mail trail on the issue. We could only conclude that if
one is asked to do something wrong, there has to be whistleblowing so
that the company can develop a better culture and better process to
enable it to deal with it. We do not wish people to feel that their

line as well, particularly at the front-line, retail-desk level with
PPI, with individuals being pressured in that regard. At a breakfast
conference this morning, Martin Wheatley was very clear. He said that
these individuals at the front-line level were trying to eke out a
salary of £16,000 to £18,000 a year. They had been asked
to sell PPI alongside loans and other products and would receive an
extra couple of thousand pounds a year for doing so. At the top level,
however, huge sums were involved. Distorted incentives led to a
situation where, as a result of PPI mis-selling—deliberate
mis-selling by companies—the banking industry could face a bill
of £30 billion. Financial stability could be threatened as a
result of these perverse incentives. The PPI scheme went on for 18
years. I suggest that if a rigorous, appropriate whistleblowing regime

98A and 98B stand in my name. They seek to tease out a little more
detail in relation to the amendment just moved by the noble
Lord, Lord McFall, on whistleblowing. I say at once that I am wholly in
favour of that amendment. The position of whistleblowers in our country
is not satisfactory. Amendment 98 would widen the portal to offer
assistance and compensation for whistleblowers by giving the
appropriate regulator the power of initiative with regard to getting
appropriate compensation for
whistleblowers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T20:47:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102382000020">My
amendment is designed to widen the scope of that initiative as, at
present, I feel that it is unnecessarily limited in that the
whistleblower is defined by proposed new Subsection (2) in Amendment 98
as a person who gives information directly to the appropriate regulator
or gives it to a colleague. I notice that the amendment does not define
“colleague”. Suffice it to say that many of the
circumstances in which whistleblowers are sometimes
encouraged—and feel morally compelled—to speak out are
extraordinarily

fortune to do work for the charity Public Concern at Work. Indeed, I
set it up 20 or so years ago. That charity continues to do
extremely valuable work. I spoke to people at the charity a couple of
days ago and, believe it or not, they had been approached by roughly
2,500 whistleblowers in the past year. Astonishingly, I think that
scarcely any of the whistleblowers were from the City. There are
particular issues around that and we can underestimate the
extraordinary pressure that a whistleblower or would-be whistleblower
feels under in the context of the City, particularly as it is a very
tight community in many ways. At the moment, the only recompense that a
whistleblower can get, if he or she is discriminated against and
suffers loss, is by using the provisions of the Public Interest
Disclosure Act 1998. However, the whistleblower has to take the
initiative. This amendment, as I say, gives the initiative to the
regulator, which can be of enormous help and assistance to the
whistleblower.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102382000022">The
Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 scores over this amendment by
having a much wider entrée to the remedies than is provided by

potential compensation when they talk about giving information to the
appropriate regulator or to a colleague. This is because—and I
have checked this with Public Concern at Work—a lot of those who
want to speak out are really anxious, if not fearful. What very often
happens is information gets to the regulator in a really indirect,
round-the-houses way, sometimes anonymously. My simple amendment is
designed to open up the door but it is also a probing amendment in the
hope that between now and Report we can have discussions with the
Government on the optimum way of finding the remedy which the amendment

the whistleblower and his employer in relation to an employment claim.
I invite the House to look at the question of whistleblowing in a much
broader context. The more monolithic the organisation, the tighter its
internal process controls, the less likely it is you will
find out about wrongdoing. Almost paradoxically, the whistleblower
becomes more important —single though that person usually
is—according to the size of the enterprise about which he makes
revelations. That explains to a considerable degree the point raised by
the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, about the effects upon these

Reading, the four major banks are, in a broad sense, in charge of four
times our gross domestic product. Whistleblowing in organisations as
big as major banks is a highly exceptional event. In considering the
role of the whistleblower in this context, the Government should, I
suggest, have regard to public reaction if it is not seen to be the
case that whistleblowers are not only protected but encouraged by
legislation such as this. Regulators are there to regulate, not to
police in the sense of investigation, detection and prosecution. That
is not their usual role—certainly not historically—in
this country. Therefore, the whistleblower in this country has even
greater importance than he or she has in the United

the Dodd-Frank Act—the US counterpart of this
legislation—introduced special provisions for whistleblowing,
not just in banking but in financial institutions generally. It
provided for payment to whistleblowers according to the extent of the
misconduct that the whistleblower had revealed, as assessed by the
SEC—the equivalent of our regulators. So, for example, if a
whistleblower had disclosed LIBOR, the payment would reflect the
importance of the discovery in relation to the economic loss that had
been suffered.</hs_para>

within his or her employment or in relation to their future and that of
their family, the more they should be protected, including financially
—but with reason, I accept. If you do not do that, you expose
the whistleblower to what almost amounts to serious persecution. One
has only to look at some of the events that have occurred in the
National Health Service, where whistleblowers in different hospitals or
hospital trusts have had their careers ruined, and there was even, I
suspect, a suicide a year or two back. This is serious stuff. These are
citizens revealing misconduct by great institutions, and no more civic

a result of Dodd-Frank, which was enacted in 2011, in the financial
year 2012—the first full year after its enactment—there

the Whistleblower is a permanent office within the SEC, and its purpose

the SEC said publicly, “Now we are not only felt; we are

should be enough—enough, often, to stop things happening before
they start to get really serious. That would be the perfect example of
how whistleblowing should work. But until we reach that stage, we have
to work on the basis of deterrence—people whistleblowing about
what is happening, which results in such serious offences being
detected and stopped, people being punished, rewards being given, and
the creation of the atmosphere of deterrence and the expectation of

Newby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment would introduce a
system under which the regulators would be able to award compensation
against a firm that mistreated a whistleblower. Whistleblowing is an
important issue and the Government agree that we need to have a proper
system for protecting whistleblowers in the financial services industry
as elsewhere. However, I do not think that the noble Lord’s
amendment would be a helpful addition to the legislative framework,
particularly at this point. Let me explain
why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T21:08:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government launched a call for evidence on the whistleblowing framework
to see whether there was a case for reforming the law protecting
whistleblowers. This will be able to take account of submissions from
the financial services regulators as well as from other interested
parties. The call for evidence closes on 1 November and, once the
evidence has been assessed, the Government will consider what if any
action needs to be taken. It would not be sensible to prejudge the
outcome of the call for evidence and implement changes without first
looking at all the evidence available to support any changes. Moreover,
the Government do not think that it would be appropriate to have
different laws or protections for whistleblowers in different sectors.
It would not be right to suggest that whistleblowers were more
deserving of protection in some sectors than in others. I am sure that
this is not what the noble Lord intended, but there is a risk that
giving the regulators a special role in protecting whistleblowers in
the financial services sector will be seen as special treatment for
that
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T21:09:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0002.htm#13102382000043">Finally,
this power does not seem consistent with the role and competence of the
financial services regulators. There is a comprehensive system of

what the regulators are already doing in this area, I want to stress
the basic point about this review. First, it is wide ranging. Secondly,
it aims to beef up the current system. Thirdly, it will apply across

services sector has a different status in terms of whistleblowing to,

extremely active in supporting and encouraging whistleblowing. The

It received 3,001 reports in 2012. In the same year, the FSA received
3,929 reports. The impression has been given that the Americans have
this system which is generating huge quantities of people coming
forward and that the City is absolutely in fear to the extent that no
one is coming forward. The figures totally contradict that view. I am
not saying for a minute that the system is perfect, cannot be improved

There is, for example, a public consultation that we know nothing

as a result of the crisis that broke in 2008, the Government
felt obliged to rescue a number of our biggest banks. The Government
took control of these banks to the extent of more than 80% in the Royal
Bank of Scotland, which was their biggest stake. This was the previous,
Labour Government, and instead of straightforwardly taking this stake
which the taxpayer owned—and the Government is a trustee for the
taxpayer—they interposed this curious body called UK Financial
Investments Ltd. We all know why this was done; I fully understand it
and am extremely sympathetic. There is always a fear that a Labour
Government might be engaged in a policy of bank nationalisation. In
order to demonstrate that this was just a rescue operation and not bank
nationalisation, they created this body, UKFI, to stand between the
Government and the bank
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#13102382000063">Clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T21:34:40"></hs_TimeCode>,
that no longer applies. There is no longer a thought that somehow this
is nationalisation by the back door. Whatever else the coalition may be
guilty of, it is not seeking to do that. So the whole
rationale—the whole raison d’être—of UKFI
has gone. Incidentally, not only was it a conclusion of the commission
that UKFI should be abolished but it was also the strong view of the
previous Governor of the Bank of England, now the noble Lord, Lord
King. He made it absolutely plain.</hs_para>

UKFI gets the Government off the hook in a way that they should not be

practice is that when the Government have had difficult decisions to
take, they say, “Oh, we can’t do it. UKFI owns the
controlling stake”. When, however, the Government want to
intervene—for example, the removal of Stephen Hester from the
job of chief executive of RBS—they use their muscle. When it is
convenient to act directly, they do; when it is not convenient, they
have this charade of UKFI to give them an excuse for not doing what
needs to be
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#13102382000065">If, as a
Government, you have the responsibility of the controlling
shareholding, that should be quite clear and you should exercise that
responsibility properly and be held to account for it. The Government
say, “But we don’t have banking expertise”. Of
course they do not have banking expertise. It does not matter because
they can appoint the right people to the boards of the banks that they
hold and, as we have suggested, they can also have a cadre of banking
experts within the Treasury who can advise them on how to handle the
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#13102382000066">Like
the previous Governor of the Bank of England, we have said that quite
simply UKFI should be abolished. I suspect that many people
secretly—or at least without admitting it—realise that
that should have been done long ago, but it is not too late. The case
of the Royal Bank of Scotland is particularly to the point. If UKFI had
not existed, the Government would have had to face up earlier to the
question of what to do about the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The
commission has said that there is a very strong case, which we have
advocated, for the classic good bank/bad bank split. 
<?notus-xml column=1089?>The good bank/bad bank split is a classic technique for dealing with
major banking problems: put all the bad loans into the bad bank, as was
done with Northern Rock, and not only can the good bank be privatised
much more quickly than the group as a whole, it can get back to lending
to SMEs much more
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#13102382000067">One
of the biggest economic problems we have is the difficulty of lending
to SMEs. Some people say, “Money is very cheap. The rates could
not go any lower: they are 0.5%”. They are not 0.5% for SMEs. A
good SME is lucky if the rate of interest, including the charges it has
to pay, is in single figures. Very often it is 10%, 11% or 12%. There
is a real problem in this country that the banks have so much bad debt
on their books, and are so scared of having any further bad
debts—particularly since they have been told they
have to strengthen their balance sheets and so on—that they are
far too reluctant to lend. This is a real problem for the British
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102382000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#13102382000068">I am

worked at the Treasury, many years ago, when I was on secondment from
my firm at the time. That was when there were lots of nationalised
industries in the public sector. Worthy civil servants—and
worthy Treasury civil servants, too—thought they knew how to
manage the relationships between these large, complex, commercial
organisations. They did not do it well. It was the right decision,
therefore, when the previous Labour Government started to accrete new,
substantial holdings in commercial organisations, to set up an
arm’s length relationship to professionalise the handling of
those organisations and their ultimate disposal, and to recognise, as
that Government did at the time, that those holdings were not to be
long-term holdings. I criticised the previous Government because it was
not set up by statute, but in a shroud of secrecy without proper
accountability arrangements in place. I believe, however, that the
principle that civil servants are not the right people to manage these
complex relationships with sophisticated organisations is the right
one.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_23_PT_1/C80000A2AD8374E6E000312706C4AD0244EB88EC" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 October 2013">Wednesday,

arrangements to fulfil these objectives—you can make the

it—the current ones work well, as my noble friend Lord

security of those customers as far as may be possible, rather than
seeing them as entities from which to make profits. A ring-fenced body

stories demonstrate that beyond all reasonable doubt. This was not a
failure because of the failure of the regulators as such and their

McFall of Alcluith:</Member></B> My Lords, I will briefly speak in
support of this amendment. My noble friend Lord Eatwell spoke of
treating customers fairly. I remember, going back to 2002, when the
FSA, bless its heart, introduced this to the industry. The FSA told me
that it was a hugely uphill struggle. I well remember having a
conversation with the chairman of one of the banks, who said to me,
“Treating customers fairly? I don’t know what that FSA is
up to, because I’ve always treated my customers fairly”.
The gap between what the FSA was trying to do and the mentality of some
people in the industry was huge. I remember being at a seminar with
John Kay, who has written a great article in today’s
<I>Financial Times</I> that I have already referred to. He said that a
duty of care, if it was imposed on the banks, would be
“transformational”. I think he said that for the
following reason. There is today an imbalance between the customer and
the bank—the term for that is symmetry of knowledge—which
has led to many of the scandals.</hs_para>

after time on the parliamentary banking standards commission, when we
ask chairmen and chief executives exactly why mis-selling occurred
or why the grievous omissions took place in their
organisation, they say that they did not know anything about it. There
is, therefore, a hiatus between the top and below. One of the amusing
aspects of my time as chair of the Treasury Committee was speaking
informally to senior executives in the banks who came along to the
Treasury Committee and said, “What you did to 
<?notus-xml column=1094?>the chairman today was good because it allows us to educate
him”—or her, although it is largely
him—“about what is happening in the organisation”.
A lot of them do not know what is happening. If we had this duty of
care, that responsibility would lie at the very top.</hs_para>

the deliberations of the parliamentary banking standards commission, I
suggested that there should be an annual meeting between the chairmen

authorities, so that there was a sign-off on how they do their duty and
how they serve the interests of their institution and their employees
in the wider society. That information is not made public, but at least
there is that accountability at the top between the regulator and the
chief executive. At present, we do not have that. Having the duty of
care would make those at the top much more alive to what is going on in
their

have received evidence in the banking commission, particularly from the
lawyers who were advising us, that the term “duty of
care” has a specific legal meaning in the law of torts, and
tests to establish whether a duty of care exists and whether it has
been breached are a fundamental tenet of common law. In the context of
banks and their customers, it is not clear what a duty of care would
look like in practice. I know that there are huge legal hurdles to
overcoming that, but there is a basic, common-sense and moral purpose
to the concept of duty of care, and I think it is one that we will
refer to again on Report.</hs_para>

Brennan:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may take up the points raised
by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. Paragraph (a) of the proposed new
clause refers to a “fiduciary duty” by the ring-fenced
body. In practical terms that means a duty exercised by, ultimately,
the board of directors. The body acts through it. The practical
consequences of such a duty, which does not involve enforceability by
the regulators, are twofold. First, if the board of a bank breaches its
fiduciary duty to customers in this way, it is perfectly reasonable for
the shareholders to refuse to indemnify it in respect of any claims
made by customers on the basis that it has breached a statutory duty,
which could not conceivably be said to have been acting in the
shareholders’ interests. That is the first practical
consequence. It is a deterrent.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T21:52:45"></hs_TimeCode>,
although I have not checked this yet, I suspect that in the field of
commercial insurance you would not be able to get D&amp;O insurance for
protection in respect of a fiduciary duty until you have satisfied the
insurability test of having acted reasonably and in accordance with
commonly accepted standards of probity and good behaviour in the
commercial sector. Therefore, the point is answered, I suspect, by
practical
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T21:52:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310241000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310241000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="1310241000055" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310241000055">Lord
Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment is an opportunity to
revisit the imposition of fiduciary duties or duties of care on
financial services firms. The other 
<?notus-xml column=1095?>place debated the same amendment at the Committee
and Report stages of this Bill. Of course, no one in this House is
going to disagree with the proposition that customers need a better
deal from their banks, whether we call it treating customers fairly,
having better standards or putting customers first. The
Government have been keen, for example, to see more competition between
banks as another way of addressing this concern. We all want
to see better standards in the banking industry and a return to the
days when the customer relationship mattered and the customer came
first. We want the leadership of banks to appreciate that it is also in
their long-term interests in building successful banking businesses.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T21:53:57"></hs_TimeCode>
Government’s amendments so far, which implement the
recommendations of the PCBS, will be an important step in the round in
that
respect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T21:54:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310241000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310241000025">However,
I note that the commission did not itself recommend the introduction of
either a fiduciary duty or a duty of care. To cut to the chase, the
Government do not consider that the introduction of either a fiduciary
duty or a duty of care in legislation would help to drive up these
standards within ring-fenced banks. First, banks are already subject to
a wide range of legal duties. Most obviously, they are subject to
contractual obligations to their customers. Any banking relationship or
transaction is subject to a contract between the bank and the customer.
Of course, a bank is subject to obligations under FiSMA and the
regulator’s rules. Further, the Government’s amendment on
banking standards rules means that in future senior managers and
ordinary employees will also be subject to conduct rules. Therefore, it
is not clear that imposing a fiduciary obligation on a bank would add
any value. The fiduciary obligation is the kind of obligation that a
director owes to a company, or a trustee owes to a beneficiary under a
trust. It is an appropriate obligation when one person is acting on
behalf of another or dealing with another’s property on their
behalf. However, deposits with a bank are not property held on trust,
so a fiduciary obligation would have no place in the contractual
relationship between a bank and its
customer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310241000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310241000026">Similarly,

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> I hesitate to interrupt my noble
friend at this time of night, but there is an important issue in
relation to what he said that needs clarification. He said a couple of
times that the relationship between a bank and its customer is a
contractual one, and therefore that that was sort of QED. The problem
is that until not long ago all banks, in the small print of their
contracts, which they knew full well that customers would not read, put
material which, had the customers read it, would have led them to not
agree the contract. In that situation, the contract said such and such,
but the purport was wholly antithetical to the real interests of the
customer. How does my noble friend deal with that situation, if he is
rejecting the fiduciary
concept<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T21:56:43"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310241000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310241000028"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="1310241000057" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310241000057">Lord
Deighton:</Member></B> It is clear that the essential contractual
relationship still exists, regardless of the fine print. It is not
clear what a duty of care would add to the existing contractual
obligations or regulatory requirements to which the ring-fenced body is
subject. The primary 
<?notus-xml column=1096?>duty of a ring-fenced bank is to repay its borrowings, such as deposits,
when they fall due, in accordance with the terms of its contracts. If a
ring-fenced bank does that and complies with its regulatory
obligations, such as those relating to ring-fencing or leverage, it is
hard to see what a duty of care would do to make it care more for its
customers, inside or outside the financial services
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310241000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310241000029">Therefore,
the Government firmly believe that it would be better to
impose specific and focused requirements, and standards of business, on
banks, than to rely on high-level, generic concepts such as a duty of
care. Banks can comply more easily with specific requirements.
Customers and regulators can more effectively hold to account the
banks, and, if appropriate, their senior managers, when they do not
comply. Moreover, if our ultimate objective is to improve the deal that
customers get from their banks, one of the most effective and direct
ways to achieve this is surely by enhancing competition. Banks must be
spurred to treat their customers better by the threat of the customers
voting with their feet. Through the introduction of the measures in
this Bill, including the changes to the regulator’s objectives
and powers, and the new payments regulator, we believe that a better
deal can be
achieved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310241000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310241000030">Imposing

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, that was a very unsatisfactory answer.
It was both analytically weak and unsatisfactory in terms of the noble
Lord’s argument. Let us first deal with the economics. As the
noble Lord well knows, in the face of asymmetric information,
competition is not necessarily efficient. He knows that: he learnt that
at Cambridge. In those circumstances, to argue simply that competition
will be an effective means of establishing a satisfactory relationship
between the bank and its customers is simply analytically wrong. We
ought to take that into

the noble Lord said that there was a series of relationships:
contractual duties, the relationships set out in FiSMA and the senior

did not work, so let us not rely on contractual duties which have been

something towards the end of his reply that was really quite

astonishing. I have a sense that trustees have a very clear
understanding of the fiduciary issue of what they have to do

therefore regard them as naïve, but that is what people actually
believe. That is what we, on this side, believe should actually be the

there should be a duty of care, but it should be specific and

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I have commented on a number of
occasions that despite all the considerable endeavours since the
financial crisis by the Treasury itself, by the FSA as it then
was—not by the Bank of England—by the Independent
Commission on Banking and now by the parliamentary commission, there
has been no significant thought applied to the manner in which the
banking system could be fundamentally restructured. All those
discussions have taken place within the context of the banking system
as it is currently structured. There has been no, let us say, Standard
Oil approach to breaking up that company or an AT&amp;T approach to say
that there should be some fundamental restructuring of the overall
banking system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T22:04:25"></hs_TimeCode>.
Instead, we have taken the structure as it is and examined how we can
make it work better: for example, by a ring-fence, bail-in clauses,
resolution regimes or whatever. The only significant change in the
structure of the banking industry—the separation of TSB from
Lloyds—was done under the instructions of the European Union. It
was not a policy developed here in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T22:05:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

propose anything dramatic such as a break-up of the larger banks so
that they are small enough to fail, but instead says that when there
are sales of banking assets which are in Treasury ownership, the
Treasury ought at least to go away and think about this. It ought to
tell us how the structure of the sale is in the best interests of the
taxpayer and think about the impact on competition—I am sure the
noble Lord would like that—on customer choice and, indeed, on
the rate of economic growth. It ought also to look at the relationship
to the ring-fence and whether there might be a development of regional
banking, an idea suggested by a number of commentators. All that the
amendment seeks is to say, “Let us please have some thought
about the overall structure of the banking industry in this
respect”.</hs_para>

competitive, except perhaps in the occasional niche of the

we rush further into selling the state-owned banking assets, let us at

Chancellor has already set out at the Mansion House the next stage of
the Government’s plan to take the banking system from rescue to
recovery. For Lloyds, the Chancellor has taken the first steps to
return Lloyds to the private sector and will continue to
consider options for further share sales. Value for money for the
taxpayer will be the overriding consideration for disposals. There is
no pre-fixed timescale for share sales and, given the size of the
taxpayer’s stake in Lloyds, the disposal process is likely to
involve further multiple stages over

however, share sales are still some way off. We discussed this earlier
when we debated my noble friend Lord Lawson’s amendment. The
Treasury is currently examining the case for creating a bad bank for
RBS risky assets. As discussed, this review is still ongoing and will
be published later in the autumn. Setting out public options for
structural change may be advisable in some cases, as the
Chancellor’s announcement of the RBS bad bank review makes
clear. However, the Government will need to judge in each case whether
to do so, given the risk of generating uncertainty and speculation
about likely outcomes.</hs_para>

numbers of shares in the market is a very commercially sensitive
matter: for example, in the case of Lloyds. Any communications from

affect the price that the Government get for the shares. Publication of
a report as outlined in the proposed amendment could undermine the

Government firmly agree that all the topics set out in the amendment
need to be carefully considered by any Government in making their
decisions relating to the sale of banking assets. UKFI, which we talked
about earlier, was established with a very clear emphasis on value for

Government’s shareholdings in the banks. In doing so, it is
required to pay due regard to the maintenance of financial stability

amendment seeks to improve accountability. Many mechanisms already
provide accountability. On value for money, the Government are
scrutinised against the general principles set out in the Green Book.
UKFI is also accountable to Parliament through the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and has a mandate to secure value for money for the
taxpayer. Moreover, the Treasury and UKFI are accountable directly,
through the accounting officer mechanism, to the National Audit Office
and to the Public Accounts Committee. Indeed, UKFI published a report,
following the sale of Northern Rock, setting out the rationale for
returning the bank to the private sector at that time. The National
Audit Office completed a review of the sales process and published a
lengthy report on it, which was considered at a session of the Public
Accounts Committee.</hs_para>

Rock demonstrated the Government’s commitment to transparency on
the sale of their banking assets and the ability for bodies such as the
National Audit Office and Parliament to

matters. Finally, the Government are accountable for their decision to
Parliament, including through the Treasury Select Committee and in
public debate. Overall, it is not clear what value would be added by
this mandatory reporting requirement and it might well be detrimental
to the objectives it aims to deliver, particularly to value for money.

to the good bank/bad bank story, value for money with respect to the
disposal of assets is obviously an important component, but so is the
future of the banking industry and its performance in relation to the
UK economy as a whole, especially its support of the real economy in
the provision of financial services. That aspect does not seem to have
been considered. After all, the good bank/bad bank story is essentially
a defensive move. It is dealing with a bank which is hampered—or
potentially hampered; we will see what the report says—by its
current mixture of assets and liabilities, particularly non-performing
assets. The good bank/bad bank split is a defensive measure; a device
for ensuring that you have an operation in the good bank which we hope

understand that this would be more difficult within
the banking

specifically to both portable account numbers and sort codes. That
makes the issue more difficult because two individuals who bank at
different banks may have the same account number but, of course,
different sort codes; their entire identification is in the combination
of the two. Therefore, a new means of identifying the core bank would

this would all cost £5 billion, as has been argued by the

really going to get competition and choice for the consumer, this seems
to be a necessary step. The attempt to develop such competition through

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, it goes without saying that the
Government are fully behind the objective of increasing competition in
banking and making sure that customers who wish to switch banks can do
so without impediment. The notion of portable account numbers was
considered by the Independent Commission on Banking and in its final
report the ICB chose to recommend a new account switching service over
portable account numbers. It considered that such a service, if
designed correctly, would provide the majority of the same benefits as
portability, but with significantly reduced risk and

Government acted quickly on this recommendation to secure a commitment
from the banking industry to deliver current account switching in two
years. This was an ambitious timetable for such a big project, but the
banks have met the challenge. The new current account switching service
was launched on schedule in September and covers almost 100% of the
current account market. It has been designed to meet all the
ICB’s criteria for tackling customer concerns over switching and
to give customers the confidence they need to make the banks improve

Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and talked about account
portability. But that was not as firm a recommendation as he has
suggested, because one of the questions we asked was: why can the banks
not allocate an account number that works in the
way that mobile telephone numbers do, so that people can swap them
around in the same way? The banks replied 
<?notus-xml column=1103?>that the IT costs would be too high, but a cursory
examination—that is all we did—of the IT aspect indicated
that there were legacy problems with the IT. As we have seen with the
horrendous examples involving RBS and others, the IT system is in a
very poor state. So now is the ideal time to raise our ambitions and

perhaps even that these charges are an affront to social justice, or

that it is difficult to see this bringing down costs, the evidence at
the moment is that self-regulation is not working. Earlier this month,

Bristol University study of March this year is often cited in support
of it. This is just wrong. The Bristol study does not conclude that a
cap would drive people to loan sharks. What it says is that a cap may
cause access to credit to reduce, particularly for low-income, rather
vulnerable customers. Then it explicitly

fourth proposition, that it is possible to act now, to the great
benefit of payday loan customers. The evidence for this can be found in
the United States, where there is a long-established set of regulating
systems which cap costs. They control rollovers and restrict loan
periods. All this happens without destroying the market for payday
loans. In the US, payday loan regulation is a matter for individual
states and 41 of them have some regulation in place. In three states
and in the district of Columbia payday lending is prohibited. In 26
states, borrowing is limited to $600 or less. There is a
range of permitted interest rates; 17 states limit interest to 15% or
less.</hs_para>

has had dramatic results. There is still a flourishing payday loan

and 70% paid on time. The levels of consumer complaint of mis-selling

the information technology for doing this in the UK exists already. All

loan business continues to grow very fast. For Wonga alone, lending
rose 68% in the last reported year. The UK is seen by investors to have
huge potential growth in payday lending. JMP Securities, an American
investment bank, predicts that UK payday lending volumes and fees will
grow by 212% and 246% between 2010 and 2016. We need to act now. If
we wait for the FCA to look at costs, if we wait for the

do we really feel that there is a simple read-over between state
government in the United States and a local authority in the
UK? It seems that we pile responsibilities on local authorities without
giving them sufficient funding, in many cases, to fulfil their
responsibilities. I do not see that the amendment provides for any
resources to go to local authorities to enable them to do the
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T22:37:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310247000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310247000048">Secondly,
as far as I understand it, quite a lot of payday lending is done
online. The amendment will do absolutely nothing to address loans that
are made online because it is all geographically defined. A payday
lender may have a registered address but that may have absolutely
nothing to do with the location of the customers of that payday lender.
The disjuncture between the registered address and the location of the
customers suggests that knowledge of local needs would not necessarily
be very relevant in such a
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310247000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310247000049">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T22:38:32"></hs_TimeCode>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government wholeheartedly agree with
my noble friend that consumers must be protected when they borrow from
payday lenders and use other high-cost forms of credit. As noble Lords
have pointed out, the Government fundamentally reformed the regulatory
system governing these lenders to protect borrowers by transferring the
regulation of consumer credit to the Financial Conduct Authority in the
Financial Services Act 2012.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, has pointed out, the FCA set out an action
plan on high-cost lending to protect consumers, with tough new rules
covering a number of issues including a limit on rollovers and
restricting the use of continuous payment authorities. These proposals
have won widespread support and will profoundly change how this
industry operates. I completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord
Sharkey, that self-regulation has failed, but the industry is not going
to be self-regulated any more.</hs_para>

Lord’s amendment specifically, I am surprised that he thinks
that local authorities should be given additional responsibility for
regulating high-cost lenders. I can see why it might work in the
States, and having looked at the Florida 
<?notus-xml column=1109?>scheme I completely agree that it has been an extremely successful
scheme there. I hope that there are a number of additional elements of
that scheme that might, in time, be introduced into the UK. However, I
frankly cannot see the case for duplicating regulatory effort within
such a small geographic area of the UK, especially as consumers will
find this confusing. Nor can this be considered a good use of public
funds, given that the FCA, which is fully funded by the industry,
already has this responsibility.</hs_para>

a national reach, especially the biggest players which dominate the
market and, by definition, those which are online, so it does not make
sense to permit scores of local authorities, in addition to the FCA, to
all regulate the same lender. We believe that a well-resourced and
empowered single national regulator will provide the best outcome for
consumers. Consumers will be better protected by having a regulator
with the resources, expertise and national consistency of the FCA. I am
not convinced of the benefits for consumers of a federal approach to
regulation. In fact, this could lead to more consumer harm; payday
lenders are more likely to target consumers in local authority areas
where the authority is less active.</hs_para>

is, of course, that the noble Lord has framed it to ensure that the
Secretary of State imposes a cap on the cost of high-cost credit. While
I entirely support the noble Lord’s ambition to bring down the

via a mandatory cap. The Government do not believe that current

of credit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310247000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310247000056">The
noble Lord has referred to the work commissioned by the Government from
the University of Bristol. It does not, as he says, say that the main
arguments against a cap on the rate relates to loan sharks. It does
point out that although that may happen in some cases, lenders may try
to bypass the cap by introducing other charges or fees which are not
subject to it. Evidence shows that, with a cap in place, lenders may be
less likely to show understanding if customers get into repayment
difficulties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310247000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310247000057">While
the Government are not convinced that a mandatory cap is the best
overall solution for consumers now, they have made it clear that the
FCA has a specific power to impose a cap in future, should it decide
that it is needed to protect consumers. The FCA has already committed
to start analysis on use of this power from April
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310247000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310247000058">Capping
the cost of credit is a major intervention with potentially profound
consequences for consumers, so it is right that the FCA contemplates
use of this power in a responsible and evidence-based way, which is

FCA’s commitment to using its powers to protect consumers

close to entirely sufficient evidence. I note in passing that Australia
introduced the same system last year and there is evidence available
from there as well. I also note in passing that this issue about payday
lenders being able to avoid any cap by writing in additional charges is
explicitly dealt with in the regulations that exist in Florida and the
other states that cap these things. It is the total cost of any charges
connected in any way with the loan that is capped; it is not just the
interest rate.</hs_para>

lack of transparency and public disclosure of poor products, 
<?notus-xml column=1111?>practices, individuals and institutions, which remains unaddressed. The
focus of these amendments is to open up this aspect of transparency.

In the case of PPI, HFC Bank was fined by the FSA in 2007 for
mis-selling of PPI. It issued instructions about the steps the
bank needed to take to contact customers and review its

FiSMA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310247000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310247000067">This

case. He needed to add one other element to persuade the Government,
which is that this would enhance competition. If one improved
information in this way, then, given the enhancement of consumer
choice, the competitive objective of the Government would be better
served. This would be a diminution of some of the severe problems of
asymmetric information that distort competition in financial services,

“The time is not ripe; it is not really quite the time; there
are unintended consequences”. All that is required is a
consistent bias towards transparency. The Government should approach
this issue by saying, “In principle, we are in favour of
transparency”. The argument should be made for not being
transparent. In other words, the strong case has to be made for not
revealing something. The fundamental prejudice should be that this
information should be transparent. Effective transmission of

own.</hs_para>

response, the Treasury undertook a careful review of Section 348 and
its associated provisions. The review concluded, first, that it would
be difficult to amend 
<?notus-xml column=1113?>Section 348 without negative consequences. Scaling
back Section 348 would increase the risk that firms would become less
willing to share information with the regulators, undermining those
important relationships and the regulators’ ability to protect

year and received positive feedback from consumer groups—that

Turnbull:</Member></B> My Lords, this is an amendment to which we have
returned on a number of occasions and which is quite fundamental to the
Bill. It raises the question of what is a bank and defines who comes
within the scope of the various regimes, sanctions, penalties, or
whatever. There was a feeling when we last discussed this that defining
a bank around whether it took deposits was too narrow and that there
could be people who could conduct, for example, trading activities
without taking deposits and who ought to be subject to the senior
managers’ regime, the criminal sanction or the remuneration
regime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T22:58:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310247000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0003.htm#1310247000083">The
amendment is an attempt to widen that scope. It was tabled before the
letter dated the 22 October from the noble Lord, Lord Newby, to the
noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, with its offer to set out a note. I think
that that will probably deal with the question. I do not think that
there is any real difference between us about what we want to cover. We
want to make sure that we are covering not only ring-fenced banks but
people running major investment bank trading operations, whether they
be domestic, such as BarCap, or UBS or

my amendment was in effect a senior tier particularly for banking. Once
you do that, you have to find a definition of a bank. I thought that we
were a bit nearer to getting an answer until I heard from the noble
Lord, Lord Eatwell. It is something we need to sort out, otherwise we
shall find a serious area of misconduct in an investment banking area

about the scope of the senior managers regime and the criminal offence

Newby:</Member></B> These amendments address a minor
and technical point in connection with Sections 380, 382, and 384 of
FiSMA, which govern when the regulators may seek an injunction or a
restitution order from the court, or require restitution themselves. To
exercise these powers, the regulator must demonstrate that the person
concerned has contravened a “relevant requirement”. The
current definition of “relevant requirement” in FiSMA
does not include the new offences created under Part 7 of the Financial
Services Act 2012, which deal with misleading statements, misleading
impressions, and misleading statements in relation to benchmarks such
as LIBOR. This means that regulators are unable to seek an injunction
or restitution in relation to these offences. That was not the
Government’s intention. These amendments correct this oversight
by extending the definition of “relevant requirement” to
bring these offences within the scope of the regulators’ powers
to seek an injunction or restitution. I commend these amendments to the
House.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13102423000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0004.htm#13102423000087">Amendment

new payments regulator; orders to make amendments, which are
consequential to the Bill, to other primary legislation, under the
power introduced by the second amendment in this group, to which I will

on the conduct of financial market infrastructure administration, which
allows the Treasury to make further modifications to primary

the Treasury to make amendments consequential to the Bill—and

only in certain circumstances and the Treasury can make orders under
the power only if it considers it necessary or expedient to do so as a
consequence of a provision in the Bill. Furthermore, the power applies
only to legislation which is made before the Bill is passed, or which

an empty Chamber. This is an extremely important amendment. It is what
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, our previous Lord Chief
Justice, now on our Cross Benches, would have described, as he did in a

want to make several points for the Government’s consideration
between now and the next stage. The Banking (Special Provisions) Act
2008 and the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 were both Acts that
included clauses not as wide as this coming from the Treasury.
Researches over the past few hours have not led me to discover any
other Act in which there is a clause that provides for any previous Act
and also any subsequent Act to be amended to accord with this Act. I
may be shown not to know, but I suspect that if there is such a clause,
there will be no more than one or two examples. I am concerned that
these should come from the Treasury, lest it thinks that it has some
special reserve powers for this kind of legislative amendment

I have understood the history of this amendment correctly, it has come
in the past couple of weeks. As far as I know, it has not been
considered either by the Delegated Powers Committee or by the
Constitutional Affairs Committee. This is important because in 2006 the
Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill contained a Henry VIII clause,
which was withdrawn by the then Government after a critique by the
Constitutional Affairs Committee. I invite the
Government’s consideration of this and that of the whole House,
when it has had the opportunity to consider that
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T23:13:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102423000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-0004.htm#13102423000011">Subsection
(2)(b) refers to a power to amend any subsequent Act that is passed
within this Session of Parliament. That means by the end of next April.
In the Government’s commentary on the list of
recommendations of the commission and the Government’s response

the present subject of review with a supposed consideration of a report
called <I>Trust and Transparency</I><I>. </I>The Government are saying
that they wish to deal with changing directors’ duties and that
that requires legislation. If this is currently before the Treasury and
the relevant Ministers, is this coming in within this Session? In item
60 on payments regulation, there is to be a government report to
Parliament by the end of this year, 2013. It requires legislation. Will
that require yet another Act? We need clarity. On the whistleblower
point mentioned earlier, if there is to be a change in the law, will
that require further enactment? The final point is on auditors and
supervisors. There are various reviews from the Chancellor and the
Government which, it is said, do not involve legislation but might
involve action, which in turn might involve potential legislative

has been constructed, we now have a piecemeal presentation of the
secondary legislation procedure as it applies to each bit—and I
have completely lost track of it. The first thing that needs to be done
is to set out, for the whole Bill—the bits that were there
originally and the bits that have been added—what the secondary
legislation provisions are. Then we can make a judgment on whether they
are appropriate: whether the right things have been assigned to the
negative procedure and the right things assigned to the positive
procedure. However, it is virtually impossible to do this on the basis

just completed, is to invite noble Lords who are interested in the
secondary legislation to the Treasury to have an informal discussion on
the issues, and to see what they feel might be done, and whether any

that the Government have not today accepted everything that the PCBS

Northover (LD):</Member></B> With the leave of the Deputy Chairman of
Committees, I hope it might be helpful to everyone taking part in this
Grand Committee if I draw attention to the revised calendar for this
Bill, published with today’s edition of forthcoming business.
The calendar shows that the usual channels now hope that we will
complete the Committee stage of the Bill in 11 sessions in
total—that is, seven more sessions including today. It also sets
out the clauses that we hope to cover each day so that people who want
to take part in a particular part of the Bill can plan their diaries.
The calendar is not binding but it has support across this Committee.
We hope we can complete our work here on 18 November. Can I encourage
everyone here to try to reach the target today, the group led by
Amendment 81, so that we can complete the stage in good

as a Cross-Bencher, about the amount of time that may be allowed on

committed to a Grand Committee when a number of people who are
concerned about the Care Bill would have liked to be here. Those people
may well wish to speak on Report when they would otherwise have spoken
in Grand Committee. Consequently, we may find that Report lasts a bit
longer than the Government would choose. Therefore, it would be helpful

Hughes of Stretford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I will not dwell on
this because it rehearses a theme that we spent a great length of time
on in discussing Part 1 of the Bill—that is, the importance for
children, when their families break up or they are taken into care, of
keeping in contact with their birth family as appropriate, particularly
with their siblings. The Minister was not the Minister discussing the
Bill with us when we talked about Part 1. Therefore, he did not hear
the strength of feeling across the Committee on this issue, which was
such that the Minister—the noble Lord, Lord
Nash—acknowledged it and agreed to take the issue of sibling
contact back and look at it. So I hope, when the Minister sums up, that
I will not need to rehearse the arguments; I hope he will take that on
trust and, similarly, look at it with his colleague, the Minister in
the Department for Education, and come back on
Report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:48:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000008">The
amendment is, however, different from the amendment that we talked
about in relation to Part 1. It would require the court, at the stage
of considering permanence for a child, to pay particular attention to
any siblings and where they are, and to continued contact between
siblings when making or approving the permanence plan for a child
through a care order. Amendment 65 would therefore insert “and
sibling placement arrangements” after
“provisions”. It is very important that this issue is
considered not only by social workers and professionals, as we
discussed when we looked at the amendment to Part 1, but particularly
at the court stage. Clause 15, as it is worded, does not include
arrangements for siblings to be placed together where possible. It does
not include anything that requires the court specifically to consider
the arrangements for brothers and
sisters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000009">It is
essential that this is considered at the court stage because after
that, while there are a number of possible opportunities for detailed
arrangements in permanence plans to be considered, there are none
really to go back and address this issue. Independent reviewing
officers, for example, do not have the same authority as the courts to
scrutinise care plans and they cannot take the matter back to court
directly if they consider that the care plan is deficient in one way or
another. They can only refer the matter to a CAFCASS officer who can
then maybe bring a claim on behalf of the child if they consider that
there are grounds for judicial review or a free-standing claim under
the Human Rights Act. In practice, as I am sure Members can appreciate,
that power is rarely used. Therefore, it is very important to get these
issues about continued sibling contact right in at the front end when
the courts are asked to scrutinise the arrangements for permanence when
thinking about a care
plan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:50:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the arguments as to why that is important. I suspect the Minister may
appreciate them. I will, though, rehearse one statistic that we used in
the previous debate. I hope that the Minister will not say that the
courts will do this anyway. The figures that we looked at then
suggested that some 63% of children who go into care and have siblings
who go into care lose contact with those siblings. Clearly, at various
points in the process—in court, through social workers, through
the placements—contact is being broken for the vast majority of
children who 
<?notus-xml column=361?>go into care as part of a sibling group. I hope that the Minister will
be prepared to look at this and respond positively to it. I beg to

Part 1 of the Bill, a number of us spoke about the importance of
sibling contact. I made the point—I make no apology for making
it again to a different Minister—that the Select Committee on
Adoption Legislation took informal evidence from a considerable number
of children. One of the points made both by the group who were adopted
and the group in care concerned the enormous sorrow they felt at losing
contact with the siblings they knew. Very sensibly, one girl said,
“I am not concerned about the siblings born after I left the
family but I am very worried about my brothers and sisters”.
Another child was almost in tears as he was so worried about his
younger brother, not knowing what was happening to him and nobody being
able to tell him. He said he woke up at night worrying about his
brother. That is not acceptable. Therefore, it is important at each
stage that those in charge of children or in charge of making
arrangements and connections with children have the siblings in mind.
The judge may well say that the social workers have given him all sorts
of good reasons why they are not going to meet, but it is important
that the judge asks. There is no requirement on the judge, or indeed
the magistrates in the family proceedings court, to ask that question
unless it is in
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:54:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

(LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to all noble Lords who
have contributed to this debate. The noble Baroness, in
introducing the amendment, referred to the strength of feeling
expressed when Part 1 of the Bill was discussed and how
important it is that the court is able, where appropriate, to consider
the arrangements that the local authority might make for a child to
live with his or her siblings. My noble friend and I will consider the
points made both today and earlier in the

was discussed in the other place, the purpose of Clause 15 is to focus
the court, in its consideration of the local authority care plan, on
those provisions 
<?notus-xml column=362?>which set out the long-term planning for the upbringing of the child;
for example, whether the child is to live with a parent or other family
member, to be placed in foster care or to be adopted—the
permanence provisions. The court is not required to consider the
remainder of the plan. The clause is based on the findings in the
family justice review that, driven partly by concerns over the quality
of local authority social work, courts can spend a long time
scrutinising the details of local authority care plans for children
before making care orders. In many cases, court scrutiny goes beyond
what is needed to determine whether a care order is in the best
interests of a child. This can lead to unnecessary delays and
contribute to the lengthy duration of care
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000016">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:56:31"></hs_TimeCode>
was also highlighted in the other place, details of care plans are not
set in stone and often change over time in response to a child’s
changing needs and circumstances. In 62% of cases in a recent study,
the care plan scrutinised by the court was not carried out, due to
changing circumstances. Given this likelihood of change, the local
authority, rather than the court, is better placed to consider the
detail of the care
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000017">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:57:29"></hs_TimeCode>
appreciate the concerns expressed by noble Lords about sibling
placement, following the debate in the other place. I want to clarify
that if the permanence provisions of a particular plan deal with
arrangements relating to a child’s sibling—for example,
if the plan is for the child to be adopted along with his
sibling—the court will be required to consider those
arrangements as part of the permanence provision. I will look at the
statistics cited by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, about loss of
contact and, in addition, I make the point that she anticipated: there
is nothing in the clause that prevents the court looking at any other
aspect of the plan it considers necessary to make the
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000018">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>

Butler-Sloss, with her vast experience and from the evidence heard by
her committee, about the grief and stress that can be caused to
siblings by being parted. It is a matter that needs to be looked at. I
re-emphasise that nothing in the clause affects the duty of the local
authority, when deciding the most appropriate placement for the child,
to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable in each case, that the
placement enables the child to live with any sibling who is also being
looked after by the local

Clause 15 is about the court looking at the permanence provisions. Many
people would argue that such is the importance to young people of
continued contact between siblings—not necessarily joint
placements, which may not be possible, but particularly if they are not
possible, then arrangements for them to keep in contact with each
other—that when it comes to permanence provisions it has a
unique relevance to the stability of the placement, the well-being of
the child and the security that the child feels. It means that the
child in that placement, as the noble and learned Baroness graphically
conveyed from her conversations with young people, does not have that
placement clouded by anxiety and concern about where brothers and
sisters are. This is a unique detail in the whole panoply of details
that have to be considered in permanence placements.</hs_para>

respect for the Minister but, frankly, I do not accept the argument
that to include the provision to require judges to ask the
question—that is all that is being asked here—would delay
proceedings. That sounds like a very official argument, and it is a
weak one. In the amendment we simply suggest, as the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth,
said, that the judge should ask, “Does this child have any
siblings? If so, where are they, what are the plans, are they going to
be placed together and, if not, what contact is being arranged for
them?”. If the judge started the consideration with those simple
questions, I do not think that that would precipitate any delay at all
but it would elevate the issue to an importance that would require the
professionals dealing with the detail then to have to consider the
detail and, if necessary, reply to the court about what arrangements
they had made for sibling conduct. With that clarification of what we
are seeking here, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

desirable end to those marriages that have broken down, and make some

everyone, particularly their children. I might add grandparents to

understand that the provisions of Part 2 were intended to save saveable
marriages and reduce distress and conflict when it was inevitable that
a marriage would need to be brought to an end. While Part 2 retained as
the ground for divorce the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, it
would, if implemented, have removed the need to establish irretrievable
breakdown through one or more facts. I understand why proponents of
no-fault divorce believe that the approach in Part 2 would have helped

separate issues here. The first concerns the principle of no-fault
divorce in Part 2, and the second concerns the information
meeting and other provisions of Part 2 which were an integral part of
that policy. The Government in 2001 concluded that the provisions were
unworkable, would not achieve the objectives of saving saveable
marriages and reducing distress and conflict, and should be repealed.

decision to repeal Part 2 was made in principle long ago on the basis
of extensive academic research by the University of Newcastle. The
research looked at six models of information meeting that a party to a
marriage would have been required to attend as the key first step in
initiating a divorce. Part 2 is built around that initial mandatory
information meeting. The research concluded that none of the six models
of information meeting tested was good enough for implementation
nationally. For most people, the meetings came too late to save
marriages and tended to cause parties who were uncertain about their
marriages to be more inclined towards divorce. While people valued the
provision of information, the meetings were too inflexible, providing
general information about both marriage-saving and the divorce process.
People wanted information tailored to their individual circumstances
and needs. In addition, in the majority of cases, only the person
petitioning for divorce attended the meeting. Marriage counselling and
conciliatory divorce all depend on the willing involvement of both
parties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000034">Repeal

current rate of progress, that should take us a good five days. Perhaps
that is not so bad; four were allowed for in the Committee calendar. I
certainly do not intend to hold up progress any more than necessary. I
just observe, however, that the fact that there are so many amendments
testifies to concern that the Bill is not yet in a fit state to go on
to the statute book if it is properly to serve the needs of the
children and young people whose lives and futures it 
<?notus-xml column=367?>deals with; to disappointment that the Government have not been more
responsive to concerns raised so far; and to the hope that we will see
more movement as the Bill passes through this House, so that its

the Government have in

see whether we can get four amendments out of the way
without more ado. I am moving Amendment 65B and speaking to Amendments
87, 90A and 105. They would ensure that the Bill covered children and
young people who have a disability under the Equality Act 2010 but do
not have a special educational need. The language varies slightly, and
this is just a random selection of places in the Bill where children
and young people with a disability but not a special educational need
could be inserted. Clause 19 deals with local
authorities’ role in supporting and involving children and young
people, Clause 26 deals with joint commissioning arrangements and
Clause 30 concerns the local offer. In that sense, they are probing
amendments to gain more understanding of the Government’s
reasons for introducing a Bill that deals with children with special
educational needs but not with children and young people with a
disability who do not have special educational needs.
Amendments 65B and 90A also ensure that the principal
obligation owed by local authorities by virtue of the Equality Act to
children and young people with disabilities but not a special
educational need—the duty to make reasonable
adjustments—is covered. Amendment 90A, in particular, is
designed to ensure that the reasonable adjustment duty is firmly
integrated into the planning of education, health and social care
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:18:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000042">Part
3 applies to children and young people with special educational needs.
Children and young people with special educational needs are defined in
the Bill as those who have a significantly greater difficulty in
learning than the majority of others of the same age or a disability
which prevents them from making use of the educational facilities
usually available in that area. Although many disabled children and
young people are covered by that definition of SEN, some are not. For
example, the following children would be disabled but have no special
educational need: a child with a physical disability whose school was
completely accessible to them or a child with a serious health
condition that does not impact on their learning or ability to access
the school premises. That group could include those with epilepsy,
asthma, diabetes or a motor or musculoskeletal disorder, all of which
might require medical treatment or therapies to be administered in
school, possibly alongside a social care package at home, but would not
require any educational
interventions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:19:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000043">Research
from the universities of Bath and Bristol, commissioned by the DfE
itself, estimated that around 25% of disabled children do not also have
special educational needs. The impact of this omission is that the Bill
will require local authorities and clinical commissioning groups to
plan jointly under Clause 26 and review under Clause 27 provision for
the 75% of disabled children and young people with SEN but not for the
25% of disabled children without SEN. Under Clause 30, local
authorities must set out a local offer of services available for the
75% of disabled children and young people with SEN but not for the 25% 
<?notus-xml column=368?>without SEN<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:20:23"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Bill thus creates a dividing line between children with SEN and
disabled children without SEN and, as a result, certain things must be
done for one group and not the
other<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:20:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

unfair, leaving disability out of Clauses 26, 27 and 30 does not make
sense on a practical level. The label SEN is simply not used by social
care or health commissioners. For example, under the Children Act 1989,
social care services are delivered to disabled children, not children
with SEN. Locally, the Bill as currently drafted will lead to confusing
arguments about whether a service is for children with SEN or only for
disabled children. There would be no additional cost to including
disabled children without SEN in the duty to review services or jointly
commission services. It could even end up saving money by creating a
more streamlined
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000045">There
are three things wrong with leaving disability out. First, as we have
seen, in the new world of integrated education, health and social care,
it will lead to confusion and unnecessary boundary disputes. Secondly,
it misses a golden opportunity to rationalise the legislation on SEN
and disability. SEN legislation is a river fed by two
tributaries—SEN legislation itself and disability discrimination
legislation. These overlap to a significant extent—some 75% as
the universities of Bath and Bristol have shown—but not
entirely. This Bill would be a perfect opportunity to bring the two
streams together into a single, more coherent framework. Thirdly,
leaving disability out goes back on what was promised in the Green
Paper on SEN and disability.</hs_para>

promised a new deal for children with SEN and disabled children. Local
authorities would be required to set out a local offer of services
available to support children who have SEN or who are disabled. There
would be stronger strategic planning and commissioning duties to
support children who have SEN or who are disabled. The Bill sets out
stronger strategic planning and commissioning duties but, importantly,
it does not include disabled children in these clauses, as was
promised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:23:28"></hs_TimeCode>. I
understand that the Government believe that disability is adequately
covered in the Bill as a result of Clause 20 but the references to
disability there are all to a disability that calls for special
educational provision to be made. I fear that does not really bring in
those with disabilities but without

do I think that this amendment is important? When the Government
originally published their proposals for the Bill, when Sarah Teather
was the Children’s Minister, the focus was very much on special
education and disability needs. The Government have said that this does
not prevent the provisions being applied to disabled children when
there are barriers to them accessing education. Clause 20 includes
disabled children as people who have special educational needs.
However, clarity is needed about what might constitute a barrier to
education. Are we just talking about things such as
additional support—Braille, and so on—or do we include
the simple ability to get to a class or get through a lesson due to a
spinal problem? This amendment is a probing one to clarify that
educational or training provision includes the ability to access
education and does not apply only to the actual classroom or teaching

point is simple: whether you need injections for diabetes, tablets for

progressive. I do not think that anybody would say, “Down with

way forward. What we are about is making it better. I was delighted to
see the Minister’s amendment—I thank him for
it—which means that, for the first time, there will be a duty of
care, there will be statutory guidance and we will, I hope, circulate
good practice. I spoke this week to Ofsted, which is keen to be
involved to ensure that that good practice and statutory guidance are
delivered. The real issue will be the quality and substance of the

of the things I am keen to do through the Children and Families Bill,

clear where they are responsible, and what the rights are of young
people who are in their schools. So, we are looking at referring
closely in the Code of Practice to the Equality Act and everything that
pertains to it that should reflect on better provision of special
educational needs and disability provision within schools and the
guidance that the EHRC, Equality and Human Rights Commission, has
produced, a very helpful guidance around reasonable adjustments

recognise that the draft code of practice on SEN issued in the last few
weeks includes a number of references to the Equality Act 2010 and the
reasonable adjustment duty as it applies to schools. The Equality and
Human Rights Commission has had a number of very productive
discussions with officials in the Department for Education, where it is
clearly recognised that the reasonable adjustments duty is a very
important part of the considerations schools make when looking at the
needs of disabled pupils and pupils with special educational needs.
With this amendment, I am asking Parliament to consider formalising the
current statutory definition of the code of practice such that it is
stated in the Bill that it applies to both the SEN framework and the
reasonable adjustment duty under the Equality Act 2010. Given that
there is a recognition in relation to pupils with disabilities or SEN,
it really would be helpful if the status of government guidance on

Diabetes UK. The Health Conditions in Schools Alliance is made up of
more than 30 organisations representing more than a million children.
They support Amendments 220 and 223, which call for duties to be placed
on schools to properly support children with health conditions. The
Government have now tabled Amendment 241A, which places a duty on
schools to support children with health conditions and to follow the
statutory guidance. This amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord
Nash, is, as has already been said, very welcome, but it is also clear
from those who have looked at it that we will require further assurance
from the Government that children and parents will not have to face the
problems they currently do. It would be very helpful indeed if the

Lords know, too many children with health conditions are not getting
the support they need. Their health is put at risk and they can be
excluded from lessons, from school trips and even from school entirely.
It can mean that some parents have to go into school to provide care
for their child at the expense of their own job. It can also mean that
children with health conditions are simply not given the opportunity to
reach their potential in school, which is a major disaster for them. If
a child is not getting the support it needs, there is very little a
parent can do. They can, of course, take legal action, but how many,
frankly, are in a position to do that or could afford it, particularly
with the conditions that now have to be
fulfilled<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:44:48"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000069">Although
the Government are to be applauded for recognising and dealing with
this problem, it requires a duty on schools. We know that some schools
will not meet the needs of children with health conditions. What
sanctions will schools face if they do not implement the duty and
follow the new statutory guidance? If children do not get the support
they need, what avenues will parents have to hold the school to
account? We would welcome assurance from the Government that their
statutory guidance will make clear what schools are required to do and
how they should do it. Placing clear duties on schools so they have
policies and plans in place to support children with health conditions
will mean that school staff will know what is expected of them, which
is crucial, and parents will know what schools should be doing. Most
importantly, it will mean children with health conditions will get the
support they need and get the most out of their education. I beg to

comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. The Health Conditions
in Schools Alliance supports this amendment. The alliance is made up of
30 organisations representing more than 1 million children. It called
for a duty to be placed on schools to support children with health
conditions. Children with conditions such as asthma or diabetes are
often left on their own or unsupervised and are vulnerable to an attack
or a hypo. Some children are prevented from treating their condition as
soon as they recognise the symptoms, often meaning that the situation
ends up worse than it should
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000072">A lack of
understanding from teachers and staff can make the situation worse by
making a child anxious and stressed about their condition, which can
make it worse than ever. A lack of understanding and training sometimes
means that teachers and staff are not able 
<?notus-xml column=374?>to recognise that certain conditions or medications can affect learning
and behaviour. Poor management of conditions often means that children
miss lessons. Sometimes schools do not even have policies for absence
and for whether a lesson has been learnt or not.</hs_para>

conditions means that children are better able to concentrate and get
the most out of their time in school. Exclusion from school, whether
from a trip, a lesson or for months at a time, is one of the most
common problems for children who face long-term health conditions. In
the past few days alone, Diabetes UK has had a number of calls to
explain the problems of children. I shall not mention the children by
name, but one 10 year-old girl who uses a pump has been told that she
cannot go on a residential trip unless her mother attends as well. The
dad was not considered appropriate. It is an activity holiday, so the
girl would exercise far more than usual. A staff member would not able
to look after the child unless the mother attended, so she cannot take
part in activities. This is quite common. Unless parents attend
residential trips and deal with the medication, children are excluded
from them.</hs_para>

or that the training is never refreshed. They are anxious about
responsibility for supporting children with health conditions and are
not helped to fulfil that properly. This is deeply worrying for

amendment places a duty on schools to work with local health services
to offer training and refresher training to staff. It would require
schools to have a proper policy in place to support children with
health conditions. That would mean that schools are prepared for things
such as staff leaving or being absent for school trips, and what
training their staff can expect. All children with a health condition
should have individual healthcare plans agreed between the school, the
child, the parents and specialist nurses, tailored to meet the needs in
various situations. Looking after children with health conditions is
not impossible, and many schools do it incredibly well. A combination
of good leadership, planning, communication and training shows how it
can be done. It is not burdensome. Schools that achieve that in the end
spend far less time looking after those children, who manage
successfully themselves.

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I will be brief—I
am sure that the Minister will be grateful for that—but I want
to say two things at the beginning. First, the Minister needs to know
that many organisations think that a great deal in the Bill is
extremely welcome. The tone of the debate seems critical. I think that
we have the number of amendments that we have simply because people
care about the issue and have discussed it at length. I have met
several organisations which have said how valuable a great deal of what
is in the Bill is, which will take forward work with disabled children.
I thought that we needed to have that on record while we are all
complaining bitterly about the things that the Government have not
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102369000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102369000082">I shall
speak to Amendment 220. Most of the points have been made, and I will
not make a long, heartfelt tirade about the group that I care about.
I just say that I work closely with children with congenital
heart disease, children born with half a heart, many of them with
hypoplastic left heart syndrome. They usually look like perfectly
ordinary children but they are in serious difficulty when they get to
school. I am therefore immensely grateful to see the Minister’s
amendment but I ask that we see the regulations, because the devil will
be in the detail as to whether it really meets the requirements. If we
can see the regulations early, it might relieve the pain on Report,
when people will otherwise want to speak at length again.</hs_para>

other question is: once we have the regulation and the detail, how will
families be able to complain without taking themselves through massive
tribunal cases, as we know has happened? It might be worth the
Government looking at how parents raise issues under the regulations
when they feel that their needs have not been met, because that would
save everybody pain. It is no use saying to ourselves that Ofsted will
deal with that, because we know that it visits only every four years.
Some children have been right through school and never seen an Ofsted
inspection. If we could have some clarity on that, it would certainly
speed things
up.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_23_PT_1/796C39E5112818A0E3D270CB93321D262BD6D945" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 October 2013">Wednesday,

welcome the government amendment most sincerely. I am glad that the

seeing the draft guidance, we have no way to comment on whether its
breadth and depth will be adequate to meet the needs of children with
medical conditions. I therefore hope that the Minister can make a
commitment to bring forward the draft guidance before Report, so that
we can improve it—not criticise it, but help to improve

want to ensure the inclusion of medical conditions not already
mentioned—the list is exhaustive, such as diabetes, epilepsy,
asthma and allergies, but also cancers. It is often thought that
children with cancers have short lives. Some, unfortunately, do, but
most childhood cancers are now long-term conditions and should be
treated more as chronic diseases, not short-term ones. I hope that the

guidance must recognise both the social and emotional needs of young
people with long-term medical conditions, and the fact that a health
condition can impact on a child or young person’s ability to
learn. Another important point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of
Southwark, was the need to involve the parents and children to ensure
that the school understands their condition and its emergency needs. A
child having a hypoglycaemic attack requires immediate treatment. A
child having an allergic attack requires immediate treatment. A child
with a migraine needs to be treated with compassion, because they may
lose their vision and hearing. Putting them in a corner or a quiet room
does not solve the problem. Those are some of the things that children
with a medical condition suffer on a daily basis in schools. If we

information, but I have met three or four children with differing
conditions. The problem is when schools do not recognise a medical
condition. A young man aged 18 with ME had a statement, but it was for
his behaviour, not for his medical condition. Even after the consultant
wrote to the school, the school refused to believe that the condition
existed. A girl with a congenital heart condition was taking an exam.
The invigilator had not been informed about the technical equipment she
had to wear, and she was pulled out of the exam. Cancer has already
been mentioned. There have certainly been some serious educational
support issues. I met one young lady who, in the year she had off from
formal schooling, had one supportive teacher who kept in touch
academically and socially. None of the others did. Home tuition via the
local authority was extremely patchy and had not linked up with the
school, and nor had the hospital school. As a result, the year was, in

a couple of suggestions that may be helpful. Not every teacher in the
country can be trained in all the different medical conditions. Why not
have a handy page on direct.gov.uk and schools’ websites so that
if a teacher has a child coming into their class or a tutor has a child
coming into their tutor group, they can look up what happens and get
some idea before they start liaising with the child and the
child’s parents? Then that person would take responsibility for
ensuring that other staff, including exam invigilators and PE teachers,
are fully appraised of what the child can do. There should certainly be
a teacher and a governor in each school with oversight of this,
particularly if the duty comes into force. It may or may not be the
SENCO, but there should be someone with a wider strategic view to make
sure that this wide range of medical conditions is

is one issue that no one has raised so far: children with medical
conditions who have some learning need during their condition. It may
not be enough to warrant a full statement or education and healthcare

it would have been helpful. The case is that of the young lady I met
through CLIC Sargent. It would have been extremely helpful for her to
have had co-ordinated educational support, but there was no

Grey-Thompson (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak in support
of my noble friend Lord Low. I have looked to my experience in
school—admittedly a few years ago—and thought about how
the Bill might affect me. I do not have special educational needs, and
nor does my noble friend Lady Campbell of Surbiton, who is not in her
place, but we both have access needs. My noble friend was considered to
have considerable needs, and I was considered to have lesser needs. I
was sent to a school miles away from where I lived. At the time it was
the only school in South Glamorgan that was allowed to take wheelchair
users. One might imagine that it was an accessible school. However,
access was appalling and nothing in particular was done to improve it.
There was an occasional ramp in the wrong place, and six people were
employed to carry wheelchair users up and down the stairs. I hope that
it is better today. I guess it was a product of its time.</hs_para>

be better, but we have to take into account other interruptions for
things such as physiotherapy in my noble friend Lady Campbell’s
case or missing school. I missed a period of school to have metal rods
inserted in my spine to stop it collapsing. I had to wear a plaster
cast jacket from my chin to my hips for six months, which left me with
very restricted movement, but nothing was done to make sure that I
could stay in school. I just had to make do. I then missed a year of
university because I snapped my metal rods—admittedly I was
training to be a Paralympian, but that is an aside. However, it was
such a major procedure that the only option for me was to write 12
essays and sit my exams within two weeks of university or to drop out
of the whole year. There was nothing in place to think about how my
impairment affected my ability to
study<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:04:44"></hs_TimeCode>. My noble

classes she was considered and classified as a “slow

the request of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, who cannot be here
today because she is at a family funeral. She strongly supports
Amendments 87 and 105. She says the government Green Paper, <I>Support

and young people and those with special educational needs. It provided
a vision of a more coherent and joined-up approach to meeting the needs
of these children and young people. However, the Children and Families
Bill concentrates 
<?notus-xml column=379?>on children with special educational needs only, to the detriment of
disabled children. Despite calls from the Education Select Committee
following pre-legislative scrutiny, and Members of the House of Commons
during debates on the Bill, the Government have refused to include
disabled children and young people without SEN within the scope of the

has estimated that around 25% of disabled children may not have SEN.
Yet it is just as vital that these children and young people have
access to the improved services and better co-ordinated provision that

proposed in Amendments 87 and 105, the Government would ensure that
they keep their promise to make the new system better for all disabled
children and young people and their families. In addition, the
Government will also ensure that all local authorities work in the most

his amendment because it is a great way of starting the debate. I have
put my name to Amendments 220 to 222 because, as we have already heard,
too many children with health conditions are not getting the support
they need in schools and this problem needs to be addressed. They
include, as we have heard, children with diabetes, epilepsy and
incontinence and many others who all need greater consideration.

feeling among doctors, medical practitioners and those working with
children who suffer from sickle cell that provision of community nurses
who deal with sickle cell sufferers should be expanded and more
resources made available in schools. According to a <I>British
Educational Research Journal</I> article, many young people who suffer
from sickle cell disorder report extensive negative experiences at
school. Around half have been prevented drinking water in class and
going to the toilet. These are simple, basic needs of sickle cell
sufferers. More than one-third were made to do unsuitable exercises and
were called lazy when they got tired because of their sickle cell
condition. Awareness needs to be raised by nurses visiting schools
whenever and wherever necessary to support and educate staff,
particularly sports teachers, about simple practices such as children
getting dried off quickly after swimming, cooling down after vigorous
exercise and being allowed to drink freely in class. Staff also need to
be aware of the brain problems, such as silent stroke, that can occur

they have an attack or a crisis they have to miss lessons at school and

refers only to medication and what to do in an emergency. It misses out
the whole area of prevention and preventive measures, which is vital to
keep those with sickle cell disorder safe and well. Also, it is no good
having advice on managing medicines if school staff can simply refuse
to administer them. Research shows that only a quarter of schools would
agree to give children with sickle cell disorder mild painkillers,
which is a problem for those suffering sickle cell, who need such
medication if they have a crisis or an
attack<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:10:38"></hs_TimeCode>. We need

know that the Government’s view is that the local school is best
placed to know the needs of its children, but research has shown that
schools are clearly not well placed to do this with sickle cell
disorder and need considerable help and guidance to respond adequately.
All children with medical conditions are supposed to have an individual
healthcare plan, but research shows that only 43% of schools with
children with sickle cell disorder even claimed to have such a plan.
Checking that all schools have such plans in place for children with
sickle cell disorder is essential. If such a policy is implemented it
will reduce admissions of sufferers to hospital, which is an added,
unnecessary strain on the NHS. Unfortunately, children suffering from
sickle cell disorder do not have any provision under special
educational needs; therefore I believe that a statement of special
educational needs is necessary to help protect these children’s
well-being at school and I look forward to hearing the
Minister’s views. I hope that these children will be brought
into the fold and given greater

whom the Minister very kindly agreed to see during the summer. These
laid out their personal cases in rather heart-rending fashion and
demonstrated just how fundamentally the support given in school can
influence not only children’s health but also their self-esteem,
their educational attainment and their family’s economic

because I think the Minister got that in bucketloads during the summer.
I do, however, want to raise some practical issues that go with the
Government’s amendment to lay a statutory duty on schools to
provide support. We are very pleased that the amendment includes
academies—that is very welcome—but the statutory duty is
not enough on its own and we are very pleased that the Government are

to be pretty strong and clear and to include some of the issues that
have been raised in the amendments from the noble Lords, Lord Kennedy
and Lord Storey. I should like to highlight three in particular because
they also need statutory force and, if they are not going to be in the
Bill, will the statutory guidance be sufficient to give them statutory
force? The first issue is that each school must have an appropriate
policy for dealing in an anticipatory way with the health needs of
children. The second is that every child must have a healthcare plan,
agreed with the child and the parents. The third issue is one gleaned
from discussions with parents, teachers and trade unions about the
fundamental requirement for appropriate training for school staff,
which the NHS is often not stepping up to the plate and providing, a
point that the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, raised. This is fundamental if
school staff are to feel confident in dealing with the wide range of
health conditions. It must be provided by the NHS but currently in many
places that is not happening. I believe that we should press the
Minister to consider placing in the Bill a duty on health authorities
to co-operate, as was outlined in Amendment 221 from the noble Lord,
Lord Storey, and Amendment 223 from the noble Lord, Lord
Kennedy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:16:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102381000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000022">Of
course, as well as statutory measures there will need to be a range of
good practice information, model policies and the ability for schools
to access support and advice as we move forward. I am sure that the
voluntary organisations involved in the Health Conditions in Schools
Alliance will be pleased to play their part in providing that sort of
information and support. However, there is one further issue that we
perhaps need to examine: whether there is a way of encouraging, and
indeed checking, on occasions, whether schools are adequately
complying. I wonder if I could urge the Minister to consider urging
Ofsted to use its guidance for inspectors to reinforce the importance
of the new duty when it comes into play, and perhaps to encourage
Ofsted to do what it does on occasions, which is, as part of the
inspection regime, to gather data over a period about a particular
issue to illuminate that issue and to gain perspective on the
effectiveness of the implementation of the duty. That could be in 2015,
when schools have had plenty of time to get themselves sorted. I would
very much appreciate it if the Minister could consider encouraging
Ofsted in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:17:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102381000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000023">In

to be reassured that the combined duty and the statutory guidance will

I have been disappointed that no noble Lords have mentioned the other
children in these schools, because the attitude of the other children
is exceedingly important, both for the children who are suffering from
disability and SEN and for those who are not. I remember having an
all-party group in this Room, where a head teacher had brought four or
five of her girls. It was a school for children with mobility problems.
It became apparent as one listened to them that the whole school was
committed to caring about these children, and this self-evidently makes
a huge difference. Would the Minister consider putting something in his
guidelines to address this
problem?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_23_PT_1/9E5FDC588B49DC78D536B8D6D013E366B0B94919" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 October 2013">Wednesday,

Amendment 87 along with that of the noble Lord, Lord Low. It relates to
Clause 25, which is about the integration of local authority services
with health services and care services. It comes back to the whole
issue of disability as well as medical conditions and so forth. This
was the subject of the noble Lord’s initial presentation on

issue. The problem is that Clause 25 says

Amendments 69, 70, 90 and 91, and we have added our names to Amendment
223 in this group. We have had a very long debate and I hope that I am
not going to repeat too much of what colleagues have said. I start by
echoing the points that the noble Lord, Lord Low, made in his
contribution. The first batch of our amendments very much dwells on
that issue. It is an important and it picks up the point that the noble
Baroness, Lady Sharp has just made: it goes to our concerns about the
heart of Part 3 of the Bill. We believe that, despite the very good
intentions in the Bill to be inclusive, it appears that it still
intends to exclude those with a recognised disability or chronic
illness from a whole swathe of its provisions, and we believe that that
is essentially still
divisive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102381000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000037">We
also feel that it is important that this issue is addressed and
resolved now, at the outset, because it is a flaw that runs through the
heart of Part 3. It needs to be tackled at this stage, not least
because when we talked to the clerks about future amendments, they
identified another 40 areas where we would have to table amendments to
achieve a similar effect if we are not able to resolve it at the outset
in the original definitions. So it is important that we come to a
proper understanding and agreement with the Minister at this point

amendments, in common with those of a number of noble Lords, have
sought to tackle whether the definition of SEN includes disability by
amending the definition. Our intention and the way we have gone 
<?notus-xml column=385?>about it—a number of noble Lords have attempted to do the same
thing—is to extend the scope of the Bill to refer to
the definitions in the Equality Act 2010, to which the noble Baroness,
Lady Howe, and others have referred. Our aim is to provide an
overriding, inclusive definition which will apply throughout
Part 3. We think that this is important and we feel that the
arguments are overwhelming and compelling on this
count<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:31:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102381000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000039">The
noble Lord, Lord Low, referred to research that we already have from
the universities of Bath and Bristol, which was commissioned by the
department and estimated at that time that in the region of 25% of
disabled children may not have special educational needs. Indeed, that
evidence was quoted by the Minister, Edward Timpson, in the Commons,
when he said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13102381000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000115">“it

definition, then, 25% are not. He also made it clear that the
definition of SEN in the Bill mirrors the current definition, which, as
we know, excludes many children. Again, noble Lords have cited
statistics in that respect. The Minister himself took a similar line in
his letter after Second Reading, in which he said that 75% of disabled
children would be classed as having special educational needs. We have
heard some examples this afternoon of the problems that this
causes.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102381000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000041">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:33:41"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, made the point very eloquently and
we have heard other examples of children with a physical disability
who, because the school was completely accessible, were not categorised
as having SEN, or a child with serious health conditions that do not
impact on their learning also not being classified as having SEN. We
really need to bottom out whether it is the Government’s
intention that such children would continue to be excluded from the
provision in the Bill. This matters enormously because the truth is
that assessment of SEN is the gateway in the Bill to all the other
support provisions. As it stands, the joint commissioning provision and
the local offer would be available to those defined as having SEN but
not to the 25% who are not defined in that way. It would exclude the
non-SEN children from health and social care provision to which some of
them may already be entitled—we might be going
backwards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:33:35"></hs_TimeCode>. This

know from this debate and from the level of correspondence and meetings
that we have had that this remains a key ask of the sector; its
frustration with the current proposals in understandable and urgently
in need of resolution. The principles of the Green Paper were to make a
system that would be simpler for parents, children and young people. At
that stage, it was understood that education, care and health plans and
the local offer would bring together current entitlements for disabled
children and young people, regardless of what combination of education,
health and social provision they require. That seems to us to a good
principle, but we seem to have moved a long way from that excellent
aspiration in the Green Paper.</hs_para>

attending various meetings and briefings with the Minister, as well as
looking back over the Commons debate, I have yet to hear a coherent
argument as to why the Government are now insisting on this narrow
definition of SEN, which appears profoundly to limit access to
services. More recently we have heard that they do not feel that there
is enough evidence that some groups of young people would be excluded
from that provision but their own research seems to disprove that.

point being

argument seems to be that the code of practice will address some of
those issues. Having looked at the draft code, it does not seem to shed
sufficient further light on those key concerns. Anyway, reference to
the code of practice is not good enough. We want this Bill to bring
together all the different types of support that children need, which
was promised in the Green Paper. That is key to ensuring that the needs
of those children and young people are taken into account in joint
strategic planning and commissioning, and that their educational
progress is

Minister will recognise the strength of feeling on this issue and put
the sector’s mind at rest by agreeing to take this issue away to
find a more acceptable, fully inclusive definition of SEN. If the
Government intend the Bill to cover all children with a recognised
disability or chronic illness, will he agree to work with us on a
wording that would definitely and genuinely achieve
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:36:24"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102381000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000046">I
now turn to the amendments tabled by the Government which address
children with longer-term medical conditions. Again, we have added our
name to Amendment 223 which addresses this issue. Obviously, we very
much welcome the progress that has been made. It seems that the
amendment remains quite general in its current form.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:36:59"></hs_TimeCode> know that
several other noble Lords have already posed questions to the Minister
but I should like to add some of my
own<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:37:02"></hs_TimeCode>. How will a
medical condition be defined and who will be covered by it? What is
meant by the requirement for schools to “make
arrangements” for support? Is that the same as a duty to secure
the support? Where is the role of health authorities in working with
schools on this? Why are requirements to consult parents and to provide
appropriate staff training not set out more clearly? Perhaps more
fundamentally—again, this challenge has been raised
today—when will the draft guidelines be available and will we
see them before

Baroness, Lady Warnock, in 1978. Her work transformed the lives of many
children and young people, allowing them to enjoy the benefits that a
high quality education can bring. We have seen other changes in law and
society that have shaped this country’s view of disabled
children, including such important legislation as the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 and the Equality Act 2010 and, of course, the
great success of the Paralympics last

seen for this group of children in our lifetimes and the challenges
ahead were brought home strongly to me when I visited Chailey Heritage
School with my noble friend Lady Cumberlege at the start of the school
year. There I saw an institution that was founded out of charity to
provide training in crafts to children born “crippled”,
as it was termed then in the East End of London. Now it offers
outstanding education, care and support to children and young people
with the most profound and complex needs who, with excellent teaching,
care and the aid of modern technology, are being supported to learn and
to fulfil their great
potential<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:40:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
Disabled children and children with special educational needs must all
be treated first as individuals. They all have different needs. It is
the Government’s concern, as I know it is of everyone in this

work and legacy of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, and to the
tireless work of many of your Lordships in championing the rights of
children with SEN and disabled children. I also know that I do not need
to tell you that, despite all the successes of the past 30 years, the
current system is not working as it should. Fundamentally, successful
reform will be about a change of culture. As we all know, it is
tempting to think that by legislating a word here and a new duty there
we can solve complex issues. However, what matters is how professionals
work with children and families.
Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:41:28"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lords

services around the needs of the family, putting children, young people
and parents at its
heart<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:41:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
Legislation cannot do that alone but the Bill sets the framework to
support the right ways of working. The detail is in the code of
practice, which I hope noble Lords have now had the opportunity to
read. It has been informed by the experience of the 
<?notus-xml column=388?>pathfinders. They are showing how services can come together and how
families can help share the available support. I hope that those noble
Lords who were able to hear from some of the pathfinders last week
found their experiences both helpful and encouraging. I was struck
then, and on my visits to pathfinders in Greenwich and Hertfordshire,
how they were working with families to develop support that meets their
needs and the impact that that support and the new ways of working were

to the definition of SEN, this group of amendments reflects concerns

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> On that point, I wonder if the
Minister will accept—as we talked about when we met him this
week, and based on the contributions from others today—that
there is a degree of circularity in language and in practice around
this definition. As we heard from the noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson, and others, very often the access to education and
learning implications of a disability are not recognised by schools or
local authorities as a special educational need and, under the
definition of this Bill, if they are not recognised as a special
educational need then they will not fall into the scope of the Bill.
This is a big problem that everyone has been trying to clarify. I
realise that it is very complex but we need to get to the hub of this.
I would be grateful if the Minister could explain, outside the
circularity of this language, why the Government are excluding the kind
of young people that the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, and others
were referring

today and consider them further, including, I hope, understanding more
clearly the point that the noble Baroness made. The Bill defines a
learning difficulty or disability as significantly greater difficulty
in learning than the majority of others of the same age, or a
disability that prevents or hinders a child or young person from making
use of facilities. This means that the majority of disabled children
also have special educational needs, and we have seen from the

framework, there is other important legislation that protects disabled
children and young people. The Equality Act 2010 makes it clear that
all education providers and commissioners must make sure that
reasonable adjustments are made for those with disabilities,
including providing auxiliary aids and services such as specialised
computer programmes, hoists and sign language interpreters. Parents can
legitimately complain if education providers fail to deliver those

system there are legal protections. Section 3 of the NHS Act 2006 gives
CCGs a statutory duty to provide health services to meet the reasonable
needs of a child with a complex health need. Section 17 of
the Children Act 1989 gives local authorities a general duty to
safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need in their area.
Together, therefore, the provisions in the Bill and existing
legislative arrangements provide important protections and support for
disabled children and their
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:46:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Bill, we need to understand which children might not be supported by
these provisions and how changing the Bill would help
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:47:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I turn to
health conditions and my amendment. A number of the amendments in this
group—those tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Low, Lord Storey and
Lord Kennedy, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth—concern
children with long-term health conditions. I agree that children and
young people with medical needs should not miss out on a full education
simply because they have a medical condition. They should not be
prevented from active participation in wider school
activities that are so vital to their academic attainment and social
well-being.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102381000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000060">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:47:41"></hs_TimeCode>
have heard the evidence that suggests that current arrangements do not
always work as they should. That evidence included a meeting with the
noble Baroness, Lady Young, and the case made very powerfully by two
young people, Beth and Max, whom she brought to see me. I find it
appalling that some schools fail their pupils in such a fundamental
way. While it remains the case that most schools manage this issue
well, and it is important to acknowledge that, it would be wrong to
ignore the instances of poor practice. Where there is poor practice,
pupils can be placed at disadvantage or risk simply because they are
not receiving the right support for their health needs.</hs_para>

me say on many occasions that this Government trust teachers and head
teachers to run their schools and to adjust their provisions for the
particular circumstances of their pupils. We believe that this applies
to provisions such as PSHE and careers; all good schools should have an
active programme on these matters, but they must be free to adjust to
the local needs of their particular pupils. However, in the case of
medical conditions, this is not a question of subjectivity. When a
pupil has an epileptic seizure, there is a clear procedure that needs
to be followed; it is not a question of interpretation. At certain
times, a diabetic child will need more insulin or more
glucose—it is as simple as that, and there is no scope for
subjectivity. The same will apply to asthmatic
pupils<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

supporting pupils with medical conditions and to have regard to

am aware that many other duties could be placed on schools. However,
ensuring that children who already have medical issues are not placed
at further risk seems to me to be extremely important and obvious. This

managing medicines guidance for schools later this year, and I thank

government amendment—I am very pleased with it—an
omission is the NHS. My amendment places a duty on NHS bodies to
co-operate with school governing bodies; the government amendment does
not. I want to avoid coming back on this on Report. We are now so close
to getting this. I do not want to find that the guidance is great and
it all works fine, but that it all falls over because there are
problems between the NHS and schools. Is the Minister prepared to
facilitate a discussion between the NHS, the Department of Health and
representatives here and elsewhere before Report to close that point?

the Minister has responded. I am not quite sure whether that is my role
or whether I should simply respond to my own amendment, although I will
not do even that in any detail. A lot of observations have been made

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> It is me again so soon. Amendment 65C is
the only amendment in this group, which means that I should be able to
speak to it somewhat more briefly. The amendment is about the rights of
disabled young adults. In using the term “disabled
people”, I include those with SEN. Referring to disabled people
will help to anchor the notion that the Bill, as we discussed as
regards the previous group, should be about disabled people without SEN
as well as those with
SEN<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:06:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102381000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000094">The
Bill does not clearly distinguish between the rights of children and
those of young adults. As the age range covered by the Bill goes from
birth to 25, the rights of young adults need to be clearly
differentiated. Parental responsibility for decision-making is in place
until the age of 18. While that is subject to some flexibility in
certain areas, such as consent to medical treatment and the Gillick
competence, the position is different form that relating to those aged
more than 18 who have their own rights and responsibilities, and where
parents do not have a specific legal role unless the young person lacks
competency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102381000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000095">I
am concerned that the Bill does not make this distinction clearly
enough. Therefore, it has the potential to blur the right of young,
disabled adults aged more 
<?notus-xml column=395?>than 18 to be involved in decisions about their own education. Amendment
65C makes clear that disabled young people must be consulted and
involved in their own right, and supported to participate as fully as
possible in the process. Other young people would not expect decisions
about their future to be made for them, so nor should this be the case
for disabled young people. I beg to

assure the noble Lord that the Bill already makes the distinction
between children in relation to whom decisions are made by their
parents and young people who make those decisions themselves. A local
authority would be in breach of its duties if it failed to make such a
distinction. Clause 27 requires local authorities to consult young
people when it reviews its special educational provision and social
care provision. Regulation 4 of the local offer regulations
is very clear that local authorities must consult with young people
directly over the local offer. That may be an implementation challenge
for many local authorities but it does not require a change to
legislation. For young people with education, health and care plans,
which may be particularly relevant to what the noble Lord has just
raised, it is they, not their parents, who must be consulted about
their assessment and
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102381000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#13102381000098">It

presumption in favour of education in a mainstream setting, but this

The frequency of such litigation about the presumption in favour of
mainstream education suggests that the current state of the law and

such a general principle that avoided the crude binary distinction
between inclusion and specialism that the Government seek to avoid. It
recommends that Clause 19 should be amended to include an additional
general principle that follows closely the language of the UK’s

turn to Amendment 157B. It can probably be understood best if we look
at the background in the current legislation. Sections 316 and 316A of
the Education Act 1996 which, until the Bill is passed, is the codified
legislative framework governing special education, provide a strong
qualified right to inclusion in mainstream education where the parents
want it. That can be defeated in relation to mainstream as a type of
provision only if the placement of the child would be incompatible with
the efficient education of other children and there are no reasonable
steps that can be taken to remove that incompatibility at all schools
in the local authority’s
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310242000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#1310242000008">Likewise,
in relation to a particular school, the presumption in favour of
mainstream falls away only if the placement of the child would be
incompatible with the efficient education of other children and there
are no reasonable steps that can be taken to remove that
incompatibility in that school. However, that does not necessarily get
the child a right to a particular school place. That is still dealt
with for maintained schools under paragraph 3(3) of Schedule
27  
<?notus-xml column=398?>only. A request for a maintained school place, mainstream or special,
must be complied with unless that would be unsuitable for the age,
ability, aptitude or special educational needs of the child or young
person concerned, or if it would be incompatible with the education of
other children or the efficient use of resources.</hs_para>

equivalent of the “reasonable steps” obligation that
exists in relation to mainstream under the Education Act or arising
under the Equality Act. That can lead to each school arguing that it
would be incompatible in the Schedule 27 sense. Overall, that can
greatly cut down the ability of a parent in that situation to get the
particular mainstream school that they want for their child, even if in
theory they can establish a right to mainstream as a type. In some
cases, it can even leave children seemingly without any school place at

Bill helpfully rationalises the legislative framework that I have just
described by bringing the interlocking provisions of the Education Act
1996 together in Clause 39 and extending them to mainstream academies.
Unfortunately, however, what I have called the “reasonable
steps” obligation, which provides that a parent’s request
can be resisted only when there are no reasonable steps that can be
taken to remove the objections to the child’s admission on
specified grounds, has been completely removed. In my view, that is not
the right way to achieve consistency between Sections 316 and 316A and
the Schedule 27 limb of the Education Act 2096. The better way in which
to achieve that consistency would be to provide that the
“reasonable steps” obligation should apply to both the
unsuitability and the incompatibility limbs of Article 39(4). The
amendment would achieve that. It would strengthen the ability of
parents to get not merely a mainstream place but also the mainstream
place of their preference. I beg to

community and to have the same opportunities as their non-disabled
peers. Despite some very welcome reforms to support for disabled
children and children with SEN in the Bill, I fear that the right of
disabled children to participate in their community will not be
sufficiently realised through the Bill. This concern is shared by

compelling evidence that families with disabled children currently

Indeed, Scope’s recent <I>Keep Us Close</I> report found that a

Government previously stated in Committee on the Bill in the other
place that there are already duties in place to ensure that appropriate
provision is made for children and young people with special
educational needs and disabled children and their families. However,
such duties are clearly failing to achieve their intended purpose.
Although the Equality Act 2010 requires organisations to be proactive
and responsive in ensuring that the public services that they provide
are inclusive and accessible, the reality is that services for disabled
children are often developed, planned and commissioned separately from
other community services, and consequently miss more strategic
opportunities to create joined-up support and a more inclusive society.
Parents are confronted with local activities and services that are
either inaccessible, or a lack of support services to enable disabled
children to join in with local activities such as youth groups or even
simply playing in the park with their
peers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310242000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0001.htm#1310242000023">The
Government need to set out a clear strategic direction and create a
strong imperative for local authorities to focus on accessibility of
local services, and that is exactly what the amendment would do.
Although a number of local authorities undertake excellent work
alongside families with disabled children to ensure that their needs
are met by mainstream services—notably Suffolk, Leeds and
Blackpool—not all local authorities are as progressive. Many
local authorities and voluntary organisations want to provide more

duty on local authorities and NHS bodies would not have to be
burdensome. Disabled children and those with SEN more often than not do
not need hugely different or specialist services. With small changes to

speech, language and communication needs. We were fascinated that, for
example, in Walsall, assessments were made of children in secondary
schools. Nowhere else in the country could we find that being done in
the same way. In Stoke, they were training lollipop men and dinner
ladies to identify conditions in children which they might bring to the

the general principle of inclusion in a number of its key provisions.
It places duties on schools and colleges to use their best endeavours
to ensure that those with SEN get the support they need. It also

different preferences for where they wish to be educated, including
specialist settings such as special schools and independent specialist

to make it clear that nothing in the Bill replaces or overrides those
provisions. Indeed, we have drawn attention to those duties and set out
examples of the reasonable steps schools and colleges can take to
include children and young people in mainstream settings in Section
7(11) of the draft SEN code of practice. Chapter 6 of the draft code
provides strong guidance to all mainstream early years settings,

local authorities, schools and post-16 institutions to consider
reasonable steps. That is solely to show that there are no reasonable
steps that could be taken to prevent a child or young person’s
placement in a mainstream setting from being incompatible with the

reasonable steps provision to all the exceptions in Clause 39 and I am

education, health and social care services. While the Government agree
that such services should be accessible and, as far as possible,
inclusive, we believe that the best approach is not to set out clear

provision inclusive, by using their “best
endeavours”—a very strong obligation—to meet the
SEN of all their pupils. Health commissioners are similarly under a
very clear duty in the NHS Act 2006 to reduce inequalities in access to
services between people and inequalities in the outcomes derived from
those services. These provisions will be supported by the statutory SEN

not make sense to have a “reasonable steps” operation in

assurance from the Minister that Clause 19 applies to all of Part 3,
including these clauses. If the Government’s intention is to
involve children under 16 in decision-making about their own lives, I

another place, the Minister stressed the importance of Clauses 32, 36,

Government’s reasoning regarding decision-making is also
inconsistent, as other provisions in Part 3 explicitly refer to the
involvement of children as well as young people and parents—for

ensure that children are consulted about issues that affect
them—in other words, the importance of listening to the voice of
the child. I cannot help feeling that the amendments should be
unnecessary, given the Government's stated position on the rights of
the child. The coalition Government stated in December 2010 that they
would give due consideration to the Convention on the Rights of the
Child when developing new legislation and policy, while the
Government's policy for youth supports the importance of involving
children and young people, including those under 16, in decision-making
processes. As the noble Lord, Lord Storey, said, the UN Convention on

its title and throughout. The Minister may say, “Ah yes, but
that’s not intentional and the code of practice makes it
clear”. Unfortunately, the code of practice does not
make it clear because the code is also inconsistent. It is a bit more
consistent than the Bill because it talks more often about children and

intended and can be put in. We now have a great deal of experience of
engaging young people. Certainly, CAFCASS has done a huge amount of
work in working with very young children and understanding their wishes
and feelings. The Children’s Rights Director spent a long time
talking to young people and young children about how decisions were
made about them. It is amazing how very young children feel very
deprived of having a part to play in their own lives when they have not
been
included<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:08:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that not including children in decisions has harmful effects. We know
from similar research into divorce that young children who are taken
along and understand what is happening have less trauma later than
those who suddenly find out that it is happening. There is similar
research into the effect of understanding on children. I hope that this
is a slip of the pen and that we will find that both are

As my name is attached to a number of amendments in this group, I want
to emphasise what the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, has said so ably.
It is crucial that from the moment at which a child can speak, their
views are sought. To an extent, that may depend on how much value can
be given to what they say and on their age. Nevertheless, it is
important to hear what they have to say. As you get older and have
great-grandchildren as well as grandchildren, the more you are aware of
exactly what you are learning from their experiences, which can change
your views quite considerably. I very much support the noble Baroness,
Lady
Massey.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_23_PT_1/D4A2E29509157977C2CAC1BA0BC1467522896E7C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 October 2013">Wednesday,

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Storey
for his welcome of Clause 19, which was echoed by other Members of the
Committee in this mini-debate. We fully understand the intention behind
the amendments—the desire to ensure that the views of the child
and his or her parent or carer, or the young person, are fully taken
into account; that they are informed and can participate in making
decisions, with the information and support that they need to make
those decisions; and that the child or young person is supported to
achieve the best possible

particularly my noble friend, that Clause 19 enshrines the principle
that children and young people should be involved in decisions about
their lives. I hope it reassures him and other noble Lords that this
applies throughout Part 3, including to the clauses on assessment and
planning. This is reflected in the draft code of practice, which sets
out in Chapter 7.3 that in determining whether an assessment is
necessary, the views, wishes and feelings of the child should be taken

home educate their children to specify home education as an alternative

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, slightly unusually, I shall speak to
Amendments 76 and 78 before I speak to Amendment 70A, because Amendment
70A, as it were, is an issue connected with some of the things that I
am going to say. I have already mentioned my concern that we are
looking at all children and not just the 2.8% who have special
educational needs. In saying that, though, I presume that the
Government’s aim is to continue the Education Act 1996 and what
was said in it. After all, that is where the statements stem from that
are now being turned into EHC plans. The Education Act 1996
says:</hs_para>

recent years, a number of us have set out to raise the profile of
speech, language and communication needs as a 21st-century scourge.
They have crept up on us increasingly because of the lifestyle that is
lived in the 21st-century—the electronic lifestyle, the parental
neglect lifestyle, the lack of communication in families lifestyle, the
lack of communication between people lifestyle—and the fact that
there are simply appalling figures about people who are identified as
having speech, language and communication needs when they start school.
I found, for example, when going to do an experiment with speech and
language therapists in two young offender institutions, funded by the
Helen Hamlyn Trust, that 67% of the young offenders had some form of
identifiable speech, language and communication need. They had reached
the age of 15 before this was discovered, hence the fact that the
conclusion from our studies was that if only that had been identified
early, they might not have been in the young offender institution
because they would have been able to complete their education. Think of
the waste of the numbers who had been excluded or evicted, quite apart
from those who had truanted, because of their inability to connect with
the education
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310242000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0002.htm#1310242000083">In
recent years, we have learnt that successive Governments have made
considerable movement on this. I particularly glad about the early
years foundation stage scheme, which has every child assessed at the
age of two to see whether there are difficulties and disabilities.
During the study that I have already mentioned to the Committee, we
were very pleased to take evidence from Northern Ireland, where speech
and language therapists are involved in the training of health visitors
before they go to carry out that assessment to make certain that those
particular needs are identified.</hs_para>

purpose of Amendments 76 and 78 is to draw attention to the need for
such early intervention. If the general intent that I mentioned earlier
that I saw behind Clause 19, particularly Clause 19(d)—namely,
that every child should be enabled to be educated to the best of their
ability—while early identification is the key to improving the
educational outcomes for children and young people with speech,
language and communication needs, some of whom will also have other
needs, such as physical needs, I would have thought that the

the children who have them also have some degree of literacy
difficulty; a high proportion of them end up being excluded. The
trouble is that this has gone unidentified, very often for far too
long. You even find people getting to secondary school who cannot
communicate there, having failed to communicate during primary school.
If we are talking about 0 to 25 pathways, we are presumably thinking
about the transition from education into employment. I have been very
interested to see the identification by employers and others of the
problems of speech, language and communication needs with potential
employees. So I am very keen to see that speech, language and
communication needs are included in the Bill as special educational
needs, because without the language and communication you will not have

education. That is a terrible figure, and I suspect that it could be an
underestimate. There are factors such as learning delays, and so on, to
be taken into account; 1 million, or 10% of all the children in the
country, have identified speech, language and communication problems

other words, there is a great deal to be done, it seems to me, to
educate those who are responsible, not just for the initial assessment,
but for subsequent child development, so that they can monitor all
children as they progress through the 0 to 25 pathway. Conditions such
as ADHD, which can actually be treated, ought to be identified much
earlier than after the second exclusion from school. My reason for
including it is, to repeat what I said earlier to the Minister, that I
believe that before any regulations or instructions are issued to local
authorities and others as to what is be done in this area, there ought
to be urgent consultation with those who have been studying it to make
certain that what they have learned and gleaned, and what they are
increasingly understanding, is incorporated in whatever comes out.
Things have moved on since my noble friend Lady Warnock did her
marvellous work, and there is a great deal which ought to be

Touhig (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 77 in
my name and that of my noble friend Lady Hughes of Stretford and to
Amendments 82, 83, 84 and 85 in my name. Before doing so, I
add my support to Amendment 70A in the name of the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham. For me, this amendment represents an important first step
in reforming the exclusion policy in schools so far as people with
special educational needs are concerned. Some 70% of children excluded
from school in England are SEN. That is telling us something: it is a
real challenge for us to tackle, and the noble Lord’s amendment
at least goes 
<?notus-xml column=416?>some way to start looking at that. I know from family support workers in
south Wales that in some of our cities they are concerned about what
they call “soft exclusions”, whereby a child is told,
“We don’t want to see you for the next 10 days”,
or, “It’s half term next week; we don’t want to
see you till we come back after half term”. There is no record
kept. This is illegal but it happens, and I fear that young people with
learning difficulties are much
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310242000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0002.htm#1310242000091">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:33:03"></hs_TimeCode>

considerable time because his teacher was someone who had an autistic

now turn to Amendment 77, which seeks to address the issue of early
identification. I know that I am not alone in the Committee in
believing that identifying and supporting children with special
educational needs as early as possible is the most important factor in
improving outcomes. Clause 22 requires local authorities to seek to
identify children and young people in their areas who may have special
educational needs. Amendment 77 would insert the words “as early
as possible”, which most people would believe is common
sense—after all, why would we not do that? Why would we not seek
this information as early as
possible?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310242000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0002.htm#1310242000093">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>
professionals who work with children have a crucial role to play: they
are the first educators that the children come into contact with. A
number of issues, such as speech and communication problems,
developmental delays and behavioural and literacy issues can be better
addressed by a good quality early years provider. This means that
children start school in a much better position than they would
otherwise, and fewer resources are required in later
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310242000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0002.htm#1310242000094">There is
evidence, though, to show that the early years workforce is typically
the least qualified in the education sector. Reductions in local
council budgets have meant that they have cut their training spend for
early years staff by 40% in the past three years. This has resulted in
many cutting back on early years area SENCOs that they have previously
employed to provide advice and training in early years settings.
However, the support that they provide is needed now more than ever. A
recent Communications Trust project, Talk of the Town, evidenced that
across a federation of schools, children and young people’s
speech, language and communication needs were under-identified by an
average of 40%. The Communications Trust said

the educational establishment, “Oi! There’s a problem.
Come over here and give us a hand”. I have lost track of the
number of times I have had conversations with Members of both Houses of
Parliament about dyslexic children and grandchildren: “How do
you get the help?”, “Who do you go through?”,
“What’s the matter?” and “Do we tell them
they have a problem or not?”. Identification here is very
important. Making that a stronger duty, despite the fact that it might

amendments and declare an interest as the patron of the British
Stammering Association. In particular, I urge the Minister to take on
board Amendments 70A and 77. I shall quote three pieces of research.
The first is from his own department, almost a year ago. It found that
speech, language and communication needs were significantly
under-identified among children. The other research is from the
organisations that form the Communication Trust. Language development
at the age of two is shown not only strongly to predict
children’s performance on entry to primary school but it also
links to outcomes into adulthood. That means employment prospects as
well as education. Tied to that is the fact that language development
in the early years has a significant impact on the behaviour and
emotional development of children. We are talking, of course, of an
adverse impact—anti-social behaviour. The final fact is that too
many children enter school without their speech, language and
communication needs being addressed or even
identified<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:42:05"></hs_TimeCode>.

Storey:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak to Amendment 80.
Clause 22 requires local authorities to identify whether children have
special educational needs. This amendment would require local
authorities to publish data on children identified as having that need
or disability and provide a breakdown of this data by type of need.
Accurate data on the number of children in their area are vital for
local authorities to plan and deliver services effectively. The draft
SEN code of practice, particularly in the section on joint
commissioning, outlines the importance of local data sets to identify
the needs of children with SEN and inform decision-making. Currently,
data from different sources for the same area can vary wildly.
Inaccurate data can disproportionately impact on the planning for and
delivery of services for children and young people with low-instance
conditions such as visual, hearing or multisensory impairments. To give
one example, figures on the number of deaf children vary by as much as
30,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:43:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

huge amount of energy goes into collecting data for different data sets
but none is effective in bringing together a single set that gives
reliable figures. Consideration should be given to a simplified,
joined-up and less bureaucratic approach, starting within central
government. There are three different ways in which data collection
could be improved. First, schools and local authorities could be asked
to record in the school census whether a child has a disability, as
well as formally identified special educational needs. Secondly, a
child’s unique health identifier could be used in education and
social care as well. This could capture whether a child has a sensory
impairment. Thirdly, disability registers could be improved and have
greater ongoing oversight. The department needs to review how data on
children with sensory impairments more widely are collected to a
reliable standard and used to reform the planning and commissioning of
SEN services. A welcome commitment from the Government to exploring
this further would be of real

Lucas:</Member></B> Then I shall add them to what I am going to say. I
very much support what the noble Lord says about Amendment 70A. It is
very important to create a system for identification and picking up
kids when you start to see symptoms that might be symptoms of a special
need. A lot of the time, there is no sensible way in which a classroom
teacher can tell; the difference between ADHD and bad behaviour is not
obvious. The motivations behind that behaviour can come from all sorts
of things. You need a specialist. You need someone to look, in a
one-to-one situation where they are not trying to deal with 30 other
children at the same time. You need a decent length of time just to
concentrate, and to really know your stuff. It needs to be a proper
process of finding out what the problem is.</hs_para>

have happy memories of going into my child’s school in his
second week, by which time he had been given 15 detentions, five of
them for having too many detentions. That ought to be saying something
to a school, but they need to have the resources available to pick up
on what the problem is and settle down and identify it, rather than
just having to react to the symptoms. Amendment 70A would put in a
backstop—a long way back from where good practice should be, but
at least it would be there. That second exclusion really should trigger
a proper analysis of what the underlying cause is of the symptoms that
the school and the child are suffering from.</hs_para>

also very much support Amendment 80. There is a lot to be said for
having a decent data set for what is going on, not least because it
would enable us to spot patterns across the country of differences in
diagnosis and in how children were being assessed and treated, which is
very important with a process that is essentially local but conditions
that are not. The conditions are national, and you want to know what is
going on so that you can inquire whether a particular pattern is the
result of good or bad practice and either deal with it or spread it,
depending on what is right. The base for that has to be data, something
at local authority level that can be quite detailed without giving away
any personal information and can be a useful and comparable source of
information. That should be one of the foundations of our
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:50:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310242000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0002.htm#1310242000115">However,
I do not support Amendments 76 and 78. I do not like the idea of the
local authority having to scour the country looking under every stone
for people with special educational needs. That would be particularly
objected to, quite rightly, by the home education community. A lot of
those children have been brought out of education because of how badly
their special needs have been dealt with by schools, and the last thing
that they want is the local authority lording it over them and saying
that it has to be in every three months diagnosing their child and
telling them what to do. That relationship does not succeed in those
cases.</hs_para>

should not try to create something that intrusive by a local authority.
Yes, as was said, the local authority should have its ears open, be a
point of contact and have a duty to respond when someone thinks that
their child has special needs and wants something done about it.
Coupled with the other duties, I think  
<?notus-xml column=421?>that the Bill will achieve a responsive local authority—a body
that will pick up on problems that come to its notice and which has to
have its eyes open in ordinary ways, so that it knows what is going on
in schools—but which does not have to scour the highways and
byways for people with special educational needs. To my mind, that is
the right

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> The noble Lord has completely misunderstood

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 22 extends the current requirement
on local authorities to exercise their powers with a view to
identifying special needs to all children and young people aged from
nought to 25. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Addington for his
support for that. Amendments 76 and 78 from the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, would strengthen the local authority duty to identify SEN.
There are many ways in which a local authority will identify children
and young people, and each authority will know the most effective way
to do so. Paragraph 2.2 of the draft code of practice makes clear that
local authorities must carry out all their functions with a view to
identifying where children and young people aged nought to 25 have SEN.
The duty applies to all of a local authority's functions, not just
those under the Bill. Paragraph 5.2 of the code further sets
out the requirements for the local offer. It must cover the
arrangements for identifying the special educational needs of children
and young people across all the providers covered by the offer. That
will for the first time bring together information on how SEN is
identified across the area and give families and young people a chance
to comment on its
effectiveness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:53:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310242000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0002.htm#1310242000119">On
the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, about speech,
language and communication needs, they are included in the definition
of SEN. The code of practice refers specifically to speech, language
and communication needs as an SEN, and data are collected annually on
that. We recognise that identification may not always be what it
should, and our new guidance in chapter 6 of the code of practice gives
much stronger guidance on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:54:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310242000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-gc0002.htm#1310242000120">Amendment
70A, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, would ensure that pupils
who receive more than one fixed-term exclusion did not fall through the
net. There are already extensive protections in that respect. As a
result of his representations and those of other noble Lords during
debates on the Education Act 2011, statutory guidance to schools on
exclusion reinforces the point that early intervention for poor
behaviour should include an assessment of whether appropriate provision
is in place to support any SEN or disability that a pupil may have. It
also sets out that head teachers should consider the use of a
multi-agency assessment for pupils who demonstrate persistent
disruptive behaviour. Chapter 6 of the draft code reflects that
approach in providing guidance on identifying 
<?notus-xml column=422?>different types of SEN. However, schools need the flexibility to
identify the most appropriate trigger for such
assessments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:54:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

principle underlying this amendment, the steps that we are taking
through the Bill and the revised code of practice already reinforce the

schools that are not certain delaying assessments until a second

77, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Hughes, emphasises that the identification of SEN should happen as
early as possible. Clause 24 reproduces an existing provision that is
designed to ensure that action is taken as soon as special educational
needs are identified, rather than waiting until the start of compulsory
education. For children under school age, health services are often the
main point of contact, so it is important that they take action where
they identify an issue. The draft code of practice sets out a number of
practical steps that will support early identification, including early
health assessments such as the hearing screening test, the progress
check at the age of two, and an assessment at the end of the early
years foundation stage profile at the age of
five<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T19:56:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in this Bill mean that in future anyone will be able to bring a child

themselves. That is a significant improvement to the existing position

80, tabled by my noble friends Lady Brinton and Lady Walmsley, raises

the prison ought to be or what they felt it was, which was not in
agreement with fact. I must say to the Minister that I heard what he
said, but I do not think that it agrees with the briefing that we have
been given by practitioners on the ground. We may want a lot of that to
happen, but it is not actually happening now. Far from wanting to have
a tick-box approach, I would like to make certain that practitioners
come together with officials—because the Bill is far too
important to be let to go by default—to make absolutely certain
that the things that the Minister said are put to the people who are

drivers have been bearing the cost – through higher insurance
premiums – of fraudulent and exaggerated whiplash claims. The
Association of British Insurers indicates that 7% of all motor claims
were fraudulent, and that dishonest personal motor insurance frauds
worth £441 million were detected by the industry in 2011. The
Government wants to tackle that abuse to help drive down the cost of
living and deliver a system that hard working, law abiding people can
have confidence in.</hs_para>

today form part of a series of changes to the justice system introduced
by the Ministry of Justice, such as the reform of ‘no win, no
fee’ arrangements and a ban on referral fees paid between
lawyers, insurers, claims firms, garages and others, which are removing
incentives for excessive litigation and tackling the culture of claims.
New figures from the Ministry of Justice’s Claims Management
Regulation Unit also published today, show that the number of claims
firms in the personal injury market has gone down by more than 1,000
following the law changes, from a peak of 2,553 in December 2011 to
1,485 last

propose to implement our consultation proposal to introduce an
independent medical panel scheme, to establish a new and more robust
system of medical reporting and scrutiny of whiplash claims. These
measures received a good degree of support from those who responded to
the consultation. Our 
<?notus-xml column=101?>reforms will mean that exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims are
deterred and challenged whilst the genuinely injured, backed up by good
quality medical evidence, get the help and compensation they
deserve.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102359000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-wms0001.htm#13102359000022">We
are currently working on the detail of the independent medical panel
scheme. We will have further discussions with all sides, including
insurers and claimant representatives, and within Government, before we
bring forward our final proposals. I am grateful to representatives
from all sides of the industry for their constructive proposals in this
area, which we are considering. I am clear that the final scheme will
need to be not only effective but proportionate and sustainable, with
any costs not falling on the public purse.</hs_para>

with all sides to tackle those practices which can contribute to the
inflated number of whiplash claims. For example, we want insurers to
end the practice of making offers to settle claims without requiring
medical evidence. We also want insurers to share more of their data on
suspected fraudulent or exaggerated claims with claimant lawyers, and
we want claimant lawyers to carry out more effective checks on their
potential clients before taking on claims.</hs_para>

option to increase the Small Claims track threshold for personal injury
claims, the Government has carefully considered all responses. We
believe that there are good arguments for increasing this threshold to
£5,000 for all road traffic accidents to raise incentives to
challenge fraudulent or exaggerated insurance claims. At the same time,
we have listened to the views of the Transport Committee and others
that now may not be the right time to raise the Small Claims limit
because of the risks that it may deter access to justice for the
genuinely injured and encourage the growth of those disreputable claims
firms which so damage the industry. At this stage, we have decided to
defer any increase to the Small Claims threshold until we can determine
the impact of our wider reforms on motor insurance premiums and better
safeguard against the risks identified above. We believe that this is
the right thing to do for all
interests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102359000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023-wms0001.htm#13102359000025">Our

December 2013 will discuss defence, including how military capabilities
of European nations might be improved. France and Germany 
<?notus-xml column=179?>share views on some of the proposals to be discussed in December, but
there is no specific joint project of which the UK is
aware.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102357000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023w0001.htm#13102357000032">The UK
is keen to explore proposals to fill critical gaps in Europe's military
capabilities and improve the capacity of NATO and the EU to act when
necessary. We are, however, firmly opposed to any initiative that would
place military capability under autonomous EU control. At present,
military activity in support of the EU is subject to a unanimous voting
procedure that gives every member state an effective
veto.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102357000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131023w0001.htm#13102357000033">EU
battlegroups of around 1,500 personnel have existed since 2007 and are
designed to provide a rapidly deployable crisis response force. Each
