Answer. The only problem is that this Government do not take
enlargement seriously enough. I looked all through the Prime
Minister’s speech and I could hardly find any mention of
it. He mentions the Second World War and the fact that we brought peace
and stability through enlargement. However, is there not much more than
that? Should we not take a much closer interest in the dialogue between
Serbia and Kosovo, which are to become independent European

assure him that we are steadfastly supportive of EU enlargement. We
think that it is crucial, as he said, to bringing security and
prosperity to the western Balkans and to wider Europe. The Prime

will agree that those countries, particularly the EU countries, which
have so far failed to recognise Kosovo, have done so for good—or
at least for domestic —reasons, be it Catalonia, the Basque
country, or Northern Cyprus. It is most unlikely that there will be any
fundamental change by those countries unless and until Serbia and
Kosovo itself reach an agreement. Therefore, the talks led by the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton, and brokered by the EU, stand the very best
chance of resolving this problem of
recognition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T14:38:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

her work in securing discussions between Serbia and Kosovo. She has
personally led great efforts to secure these further discussions,
supported of course by us and many others. Whatever individual
countries’ reasons are for not recognising Kosovo, the
UK’s position is very clear. We support Kosovo’s progress

Lords opposite in the confusion that they may have, of course we
believe that a reformed EU—a much more flexible and competitive

lie in the European Union, as independent states, and that Serbia must
accommodate itself to this reality before it joins the

preparations in relation to people from Bulgaria and Romania who may
wish to come to the United Kingdom. As the noble Baroness will be
aware, the transition provisions for Bulgaria and Romania come off for
the rest of the European Union at the same time, so the option for
Bulgarians and Romanians to travel elsewhere in the European Union will

not a political point—in relation to Poland’s accession
will not be made this time, because of the way in which we implemented
the transition provisions.</hs_para>

Lord’s statement, and particularly his suggestion that there is
a per person sum involved in this. The new homes bonus is paid against
the background of new homes. It is based on the number of homes that
are provided in any particular area and on the average of the council
tax base across the country. Where there is a number of band A
properties, a certain amount of money will be produced, across the
country, and bands G and H will produce the same. If I could just
correct the noble Lord, in the top 30 recipients of the new homes
bonus, there are seven in the north. Bradford, Durham, Leeds,
Manchester, Salford, Sheffield and Wakefield are working hard and doing

not specifically given for housing; it is given as a contribution to

correct about the basis of the new homes bonus. I have explained to the
House that the bonus is based on the average across the country of

councils provided are in band A, and in the south of England it
is very possible that they are provided in bands E, G and H.
Consequently, of course, the sums will be larger in some areas than in
others, but then, of course, the cost of living is different across

sharing widely the good practice in the better communications research

divergence in provision around the country and the shortage of funds,

Bach:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his Answer, but
is it not rather depressing that these three highly respected and
proven organisations are no longer to receive any public
funding and are being put at some risk, and all for £650,000 per
year? I am sure the Minister will agree that they all have a superb
record over many years of helping often poor and disadvantaged people
to obtain access to justice. Is it just coincidence that these changes
to legal aid are coming at precisely the same time as radical reform of
the welfare system is about to begin or is it, as seems much more
likely to some of us, deliberate government policy to link these two
things together so that if mistakes are made as a result of welfare
reform—as they will be—there will cease to be any
effective legal remedy for many
people?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000055"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13012966000362" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000362">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am always fascinated by the way in
which the noble Lord dismisses £650,000 as a mere bagatelle, but
let us also look at the facts. This scheme for funding such bodies was
introduced in 2000 and the three bodies in this consultation were
awarded three-year contracts at the end of the previous Administration.
Since then, we have twice extended their contracts by one year so that
what was originally a three-year contract became a five-year contract.
However, as I have explained to the House before, I am afraid that we
have to concentrate limited funds on bodies that are giving sharp-end
legal aid advice. These three bodies, particularly the Advice Services
Alliance and the local Law Centres Network, are umbrella bodies that do
not give such advice. Therefore, although in happier days they could
win such contracts and do such work, there is simply no
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000056"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Butler-Sloss" PimsId="5111" UID="13012966000363" xid="1959" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000363">Baroness

appreciate the significance and importance of the Royal Courts of
Justice citizens advice bureau? Having been a judge in that court for
many years, I had personal experience of the advantages of the citizens
advice bureau looking after unrepresented families in my court. Does
the Minister realise that taking away the core funding at this moment,
when the Government are also taking away legal aid for private family
cases, is going to leave the public and the courts in absolute
disarray?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000057"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13012966000364" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000364">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> The CAB at the Royal Courts of Justice is able to
apply for legal aid contracts in the normal way for the part of its
work that is directly legal aid work. As regards broader CAB work, the
Government have carried out a number of initiatives 
<?notus-xml column=1434?>to provide funding while voluntary organisations make the transition to
a much more difficult economic climate. I very much appreciate the
record and work of the Royal Courts of Justice CAB in providing legal
advice to individuals. However, I can only say to the House—as I
have done frequently as we have gone through this exercise—that
we are concentrating our resources on the sharp-end providers and will
continue to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000058"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mackay of Clashfern" PimsId="1610" UID="13012966000365" xid="1761" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000365">Lord

able to apply to the Advice Services Transition Fund and this has
helped it to continue. How many times can I say this? I look at a
budget each day and I see that hard decisions have to be made. Hard
decisions are being made by charities and we have tried to give them
help in the transition. Quite simply, the days when large amounts of
government funds were available for these bodies are over and we all
have to face that
fact.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000060"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" PimsId="996" UID="13012966000367" xid="1545" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000367">Baroness
Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, why do those hard decisions
have to be at the expense of the very poor and those needing help and
advice? As my noble friend Lord Bach said, from next April, and
particularly from next October, a brand new architecture of
benefits—universal credit—will roll out to people who
will, simultaneously, be losing large sums of money. Moreover, their
claims will not be paper-based but will have to be online, even though
something like a fifth of claimants do not even have access to a
computer. As a result, they are going to need extensive help, support
and advice at the very same time as the noble Lord is taking 40% of
funding away from CABs across the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13012966000368" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000368">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> The legal aid welfare spend will still be some
£50 million. We are also in talks with the legal profession and
with charitable organisations to help them with adjustments. The noble
Baroness is right that we are talking about the poorest. Two years ago,
when I announced this exercise, I said that if you cut a programme
designed to help the poorest in our society then you will hurt the
poorest in society. We are doing what we can to concentrate limited
funds on the needy, but it is simply not good enough for the Opposition
continually to be willing to sign every blank cheque and never tell us
how they would save the

questions and I will try to answer them. I may not have noted all of
them. As to the question on the combat role, there is no question of
our troops being sent out there in a combat role. Their terms of
engagement in Bamaco are in self-defence. We are there in support of a
French-led operation and in the expectation that the African countries
round about will be in a position to pick up any of the military
activities that are needed there. There will be a Statement shortly. We
have these two conferences going on today and from both of those a
Statement will come. We are not anticipating extending our position
there but, of course, all these things need to be under discussion.
However, we have made sure that this is a finite contribution for a
short period in order to ensure that the African countries and Mali
have stability. It is in our interests both to support the French in
this operation and to ensure that Mali does not become ungovernable. We
do not want to leave space for terrorism in this.

trauma caused by the global financial crisis and the ensuing recession
required urgent action. This Government responded with a radical
programme of reform, designed both to meet the immediate danger to our

building block upon which all other policies depend is the return to
fiscal stability. In 2010, the UK’s budget deficit was forecast
to be the biggest in the G20 and in our own peacetime history. This
record deficit has been reduced by a quarter over the past two
financial years, restoring market confidence in the UK and keeping
interest rates lower for families and businesses. We have avoided the
predicament of such large economies as Italy and Spain by gripping our
deficit problem and securing financing rates close to those of Germany.

recovery is taking longer than any of us would like, principally
because of continuing problems in the eurozone, the economy is moving
in the right direction. According to the IMF, our growth rates for both
2013 and 2014 are expected to exceed those of France and Germany. More
than 1 million private sector jobs have been created since
2010—more than 1 million—with 2012 seeing the
largest annual increase in jobs since
1989.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000091">We
cannot risk this restored confidence by compromising the disciplined
management of our public finances. I anticipate many suggestions for
where we may productively invest or spend. However, to retain
credibility, as it is not possible to borrow our way out of a debt
crisis, any extra spending has to be financed either by other spending
cuts or by tax increases. As  
<?notus-xml column=1440?>noble Lords will appreciate, we do not live in a world of easy choices.
None the less, to mitigate the impact of the recession on ordinary
families, the Government have prioritised reducing the income tax
burden on 24 million people and cancelling the planned rise in
fuel duty. The remaining three components of the Government’s
programme are geared towards helping the economy to recover and grow

second component of this programme is monetary policy. The Bank of

third component involves reforms to our financial system. Many noble

Banking Reform Bill will deliver structural measures to reform the

will concentrate my remaining remarks on the fourth and
final component. That involves a comprehensive package of structural
reforms aimed at rebalancing and strengthening the economy for the
future, including an ambitious agenda of infrastructure investment.
This is at the heart of my new responsibilities in government. These
supply side reforms will help British business compete in the global
marketplace and will make Britain an even more attractive place to do

to creating an attractive business environment is the tax landscape.
The Government have cut the rate of corporation tax from 28% in 2010 to
21% from April 2014. This is the lowest rate in the
G7—significantly lower than in France, Germany and the
USA—and will act as a spur for job creation on these shores.
Other tax reforms to encourage investment include increasing the annual
investment allowance, which will enable firms to invest in new plants
and machinery, while increased support through research and development
tax credits and legislation for a patent box will give real financial
incentives for innovation and creativity. In addition, £600

more bank lending. We have also set up the Business Finance Partnership

rebalance our economy, it is also crucial to develop our export markets
aggressively and to support those companies with overseas

million per year, a measure that will help us to deliver services to
more SME exporters and will refocus UKTI activities on the highest

to congratulate him on his appointment to the Treasury team. It
is always a special delight to see one’s former pupils do so
well. When I marked his economic essays back in the mid-1970s, I never
imagined—nor do I suppose did he—that we would find
ourselves in this situation. I think it is appropriate to report that
his essays were typically examples of excellent economic analysis, and
I hope and believe that he will put those skills to good use in
re-educating the Treasury. It certainly needs
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000112">Today,
he has been placed in an extraordinarily difficult position. It is
rather difficult to defend the Government’s growth record when

the longer view, since the Government’s spending review in the
fourth quarter of 2010, when it might be said that coalition policies
replaced Labour policies, the UK economy has grown by just 0.4% over
that entire period. Over the same period, the USA has grown by 4.2%,
Germany by 3.6% and France by 1.5%. Accordingly, while the UK economy

first, how did we get into this mess? As the noble Lord said, the
Government inherited the terrible economic consequences of the
international financial crisis—everyone agrees about that. These

question is: in the past two and a half years, have the
coalition’s policies made things better or worse?</hs_para>

rate to that in the US and Germany, so that George Osborne inherited an
economy growing at an annual rate in excess of 2%. He killed that
recovery stone dead. He destroyed business confidence by preaching the
coalition dogma of austerity and by foolish and demeaning comparisons
with the plight of Greece and other eurozone countries without their
own currency and exchange rate; he slashed public investment so that in
the past three years the Government have spent £12.8 billion
less in capital investment than Alistair Darling had planned;
and, with savage glee, the coalition set about shrinking the state and
impoverishing the poor. This is all justified in terms of the Tory
manifesto commitment to eliminate the deficit in one
Parliament—a commitment, by the way, which will not be kept, for
the deficit is not falling.</hs_para>

should be done to turn the position around again and to set the economy
on a new growth path or, to put the question in a more practical
fashion, how can businesses be encouraged to invest? Firms invest
because they are reasonably confident in the future demand for their

discipline, as referred to by the noble Lord, it does not matter how
much cheap money there is, as no one will invest. That is why monetary
policy is not working. Interest rates can go no lower and the first
positive announcement effect of quantitative easing has now worn off.
Quantitative easing may be inflating asset prices and ruining pension

are intent on slowing the growth of

why my right honourable friend Ed Balls has proposed a temporary cut in

capacity that would result from bringing forward infrastructure
investment, including building thousands of affordable homes. Enhanced
demand prospects would then be underpinned by a British investment bank
to boost lending to small businesses, complementing fundamental
regulatory reform of the banks. To sustain confidence there should be a
compulsory jobs guarantee for the long-term unemployed and, further up
the employment chain, investment in skills and in transformational
science and technology. That is plan
B.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000123">Why cannot
this be done? “Because”, cry the coalition,
“it’s a policy for borrowing more when debt is the
problem”, and we heard a similar statement from the 
<?notus-xml column=1445?>noble Lord today. But hang on, at the moment, as we
all know to our cost, spending cuts are resulting in a growing deficit.
How can this be happening? The IMF has provided the answer and it, at
least, has acknowledged its earlier mistaken commitment to
austerity.</hs_para>

relationship between changes in spending and the overall performance of
the economy. This is measured by what, in the economics jargon that the
noble Lord and I used to discuss, is called the multiplier. If a cut in
government spending of, say, £2 billion results, for
whatever reason, in a fall of output of just £1 billion, then
the multiplier is a half. That is what the IMF believed the multiplier
to be back in 2009. The share of taxes in output is about 40%, so if
government spending is cut by £2 billion and output falls by
£1 billion, tax revenues fall by about £400 million. The
fall in tax revenues is much less than the cut in spending, and so the
deficit falls by £1.6 billion. That was the policy that the
Government thought they were
implementing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000125">However,
what if the multiplier happens to be bigger than that? Supposing that
it is as large as 2.5, the cut in spending results in a fall in
tax revenue of exactly the same amount. You can go on cutting taxes
until the cows come home and there will be no change in the deficit at
all. All that will happen is that the economy will be driven further
and further into the mire of depression.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012966000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000126">In acknowledging a
previous error, the IMF estimated the multiplier to be a bit less than
two, so a £2 billion cut in government spending will drive the
economy down by about £4 billion and, when cuts in revenue are
taken into account, the deficit will fall by only £400 million.
Throw in a depressed European Union and you arrive at our current
miserable situation: ever bigger cuts and a growing deficit. But the
good news is that what goes down can also go up. What if government
spending is increased by £2 billion and the multiplier,
optimistically, is 2.5? The economy then grows by £5
billion and the increase in tax revenues pays for the extra spending;
there is no extra borrowing at all. I repeat: increased spending
results in no extra net borrowing. Plan B is a strategy to cut
government spending. And there is more. The government
cuts—particularly those disastrous cuts in government
investment—not only reduce output now by cutting demand; as the
OBR has pointed out, they also cut future output by reducing the real
productive capacity of the economy.</hs_para>

Eatwell:</Member></B> The figure of £2 billion was
purely for illustrative purposes; it was a simple number. I
thought that people could do the arithmetic in their heads. The issue
is directly whether we continue with a policy of cutting government
expenditure or whether we are committed to an increase in expenditure,
particularly 
<?notus-xml column=1446?>on infrastructure. Your Lordships will note that the noble Lord did not
say that his infrastructure plans fell outside the tight vice of
austerity policy. That vice must be unwound. That is what I am talking

was saying, there is more to it than that. As the OBR has pointed out,
government cuts in investment cut future output by reducing the real
productive capacity of the economy. This long-term loss of output
brings with it a long-term reduction in tax revenue, in addition to the
medium-term effect that I have just outlined. In other words, the
Government are not just failing to cut the deficit now; they
are increasing deficits for years to come. By contrast, if the IMF is
right, the measures proposed by my right honourable friend will be
substantially self-financing in the medium term and will stimulate tax
revenues in excess of spending in the longer term. This point has also
been argued by the Harvard professor and former US Treasury Secretary,
Larry Summers.</hs_para>

wrong with that argument. First, no one is suggesting a spending spree.

Skidelsky:</Member></B> My Lords, I join the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell,

George Osborne took over the controls at the Treasury, he decided that
fiscal policy would be governed not by the state of the real economy
but by the state of the public finances, as measured by preset fiscal
targets, particularly the rate of deficit reduction. Those targets were
designed to reassure investors in government debt that the state was
solvent and would remain so. Half-way through the life of this
Parliament, we can say that the effects of that policy in terms of
output and growth have been disastrous. Britain, like the eurozone,
remains stuck in the slow lane. We did not grow at all last year, and
we enter 2013 with a realistic prospect of a triple-dip recession.
Despite our freedom to devalue and massive open-market operations by
the central bank, British output is 3% lower than in 2008.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:53:12"></hs_TimeCode> results of
the fiscal targets are correspondingly dismal. A state with high debt
where no growth has become the new normal will not retain the triple-A
rating on its sovereign

has gone wrong? The central design failure is that the targets were set
on the heroic assumption that the economy would recover despite the
tightening of fiscal policy implied by the targets themselves. In a
balance sheet recession, when the private sector is cutting spending to
reduce its overindebtedness, that assumption was just wrong. Put
simply, we cannot all deleverage at once. To save more, you spend less,
and if everyone does that, including the Government, the economy
shrinks. That is lesson number one to which the noble Lord might
respond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:54:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000139">George
Osborne blames the failure of Britain to grow on the eurozone, but that
argument is circular, as it is following exactly the same policy as we
are. It is the Chancellor’s own policy which explains the
stagnation of the British economy, not the
eurozone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000140" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000140">Mad
economists are emerging from the woodwork to say that George Osborne is
not cutting deep or fast enough. For example, Andrew Lilico appeared on
the “Today” programme this morning telling us that the
reason that the deficit is not going down is that austerity has not
started. Apparently we are in the middle of a Keynesian boom. We need
more cutting. Cut benefits, cut the welfare state, cut government, cut
everything 
<?notus-xml column=1448?>that can possibly be cut—and behold, the private sector phoenix
will rise from the
ashes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:55:06"></hs_TimeCode>. These
Einsteins of finance never explain how bigger cuts are supposed to

Chancellor can claim that the unemployment figures are slightly lower
than they were some months ago. How can this be when output has not
grown and may even have fallen? There is a puzzle here, but it is not a
large one. The reason is that today, with a more flexible labour
market, a fall in output is not necessarily, or immediately, reflected
in a fall in employment. It may simply lead to a movement of workers
into lower-paid, part-time or intermittent jobs or work training
schemes, none of which count towards recorded unemployment. This has
certainly been happening. It also explains why the Government can claim
success in increasing private sector employment faster than the public
sector is shedding

have no doubt that if the Chancellor continues cutting as hard and fast
as Mr Lilico wants, those of us left with decent jobs or incomes will
be able to have as many drivers, gardeners, trainers, cleaners,
nannies, domestic servants, chefs, butlers and waiters as we can
possibly want, and, no doubt, at the equivalent of Victorian wage
levels. In other words, back to the world of “Downton
Abbey”. After two centuries of industrialisation, what a
wonderful solution to the unemployment
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000143">The
obvious alternative to blind faith in fiscal targets is action to
restore the economic trajectory that underpinned the targets in the
first place. The international organisations are now saying this; the
noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, has quoted Olivier Blanchard, who has just
said that the Chancellor should “ease up” on fiscal
austerity, which is as near as an international civil servant can come
to saying that his policy is dead wrong. Even Boris Johnson says we
should junk the word
“austerity”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000144">In
plain English, “easing up” on austerity means stimulating
investment. Public capital spending is not included in the current
deficit target, so the Government can restart the investment machine
without breaching their own targets on current spending. That is the
only way to get the deficit down, or to meet their
targets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000145">In
this context, I welcome the Government’s announcement that they
have approved the second phase of High Speed 2. However, I have two
questions. Why will it take so long? The first phase is scheduled to be
completed in 13 years’ time, and the second phase in 2033. Two
years ago I asked the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, who had just stepped
down as Secretary of State for Transport, how long it would take to
complete this project with any sense of urgency. He said that it would
take about five years. He is in his place, and I hope that he does not
tell me that I have remembered that wrong. As I have said before, if
only we had a Lloyd George in charge of this programme, we would get
some

opportunity for the Government to take advantage of the spectacularly
low cost of their own borrowing—why it is so low is the subject
of another discussion—to finance the whole thing itself. It is a
genuine capital investment, which will yield an identifiable rate of
return. Perhaps the noble Lord would give us some indication of how the
Government will finance this project. I hope that they will
not repeat the disastrous PPP schemes which made such a
mess of the London Underground and Channel Tunnel
projects.</hs_parafo>

an investment strategy such as I have proposed not cause the public
debt to increase? This is the crunch question. The Minister said in
opening that it would not be possible to borrow our way out of our debt
crisis. If indeed the project starts reasonably expeditiously, the debt
will go up. There is no doubt that it will be higher in 2015 or 2017
than it would have been otherwise, but so will the capital stock and
the economy itself, while the increased output can be taxed to finance
the interest cost of the extra debt.</hs_para>

obvious risks. The risk of a pro-growth strategy is that borrowing more
than initially planned may spook the bond markets and lead to a rise in
borrowing costs. However, it is a much smaller risk than putting
one’s faith in pre-set fiscal targets which produce a stalling
economy, without any guarantee that this will actually deliver on the
fiscal numbers. Which strategy does the Chancellor really think is more
likely to keep our AAA rating with the credit markets?</hs_para>

strategy makes sense for Britain, it should make sense for Europe as
well. This country was a pacesetter in adopting fiscal targets as a
guide to policy after the financial crisis. Why not be the first mover

self-defeating

natural state of an economy. Most economies tend to grow over time.
Financial crises, bad harvests and various other factors can, of
course, delay or obstruct that growth. But growth is the natural order
over time, because human beings have a natural instinct to make two
blades of grass grow where one grew before and a natural instinct to
innovate. Growth, it is worth remembering, does not come from
Governments; it comes from individuals.</hs_para>

reaction be to the figures which were released last week and showed a
0.3% drop in GDP in the final quarter? The figures can always be sliced
in many different ways. One can portray them, as indeed the noble Lord,
Lord Eatwell, did, as saying that four out of the last five quarters
have been negative; that the economy was flat all last year; and that
the economy is still below the 2008 peak. On the other hand, you can
formulate them a slightly different way: the economy grew by 0.3% in
the last six months; although the economy is below the peak of 2008, if

<?notus-xml column=1450?>you exclude North Sea oil production it is only a whisker below that
peak, and North Sea oil has been in dramatic decline with interruptions
to production. The fact that there has been no growth last year is the
same as in France, while the 0.3% drop in GDP in the last quarter
compares with a drop of 0.5% in Germany; and, collectively, the whole
of the eurozone is currently in recession. What I draw from all that is
that when the dust settles and this is all in the history books, I
suspect we will find that almost all the countries in this part of the
world had a broadly similar experience, whichever way one tends to look
at the figures at any particular moment.</hs_para>

the views of the IMF, but we have not actually had the views of the
IMF; we have had the views of Mr Blanchard. Christine Lagarde, the
director-general of the IMF, has been extremely supportive of the
Government’s strategy and we will only officially hear the views
of the IMF in May, when we hear the results of the article 4
consultation. The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, talked a lot about the
multiplier effects. Interestingly, there was a report in the press at
the weekend that the IMF has concluded that the multiplier effects,
both of austerity or of any deficit spending, are extremely slight in
the case of the UK. No doubt we will hear more about that
when the article 4 consultation takes place.</hs_para>

the figures for the last quarter were extremely disappointing, but the
idea that some extreme excess of austerity is holding back the British
economy seems to me very much open to question. The Government have
shown that they are prepared to be flexible in their deficit reduction
programme. They have relaxed the programme twice and put back the date
at which they expect, and are aiming for, a fall in the total
debt-to-GDP ratio. As my noble friend Lord Forsyth said, the difference
between the Government and the Opposition is much exaggerated by both
sides for the purposes of both sides. I do not think that the noble
Lord, Lord Eatwell, is right in saying that the capital expenditure
planned under the last Government was higher than that of this
Government; in fact, the cuts that Alistair Darling put forward were
bigger than those of this Government, some of which have been reversed.
Can the Minister comment on that precise
point?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000156">Despite
the small differences between the planned reductions in expenditure, it
is true that if you compare the outcome of expenditure with the
original Darling plan for reductions in expenditure, the latter was
much tighter and more austere than what the Government have
implemented. If you compare our austerity programme to that in other EU
countries, it is difficult to argue that these cuts are savage or that
this fiscal consolidation is sudden and dramatic. At the beginning of
this crisis we had a deficit to GDP of around 12%. That was almost
exactly the same as Greece’s. I am sorry to say that today
Greece has a considerably lower deficit than the UK’s. Italy,
France, Ireland, Portugal, and Greece all have lower deficits than we
do. These have not been caused by growth—a solution somehow
magicked out of the air by the party opposite. That is not how they
have reduced their deficits. They have done so by making more savage
cuts and far severer fiscal consolidations than we have made.</hs_para>

of around 70% to 80%, which is where it is expected to peak out, if we
go on adding to that overall stock of debt at the rate of 12%, as it
was when we started off, or 7% or 8%, because the annual deficit is the
amount that we add to it each year, we would soon get to a situation in
which a debt-to-GDP ratio would be 100%. As economists such as Reinhart
and Rogoff have argued, that is the level at which the overall stock of
debt becomes dangerous for the long-term growth of an economy. They
would argue that that is why Japan has had such a bad time for such a
long period. If deficits really solved long-term economic growth, Japan
would not have been stranded in the situation in which it has been for
such a long
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000158">If
deficits of 7% to 8% per annum have left the country not growing, is it
credible that one of 10% or 12% will suddenly cause the economy to leap
into life? We hear about the multiplier effects, but never about what
is going to happen when these so-called stimuli are withdrawn. Anyone
who thinks that this would be the real world experience of deficits
ought to read the diaries of Mr Morgenthau, President
Roosevelt’s treasury secretary, who expressed his
disillusionment with the deficits being run in America in the 1930s. He
wrote that all the United States had to show for it was unemployment at
much the same level and no increase in production. In the UK today we
are running deficits that are considerably higher than those run by the
Roosevelt
administration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000159"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Skidelsky" PimsId="720" UID="13012966000395" xid="1439" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000395">Lord

Lamont of Lerwick:</Member></B> No. President Roosevelt initiated back
to work programmes—that is true—but the private sector,
the economy, was not generating growth. If the noble Lord, who is a
very eminent historian, wishes to doubt that, just let him read the
Morganthau diaries, because they are full of deep disillusionment about
the pointlessness of the programme that he himself was implementing and
the effect that it was having on the growth of the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000161">I am
not arguing that deficit financing can never be of use or play a part
in taking up the slack in the economy when the private sector is unable
to borrow, but we are in a position where both public and private
finances are under pressure at the same time. It is a much favoured
parlour game to decide what Keynes would have thought of doing in this
scenario today. Of course, the House is very fortunate in having the
eminent historian, the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, who knows more about
this subject than anyone else, to tell us. Indeed, we also have the
noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, a most distinguished Cambridge
economist—a university that is profoundly affected today by the
shadow of Maynard Keynes. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell,
remembers Milton Friedman’s comment about Cambridge academics
and their theories, which have applications within 25 miles of
Cambridge University.</hs_para>

different from a normal cyclical recession. It is, as the noble Lord,
Lord Skidelsky, said, a balance sheet recession, but it is a recession
that has followed a severe banking crisis. As economists such as Rogoff

to last much longer than normal, cyclical recessions, and are much
deeper.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012966000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000163">So
what can be done to stimulate growth? I believe that there are
things on the supply side that can do this—training;
lifting and relaxing planning controls, as the Government have done;
infrastructure spending, very much as the Minister outlined, although
if infrastructure spending is to be financed by cuts in current
spending, that will squeeze consumption further, which has been one of
the problems of the economy, because inflation has not come down, and
it has been inflation that has been squeezing consumption and living
standards.</hs_para>

problem of the economy, I believe, is not fiscal policy but the lack of
credit in the economy and the failure of the banking system still to
make credit available. The risk is that the new businesses that drive
innovation and produce the new products will be strangled because of
the lack of credit. The Government have introduced the Funding for
Lending scheme. It is too easy to say what the effects of that are, but
if it has a good effect, maybe it ought to be expanded further.
However, they have been piling regulation upon regulation and demands
for more capital from the banks, and that, in the last analysis, is
incompatible with more lending and makes more lending more difficult
and more expensive for the
banks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000165">The
Government have said that they want to see new entrants into the
banking sector, which I think would be highly desirable, but I am not
sure that that message has got through to all parts, particularly the
lower parts, of the Financial Services Authority. I noticed that the
chairman of Metro Bank said the other day that if he had known what was
involved in starting a new bank in the UK, he is not sure that he would
do it again or would have done it in the first place.</hs_para>

Governor Carney, and there are great expectations of him, but he will
not exactly be a man on a white horse, and I think it would be unfair
to regard him as that. He has talked a lot already about central banks
doing more to promote growth. I hope, however, that the Bank and the
Government will be cautious about more quantitative easing. There is in
this situation, even now when we do not have growth in the economy, a
danger of creating more asset bubbles. We have seen the consequences of
the “Greenspan put” in the past, where central bank
action has been taken to keep the financial markets buoyant and the
result has not been that we have avoided a crisis but that the crises
have got successively worse. When I look at the level of the stock
market, which of course can be interpreted favourably in one sense, I
wonder whether it is reflecting the prospects for the economy or the
consequences of quantitative
easing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000167">The
Opposition have inevitably been very critical and the Government
inevitably are in a difficult situation. I think it was Boileau, the
French writer, who once

thing is that those who are telling the people they are not well

create the situation we are in. It is not an easy situation and, most

Hollick:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, would like to congratulate the
Minister on his leading role in a brilliantly successful Olympic and
Paralympic Games last summer. He is the living embodiment of the vital
role the Government can play to promote growth in the short term and,
thanks to the legacy infrastructure, in the long term too. His
appointment provides welcome substance to the Government’s claim
to wish to boost infrastructure investment but will the Government
provide the means to do it? He and his partners at the ODA received
£9.3 billion from the previous Government, a level of support
that was maintained by the coalition. We must hope that he will be
successful in persuading his new boss that the entire economy is badly
in need of this kind of commitment to invest in
infrastructure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000169">As
we have heard from other noble Lords, the UK economy is profoundly
stuck. Real GDP is more than 3% below the 2008 figure and a significant
15% below where it would have been if long-term growth trends had been
maintained. This sustained underperformance can be expected to impact
adversely on the underlying production capacity of the economy and our
skill base. The corrosive effect on the social fabric is high and
under-investment in education, housing and public services is all too
evident. Unemployment is up from 5.2% to 7.8% despite the recent
downward trend and more than 900,000 young people are unemployed with a
similar number of the total workforce out of work for more than 12
months. Yet the Chancellor’s response to this grim state of
affairs was to say in his Autumn Statement that,</hs_para>
<hs_quotefo UID="13012966000282" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000282">“turning back
now would be a disaster”.</hs_quotefo>
<hs_para UID="13012966000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000170">Turning back from his
failed and indeed nonsensical policy of “expansionary fiscal
contraction” would have been a wise choice. Expansionary fiscal
contraction works as an oxymoron but not as an economic policy. The
belief that cutting the fiscal deficit would boost business and
consumer confidence and lead to economic growth and that private sector
investment would fill the gap left by the coalition’s austerity
plan was and remains profoundly flawed. In 2010, the OBR predicted that
business investment would grow in real terms by 8.1% in 2011 followed
by average annual growth of 9.5% in the following four years. In
reality, it grew by 2.9% in 2011, 3.8% in 2012 and is forecast to grow
4.9% in 2013. Many of our larger companies hold high levels of cash on
their balance sheets but uncertainty about the outlook for
demand—a word that was curiously missing from the
Minister’s remarks—is proving to be a deterrent to
investment. This flawed approach was in part sustained by a naive
belief in the sanctity of the UK’s credit rating as measured by
discredited rating agencies. Markets are sophisticated enough to
realise that without growth the deficit will continue to balloon
leading to further austerity and further weakness in 
<?notus-xml column=1454?>the economy—a spiral of doom. As Larry Summers has pointed out,
we are facing not just a fiscal deficit, but also growth, jobs,
investment and skills
deficits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000171">If
the Chancellor is to address these deficits, he must first address the
UK’s dramatic lack of aggregate demand. This is not just the
view of his opposite number, my honourable friend Ed Balls, whose
analysis has, most gallingly for the Chancellor, proved to be all too
correct, but is also the view of the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO and
many other major economic institutions which have all warned that
austerity was hurting growth and have urged economies—not just
the UK—to embrace
stimulus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000172">The
Chancellor is, of course, a realist. He knows that he must alter course
and boost growth. Over the past year, he has introduced a number of
supply-side measures, many good, some less so, but taken together they
are unlikely to have much impact in the near term. The Funding for
Lending scheme is to be applauded. The 89 steps of the noble Lord, Lord
Heseltine, to leave no stone unturned in pursuit of growth are most
welcome and were warmly embraced by the Government. However, his
principal recommendation to gather together all business funding in
Whitehall and pass it to the regions appears, unsurprisingly, to have
encountered some resistance at the centre. All these supply-side
measures provide evidence of a quickening pace but no real
determination to boost demand, which is essential if these measures are
to achieve their
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000173">However,
I detect a change in the economic weather. Surely the most significant
step towards a more balanced policy is the appointment of Mark
Carney—not on a white horse—as the next Governor of the
Bank of England. The Chancellor was initially rebuffed in his quest to
hire Mr Carney but, to his credit, he persevered, upped his offer and
landed his man—a man with a record of openness to monetary
policy innovation, who has advocated that central banks target both
inflation and nominal growth and believes that monetary policy measures
to help the economy grow are not exhausted. Last week in Davos he
advocated an activist monetary policy with the immediate
aim—indeed, priority—of ensuring that the economy reaches
“escape velocity”. I take this to mean that growth in the
economy reaches a sustainable level where increased tax receipts can
take over from austerity as the principal driver of debt
reduction—a virtuous cycle of growth replacing a vicious cycle
of cuts and persistent
recession.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000174">Therefore,
Mr Carney is part of the plan B that dare not speak its name. He may
deploy a range of initiatives such as forward guidance targeting growth
and expanding the supply of Bank reserves to purchase a range of
long-term assets with the aim of increasing spending. However, monetary
policy can, as Mr Carney himself has emphasised, only take us so far.
Bold fiscal measures are needed to help the economy move forward. Mark
Carney has shown that he is adept at taking full advantage in a
sellers’ market. I expect that in his discussions with the
Chancellor he has emphasised the limits of monetary policy, however
innovative, and secured an acknowledgement from the Chancellor that a
series of fiscal measures need to be introduced to create the demand
the economy so badly needs. It is vital that the Chancellor and his new
governor work 
<?notus-xml column=1455?>closely together to develop a co-ordinated monetary and fiscal approach
to reach “escape velocity”. For his part, the Chancellor
must adopt the most effective fiscal initiatives to increase demand and
promote investment, particularly in
infrastructure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000175">Temporary
fiscal measures which boost growth will make it more likely that the
medium-term targets can be met and will, I believe, so long as the
medium-term framework remains intact, be welcomed by financial markets
which have become increasingly concerned about the depressive
consequences of untrammelled austerity, as we have heard from other
noble Lords. I would like to see the Chancellor introduce a UK
version of the successful temporary payroll tax cut in the US and
reduce employees’ NIC by 2p in each of the next two years. The
cost, after taking account of the tax generated by the additional
economic activity, will be around £5 billion a
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000176" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000176">This
weekend, the Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged that the coalition made
a mistake in cutting much of its capital spending. Now is the time to
reinstate the capital spending on the school build programme and on
social housing. If we are to tackle the growing investment deficit in
infrastructure and in energy, estimated to be £350 billion and
£175 billion over the next 30 years respectively by McKinsey
Global Institute, the Government must take action. Offering loan
guarantees is a welcome step but only if it is accompanied by measures,
such as the introduction of road pricing on motorways, which can
provide private investors with an adequate rate of
return.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000177" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000177">Funding
infrastructure remains a challenge, despite the Government’s
exhortations to the pension funds to invest. The Government could
consider the introduction of tax-free infrastructure bonds for
individuals, taking advantage of historically low long-term interest
rates and providing hard-pressed savers, who have been badly penalised
by low interest rates, with improved returns. Many infrastructure
projects are, inevitably, medium-term or long-term in nature and so is
their effect on demand. Boosting short-term demand could be achieved by
a reduction in VAT on building works at domestic residences from 20%
to, say, 5% over the next two years. This would encourage households to
invest to improve their properties and utilise the currently
under-employed pool of construction

debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:26:05"></hs_TimeCode>. For the

Minister has found himself, as a businessman, in the middle of an
intensely political debate with a very simple business solution. To
characterise the debate so far, we have, on the right, the belief that
any expenditure—capital or otherwise—merely adds to
national debt and, as such, undermines the financial health of the
Government. It increases debt because you cannot borrow your way out of
a recession, particularly a debt-led one. On the other hand, you have
the equally misguided belief that all the Government need to do is pull
the demand lever, loosen the reins and become the spender of last
resort, boosting the economy and lifting it by its boot straps. We are
told such spending would be good no matter what it is on. The
Government will be the investors of last
resort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000181">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:26:31"></hs_TimeCode>
I was a diplomat, I would say that both sides are right. As I am a
businessman, I must say that both sides are wrong for one very simple
reason. What matters, and will make both arguments right, is not how
much is spent but what the money is spent on —that is, the
quality of the investment. It is extraordinary to me, when I hear the
Government talking about investment plans or the Opposition talking
about how much money they would inject into the economy, that they talk
about the amount spent, not the return on that money. Ultimately, it is
the return on the money that matters. If the Government can invest in
infrastructure that provides them with a cash return in excess
of the interest on the money borrowed to build that
infrastructure, not only will that not increase the deficit, it will
actually reduce it because it is a good
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:28:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:28:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000182" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000182">There
is, however, a word of warning for those who take courage from these
words and think that capital investment is all we need. It depends on
the type of capital investment. If taxpayers’ money is to be
invested, it must be invested profitably. I hear the very good point
about HS2 made by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky. There is a very
simple reason why the investment is not being accelerated and that is
because, although the cost-benefit analysis currently shows a
profitable project, the returns to government are, over 60 years, about
one-third of the total capital cost. As far as the Government are
concerned, it is a loss-maker. For as long as the Government invest in
loss-making assets, their finances will be undermined, wealth will be
destroyed and the economy will be pulled

are we to reconcile the very simple principle of profitable
investment? I use the word “profitable” in a very special
sense—a sense in which it is not often meant,
particularly in another House in this great Palace. I do not mean
“profitable” in the sense that it is likely to win votes;
nor do I mean it in the sense that it will be socially beneficial, but
in the sense that it will produce a cash return. Where are such
investments to be found? History would say that Governments have not
been particularly good at investing in truly profitable
assets.</hs_para>

answer lies in a little story that I should like to share with noble
Lords. I recall from my time as a young retail apprentice at the age of
10, being taken out with my dad around the local village. Every
Saturday morning at 9 o’clock there was a queue of
between 10 and 15 people outside the baker’s shop. One
day, rather foolishly, I said to my dad, “He must be a very
clever baker to have that queue outside”. The answer 
<?notus-xml column=1457?>came back: “No. That is a wasted opportunity. That is money that
is not being made. That baker should be opening his doors half an hour
earlier and he would make more money”. There is a clear lesson
there. Where there is a queue, there is demand; and where there is
demand, there is potential for profit.</hs_para>

we want to find a queue in this country, we need to look no further
than virtually every part of the road network at 8.30 am and 4.30 pm.
Here we have a government monopoly—a business that only
government can effectively invest in. It would produce, by my
calculations, 10 pence of government revenue for every passenger mile
travelled. Projects and roads could easily be built that would pay for
themselves and therefore fulfil our criteria of truly profitable
investments. They would not meet that terrible test of all government
ventures: they are not politically popular. None the less, if you need
any convincing of the economic potential tied up in our road network,
do a little mental experiment—it is always fun. Imagine a London
in which the M25, the M1 and the Westway were permanently closed.
Imagine the havoc that that would wreak on our economy and very quickly
you can see how much damage it would do. Now reverse that concept and
ask yourself: why not build more great motorways? A flyover from
Croydon to central London could get commuters into London in 12
minutes—that journey takes about an hour and a half today at the
wrong time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:32:12"></hs_TimeCode>, if
you are lucky. Such projects could easily be built and financed. It

measures by which the Government could invest profitably in the
economy, there are other free ways that they could do so. Legislation
is relatively free and it can do much to liberate demand. I take issue
with the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, when he said that there is no
demand. As a retailer, I can tell him that there is an enormous amount
of pent-up demand in the UK. In my company, we have identified
1 million square feet of trading premises that we would like
to open, but this year we will open barely 250,000 square feet. That is
not because we do not have the money. We are generating £250
million more cash than we can profitably invest in our business, after
paying taxes and dividends. That £250 million cannot be invested
because at least 700,000 square feet is tied up in a chronically slow
planning system that has no sense of the time value of money. For
example, it took us nine months to get planning permission for a stock
room for a shop that we wanted to open in Surrey Heath. The opening of
the whole shop was held up for that time. There was no sense of
remorse. The attitude was, “If we make the decision tomorrow,
next month or in nine months’ time, it really makes no
difference. We will make the decision when we get to it. Wait your
turn”.</hs_para>

is amazingly debilitating but, above and beyond that, there is a more
profound problem with our planning system. The essence of it is that
the shape that our economy should take is determined from the top down,
whereby decisions are based on what activities take place in which
locations, through a system of zoning and restrictions on use that is,
frankly, Soviet in its approach to economic development. I am used 
<?notus-xml column=1458?>to it now, but it still surprised me two months ago
when I went to see the chief planning officer of a big town. We were
proposing to open a store that would have taken £15 million. The
planning officer said, “No, I don’t want you to open it
there; I want you to open it here, on the wrong side of town, next to
the single-lane road that is always blocked”. That store would
have taken around £4 million, rather than £15
million. That was bad news in itself, but the really bad news came when
he told us that we would have to wait four years for that site to
become

thousands of entrepreneurs with the uncomprehending dead hand of a

Stalin, the world has lost faith in planned economies. We prefer free

held back by our planning system runs not into the hundreds of millions
but into the tens of billions. The message is very clear: liberate
pent-up demand rather than try to push, encourage and incentivise
demand that will not happen of its own accord. If we really want to be
brave in our economy, we should not just free up use of brownfield
sites; we should take a small fraction of the 92% of this country that
is greenfield. We should take the ugliest sites closest to London and
turn them into beautiful new garden cities, because then those tens of

way we look at it, the scorecard on this thousandth day is lamentable.
Last week, as has been mentioned by several speakers, we received the
GDP figures for the final quarter of 2012. As we all know, growth was
minus 0.3%. We are heading for a triple- dip recession—unheard
of in modern times. It is no wonder that the 
<?notus-xml column=1459?>Prime Minister was anxious to distract attention with his speech on
Europe. I know that the Government get tetchy when my right honourable
friend the shadow Chancellor talks about flat-lining, but with only
0.4% growth over the past couple of years, what else can we say? Noble
Lords should compare this with Germany, which has experienced growth of
3.6% over the same period, or better still, the United States, where
the figure is
4.1<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:38:33"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000192" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000192">America
is a very pertinent comparison. In many ways, the American economy and
ours are parallel. Yet, while we wallow, the Americans are experiencing
improving growth. There is no need to take my word for it. Noble Lords
should look at the Dow Jones index, which is racing ahead. Indeed, the
Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, in a notable column in the <I>New York
Times</I> last week, totally debunked the deficit hawks in his own
country. The United States did not pursue a policy of austerity, but
instead chose stimulus through massive public investment while interest
rates were kept at rock bottom. The result is that deficit and public
spending as a share of GDP have started to decline of their own
accord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:39:18"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:39:18"></hs_TimeCode>
Contrast this with George Osborne, who slashed public investment and
raised taxes on families. In doing so, he has killed business
confidence and growth and we know the result. The deficit has increased
as a share of GDP and is up more than 7% on the equivalent period last
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000193">The
facts in America, as they are in our own country, are that, when the
financial crisis hit, the economy went into a tailspin, tax receipts
fell and unemployment benefits rose. However, unlike us, the Americans
held their nerve, re-invested and, as the economy recovers, the deficit
as a share of GDP is falling. It is really easy economics to
understand, so why does our Chancellor take a totally different
position? If our economy were recovering, perhaps it would all have
been worth the pain, but it is not. Everything is heading south.
Indeed, in America, recent forecasts suggest that the federal deficit
will be below 3% of GDP by 2015, a number that I am sure we, too, could
live with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000194">So,
where are we on the 999th day of this totally misguided policy? Our
economy is static; our people are suffering; our businesses lack
confidence; the banks are not lending; companies are sitting on piles
of cash instead of investing; and our trade gap is widening. It
is a total disaster, much of which could have been avoided were it not
for the obsessions of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000195">My

Combining small businesses with medium-sized businesses shows how out

else uses this definition, I guess I will have to live with it.
Interestingly, SMEs have held their own during this economic crisis.
Employment figures have been pretty constant over the past five years
and so too have export achievements. It has been large companies and
the public sector that have shed their workforces. It should

help SMEs. At one point, it seemed like a monthly occurrence that one

Although the Government may feel that they are doing well, the fact is

making a grave mistake in looking to the high street banks to deliver
their programmes. The truth is that the banks have forgotten how to

of consigning troubled companies to the intensive care unit, now means
that saying yes is hard to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000198">Last
month, I had the opportunity to visit the German Sparkassen banks. I
know noble Lords are probably familiar with the German system, but what
a contrast? More than 40% of corporate debt in Germany is channelled
through these local savings banks. What impressed me was the long-term
commitment that these banks have to their business customers, often
going back decades. They stand on the touchline cheering their
customers on. What a contrast to banks in our country. How many small
companies have even met their bank manager? How many loans are
accepted or rejected solely based on an online application, with never
a human being in sight? In Germany, when a company gets into trouble,
it seldom comes as a surprise and, if a banker is close to his
customer, he can make an assessment based on something more than a
computer print-out.

new business hub at Tech City. I am always sceptical about this. I have
seen too many politicians who somehow think that they have become
tech-savvy just because they can use the on/off button on their

overenthusiastic in his belief in the Government’s ability to

billions were lost in the health service and elsewhere through IT

spending other people’s

have been surprised that, so far in the debate, people have
concentrated on the deficit rather than the debt. The noble
Lord’s predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon—whom we
miss so much—was subject to regular questioning from me, asking
why we continue to refer to reducing the deficit and not the debt,
when, of course, the deficit is simply the rate at which the debt is
increasing. I never got a satisfactory answer to that. Therefore I ask
the noble Lord, in briefing himself into his department, to look at the
ComRes ITV poll that was carried out just before Christmas—which
may have got lost in the tinsel and bright lights of the Christmas
period—where people were asked whether they thought that over
the course of this Parliament the Government were going to increase the
debt by £600 billion, reduce it by £600 billion, or leave
it much as it is. Only 6% got the right answer, which is that the debt
will increase by £600 billion. I regard that as a really serious
problem, because if you are asking people in the country to make
sacrifices and to realise that Governments face difficult choices,
first you have to make them aware of the extent of the problem. I
really do not think it helps for politicians—from whichever
party—to shy away from explaining just how serious a problem we
have.</hs_para>

problem, in short, is that the state is growing and the economy is
shrinking. The latest OECD figures show that state spending has now
gone up to 49% of our GDP. That is an extraordinary amount. I used to
define communist or socialist states as states where the 
<?notus-xml column=1462?>Government spent 50% of the GDP. In the year 2000, when Gordon Brown was
Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Government spent 37% of GDP. I am
sorry that the noble Lord who said that it is ridiculous to talk about
a massive Keynesian boom is not in his place, because I must point out
that there has been an astronomical increase in the share of our GDP
that is being spent by the Government. Out there in the country, real
wages and living standards are falling. The first thing that we have to
explain is that we have been living beyond our means. We have been
spending about 10% more than we earn and we have been saving nothing.
We need to save about 10%. Now 10 plus 10 is 20%, so to put that right,
living standards are going to fall by 20% unless we can get growth. It

Birt:</Member></B> It is a pleasure to follow the keenly felt and
eloquent speech of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. It was not the first
in this excellent debate. As the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has reminded
me, I am not qualified to add to the powerfully expressed views of some
of our leading economists during the course of the debate, with others
still to come. However, I shall offer some perspectives from the front
line of the real
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000227" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000227">I am
involved as a director in a number of leading businesses in Europe and
the UK, as well as a promising internet start-up. I am also an adviser
to one of Europe’s leading private equity houses; as
a result, I am exposed to a great number of portfolio businesses,
chiefly operating in the UK and Europe. Anyone who works in the ever
more complex and competitive global economy, or anyone who has ever
happened across the rusting industrial archaeology of the old Eastern
bloc—I am sure this is common ground on all sides of the
House—will testify that government cannot substitute for
entrepreneurs or for genuine corporate expertise. The noble Lord, Lord
Lawson, reminded us of that at the beginning of the debate.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1466?><hs_para UID="13012966000228" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000228">What can Governments do
to promote growth? First and foremost, as others have said, they can
maintain a stable economy in which business can plan with
confidence—something we have resoundingly failed to do in this
last period of our history, as we all recognise, whatever the mix of
reasons for that. Surely it is plain that the route back from the dire
circumstances we find ourselves in, whether it is route A or route B,
is a long one.</hs_para>

Governments, we need tough regulation of our financial
institutions—and we are probably about to have it. They have let
us down. We need that regulation to ensure that they manage risk
responsibly, which they patently failed to do; that they lend sensibly;
and that they do not hoard huge rafts of assets—which they are
still doing—that they have neither the skill nor the means to
develop and grow. That is undoubtedly one of many causes of the absence
of growth in the real
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000230" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000230">Thirdly,
Governments need to ensure that the climate for investors is friendly
and internationally competitive. In my experience, the incentive regime
for business start-ups in the UK works well. But there is a particular
failing in the capital markets that I do not understand, and which
needs investigating. Investment in start-ups by business angels or
small venture capital companies is thriving. As a result, early stage
companies in the UK are prospering in large numbers at the moment,
particularly in the new technology sector. However, UK capital to grow
these successful young companies into major regional or global players
appears mysteriously absent. There are many strange failures in our
capital markets that we need to work harder to understand. With a lot
of these younger companies, highly professional and acute US players
fill the void and snap up our best companies before they can grow in a
UK or European
environment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000231" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000231">There
is a further difficulty in attracting substantial global investment
into the UK, which I do not think anybody has mentioned so far. Major
investors are nervous still about the instability in the eurozone. I am
exposed to many of these investors—the giant US pension funds,
or sovereign funds in the Gulf—and they have trillions to put to
work; there is no absence of funds in the wider world. Rightly or
wrongly, they wrap up the UK into their concern. So it is in our
interest as a country, though perhaps we cannot do very much about it,
to help to accelerate the painfully slow process of resolving the
eurozone
crisis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000232" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000232">Fourthly,
Governments can help to ensure that UK business has access to the right
skills, as several noble Lords have mentioned. As we all know, we have
some educational institutions of global renown, but we do not begin to
produce all the skills that we need for the UK economy. In business
meetings in the UK now, I regularly find that I am the only
British citizen in the
room.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000233" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000233">We need
to motor our economy to attract rare skills from abroad, but our
immigration rules may begin to handicap us. President Hollande’s
early actions, and the response of France’s business elite to
them, remind us that talented individuals with rare skills in great
demand globally are highly mindful of the overall tax regime when they
decide where to settle.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, noted, Britain is currently the most
advanced e-commerce environment in the world. However, we saw the lack
of critical skills in areas of rapid development such as mobile and
data mining. Without resorting to an entirely directive approach to
designing resources within our education system, the
departments for business and education need to be more alert
and fleet-footed in spotting critical skill shortages and speedily
encouraging and incentivising the relevant educational institutions in
the UK to meet
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000235" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000235">I have
left until last our area of greatest comparative weakness, which many
noble Lords have already mentioned: the UK’s persistent failure
to invest in infrastructure. As others have mentioned, I note that the
Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged last week that it was a mistake to
cut into the Government’s capital investment programme when the
deficit reduction programme was first agreed. Mr Clegg may not be aware
that we as a country have been here many times before. He should ask
his officials to dig out the analysis conducted by the
Cabinet Office Strategy Unit during my time at No. 10 on why we had by
far the worst transport infrastructure in the developed world. I
wholeheartedly support all that the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson, said
about that, particularly the wonderful passion that he expressed about
our impoverished road system. A large part of the reason for
that chronic underinvestment over many
decades—indeed, for the past 40 years, as the study
identified—was that Governments of all persuasions had cut
capital ahead of revenue expenditure when a downturn occurred. This is
not just a recent occurrence.</hs_para>

study, I concluded that the main root cause was the culture of the
Treasury itself, understandably determined at such times of national
reverse to rein back public spending. Officials aggressively target the
easy wins first, and tomorrow’s capital spending tends to carry
far less political pain than today’s welfare cut. Thus we
continually fail to invest in infrastructure to modernise our economy
and, as many have said, make it more
productive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000237" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000237">Last

Frankfurt airport itself. Frankfurt airport has four runways.

Howell of Guildford:</Member></B> My Lords, I join in warmly welcoming
my noble friend Lord Deighton to his Front Bench responsibilities. I
listened with great interest to his opening speech. I must confess,
however, that I am reluctant to join in this great argument between
austerity versus Keynesian inflation, of which we have heard both sides
in this debate. That is not least because both sides are in fact based
on a wildly exaggerated view of the degree to which our economy in this
country can be steered, manipulated, adjusted, rebalanced or anything
else magically, by purely domestic economic actions, somehow to create
growth and pull it out of a hat. In fact, I go further and say that the
naivety of some of our economic gurus who pronounce on these matters
never ceases to amaze me. It really is laughable to see the so-called
expert analysts twisting themselves in knots, to coin a phrase, over
whether GDP grew in the last quarter by 0.1% or shrank by 0.3% or more,
when GDP itself is a questionable and highly inaccurate measure of
economic activity and progress. I believe that it was invented only in
the 1930s and it has in any case now been distorted beyond
recognition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000242" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000242">Now
the experts tell us that infrastructure spending can somehow be
switched on overnight to “kick-start”—that is the
phrase—the economy. I do not know what system they believe they
are dealing with. They have obviously never worked in the construction
industry or they would know that the rather ugly phrase
“shovel-ready” is a meaningless term and that the best
infrastructure projects take a minimum of two years to
prepare—the best projects, that is—and to wind their way
through all the permissions and controls that we still have in this
country, even after certain reforms. I note what was said earlier by my
noble friend Lord Forsyth, who reminded us that the HS2 scheme
announced yesterday will take 13 years to get to its first phase. I am
not at all sure where I shall be in 13 years’ time, or indeed
where even the economy should be. I am not sure that these issues fit
into our present concerns at all.</hs_para>

reality is different. It is that our fate lies very largely overseas
and it is our sagging exports, especially to the eurozone, that have
hurt us. That is the problem now. That is what the December economic
review from the Office for National Statistics emphasises, quite
rightly, and the Office for Budget Responsibility also makes that
crystal clear. I am sorry that my noble friend does not think they are
always right but on this they are pretty clear indeed.</hs_para>

I am not against more major projects here at home to repair and upgrade
our dilapidated infrastructure. On the contrary, we need a bit of the

the lunatic optimism of the Brunels—father and son—and
other great Victorians. I believe that some of these projects could be
financed without spooking the international bond markets.</hs_para>

Professor Pissarides, a Nobel prizewinner, has been telling a Davos
audience that good energy and transport projects with a strong payback
in return, both in narrow and wider economic terms, can be financed
with minimum impact on the public finances if sensible accounting
practices are used. Some of us have been touting this idea around for
at least the past two years. It is all brilliantly laid out in
<I>American </I><I>Gridlock</I>, a book by one of America’s best
and most original economists, H Woody Brock, in which he speaks of the
need for a completely new capital stock of higher quality. There is
nothing very new about these ideas; it merely seems as though
economists over here, on this side of the Atlantic, are at last waking
up to them. They ought to be ideas that, frankly, transcend party
politics and are not turned into a political football.</hs_para>

key to recovery is going for a policy of lower energy and power prices
instead of the higher ones that we have at present. Again, my noble
friend Lord Forsyth emphasised that. Energy costs here are stupidly
high. We may not be able to match America’s low gas and
electricity prices at present, for obvious reasons, but anyone who
doubts that the value of cheap and abundant power supplies is key
should look at the industries now flowing back into
America—especially petrochemicals—and the hundreds of
thousands of new jobs being generated. Britain is in fact superbly
placed over the next decade for gas supplies, with both our own
substantial resources and half the world trying to sell us more of both
piped and frozen gas. It is a true buyer’s market and we
should be making the most of it, rather than the
least.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000248" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000248">As I
say, the real recovery is in export markets—whatever we do at

and far-sighted, innovative and creative enough to adjust to
totally new world conditions in a network world. If we are
looking for the queues that my noble friend Lord Wolfson, in his

the queues should be forming for us to perform much better in the

of thing is as important for our prosperity as many a conventional
trade mission. It also opens up, though exchange between individuals
and scholars, avenues for enterprise for small and medium-sized
businesses. I should certainly like to see the chambers of trade play a
far bigger role in the international export scene, as my noble friend
Lord Heseltine recommends, and I declare an interest as the economic

is a hopeful message to be distilled out of this. It is not a disaster
at all. The message is particularly and almost uniquely favourable to
Britain. The essence of it is that we now live not in a world of power
blocks and superpowers but in a world of networks. That is what the
microchip and the worldwide communications revolution have brought
about, and many economists do not yet seem to understand that. It is
not just a question of Asia and the southern world awakening, with
their vast cities of the future and their cultures and
values—which incidentally are often superior to ours when it
comes to family cohesion and education—and generally pulling
ahead of us in technology. That is the story of the past 10 years and
it is almost over. Those schoolbooks that we had about capital flowing
from the West to the developing world are history. The wealth, as well
as the research and technological skills, are now flowing the other
way. The debt-laden western powers are now turning east and south for
desperately needed investment and capital from the massive savings and
the huge sovereign wealth funds of Asia. We have 
<?notus-xml column=1471?>so much to learn and gain from India and China; it

us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012966000254" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0001.htm#13012966000254">This time

by a whole raft of new players such as Mozambique, Tanzania and Kenya
in east Africa, and in west Africa Ghana, Sierra Leone and the Nigerian
giant, which will soon be overtaking South Africa if it can manage its

sitting plum in the midst of the world’s best network. We will

investors. We will be increasingly well placed energy-wise, as I have
described. That is the good story of where we are going as a

too closely. Perhaps we should listen to somebody else in the IMF who
arrived fairly recently: the new lady in charge. The fact is that the
chief economist of the IMF has told us what the Government should now
be doing. The Governor of the Bank of England has even had some new
ideas about new supply side measures, and on infrastructure we have

money being spent can be summed up by that Answer I have just quoted.
It is not being spent, and that is the problem. There is no use talking
about why we do not have growth when the money is not being spent
today. I know that developing major infrastructure plans is difficult,
and it is as much the previous Government’s fault as anybody
else’s, but the fact is that we are where we are now, and this
Government have unfortunately not been spending money on infrastructure
now. With all the good intentions in the world, it has all been

willing to borrow. I wish all companies were like those that the noble

successful. If every other company in the country was as successful as
Next, we would be in a much better position than the one we are in

are the other hopes for the economy? One “hope” is Mark
Carney, the new Governor of the Bank of England. He said recently that
he wants to see his target changed to nominal GDP. Some people do not
appreciate that that does not mean dropping inflation but combining it
with inflation. My noble friend Lord Peston and I tabled an amendment
to the Financial Services Bill, which the noble Lord, Lord Newby,
rejected, to delete the three little words in the Bank of England Act:
“subject to that”. If the amendment had been accepted,
the new Governor of the Bank of England would have had his powers

the noble Lord, Lord Newby, told us the other day that the Chancellor
has rejected the new governor’s proposals, although he did not
put it as bluntly as that. He said that they are not changing 
the target. If I may put it this way, they are typical Treasury
words—as the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, is already
learning—that do not answer the question. Have they dropped Mark
Carney’s ideas? He did not say that they had not dropped them,
just that they 
<?notus-xml column=1474?>were keeping the same target. So we are stuck with it. My hope for Mr
Carney is that he will ignore the target and just do it. The Chancellor
cannot sack him because he is now the best in the world, as the Prime
Minister has told us. He is unsackable, so my advice to Mr Carney, if
he ever hears or reads it, is to ignore the target and just get on with
the job of co-operating with the Chancellor and helping him to achieve
what we all want to see—growth in the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:40:31"></hs_TimeCode>. As I

or without the agreement of the Chancellor, I hope that the
co-operation on monetary and fiscal policy that has been referred to
will be achieved. I hope so, but I am not terribly hopeful. We are told
that what the Government are doing now is because they cannot borrow
any more, and that if the previous Government had not borrowed so much
they would not be in this difficulty. In 2007-08 the previous
Government themselves inherited a global financial catastrophe. It was
not made in Downing Street. If the then Government had not
borrowed, the present Government would have borrowed not only a huge
debt but a recession as well—yet another recession. They saved
that. The previous Government did at least leave them growth. That
growth has gone and the debt is still there, so the inheritance is not
the reason for a deficit reduction plan. Austerity is clearly not an
answer. If nobody else can see it, I hope that Mark Carney can and will
help the Chancellor to see it as well. The question remains for the
Chancellor: what is he going to do about growth now? Is he going to
spend any money? He has told us that he will not, that he cannot borrow
any more.</hs_para>

2010, we were told that the Budget deficit reduction would be
brought into balance in five years. The latest figure I have seen is
from the Office for Budget Responsibility, which I am bound to say is
not the greatest forecaster in the country on any list. The last I saw
it was fifth out of 10. It is not my favourite forecaster, but it is
the Chancellor’s favourite forecaster, and he said the annual
Budget deficit will be down to 1.6% of GDP not in 2015 but in 2018.
This was before the latest set of figures that we have seen, so if we

first point is that the whole debate of austerity versus growth is
completely facile and futile. It is totally misguided. The distinction
is spurious because austerity is fundamentally a growth policy. It is
at the core of our economic management. Unless we reduce the deficit
and tackle the debt, confidence will fall, interest rates will rise and
the crisis that we have inherited and are emerging from will
return.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000004">Like
my noble friend Lord Howell, I will not enter into the sterile argument
on which the Opposition seem to be salivating about one
quarter’s provisional figures on the deficit. For the past year
we have been flat-lining—the figures add up to zero. They may be
adjusted more favourably once the fourth quarter is studied further.
However, it is perfectly normal, after a serious recession, that there
is an early bounce back and then a period of flat-lining or even a
further fall. It has gone on longer in this case because we inherited a
bigger crisis. Our banks are constipated. The continuing euro crisis
all last year affected both confidence and our markets. In passing, oil
accounted for 0.2% of the deficit in the fourth quarter because
production has been substantially lowered, mainly as a result of
maintenance programmes which are now being completed. Therefore we may
feel a compensating bounce back in the next and subsequent
quarters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:46:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

really only one measure of performance and not a particularly reliable
one. Here I again agree with my noble friend Lord Howell. However, it
is one on which there are grounds for cautious optimism. Some City
forecasts expect growth of 1% this year, rising possibly to 1.5%
towards the end of the year. That is slower than the United States but
faster and higher than the eurozone. Employment, not much mentioned
from the Benches opposite today, already gives grounds to support that
theory. Indeed, even between September and November, in the fourth
quarter, there was an increase of 113,000 jobs. Another indicator, the
savings ratio, is now around 7.5% which is higher than at any time
since 1997, so the private sector seems to support a tight fiscal
policy, although ironically that may in fact slow growth a bit when
coming from the private sector. However, with real disposable incomes
up by more than 2%, there is now the beginning of empowerment of the
housing sector and the private sector generally. The Funding for
Lending scheme is widely supported by the banking sector. It is helping
to reduce banks’ funding costs and in the past two or three
months there has generally been a sharp rise in credit availability,
not least with £50 billion worth of guarantees for
infrastructure

deficit reduction targets is absolutely vital but as progress is
made—it is already being made with the deficit down from more
than 11% to less than 8%—gradually some leeway will emerge and
gradually new policies will be developed. That is as it should
be. It does not undermine plan A. It simply builds on the progress that
plan A will be delivering. I particularly welcome the way in which my
right honourable friend the Chancellor has advanced his policies in
reducing corporation tax. At long last we are becoming competitive
there and I think that will reap dramatic and relatively early benefits
to us —the Laffer curve will kick in. There has been a massive
rise in the tax threshold for the low-paid, taking 24 million people
out of tax. That is a very valuable growth policy because the money

cuts, necessary for other obvious reasons, does not impose a major drag
on growth. Other factors do come into play. I believe that lack of
credit and liquidity are very serious ones. They are the real problem.
Banks, to a unique degree in the United Kingdom, were massively
overleveraged and underregulated for the first decade of this century.
That was the distinguishing feature of the United Kingdom’s
crisis. As they struggle to retrench, their lending is paralysed. They
have also neutralised any benefit that quantitative easing might have
delivered because they hoard the resources that it has delivered to
them instead of getting them out into the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000008">The
World Economic Forum competitiveness table shows the United Kingdom
climbing to eighth position from the 13th that it occupied under the
previous Government. However, overall productivity has still not
recovered fully from the decline of those years. In part, I think this
is caused by the chilling effect of banks not feeling able to force the
issue on their huge portfolios of exposed loans because to crystallise
them would severely affect their own balance sheets, as my noble friend
Lord Forsyth said. Therefore, those loans are stuck in damaged and
unproductive companies instead of being directed to new, more viable
growth opportunities. Lack of credit is still a huge brake on

is another serious problem that many companies face. Quantitative
easing has driven down yields on gilts which company pension schemes
are obliged to hold in substantial quantities. As a result, the Pension

British companies have had to pump an extra £150 billion into
their pension schemes, denying themselves the use of that money and,

quantitative easing is one factor, and a significant one—I hope
it will not be resumed—I believe that at the root of the problem
was the stealth tax of 1997 that withdrew tax credits from pension
schemes, estimated then at around £5 billion per annum. Just as
sustained deficits lead to accumulating debt, this revenue raid has by
now deprived the trustees of such schemes of some £100 billion
of capital. Further imposts have resulted from the levies to the
Pension Protection Fund and the introduction of more demanding
projected solvency requirements in 2004. Pensions regulators have often
obliged trustees against their better judgment to forgo equities in
favour of bonds. This toxic cocktail was completed by the credit crunch
recession, the lengthening of life expectancy and, as I have mentioned,
the impact of quantitative easing on gilt yields, with all the
implications for the discount factor in calculating future

of the burden of meeting the funding demands has fallen on employers

at present, many companies, mainly SMEs in manufacturing, are being
starved of working capital and the ability to invest by the overhanging
shadow of inherited liabilities to their pension schemes. It is no
wonder that so many defined benefit schemes have been closed to new
entrants. With the dramatic decline in the manufacturing sector
in past years, many firms have contracted and have often diversified
into specialist sectors with smaller workforces. They have closed their
pension schemes but still have the bloated burden of the

be in the camp—unsurprisingly, perhaps—which believes
that austerity leads to more austerity. While we are discussing
economic history, I think that President Roosevelt has a better record

my main purpose is to address some of the longer-term problems of the
UK economy which have contributed to our being in the mess that we are

we do not just slump back to a situation of business as usual. This
country is not a basket case—I agree with Boris Johnson on that
note of cheer—but it has some long-standing weaknesses which
need addressing and which we have been able to put on one side at
different times of our recent history. The weaknesses are well known
and I will not labour them but the shrinkage of the manufacturing
sector has not been fully compensated by the rise in the services
sector, with the consequence of a widening balance of
payments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:59:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000021">The
noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, referred to the record of Mrs
Thatcher’s Government but we should remember the costs of some
of those changes on the supply side in terms of the action that was
taken against trade unions. About 3 million jobs were lost in the
manufacturing sector. A heavy price was paid for that in some of the
old industrial areas and some of the political ramifications are still
very much reverberating. 
<?notus-xml column=1479?>Both the noble Lords, Lord Lang and Lord Forsyth, were on the front
lines of the battle in Scotland. That battle still goes on, albeit in a
different form. Social discord was very high and the costs of all that
were borne to some extent—quite a large extent—by the
fact that the North Sea oil revenues were flowing and the Exchequer was
benefiting greatly from
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:58:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000022">We
still have the problem of the shrinkage of the manufacturing sector. We
have been consumers and borrowers rather than savers and investors. Too
few of our companies think long term and we have a relatively
low spend on innovation. Indeed, at present, investment in new
machinery appears to be at a lower level than in Austria, Turkey or
Mexico. R&amp;D figures are better: the UK is fourth in the EU, but
efforts are disproportionately concentrated on defence and
pharmaceuticals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000023">Low
productivity levels were referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Lang, and
others as reflecting inadequate skills and low capital investment.
Industrial relations are still poor in some places and communication at
work also leaves a lot to be desired. We must face the fact that a high
proportion of our economy—the commanding heights in some
sectors—is in foreign ownership. This raises the question of why
there are relatively few British entrepreneurs able or willing to take
on some of these sectors. We also know that we have a systemic tendency
for rewards for top executives to outstrip performance and those of
other employees. This inequality can have a downward effect on growth
and this is important for this debate, as well as for equality. We have
a concentration on traditional markets. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell,
said, we have an improving presence in China, India and Latin America
but it is still relatively weak compared to our major European
competitors. Behind it all, we have the imbalances in our economy
between the relatively prosperous south-east and eastern regions and
the rest of the

what can we do about this? We know it is very complicated but there are
some glaring weaknesses that the complexities should not stop us from
addressing. First, can we learn some lessons from Germany and put an
obligation on employers, widely accepted there, to train, not just
young people but others as well? Can we not use the public procurement
process to encourage all contractors to reach the high standards of
training achieved when contracts were awarded for the Olympics, the
human relations side of which huge project the noble Lord, Lord
Deighton, was so successfully involved? Furthermore, we know that many
in this House would favour deregulation of the labour market and we
heard the Prime Minister talk about that in his Bloomberg speech just
last week. Why is it that the other economies around the North Sea, if
I can call them that, all have regulated labour markets? They did not
follow the deregulation, easy hire-and-fire, route of the
English-speaking world: collective bargaining is still
strong at sectorial level, as are extensive information and
consultation arrangements and worker representation in boardrooms. This
style of corporate governance has greatly assisted the development of
long-termism, a more equal spread of rewards and good economic and
export

also need to look at management culture and education. The UK often
boasts of its world-leading business schools and universities but they
often seem to be a transmission belt to put people into the financial
services sector. How can they be more like staff colleges for a new
North Sea economy and impregnate the other areas of industry and
services? The noble Lord, Lord Lang, also referred to taxation. At
present, the tax system favours borrowing over savings, debt over
equity, capital gains over income and tax breaks for the wealthy rather
than help for the poorest. Those emphases need to be changed. Can we
restore a requirement in major takeovers to examine the social
implications of bids and make takeovers a little harder? Perhaps we
could re-examine the scope for the state to take golden shares in key
UK companies while we still have some of these left. Every time we
devalue, as we are doing now, British companies become cheaper for
people in stronger currency

national investment bank, an idea espoused by the noble Lord, Lord

Lord Heseltine, regional policy restored and those regions that are
particularly hard hit, because they are dependent on the public sector,
given some help with new dynamism and entrepreneurial flair which needs
to be extended beyond the capital and its favoured environs. I do not
expect answers to these questions today, though I am sure we will

largest empire that the planet has ever known but, at that time, the

welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his amazing leadership in
the Olympics. He has an impressive track record—to use a
pun—of delivery, which is what this debate is about. If you
fast-forward to today from the 1970s and 1980s, we are a country which
is possibly entering a triple dip recession. Yet this country has
shown, over the past three decades, that it can completely reform its
economy and that, despite all these problems, we are one of the 10
largest economies in the world. With no empire we are still a very
wealthy country with so much going for us. So what are we doing wrong?
We cannot blame everything on the global situation or Europe. We seem
to have come to a binary way of looking at the world: in or out of
Europe, 
<?notus-xml column=1481?>austerity or spending, tax cuts or tax rises. If
only the world was so simple. As the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said, we
know that public expenditure of 50% of GDP is not only unaffordable but
not right. We also know that the coalition Government’s tough
talk of austerity seems to mean that we cut everything, including
higher education and defence, no matter how vital some of these areas
are, as the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, said. Just look at what is
happening, unpredicted, in North Africa now. How short-sighted are our
defence cuts, particularly in regard to troop numbers, now that we are

have actually worsened our chances of recovery. At the very least, it
has sent out a very negative signal and sapped the confidence of our
consumers and our businesses. The only thing this tough-talking
austerity has achieved is maintained our triple-A credit rating, but it
seems that we might be on the cusp of losing that, too. It is ironic
that our current global financial crisis was caused by the lowest
prolonged level of interest rates we had known. I am talking about
interest rates of 5%. We have now had three years of interest rates 10
times lower at 0.5% and that is what is propping up our economy. What

Government have, to be fair, tried a great many measures: quantitative
easing, injecting liquidity, fixing the regulatory and supervisory

and they need to go further in some of these areas. Our welfare bill,
including pensions, is over £200 billion a year. There is still
a benefits trap and it pays not to work. A trial of a scheme which
requires compulsory community service for jobseekers has been
successful. Could the Minister confirm that this will be rolled out
nationwide? I remember an event organised by the noble Lord, Lord
Forsyth, at which I spoke to the former Australian Prime Minister, John
Howard, about Australia’s very successful welfare-to-work
scheme. He explained that he thought it was going to be very unpopular
but it proved to be very popular, including with the jobseekers
themselves. That is not austerity—that is the wrong word. It is
about being firm and fair, and that would be in the best interests of
this country because work pays and it is good to work. Of course, if

entrepreneurship and foreign investment but creates employment.
Increasing taxes, on the other hand, stifles the economy, jobs and

been revealed that this Government have implemented almost
300 tax rises. These increases are harming business. In my

Higgins:</Member></B> My Lords, it is always a pleasure to follow the
noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, because he always introduces an element of
optimism in what has otherwise been a pretty grim debate. Like everyone
who has spoken, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish
him well. I certainly share the views of those who congratulated him
also on his role 
<?notus-xml column=1484?>in the most successful Olympic and Paralympic Games ever. I particularly
urge him not simply to be a government spokesman in this House but to
take an active role in his department. This is not always easy,
particularly regarding financial matters, where this House is inhibited
in some respects. However, the issue is important because we now have
not only a generation of professional politicians in the other place,
but we are getting pretty close to a generation of professional
Ministers, and an injection of more realism from these Benches on those
who are serving as Ministers would be welcome.</hs_para>

of the present situation is that we have to put the question of growth,
investment and so on in the overall economic context. It is true, as
all Cambridge economists would say—there are more around the
Chamber—that it is difficult not only for economists to forecast
the future but to forecast where you are. This is certainly true at the
moment because we have the strange situation where we appear to have an
economy that we are told is about to have a third dip but, at the same
time, the stock market is not doing at all badly and employment is
increasing rapidly. The answer to this is probably to be found
in the fact that wage inflation is virtually non-existent and it would
seem almost that the unions have come to the view that they should go
more for an increase in employment, rather than sustaining their
members’ living standards. This clearly has serious implications
for what might happen in the future, but none the less, this
appears to be the case. The trouble is—as the noble
Lord, Lord Skidelsky, pointed out—that the implication of that
is that productivity is actually going down in the circumstances I have
just described, at a time when we certainly, as an economy, want to
have productivity going up. Therefore, the answer has to be that we
must do something important to encourage aggregate demand.</hs_para>

just one other word in reply to the comments of my noble friend on the
Front Bench. He actually referred to a “national infrastructure
plan”. Those who have been in this place or another place for a
long while have nasty echoes of George Brown and his ill-fated national
plan, but I am not clear whether my noble friend will find that this
has capital initial letters in <I>Hansard</I><I>.</I> Perhaps he might
clarify whether it is his intention that it should do so. There may be
some argument for such an approach in the present circumstances with
regard to infrastructure, but it is absolutely clear that the
Government must continue to press on with their deficit reduction
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000043">I am now
rather puzzled by the position of the Labour Party. We were
told originally, “Well, the Government are doing it too fast and
too soon”—the implication being that something ought to
be done. It was clearly the case that one could not go on as one was
going on at the time when we came into power. What is the position now?
The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, with his usual reference to Keynesian
multipliers and so on, seems to be saying that we should now take
fiscal measures to stimulate the economy. In other words, he is saying
that we should not cut the deficit but go on increasing it even more.
He shakes his head; in that case, I am not clear where he stands on
this issue. What does he want to do about the deficit? It is not
apparent what he wants to do about the deficit, and 
<?notus-xml column=1485?>whether it involves the multiplier as well. We look forward to some
clarification in the wind-up speeches from the Front
Bench.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000044">The
trouble is that if it is not possible to do it by fiscal measures one
has to find other means of doing so, and lowering interest rates
further is clearly not a possibility. Therefore, one inevitably has to
resort to the question of quantitative easing. I share the qualms
expressed by my noble friend Lord Lang and others about the effect of
this on pension funds. The Treasury Committee is now, I gather, going
to carry out a full report into quantitative easing, which will be
helpful, but it does not seem to me that there is much alternative for
the moment. It is certain that its impact is diminishing, but it seems
to have some stimulating effect at the present time, which is something
that we need in present
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000045">Having
said that, I am concerned about the fact that our monetary policy is
confused and divided between the Treasury and the great Gordon
Brown’s invention, the Monetary Policy Committee—a very
unaccountable body. I am not at all clear that monetary policy is
operating as it should. Until the innovation of quantitative easing, it
was not a monetary policy at all: it was a Monetary Policy
Committee without a monetary policy. All it had was an interest rate
policy involving one interest rate. We are not clear as to how
responsibility for overall economic management is divided between the
Governor of the Bank of England—now incoming—and the
Monetary Policy Committee on the one hand and the Treasury on the
other. It is not clear to what extent there is a degree of
co-ordination and—as I pointed out as the legislation was going
through—they are working on two different forecasts. That is an
extraordinary situation to find ourselves in. Having said that, I think
it is important that we should continue to cut, but cuts must be made
in a sensible way. Yesterday at Question Time, the issue came up about
what is happening in south London, and the protests going on there on a
large scale because of the proposal to downgrade the maternity unit at
Lewisham Hospital. I have an interest in this, because my daughter was
born in Lewisham Hospital. We went there because of their high
reputation. Even more remarkably, her son was also born in that
hospital because events happened much more rapidly than was expected;
she had to drive 60 miles to get to the hospital and she and the baby
arrived there at the same time. The hospital responded magnificently.
To downgrade that hospital now would be a really appalling example of
how not to do cuts—cuts made simply because another part of the
NHS had overspent. It would be better to fire the people who overspent
rather than affect Lewisham Hospital. I have digressed—but I am
merely saying that I have a qualification in respect of my views on
cuts. The cuts must be sensible and well
judged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000046">On
infrastructure, I would like to make two points. First, there is
absolutely no point in having totally uneconomic infrastructure
projects. In this context, whatever the political arguments may be on
global warming and so on, to have a structure where the cost of the
investment is to be met by imposing higher costs on existing
consumers—some of whom may be dead before the new wind farms
come in—is not a sensible way of proceeding. I am sure that my
noble friend on 
<?notus-xml column=1486?>the Front Bench, with his knowledge of
microeconomics, will accept that if the pricing policy was right in the
first place, loading the cost of the investment on top of that is
certainly not going to give an optimum solution. But that tendency not
to carry out a normal investment appraisal but to put the costs on the
existing consumers appears to be happening with our normal, rather than
high speed, railways. The regulators seem to have
changed their view on what is the right way in which to make investment
proposals in these large infrastructure areas. I hope that my noble
friend in the Treasury will look carefully as to whether the regulators
are really doing the job in this respect that they ought to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000047">I gather
that the Treasury Committee—of which I was chair for many
years—has just made a report on the mini-Budget Statement. It
says that it is important that the Chancellor should not create
uncertainty with regard to his determination to reduce the
deficit. I believe that that is the situation that ought to be avoided;
it is important that we should remain resolute. At some stage,
obviously, it will be possible to reverse the present policy, but that
time has not come yet if we want to get growth in the
economy.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_29_PT_1/58BF710D9B7413A4553C14B9D2DACFD55327527B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 January 2013">Tuesday,

Deighton. I must also express my condolences to him for the
frustrations that he will inevitably face. There is a level of
exasperation that is liable to render one speechless and that is how
some of us on these Benches have been reacting to the
Government’s economic policies. Others have been able repeatedly
to highlight the failures and fallacies of these policies, with a
seemingly undiminished fervour. The Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, is one

Government have been holding the economy in recession and causing
untold misery to great numbers of working people, to people who are
seeking to work and to people who, for one reason or another, are
incapacitated. Perhaps the first thing that needs to be explained is
the insensitivity of the members of the Government to the effects that
their policies are having on a multitude of ordinary citizens who fall
into the middle and the lower reaches of the spectrum of income and
wealth. That such insensitivity is not an inevitable concomitant of
Conservative politics is surely indicated by the nation’s
experiences under the post-war Conservative Governments which, by and
large, shared a consensus on social and economic policies
with the Labour Governments. It was well understood by the
post-war Conservatives that a necessary condition for the growth in the
country’s prosperity was an assurance in the minds of the
majority of its citizens that they would profit from their labours
within a society that was destined to become increasingly egalitarian.
The egalitarian instincts of one Conservative Prime Minister, Harold
Macmillan, are deservedly well remembered. As Churchill’s
Minister responsible for housing from 1951 to 1954, he was charged with
the task of fulfilling the promise to build 300,000 houses
per year, and he achieved the target a year ahead of

present Government are also mindful of the manner in which a
house-building boom can serve to alleviate a recession; and they may
have been mindful of the effects of the house-building boom of the
1930s, to which local authorities contributed largely by providing
social housing. However, in a manner that seems to be utterly perverse,
the Government seek to relieve building contractors of their
obligations under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990
to provide a modicum of social housing. Their thought is that the
obligations to provide social housing are imposing a constraint on the
profits of the building contractors. Here is a prime example of an
economic argument, conceived in the abstract, that has no basis in fact

is now a growing recognition, which is reflected in much recent
literature, that better national economic performance is correlated
with greater social equality. There is plenty of evidence for this
among our European neighbours. In Britain, in recent years, the degree
of inequality has been increasing rapidly and exorbitant rates of pay
have become common in our financial sector. The justification that has
been offered for such remunerations is that they provide incentives to
effort and that they are necessary for attracting talented people to
serve in the financial sector. The Government appear to have accepted
such spurious assertions. The Government have gone further in reviving
the doctrine of the trickle-down effect. This asserts that the economy
is best stimulated when the greed and the enterprise of the rich are
activated by abundant rewards. To this end, there has been a reduction
in the top rate of income
tax.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000053">This
Government have been influenced to a remarkable degree by tendentious
economic doctrines that they have failed to re-examine in the light of
our present circumstances. One such doctrine concerns the supposed
crowding out of private economic enterprise by government initiatives
that pre-empt the supplies of labour and capital. A misplaced faith in
the alacrity of private enterprise has led to the mantra that social
provision should be open to any willing provider. The willing providers
have not been forthcoming, except where there have been easy pickings,
such as in the provision of manpower services and in security.
In the case of the private provision of health services, the

providers has been evident in connection with the major infrastructure
projects that this country so urgently needs to undertake, if it is to
retain its competitiveness in the global economy. There is a further
fallacy of economic thinking that is operative in this area. This is a
belief that social and national economic decision making can be, and
ought to be, conducted within the same framework as commercial decision
making and according to the same decision rules. Within such a
decision-making framework, one of the essential elements is the
commercial rate of interest, which is allied to the concept of the rate
of discount. The basic nostrum is that future earnings and economic
benefits should be measured and compared via their discounted present
values. A pound promised tomorrow is judged to be of lesser value than
a pound 
<?notus-xml column=1488?>given today, by virtue of the fact that
today’s pound could be invested profitably to generate a return
that is determined by the market rate of interest.
Notwithstanding that the current interest rates are markedly lower,
commercial project evaluation continues to be based on a target rate of
return of some 6% per annum. This implies a rate of discount that
diminishes the value of next year's pound by 94%. Some simple
arithmetic will reveal the fact that, in these terms, a pound promised
with certainty 15 years hence will have a present value of only 40
pence. At this rate, it is no wonder that commercial enterprises are
concerned with the here-and-now at the expense of making provisions for
the future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000055">It

perspectives of time that extend well beyond 15 years. To finance such
projects, which are the only sure way of stimulating the economy and of
overcoming the recession, without causing a balance of payments crisis,
the Government must borrow from the banks and on the open market, or
they must guarantee the borrowing of public bodies. They must also
raise taxes from those who can afford to pay them, including from large
corporations that have proved adept at avoiding taxation.

impact on the quarter. Excluding those, the economy actually

performance but not a healthy one. However, it is encouraging
that, according to the ONS, our volume of exports to 
<?notus-xml column=1489?>non-EU countries has increased by around 35% since
2009, and I hope it will continue to be a source of
strength.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000058">There
are some other, more encouraging signs according to the <I>FT</I>:
broad money supply growth is picking up and mortgage rates have fallen
as the Bank of England’s funding-for-lending scheme starts to
help the flow of credit from banks to the real economy. The FTSE index
of leading companies is at its highest level in four and a half years
and there are signs of recovery in some major economies. The other
bright spot is that people are continuing to find jobs. Half a million
more people are in work compared with a year ago and these jobs,
according to the ONS, have all been created in the private sector. I am
not an economist but I find it difficult to reconcile the continuing
poor GDP figures with the continuing good news on private sector job
creation. I am not sure whether the diagnosis of the noble Lord, Lord
Skidelsky, is correct.</hs_para>

has helped the figures. However, unless growth picks up, I see that
borrowing will decline much more slowly. Table 4.18 in the OBR December
2012 forecasts shows that it is not overall public sector current

The cut in corporation tax and the significant increase in investment

move on to the second part of the debate—the Government’s
role in promoting growth. I am not of the belief that the Government
should intervene to

Europe Since the Second World War</I>, written last year, Geoffrey Owen
of the LSE makes a tour through UK, French and German industrial policy
since 1945. His conclusion is that, in the main, government
intervention has not worked and that, instead, it would be far better
to create the right economic conditions for the industry that I
referred to a moment ago. UK government intervention failures included
the de Havilland Comet, Concorde, the advanced gas-cooled reactor,
British Leyland and ICL. British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce were the
major successes. So, with some exceptions, these interventions were
generally unsuccessful. Policy- makers tended to overrate the
risks and costs of market failures and underestimate those associated
with government failures. There is also a mistaken assumption that
there were certain technologies that a country somehow needed to have,
and that they were more likely to be achieved through centralised
direction than through competitive markets. The cost to the taxpayer of
ill-judged industrial policy was
high.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000064">I

rise in part to take issue with the very interesting speech of the
noble Lord, Lord Wolfson. In the detail of it, he rather dismissed the
idea of social investment at the current time—I hope that I am
being fair in conveying what he said. We must not underestimate the
importance of investing in early intervention, even at these difficult
times. If we want to have a skilled workforce and if we need to compete
with China and other nations around the world, we need to invest early
in our children, because what happens in the early days and years of a
child’s life is the most important determinant of whether they
will do well in education and
employment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:46:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000069">I
welcome the Government’s commitment to early intervention. The
right honourable Iain Duncan Smith has championed for many years this
notion of intervening early to get the best outcomes. I was cheered
recently to hear Andrea Leadsom, a Conservative MP and vice-chair of
the parliamentary group for children’s centres, really
highlighting the difference that can be made if one gets in early with
children and children’s lives, or indeed in terms of the
pregnancy of a mother and at certain times in adolescence as well.
There is a flexibility to the mind where the neural pathways are able
to be rejigged in certain ways, which can help people to do far better
in education, in work and
elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:47:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000070">Of
course, there have been some positive outcomes with respect to the
100,000 troubled families that the Government have been focusing on
recently and the Government’s investment in health visitors,
which is very welcome indeed. However, I repeat that what happens early
in life is the determinant, to a large extent, of future employability.
Too often business people think, “The education system has
failed. We need to put in our skills now at the age of 16, 17 or
18”—but that really is too late. We know from the
research on early years education that good-quality early years
education gives a huge boost to the educational outcomes of children.
Indeed, a good early years experience can protect children against bad
later educational experience. For instance, children having good early
years experiences going to poor or middle-quality primary schools will
do as well as other children going to good primary schools because of
that good early
experience<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:48:25"></hs_TimeCode>.

am afraid that despite the welcome attention from the Government in
early intervention, the global picture is worrying in terms of children
and family services, and in particular in terms of child protection.
The 28% cuts across the board to local authority spending, the cuts in
the number of youth workers and the cuts in other services are really
impacting on children and families. Local authorities are maintaining
their statutory services, so they are ready to protect the most
vulnerable children, those harmed the most. However, all those other
services around children and families are gradually 
<?notus-xml column=1492?>being picked off. Statutory services are moving on
to the back foot. Year by year we see more and more children being

have an example to express better what I mean. I draw noble
Lords’ attention to the National Grid Transco young offender
programme which is closely associated with Sir John Parker, the former
chairman of National Grid Transco. In 10 years it has provided the
programme to 1,000 young people. It has seen recidivism rates drop from
a norm of 70% to less than 4% for those young men and women. Sir John
Parker always highlighted—he was a tremendous advocate in
business for adopting this programme—the cost to the nation of
keeping these adults in prison. The year before last that was about

I have been hearing stories about some of the young men who have come

also heard about a man who got a home for himself so that he could be a
lone parent to his two sons. Another man had lost custody and contact
with his children but made sure that he quickly got a home so that he
could have shared contact with his sons. In my own experience of
visiting presentation ceremonies for National Grid in the past, I have
been touched to see fathers with their young children. These young
children now have fathers. A chief indicator for offending is that
one’s parent was an offender themselves. Instead, these infants
and young people are now seeing their fathers in a decent job, able to
provide income to the family and setting a good example to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:52:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000075">I
hope that that example shows what a difference good social investment
can make to the economy. I hope that the Minister will give an ear to

economist, and cuts may be necessary in the current circumstances, but
I am very concerned that we have seen this all before in the 1980s and
1990s. Youth services and children's services are cut and cut and we

significantly lightening the further pressure on our debt each year.
Employment is of course a key driver of growth and recovery and we have
seen more than 1 million new jobs created in the private sector in the
same period. Unemployment is at its lowest level for 18 months and the
number of people in work has reached another record high. Demand for
manufacturing orders is also expected to rise in the next quarter.

We will not reach the great heights that we once did if we continue to
buy so much more than we sell. That is why I am so pleased that the
Government have developed a renewed focus in this area, with UK Trade
and Investment actively encouraging small and medium-sized businesses
to increase the exporting of their goods and services, particularly to
emerging markets.

are three parts to this. First, around the early 1970s we started
de-industrialising, losing our industry, and our industry started
migrating to Asia. This happened not only to us but to many other
European countries. Germany is an exception, to which I will come.
Incidentally, Germany has never adopted any Keynesian policies that I
know of. It has always been a non-Keynesian-run country and has always
taken horrendous cuts in real wages. Even now, its consumption
to income ratio is lower than in the UK, regardless of what
growth it has. It is a very different kind of economy and we are not
about to replicate Germany. We can forget
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000096">Conservative
voters do not like infrastructure development, such as HS2. Forget
about Labour; our prosperous people are anti-growth with regard to HS2.
Our prosperous people are against the third runway. We have a deeply
anti-growth mentality. This is not my main point, but I want to
point out that we are somewhat perverse in our desire for growth. When
it actually comes to our doorstep, we say, “Take it somewhere
else, thank you very
much”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000097">But
to go back to my point, we got into de-industrialising early in the
1970s, and this happened to quite a lot of other countries. When we
finally lost a lot of industry, some of which we could not keep here
because we had priced ourselves out of international markets, we
replaced it with a service sector through much of the 1990s. Economics
is a strange subject. In neoclassical economics, it does not really
matter whether you dig ditches or make a car or make candyfloss. It is
all income. If you make candyfloss and not cars, you are still growing.
In the 1990s, we had the longest boom, for 15 years, but it was
entirely based on the growth of the financial services sector. Our
wealth creation was in the financial services sector. I know it is no
longer fashionable to like the financial services sector and we find it
not socially useful, but we lived off that sector for 15 years. We did
not reindustrialise or do anything about upskilling. I have been in
this country for 45 years and every year we say, “We should have
more apprentices, German-style”. Wow, there we go again. We have
not reindustrialised; we have been happy with the financial services
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000098">As a
part of that, we stopped saving. Households stopped saving, and
Governments stopped saving. Our crisis has arisen from over-spending,
under-saving and over-borrowing. It was not only us; almost the entire
western world under-saved and over-borrowed, and the poor,
fast-emerging Asians were lending us a lot of their money. They were
not only lending us money, they were also exporting goods to us which
we bought with the money they had lent us. So, in a vicious circle, we
went on having balance of trade deficits thanks to the money they had
given us. It was like a drug dealer giving you money to buy drugs and
then you need more
drugs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000099">Getting
out of an over-spending crisis is not easy, as the noble Lord, Lord
Skidelsky, pointed out. This is a portfolio of a stock disequilibrium
crisis, and it will take a long time for our savings to recover to
anything like a decent standard. The noble Lord, Lord Lang, 
<?notus-xml column=1497?>talked cogently about our problems with the pensions industry, and so on
but, given our demographics, we need to get to a level of savings
higher than what it was in the 1990s. The question is what we are going
to do to get our level of savings higher than it previously was. How
are we going to get to that
stage?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000100">I know
that there is a clear division between Keynesians who think that one
more bout of spending will get us out of this crisis. I have studied
Keynesian economics and I have been a Keynesian economist, although I
am not one during this crisis. Our problems arise from what we did
during the prosperous years about spending. It is not what we borrowed
after 2008 that is the problem; our problem is that we borrowed at the
top of the boom and that our debt to GDP ratio went up in the good
years. Had it been the case that borrowing was self-liquidating, we
would not have been in this situation. So, to some extent, there is a
problem, not about borrowing but what you spend it on. Some spending is
self-liquidating, while other spending is not. Obviously, we had a
balance between the public sector and private sector or, perhaps,
between the wealth-creating sector and the welfare-creating sector.
That balance went awry somewhere during the boom years. We started at
36% of GDP being spent by the state in 1997, when Labour came to power;
it was 44% by 2007 before the crisis hit us. At the end of all the
misery that this is going to cause us, we are going to return to 44%.
All the adjustments, no matter how long they take, will only get us
back to 44%, and there will still be a lot more structural adjustment
to do when we are through with this. After we have eliminated the
deficit and stabilised the debt level, we will start rebuilding the
economy. This is just patchwork. We have to think about this problem
more
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000101">I
believe, and have always believed, that QE was a disastrous mistake.
When you need to raise your savings, if you cut interest rates you
discourage savings, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lang.
Furthermore, we know that while households and Governments are in debt,
corporates are in surplus cash and no one is investing. One reason
could be, of course, that there is no demand, but another problem is
the uncertainty about interest rates. Everyone knows that one of these
days QE is going to come to stop and interest rates are going to go up.
Until I see how interest rates are going to go up, why would I invest?
Why would I invest now, when interest rates are 0.5%, when I know that
they are going to 6% further down the
line?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000102">One
thing that Mark Carney can do—although I do not think he will
listen to me, if anyone—is to stop QE. Let us get out of QE as
fast as we can. A very loose monetary policy and a very tight fiscal
policy have so far not had much effect on the economy. We are bumping
along at the bottom. Minus 0.3% is neither here nor there because, in
any of these things, the standard error is plus and minus 1%. It is
like opinion polls; we are always told that error is plus to minus 3%,
so do not take the actual numbers assessed as serious numbers. We have
been bumping along at the bottom for roughly three years, as has the
eurozone economy. The Americans are doing slightly better. However,
relative to their potential growth rate, they are also quite far down,
and this is a problem of the entire western world.</hs_para>

is not easy to be convinced, and I am not convinced, that a
reinvigoration of the Government’s spending programme on the
capital side will necessarily lead us out of this problem. This is
partly because, if you are going to spend on investment projects, the
pay-off is delayed and long. So your spending today is not going to
bring economic growth immediately. The IMF studies show that if in one
year the multiplier is one-half and in the second year it is
two-and-a-half, the model needs re-examination. What sort of model is
it? Next year it may be three-and-a-half or one-quarter, I do not know,
but it is not a Keynesian problem—it is a very different
problem—and we will have to bump along on the bottom.</hs_para>

suggested will not work, partly because of the delays which feature in
infrastructure, as the noble Lord, Lord Birt, pointed out, and as we
well know. So even if we planned to spend money, even if the Government
were to announce £50 billion of investment, that £50
billion is not going to enter the economy at any time soon and, if it
does, it will not lead to income growth rates. I am very gloomy about
bumping along the bottom until confidence revives in the private sector
and it starts investing again. The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, mentioned
that stock markets are feeling very happy. They must know something
that we do not, but they are clearly feeling euphorious. People are
into junk bonds and equity markets, so maybe there are some
undercurrents of optimism, but we do not know what it
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000105">Everyone
else has spoken about infrastructure, so I will not talk about that.
One reform that I hope we can accomplish, I do not know how soon, is to
start not taxing income but taxing expenditure. It is a long-delayed
reform. If you have an economy which needs to save more, you do not tax
income, you tax consumption and expenditure. Secondly, I do not think
we should tax profits. We should tax material consumption or carbon
emissions, but not profits. Nor should we tax employment, as we do with
the national insurance contributions. We are doing everything wrong. If
we are going to permanently change the economy, stop taxing income and
tax expenditure; stop taxing profits and tax material consumption; and
stop taxing employment, as far as possible. If we begin to make those
kinds of long-term changes, perhaps we will get back into the spending
habit and, if the savings are there and interest rates fall back into
the normal pattern, we will have growth coming from the private sector
and not necessarily the public
sector.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_29_PT_1/7FE2ED1F333787BFF3D908287CFF51DED06B0FB0" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 January 2013">Tuesday,

Selsdon:</Member></B> My Lords, when the noble Lord, Lord Desai, joined
this House in 1991, I always found myself speaking on economic and
trade debates from one of these Benches—either this side or that
side—but there was something strange about it: he always seemed
to be at a much higher level. I thought that perhaps the seats were
higher. However, this was part of his life and I learnt much from him.
When he first arrived, I wanted to know why we had so many
economists. I had already asked the Department of Trade why we needed
economists connected with trade, and I found that there were about 230
of them. This started when we had the desire for a relationship with
eastern Europe. 
<?notus-xml column=1499?>Somehow people felt that economists came from eastern Europe, where they
were more intelligent or more highly trained. The noble Lord, Lord

stand here today to speak on behalf of the remains of my
“gang”: the noble Lords, Lord Ezra and Lord Stoddart of
Swindon, and the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, who is in his place. We
had the honour of serving on a Select Committee on overseas trade, back
in 1985. We are going to make an approach and ask whether that
committee can be re-established, and the Chairman of Committees will
already have received a message from the noble Lord, Lord
Ezra.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012984000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000109">I was
put on that committee because I would be young enough when it became
important to do something serious about everything. This has been much
the story of my life in your Lordships’ House. No one realised
that I might be able to do something on my own. However, I did write a
report. The Select Committee was called the Aldington committee, after
Lord Aldington, and it had some quite bright people on it. We had an
enormous amount of support and interviewed people from well over 100
companies. Our report asked, “What do we do when the oil runs
out?”. This was in the 1980s—the committee was formed in
1985—and the oil was steadily running out. Everybody was
spending the money from oil but not investing it. As it ran out, the
balance of payments deficit began to grow, because people were not
interested in balance of payments. The deficit soared, particularly on
visibles. It became so enormous that we could hardly support it. As we
know well, today we have quite a lot of deficits on visibles. The total
figure is around £50 billion, although there are some good
aspects. In the pharmaceutical field we have a surplus of perhaps
£20 billion; in food, excluding alcohol, it is minus £20
billion; with alcohol, it is a little less, because the whisky which my
family used to make historically is probably doing quite well
abroad.</hs_para>

of payments matter? I think that it does, but it is trade that I am
interested in. I sail very happily in the wake of my noble friend Lord
Howell in recognising that, if we do not trade with the world,
we will no longer have an economy. Your Lordships know well that our
visibles deficit with the EU is very significant. We have a surplus
with non-EU countries—Egypt and the Middle East are among the
greatest—but with that form of deficit and no investment
following, we have a certain difficulty.</hs_para>

forgotten that over a short period of time new technology has been

them. On the automotive front, it took a long time to get the go-ahead.
We did a study on cars and forgot that the Japanese drove on the same
side of the road as we did. That was quite a problem, but it was one of
the reasons why we said, “Why don’t you come and make
cars over here, because it will be more economic?”. However,
they just wanted to make cars that lasted. So those were two areas of

actually type. One of the things that I learnt in the Navy was to type
seven copies and put holes through the a’s and the e’s.

area of taxation. I had a great regard for Michael Heseltine—now

the enterprise zones. That was when I went to Toxteth. We looked at
what happened in Docklands and the regeneration. Although there were
people who normally would never have invested in these sorts of
doubtful ventures—we have only to look at the slightly
disastrous 
<?notus-xml column=1501?>beginning of Canary Wharf and the complete failure
of developments of any significance to get off the ground economically
in Docklands—it was the ability to claw back tax that permitted
people to take an added risk. We should look at this again. Rather than
having our foreign friends who want to live in London being told they
will have to pay mansion taxes or things of that sort, I should like to
set up a fund that would enable them to invest in infrastructure
development and claw back that tax for a period of time.</hs_para>

Lord Howell and others to go out in the world and sign the sort of
Elizabethan treaties that we used to have, where we would buy the
“turds of birds” from South America, as someone said;

that the state can do is step out of people’s way and allow them

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by adding my voice
to the many expressions of congratulation and welcome which the noble
Lord, Lord Deighton, has received warmly and genuinely from all
sections of the House this evening. It is very good to think that there
is now going to be someone in government with an economics background.
However, I have to tell him—if it is not already blatantly
apparent—that he has joined the board of a company that has been
extraordinarily mismanaged over the past two and a half years. The
record is extremely bad and was quite unnecessary. In the first two
quarters of 2010, our growth rate was 0.3% in the first quarter and
0.7% in the second quarter. Then it just fell off a cliff because of
the negative confidence impact of the declarations of the new
Government.</hs_para>

the light of experience, there must be very few people in this country
who are not politically signed up to the Government or otherwise

is 
<?notus-xml column=1504?>very regrettable that we did not continue on the trajectory set out by
Alistair Darling in his Budget of March 2010 to reduce the deficit on a
much slower path. That would have been a much better
idea.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000135">Remarkably,
those things were predicted by a number of people at the time.
Everybody has to pay tribute to my right honourable friend Ed Balls,
the shadow Chancellor, who did something which I would never have dared
to do as a Minister or shadow Minister, which was to make a very
specific economic prediction. He said that the policies adopted by the
new Government would bring about a double-dip recession. Sadly, he was
all too right. The dangers which the Government were running were quite
clear at the time, but so far we have had not a word of recognition of
their mistakes. Not only was the basic macroeconomic judgment clearly
wrong, but the manner in which economic policy has been adopted has
been extraordinarily cack-handed and clumsy over that time. I will give
one example in relation to VAT, which I mentioned in this House at the
time.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012984000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000136">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:49:33"></hs_TimeCode>
thought that it was quite reasonable to increase VAT, but not by 2.5%
at one go, and certainly not to do so on 1 January.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:40:36"></hs_TimeCode> you want to
increase a consumption tax like VAT, and maximise the revenue impact
but minimise the negative demand impact, which presumably any sensible
person would try to do, the one thing you do not do is to deliver it on
1 January. Any shopkeeper, restaurateur, car salesman or anybody else
could have told the Government that that is the lowest seasonal moment
in consumer demand in the course of the year. The effect of putting on
an enormous consumption tax at that point is to exacerbate the downturn
of the economy and increase the volatility of the economy, when the aim
of a stabilisation policy should be to reduce
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:40:38"></hs_TimeCode>. That was not
a very intelligent thing to do, and it is a very bad record. That is
the first, and fundamental, mistake. I will list five fundamental
mistakes—five stupidities—of which this Government have
been guilty over the past two and a half years, and that is the first
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000137">The
second stupidity relates to infrastructure. Of course, it is a rather
good thing to spend money on in a recession, because factor costs,
labour costs, land and interest rates are lower. I am sure, by the way,
that the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, learnt all that when he studied
economics under my noble friend Lord Eatwell all those years ago.
Indeed, in what he said this evening he showed signs of having done so
and genuinely wishes now to put them into effect. I congratulate him on
that. Perhaps this is a new broom in the Government, which is very
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000138">He
mentioned infrastructure; the trouble is that a lot of opportunities
have been lost irrevocably. We should have been spending that money on
infrastructure over the last two years, as we have been in recession.
It is not much use—or it is better than nothing but very much
less use—now to plan to spend more money on infrastructure
several years hence. In the case of HS2, that money will not be spent
until the 2020s. I hope that we shall be back in power long before then
and that the economy will be booming. That infrastructure spending
might be contributing to an overheating of the economy, requiring an
increase in interest rates. It 
<?notus-xml column=1505?>will still be a desirable investment for the

third stupidity perpetrated by the Government relates to monetary
policy. I can quite see that with such a very restrictive fiscal policy
the Government’s only hope of generating some demand and
compensating for the collapse of private sector demand was through
monetary policy. Monetary policy obviously cannot be conducted by
reducing interest rates, considering the level at which they now stand.
A number of people around the world have come to the conclusion that
quantitative easing is the best tactic in current monetary conditions,
and one can understand that. An argument is to be had as to whether the
type of quantitative easing adopted by the Bank of England in this case
was the right one, or whether it would have been much better to have
bought paper from the non-banking sector, thereby putting money
directly in the pockets of the private sector, rather than to buy paper
from the banking sector.</hs_para>

that as it may, it was completely crazy to pay interest—and as
far as I know the Bank of England is still doing this—on the
deposits of the Bank of England, which were being inflated in this way.
I think that the interest rate that the banks receive is 75 basis
points; the Minister can perhaps correct me if I have got that wrong. I
should be delighted if the Minister tells me that this particular
stupidity has come to an end. It really is quite extraordinary. There
is no point whatever in having the banks simply accumulate deposits at
the Bank of England. That is not the money supply; it may be a figure
included in some of the indices, but it is not conceptually the money
supply, it is not at all cash held for the purpose of transactions in
the economy, and is absolutely useless from the point of view of
investment, consumption or demand. The only purpose of this exercise is
to get the banks to leverage on those deposits by extending their
lending; by credit creation. The penalty for not doing that is being
reduced by paying the banks for keeping those deposits on deposit at
the Bank of England, by paying them the 75 basis points. To put it
another way round, this is reducing the incentive for the banks to
lend. This, therefore, is a question of the Government putting their
foot on both the accelerator and on the brake—not perhaps as
much on the brake as on the accelerator—but why do that? It is
completely

fourth example of quite gratuitous stupidity on the part of this
Government is, again, a contradiction between two different policies
adopted simultaneously by the Government. One is
the Government’s desire to 
<?notus-xml column=1506?>see the banks lending more; to see greater credit creation, which is a
sensible objective. The real problem for credit creation is confidence.
The Government are doing nothing to contribute to confidence, so
against that background, all these other technical attempts to
generate greater bank lending are unlikely to be enormously successful.
Nevertheless, the Government are apparently sincerely signed up to the
cause of increasing credit creation in this country. However, at the

had this out several times in this House with the noble Lord’s
predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon. When I raised it, he said,
“Ah yes, but we have had two or three exchanges in this House on
this subject in the past two years. These new capital adequacy
requirements will not come into force until 2018, so that’s all
right”. It is not all right. I hope that the noble Lord will
look at this again, because it is certainly not all right. I sat for a
number of years on the board of an investment bank, with a lending book
of many billions of pounds, and I can assure him that if the
regulators—the Bank of England in those days—had said to
us, “We want to increase your capital ratios in five
years’ time”, we would have had to start right then. At
the next board meeting we would have been discussing how to change our
policies. In a market in which it is very difficult to raise
new capital because the bank shares are on the floor, and for the same
reason you cannot really reduce your dividend, and banks, for less
estimable reasons will not reduce their bonuses, there is no way of
achieving higher capital adequacy ratios other than reducing their
lending book.</hs_para>

trajectory to get them to the capital adequacy position they need to
get to by 2018. That goes completely counter to the Government’s
expressed desire to get banks to increase their lending. It does not
make any sense at all. Again, it is a complete and utter contradiction,

the fifth stupidity the Government have gone in for—again, not
for very creditable reasons—is the decision to hold a referendum
on our membership of the EU. This, of course, is a subject which I know
we shall have a chance to debate in greater detail in two days’
time, and I will not trespass on this ground for very long.
Nevertheless, it must be brought into an economic debate. This is a way
in which a Government, who should have as a priority the creation of
the maximum degree of confidence in the economy, reducing the risk of
the environment in which investment and consumption decisions will be
taken, are doing exactly the opposite. They are gratuitously,
deliberately and unnecessarily creating a whole new area of risk, which
is about whether or not this country will still be part of the European
Union in a few years’ time. In the past three weeks, two Cabinet
Ministers have said that from their point of view they can quite easily
see their way to our leaving the European Union. You cannot do a worse
day’s work in terms of undermining confidence in the economy
than to do what this Government are doing on that particular
front.</hs_para>

again, just as some infrastructure decisions such as abandoning the
third runway at Heathrow were basically driven by party-political
considerations, marginal votes and seats in west London and so on, I
fear that this decision about a European referendum has been based on
party-political considerations such as the need to appease the
eurosceptics in the Tory party at the expense of the national interest.
It is time that the national interest came first and last, because this
economy is in a very difficult situation and we need to get out of this
recession as quickly as possible. It is about time that the Government,
in addressing that task, make sure that they adopt a position that is
purely based on national interest, not on such short-term
party-political

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister is going to be tired of
being welcomed to his new role, but let me join with others there. I
also want to congratulate him on sponsoring what is not an easy debate
so early in his ministerial career. It speaks of leadership and this
House, on all sides, likes and appreciates leadership. I also want to
thank the House for its indulgence. After the first four speeches, I
had to join the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards or it
would not have been quorate. I think we can all agree that getting the
banks into a stable financial situation is a priority. Everything else
that we may do for growth in the economy will all be reasonably for
naught if we cannot sort our banking structure out, so again I thank
the House for that.</hs_para>

first four speeches and was then in plenty of time to hear the noble
Lord, Lord Desai. Those speeches were all a sort of tour de force with
the combat of different schools of economic thought. I dare not
trespass into that territory—that is not where my intellectual
capacities are—but I found it fascinating and I suspect, like
many people, that I concluded that is very hard to listen to abstract
theory and come away with conclusions. I hope that the House will not
mind if I try to be simpler and perhaps a little more
practical.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012984000150" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000150">I
do not think you have to have a grasp of economic theory to recognise
that the previous Labour Government hideously overspent from about
2004, ramping up public spending so that when the financial crisis hit
in 2008, because of our spending and debt levels we had no resilience
and no cushion to deal with that crisis. I do not think you have to
come with a background in economic theory to recognise that the very
laissez-faire attitude towards the banks essentially led to the booking
of absolutely false profits by those institutions and ephemeral tax
revenues, which were taken as a permanent tax stream by the Labour
Government.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012984000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000151">I
do not think you have to have an economics background to recognise that
over a longer time than the Labour period—over a
generation—we allowed our economy to become unbalanced. The
noble Lord, Lord Desai, described that exceedingly well. We became
overly dependent on the financial services sector. We failed to make
sure that vigour extended beyond the south-east and covered the rest of
the country. In perhaps the cruellest rub of all, we neglected
providing 
<?notus-xml column=1508?>the kind of skills to our young people who were not going to take the
academic route but needed vocational training and apprenticeships. They
could have generated the kind of jobs and economic strength that would
come from those skills. We chose to neglect all those things; that
whole series of imbalances is now being tackled by this coalition.
Taking that long-term view and taking on the challenge of dealing with
these absolutely fundamental weaknesses in our economy strike me as
being some of the most important measures that this coalition has
taken.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012984000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000152">I want
to name check in some sense Vince Cable—he has not been
mentioned, at least while I have been here—for bringing forward,
fostering and pushing an industrial strategy, something which we have
seriously neglected. He has finally provided sector-specific support to
industries that can lead us into growth, whether they are
pharmaceuticals, green industries or aviation, and the development of
the domestic supply chain—an area that really had no focus in
the past. There has been investment in innovation and R&amp;D and there
is now an absolute sea-change in capital allowances, to encourage
investment in new technologies by business. There is action on finance
to deal with absolute market failure, which even those changes that we
are making will not address. That is, in the Green Investment Bank, the
British business bank and very substantial increases in export
guarantees.</hs_para>

Lord Deighton, spoke, what excited me the most about his extraordinary
speech was his focus on doing and delivering. In that context, I would
like to add something slightly different to this debate, because as a
doer and deliverer I am going to ask him if he might be willing to
think small. We have such a bent in this country for looking at the
large—the large business, the grands projets and the big
bank—while we neglect the heartland of our economy. SMEs as a
sector, not just in the UK but overall in the EU, account for all of
our new job creation. That is not just in tough times such as these; it
has also been true in the years of prosperity. New start-ups and small
businesses are absolutely key to our growth and we have an enviable
range of SMEs in the UK. Some 20% of all the SMEs in the EU are in this
country. I do not think that registers on the general
consciousness.</hs_para>

Government have taken steps to strengthen small businesses, from tax
breaks to investors through the EIS, regulatory preferences, new
support through UKTI and Funding for Lending. However, let me suggest
that it is not enough and not brought into a coherent strategy and
programme. The problems of SMEs are incredibly granular. I listened
yesterday to Xavier Rolet of the LSE talking about the problems of
raising equity for SMEs, in large part because all the rules are a
scaled-down version of those written for blue-chip companies, rather
than being designed for the small
players.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000155">I am
on the SME Select Committee on exports, where I hear about the problems
of protecting intellectual property for small exporters, especially for
SMEs that decide to try to export to the BRICs. Again and again, this
House has heard the complaint that small companies and microcompanies
cannot access credit from the traditional banks. We lack those networks
that supply 
<?notus-xml column=1509?>such credit in successful countries, such as the
community development finance institutions in the USA and the
Sparkassen in Germany. This list could go on for several pages; I
suspect that in today’s debate many more issues concerning SMEs
will have been raised.</hs_para>

trying to tackle this as a piecemeal add-on to various different
policies in different departments. I wish that the Government would
consider having a dedicated team working across departments, going
through obstacle by obstacle with the single mandate of releasing
growth in our SME sector. Frankly, the big guys can take over
themselves; this is where we can make change and with small companies,
small changes make an immediate impact. We all know what the impact on
jobs would be if SMEs which were planning to expand, perhaps to hire
just one more person, did it six months earlier than they had
originally planned. The gain that we can get, with its impact on
growth, could be tremendous if we agree to focus.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, by referring to small
infrastructure. I am very supportive of the big infrastructure projects
such as HS2. There is a whole range of them. We have neglected
infrastructure in this country; I would not argue with that. However,
as many people have said, large infrastructure has a long lead time and
I want to make a plea for small infrastructure projects. In the Local
Government Finance Act 2012, the Government put in place the legal
framework for tax increment financing though a structure known as TIF1.
This would allow local authorities to receive part of the uplift in
business rates resulting from new infrastructure and, on that promise,
to obtain the financing to enable those projects to go ahead in the
first place. A perfect arrangement, your Lordships might think, for
transport links to enable a new industrial park or for an opportunity
to finance key housing.</hs_para>

go through the details of the legislation but, in effect, what the
Government did was to give with the one hand, by creating the framework
for TIF1. They then took away all the potential by severely limiting
the period during which local authorities could capture those business
rate increases. The argument is about general accounting and the
relationship with the Treasury, and whatever else, but given that we
need growth this is absolute madness. Just about every local authority
in the country will have a few good, but small, infrastructure projects
that would stimulate economic development locally. We need those to be
breaking ground and I urge the Government to go back and capture that
low-hanging fruit of small, local infrastructure projects which could
feed quickly into growth.</hs_para>

lending, this House is well aware that we are quite unique in the
developed world in having so much of our banking service dominated by
five huge players, all of them so like each other that few individuals
or businesses ever bother to move their accounts, despite high levels
of dissatisfaction. Everyone recognises that competition for these
banks is one of the best ways to challenge what became a tainted
culture and a lack of focus on the customer. But while new, big players
may have a role, I want to argue for change to include a network of
small players. This means community banks, specialist small business
banks, crowd funders, peer-to-peer lenders and credit unions—in 
<?notus-xml column=1510?>other words, to have real variety and choice capable
of meeting much wider needs than our banks currently
meet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000160">A lot of
the enabling legislation is now in place, but to take it from a
possibility and a theory to reality, recognition, action and support
from our Government and our regulators are needed. It makes for a
messier world but, I would argue, a more stable, capable and honest
one. That is the argument that I would like to put to the Minister. Of
course he must act on large projects and, with infrastructure, they
would be a large part of his plate. Will he look at the small and the
quick? We need economic growth now, not in 10 or 15

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a most
fascinating debate, which has covered a wide range of issues and it is
therefore a testing ground for the new Minister, whom of course I
welcome to his place. I am sure that he will enjoy these debates, as we
all do, while recognising that replying to a debate with nearly 30
contributions, all of which merit real thought and response, is
challenging. This is not least because the Minister is also replying to
the debate about the most fundamental issue before the country, which
is the present state of the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000162">The
Minister will have noted that from the beginning the noble Lord, Lord
Skidelsky, from the Cross Benches, wasted no time in emphasising two
things. We should not be deluded by false claims on infrastructure, or
the way in which the Government are recovering the economy. Mention of
HS2 and HS3, which are more than a decade, or certainly several years
away, before any work on them is done, scarcely fits into the pattern
of the urgency of our need for recovery in the economy. My noble friend
Lord Barnett buttressed that position by identifying how little has
been done in the specific area of infrastructure investment, on which
he had challenged the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000163">The
Minister might have thought at that stage that least we were on home
ground in talking about infrastructure. The noble Lord, Lord Lamont,
raised the very real and significant issue about regulation of the
banking sector. The Minister will appreciate that behind these issues
that we are discussing is the financial collapse a few years ago. This
has thrust the financial sector into considerable turmoil. For the
Government, it has presented a very real challenge in how we seek
successfully to regulate the banks, so that nothing like the disaster
of the past decade can occur
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000164">There
were other issues in this debate that I hope the Minister will find
time to address. In an interesting contribution from the business
perspective, the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson, appeared to indicate that
one of the best infrastructure projects in which we could get involved
was building roads. Behind it he raised, as regards finance for the
roads, the possibility of some system of road pricing. I have no doubt
that the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, has already been warned about going
where others have feared to tread in the past, but he would be wise not
to be too enthusiastic about the concept of road pricing in
anticipation of where the Government might go in due course.</hs_para>

quantitative easing came up. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, raised the
matter first. He was supported from my Benches by my noble friend Lord
Desai. Both of them were really asking what happens when quantitative
easing ceases, and we seek to establish a more framework for our
economy and currency. This is an interesting question, which I hope the
noble Lord will recognise as germane and important to this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000166">The
noble Lord, Lord Birt, stressed the issue of the development of the
right kind of skills in an economy. This is a long-term process. We all
recognise that, but we have heard too much analysis of what is wrong
with our skills sector without effectively producing the strategy to
cope with it. There is no doubt that for the long-term health of our
economy we need to ensure that our people are readily skilled for a
world in which technical change occurs so quickly. If that was not
enough the noble Lord, Lord Lang, brought up pensions and the challenge
that they present to the Government, and in this significant issue he
was supported by my noble friend Lord Monks. The agenda is moving up,
without the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, not failing, as he usually
does, to give us an overview of the issues that are at stake and how
they affect business. He was full of a somewhat doleful message. Of the
Chancellor’s targets, which he set two and a half years ago
against which his achievements must be measured, only the tattered
banner of credit rating 3A remained, and one was not too sure how long
that banner would last before it was
shredded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000167">The
noble Lord, Lord Higgins, picked up on this debate as have a certain
dismal quality. It is certainly one that has raised fundamental issues.
The noble Lord introduced a dismal element because he thinks that some
of the solutions are difficult to achieve in the time that we need to
achieve them. The Opposition agree with him. Meanwhile, my noble
friends Lord Hanworth and Lord Hollick emphasised the failings of the
Government in relation to the policy that has been pursued so far. I am
not sure that the suggestion that the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, had
produced a document to which the Government should give their fullest
attention was quite the response that they have so far given. While we
know that that document is to be taken seriously,
“seriously” is different from “being acted
upon”. We await the Government’s indication that they are
actually prepared to implement some of the suggested reforms of the

Heseltine.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000168">The
noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, suggested that the Prime Minister has
committed himself to every government department having a growth
objective. I do not know all government departments intimately, but I
can think of one or two that would resist that concept. There is
another challenge for the noble Lord as he beds himself down into
Treasury matters. As he will be only too well aware, the Treasury is at
the centre of all these issues, and the responsibility that he has
taken on needs to measure up to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000169">Those
are the issues that have been raised in debate, but the fundamental
point is the charge that is being made from this side of the House,
buttressed by a number of contributions from elsewhere in the Chamber.
That charge is straightforward—that we are quite 
<?notus-xml column=1512?>possibly on the brink of a triple-dip return to recession. We are taking
longer to emerge from recession than at any time in the past. The
objectives and measures that the Chancellor put forward for success in

Howell, found a glimmer of optimism in opportunities for improving
exports. No one doubts the necessity for that, but when the pound is
slumping to the extent it is, if we do not capitalise on that to
develop our export potential, we are in a very serious position indeed.
However, although the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is certainly better
informed on these matters than I am, I do not think that exports are
based too much on sentiment. I understand the markets that may obtain
within the Commonwealth, but I am not sure that we get any favourable
treatment as far as those sovereign countries are
concerned.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012984000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000170">This
debate has laid bare the weaknesses of the Government’s present
policy. We are at a crossroads because it will not be long before the
Government recognise that they cannot pursue these policies for much
longer without pushing the country into total despair. One speech was
quite enlightening on these things. It was made by the noble Earl, Lord
Listowel, on child welfare. I appreciated his contribution. At last we
got to the costs which are being born of failure. The cutbacks that are
occurring affect our people so grievously, and we have not seen
anything yet. The vast bulk of the cuts in welfare are still to be
enforced and implemented upon our people. The noble Lord must recognise
that this leads to the parlous state which the economy is in. I hope
that he will recognise serious authorities, such as the chief economist
to the IMF, the chairman of the bank to which he had some connection,
who indicated that he thought that the Chancellor is on the wrong path,
or Boris Johnson, who takes a rather different view on the policies
that are being pursued at present. We are at a crossroads, and the
Government had better start making the right choice of route to follow,

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for the serial
welcome. It was very kind of noble Lords to recognise the extraordinary
work that went on to deliver the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the
summer. That was a big team effort. In fact, many of the team are
distributed around this Chamber. I appreciate all those kind words and
receive them on behalf of a magnificent national effort.</hs_para>

housekeeping points. My name is pronounced Deighton, as in height, if
you want the precedent for the English pronunciation, not as in weight.
Thank you for pointing that out. There was also a suggestion that it
would be useful to spend as much time as possible in the Treasury. The
arrangement with my right honourable friend the Chancellor is that I
should concentrate my time at the Treasury, which is why I will
be supported very closely by my noble friend Lord Newby in this
Chamber.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012984000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000173">I
found the debate highly stimulating. I will be able to do my job better
for having listened to all the contributions. I shall leave this debate
feeling hugely 
<?notus-xml column=1513?>positive, despite the many challenges that we face with our economy. I
propose to make my comments not speaker by speaker but rather
consistently against the most important themes in the debate. I shall
begin with a review of what I think we heard about fiscal
policy—the macroeconomic policy—and I shall then review
monetary policy. I shall then talk about reform of the financial sector
and finally I shall talk about the selection of things that we
discussed that might generally fall into supply-side reforms, including
all the discussion around infrastructure and capital projects. If I do
not manage to address everybody’s points, I shall certainly
write afterwards. I shall also try to focus my comments on what my
noble friend Lady Kramer called “doing and delivering”. I
think that is what I am here to do, so my focus will be on what we can
accomplish rather than on the more esoteric elements of economic
theory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000174">I
thought there was a lot that was agreed on. The way I have always
operated, particularly in business, is by finding the areas of
collaboration and forging ahead on them rather than labouring on the
areas of disagreement. However, with respect to fiscal policy, it
seemed to me that there was one fundamental disagreement between us, at
least in simple theory. I think it boiled down to a very simple
question. Should we inject more demand into the economy to boost
growth? It is a very fair question. It is quite extraordinary to me
that nearly 40 years later we are still arguing about Keynesian
economics, how effective monetary policy is and the size of the
multiplier. I think that was in the first week. It also convinces me
that I made the right choice not to be an academic economist. The
debate does not seem to have moved on in those 40
years—we are still talking about the same things—so I am
glad that I went out and did
something<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:17:07"></hs_TimeCode>, which
I was probably better at because that was not going to work.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012984000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000175">It all sounds very
easy—we should just go out and borrow more, spend it, and hey
presto everything is better. That feels an awful lot like the situation
we found ourselves in between 2008 and 2010 when we overborrowed and
overspent when the economy was right at the peak of its performance.
There has been a lot of discussion about confidence. When deficit
levels are at the levels they are, I do not think you reintroduce
confidence into the economy by going back on a spending spree. It just
does not make any sense to me. I have listened very carefully to what
everybody is describing as plan B. I do not think plan B is a plausible
alternative. How does it get financed? More borrowing. How does that
stack up against the bond markets and interest rates? We have saved
£33 billion by being able to borrow at lower rates than had been
originally projected because of our success in winning the confidence
of the markets. We do not want to lose that. It is absolutely
critical<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:18:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000176" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000176">It
is also not entirely clear to me that there is such an enormous
difference between us. We were unable to surface just how much extra
money the alternative strategy would involve borrowing and whether that
would make a huge difference. I was much more persuaded by the
argument, which I think matches the analysis in the independent OBR,
that the principal problem with demand has been external demand, 
<?notus-xml column=1514?>particularly the reduction in demand in the EU. The right strategy in
the long term, which is part of the supply-side solution—my
noble friend Lord Howell was very clear about that—is all the
work being done to switch our focus in markets to the rest of the
world— the so-called BRIC economies—where growth is
actually
occurring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:19:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

discussion around the capital budget and whether it had increased since
the original plans of the previous Government. I do not really want to
argue about too many statistics because we have had a lot thrown both
ways. Essentially the plan we have now is about £10 billion more
than the previous Government’s original
plan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:20:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

made by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, about when the money is being
spent but we have to understand that capital spending and
infrastructure spending are not, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said,
a tap you turn on and off. There are long lead times. There are even
longer lead times if you want to do this properly. A lot of this
capital spending is not a panacea to solve a very short-term problem.
In fact, thinking of it that way could create all sorts of difficulties
and much more focus should be on ensuring that the projects that are
mid-way through their gestation are now delivered into the economy in
the right way. They are the ones that are going to have the immediate
impact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:21:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lamont mentioned his concern about inflation. That was certainly one of
the problems in 2011. The rise in commodity prices pushed our own
inflation rate up, I think, above 5%. That had a significant impact on
the cost of living. However, all the forecasters are looking at
inflation stabilising over 2013-14 down towards the Bank of
England’s target

external agencies as supporters of our own cases. One side can produce
the economists—the IMF. The other side can produce the chief
executive. I could give a quote from the OECD that this is the right
plan and we should stick to fiscal stability. We are all capable of
producing people to support either argument. It just is not possible to
bless your own strategy with the utterings of an external
economist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:22:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Desai, gave a very eloquent exposition of the long-term issues
underlying the problems in the economy. I am not going to repeat that.
I do not think that anybody particularly disagreed with much of it.
However, I have a growth mentality and one of the things that attracted
me to join this Government was that the Prime Minister and the
Chancellor were very clear in their mandate to me. They said,
“We need to deliver growth in this economy. We will support you
to get that done in whichever way you can”. They convinced me
that they were as committed to performance excellence as any of the
other high performing organisations I have worked in. That is really
what got me interested in doing this job. I was also very interested in
the noble Lord’s comments on welfare. An absolutely key
criterion in any of this has to be fairness. We can all argue about
marginal decisions but I assure noble Lords that in my work at the
Treasury the distribution effects of what we do are absolutely at the
top of the criteria for assessing which measures we
take<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:23:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

had a very interesting discussion about the impact of quantitative

its current efficacy but I think we are all interested in what the new

extremely cautious before we suggest that ditching the inflation target
is the obvious alternative thing to do. That is far from clear and is
certainly not the Treasury’s
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:24:51"></hs_TimeCode>. In

Deighton:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for reminding me about
unwinding quantitative easing. In summary, the central scenario
predicted by the OBR is that it is expected to make a profit over its
lifetime as the scheme is wound down but, as always with these things,
that depends on a number of assumptions about the future yield curve,
the exit, the pace of that exit, bank rate policy at the time and, of
course, any changes to the size. However, those are the variables that
go into that

think that all those who spoke about banking reform agreed that it was
important to develop financing, particularly for smaller businesses,

the broader question of structural and regulatory reform, I could not
agree more with the comments of a number of my noble friends that
although it is absolutely critical to ensure that we have more
resilience in the banking system so that the same mistakes are not made
again, we have to be extraordinarily careful—I think the timing
of the introduction of some of the measures reflects that—that
we do not overshoot and significantly damage the banking system which
exists to provide finance to the real economy. In my own mind, the real
issue with many of these institutions has less to do with capital or
liquidity rules and much more to do with the culture of leadership and
management in those firms. We are beginning to see some promising signs
of improvement

forward the case that there should be more red tape, so we are all
heroes in terms of our desire to cut it out and to enable faster
planning permissions. As I think I mentioned in my opening speech, we
have already cut 1,500 pages of planning policy and have speeded up the
rate of approval of planning applications. My personal approach to this
will be to follow through some of our projects to see where there are
barriers and to use those as pilots for seeing where there are thematic

enhanced. If, in the short and medium terms, that has the extremely
attractive by-product of generating a significant number of jobs and
short-term growth, then that is a dream package. However, that is the

great topicality, given the cuts to arts budgets which are taking
place, both nationally and in many regions and localities. These are,
not surprisingly, the subject of widespread
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:34:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000199" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000199">First
of all, may I say what a pleasure it is that the Minister is replying
to this debate? I have not previously had the chance to congratulate
him publicly on his appointment but I now do so warmly. We have made
common cause in the past on agricultural issues, not least in our
concern for the survival of the red squirrel. Given that he will have
to defend the Government’s record in the area we are discussing,
I have a feeling that our former harmony might be temporarily
dissonant—but I very much hope that that will, indeed, be only
temporary. I am also delighted that my noble friend Lady Jones is on
the Front Bench for the Opposition, as I know how much she cares about
the issue being raised this

financial interests to declare but the register of interests does list
that I am president of the Northumbrian Pipers’ Society, an
important cultural organisation in the north-east which promotes the
playing and appreciation of our own regional musical instrument. I have
also for many years been a volunteer tourist guide for the great city
of Newcastle upon Tyne and, perhaps most relevantly to this debate, I
was also a Member of the other place representing Gateshead. The arts
and culture have been hugely significant in that town’s economic
regeneration but—through projects such as the “Angel of
the North”, the Baltic art gallery, the Sage music complex and
the award-winning Gateshead Millennium Bridge; this is not an
exhaustive list—the benefits have also been felt throughout the
whole of Tyneside, the north-east and the country. I feel hugely proud
of Gateshead Council and the 
<?notus-xml column=1518?>remarkable way that its members, many of whom come from a
traditional industrial background, grasped early on the cultural agenda
in the way that they did. I therefore take every opportunity to pay
tribute to them and the way that they worked in partnership with other
parts of the public and private sectors in the many projects that they
pursued.</hs_para>

given Gateshead’s record, it is frustrating that in the
important Newcastle-Gateshead partnership of recent years,
Gateshead’s achievements are often ascribed to Newcastle by
those who do not come from the area. I am sure that the noble Lord,
Lord Shipley, as a former leader of Newcastle City Council, will
understand my frustration, while none the less recognising, as we both
do, how important the Gateshead-Newcastle partnership has been in
recent years, and how it has promoted economic
regeneration..</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000202" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000202">The
wording of the Question for Short Debate speaks of the contribution of
the arts to regional and economic regeneration more generally in order
to bring in the wider national and UK dimensions to the subject. Many
of us believe that the arts, culture and the creative industries are a
crucial part of our national economy, and it is my contention this
evening, therefore, that supporting the arts and cultural projects
nationally and regionally has to be a vital part of our economic growth
strategy and policies for national economic
recovery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:37:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000203">In
documentation produced by the Arts Council, it is pointed out that our
creative economy, as a proportion of GDP, is the largest in the world.
Our cultural sector accounts for nearly 70,000 businesses and
contributes £28 billion each year to the UK economy. The
creative industries provide 1.5 million jobs and our arts and culture
attract millions of overseas tourists, helping to promote Britain as a
world hub of creative talent. However, if arts and culture are
important to our economy nationally, they are also vital to our regions
and localities and have played a crucial part in the economic successes
of many towns and cities in recent years. Examples that come to mind
include Liverpool, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol and east London.
Cultural projects and initiatives have also revitalised and reversed
the decline of some of our traditional seaside resorts such as
Folkestone and Margate, where the Turner Contemporary has attracted
approaching half a million visitors since it opened in 2011. In the
north-east, the Sage Gateshead has contributed £146 million to
the north-east economy since it opened and currently supports 660 or
more jobs. In 2011, the entries for the Turner Prize that were
exhibited in the Baltic art gallery attracted a record number of
visitors and had a positive economic effect. Overall, culture and the
arts have contributed to a dramatic growth in the tourist industry in
the north-east—a growth rate that has by far outperformed any
other sector and brought our tourism industry right into the economic
mainstream.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000204" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000204">There
is no doubt that arts and culture have made a great contribution
nationally and locally in recent years. However, there is now
considerable concern about the future arising from the
Government’s current approach. I, like my party, am concerned
that with the arts, as with the rest of the economy—as we have
been discussing this afternoon—the cuts are too deep and 
<?notus-xml column=1519?>too fast. To begin with, the Arts Council itself has had its budget cut
by 30% since 2010. While I applaud the Arts Council in its work and
recognise that, in implementing these reductions, it has sought to
protect the artistic front line—by which we mean support for
cultural projects and productions in some of the least well-off parts
of our country—none the less, cuts of the order demanded now and
for the future, on top of the economies already made, threaten the
front line in my view. This is a view that is shared by many in the
cultural sector both nationally and
regionally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000205" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0002.htm#13012984000205">My
noble friend Lord Beecham had a Written Question on arts funding which
was answered by the noble Viscount, Lord Younger, on 8 January, and I
would like to ask the Minister some questions about it. My noble friend
asked what proportion of central government funding for the arts in
2011-12 and 2012-13 was for capital funding, and what proportion was
for revenue funding. The Answer surprisingly began by saying that the
Government were unable to provide information on potential funding for
the arts across central government because they did not hold the
information centrally; it said that the information could be provided
only “at disproportionate cost”. This begs the question:
if central government spending plans are not held centrally, where are
they held? The Answer gave information about the reduction in Arts
Council funding and about DCMS funding in addition to Arts Council
funding. This showed that the additional funding was being reduced
overall from £2.198 million to £1.025 million and that
for this year, 2013, no capital funding was envisaged at all in that
part of the DCMS budget. Can the Minister explain
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:41:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T20:41:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

claimed that philanthropic giving might help fill the funding gap. The
Culture Secretary herself has expressed hopes that this might double
over the coming years. However, the figures that I have seen—and
I do not know whether the Minister can confirm them—which were
released in 2011, show a reduction in corporate giving of 11% and a
reduction in individual giving of 4%. Neither of these figures augurs
well for the future. Also on this question, I refer the Minister to
comments from Sir Nicholas Hytner, director of the National
Theatre, who, writing in the <I>Observer</I>, said that,</hs_para>

right—and he obviously speaks from great experience—then

the reductions in funding at national level are causing concern then
the situation is even worse at regional level. As we know, the local
government spending review was debated in your Lordships’ House
on 17 January. Considerable concern was expressed about the cuts that
local authorities were facing overall. The cuts—the result of
the squeeze in local government spending—have already been felt
in the arts and culture sector, but the likely effect of current and
future cuts are even worse. It is not that local authorities want to
cut back spending on arts and culture or that they think that such
money is unimportant, but they have their overriding responsibility to
continue providing 
<?notus-xml column=1520?>services such as social care and child protection, waste collection and

rapidly running out of time. I shall conclude by referring to the
coalition Government’s recent mid-term review. It is both
regrettable and astonishing that the creative industries and culture
and the arts have played so little a part in the review. In particular,
no goals seem to be set by the Government for arts and culture for the
next two years. Of the five commitments that are mentioned by DCMS in
the mid-term review document, not one of them mentions culture or the
arts. I wonder how the Government can explain

pay tribute to Arts Council England because it has managed its funding
cuts thoughtfully. Rightly, it demands excellence when it
allocates money and it is right to emphasise the interrelationship of
libraries, museums and cultural organisations. There is a crucial role
now for the Arts Council to ensure that its support is not
overconcentrated in London and is distributed across England to develop
greater equality of funding and thereby of access. A very small switch
in the proportions of Arts Council funding between London and the rest
of England could have a major impact on the viability of organisations
outside London.</hs_para>

importance of artist development programmes. I am impressed by the
potential here and cite as an example the record of
Generator—the leading music development agency in the UK set up
20 years ago with the aim of developing a more sustainable music

other fledgling agencies in policy and programme development,
governance and funding. It has managed to lever in £4 for every
£1 received from the Arts Council, which has enabled it to
support 
<?notus-xml column=1524?>new talent, help create 50 new businesses, assist 107 SMEs
and a further 173 new SMEs, as part of its business support programme

decade ago when I arrived in Yorkshire—in Wakefield—there
was much feverish talk of regeneration: a new hospital, new railway
stations, a new shopping centre at the heart of the city and a new art
gallery. There was the usual flood of scepticism, enhanced by a strong
dash of Yorkshire realism. Would any of this ever
happen?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000236" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0003.htm#13012984000236">The
most extreme reactions in all this were to the art gallery. Here, west
Yorkshire bluntness could find its ideal target: “We need a new

And so it went
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012984000237" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0003.htm#13012984000237">Now, 10
years on, all these regeneration projects are complete—even the
work on the railway stations has begun. We are amazingly fortunate to
have received all this, and in the midst of one of the deepest
recessions in modern history, as we have heard this afternoon. Most
amazing, however, is the Hepworth gallery. The largest new-build
gallery outside London for over a century, Sir David
Chipperfield’s building has received universal accolades. With a
target of 175,000 visitors for the first year, we achieved over half a

birth to the west Yorkshire sculpture triangle. That includes the Henry
Moore Institute in Leeds, and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and the
Hepworth in Wakefield. The sculpture park is a great triumph, unique in
England, and also a tribute to the passion and energy of Peter Murray,
its founder. The Hepworth has already hosted at least one

God, for which it was built, and an equally flexible venue for other
cultural purposes. The largest venue in the very heart of the city, the
cathedral will bring further economic benefits to the city and region

Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England. In so many of our cities,
cathedrals are responding to the needs of a changing society. In
Norwich, we embarked on providing new facilities, which have further

visit our cathedrals every year. In 2004, a report showed that English
cathedrals alone brought £150 million into the various local

there, of course. Cathedral music thrives here in this country as it
does nowhere else in the world. Furthermore, speak to so many of our
outstanding musicians, conductors, soloists and instrumentalists and

is one more essential by-product of arts and culture in regeneration.
This time it is not about finance and economics but, instead, about the
nurturing of our common humanity. One serious impact in our area of the
death of the coal industry has been a loss of sense of purpose in so
many communities. That undermines what I would call our corporate
self-esteem. The Hepworth and similar projects have begun to repair
this essential element in community life. Every one of us will know how
serious the loss of self-esteem 
<?notus-xml column=1526?>is for individuals, sometimes even to the extent of people
talking their own lives. It is no less serious corporately in

have tried not to drown noble Lords too much in statistics, but even
the few that I have quoted tell their own dramatic story. My message to
Her Majesty’s Government is that even a minimal increase in
funding for our cathedrals and their upkeep, for example, will yield a
bonus proportionately way beyond what any other investment can offer in
these tough times. So, too, with the arts. In Wakefield we
are grateful this year for Arts Council support for the Art House,
another unique institution in our city which works particularly with
the less well off, and sometimes the disabled, in the area of the arts
and the creative arts. Frank Matcham’s fine Theatre Royal has
also received

still all these institutions and agencies are up against it. Spending
on the arts and on culture is tiny proportionately to our national
spending and budgeting, but the benefits that it brings in
regeneration, economic development and, as I said, in terms of
corporate self-esteem exceed what any of us might expect. I ask the
Minister in his response to please be both realistic and generous in
supporting regeneration by this most imaginative
route.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_29_PT_1/AE23AE4AA516DB3AEE6830912CCAA8EA5A482D45" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 January 2013">Tuesday,

physical facility is one thing, but we also need people with vision and

but very few of them succeed in making art their full-time, primary
source of income. With a little help, many of them could do that and
work full-time at their art—not just in Pembrokeshire; I am sure

Lady Quin for initiating this debate, and for the characteristically

regional regeneration. She made a compelling case, drawn from her own

a time when our economy is stagnating, and business leaders vent their
frustration at the Government’s lack of a growth strategy,
investment in regional regeneration ought to be an obvious priority. It
makes sense in helping to tackle the growing disparity between rich and
poor, and between those in work and the unemployed, which holds back
our recovery. We know, for example, that since May 2010 the number of
long-term unemployed has risen by 60% across the UK as a
whole, but by 83% in Yorkshire and 123% in the north-east. Similar
disparities exist for youth unemployment. Meanwhile, figures for
individual and business insolvency also show disturbing patterns, with
the north suffering more than the national
average<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T21:20:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012991000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0003.htm#13012991000022">Unfortunately,
the current Government do not appear to have a coherent regional
strategy. They were all too quick to scrap the regional development
agencies when they came to power, but the local enterprise partnerships
put in their place have limited scope and have been widely criticised
for failing to distribute grants and loans effectively. Incidentally, I
would be interested to hear from the Minister what proportion of LEP
funds have been used to support the creative
industries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012991000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0003.htm#13012991000023">The

same criticisms equally apply to the Government’s arts policy.
The Government give every impression that, at the time of austerity,
culture is expendable. We take the opposite view. Culture is not a
fluffy add-on. Culture and tourism account for 7% of the UK economy,
providing more than 3.5 million jobs; with a spread throughout the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012991000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0003.htm#13012991000025">We believe
that this is a key part of growth strategy for our economic recovery,
as well as being the lifeblood of an innovative, diverse and civilised
society. The cultural sector should be at the heart of the regeneration

record of the previous Government is a testament to the development of
the UK as a world leader in creative talent. I point to initiatives
such as free access to national museums and galleries; investment in
regional theatres; the Renaissance in the Regions programme which
revitalised regional museums; and the Creative Partnerships that worked
with more than 1 million children around the

used the arts to drive their renaissance. These were cities such as
Liverpool, the European City of Culture, which generated
£800 million for the regional economy; Bradford,
where the National Media Museum created an extra 536 jobs;
the Birmingham Creative City initiative, which aims to create 100,000
jobs by 2020; and the Newcastle/Gateshead collaboration, which has
created 1,200 new jobs. As we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord

instead of building on these initiatives, under this Government
investment in regional and local culture has gone into sharp reverse.
They have been hit by a perfect storm of squeezed funding. As we have
heard, the Arts Council budget has already been cut by 30%, resulting
in 21% staff cuts and a halving of their regional sites. Numerous arts
organisations around the country have been forced to scale back their
activity. Meanwhile, the cuts of 33% in local authority grants are
squeezing local arts projects, with the LGA reporting that by 2020 up
to 90% of cultural budgets will disappear and that high-profile
councils such as Newcastle were already facing a 100% cut in their arts

of corporate giving, initiated by the previous Culture Secretary,
Jeremy Hunt. My noble friend Lady Quin referred to this. His idea was
that the shortfall would be filled by boosting philanthropy. In fact,
as we have heard, the contrary is the case. Figures released in 2011
have shown that corporate giving was down by 11% and individual giving
down by 4%. There is also a widespread view among arts leaders around
the UK that this strategy fundamentally misunderstands how philanthropy
works, and how little it is likely to benefit smaller arts
organisations outside London. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the
department’s current thinking on this.</hs_para>

debated on several occasions, the policy of Michael Gove, the Education

a

share the passion of the noble Lords, Lord Rogers and Lord Shipley, for
the importance of arts in education. However, for the future it seems
that these will not be the skills and attributes that the Government
expect to drive our economic recovery. If the Minister disagrees with
this analysis, perhaps he could explain what discussions have taken
place with Michael Gove to ensure that creative skills are put back in
the centre of the curriculum, where they belong.</hs_parafo>

the actions of the coalition so far, we can conclude that it does not
see investment in the arts and culture as a central plank of regional
regeneration. There has been little leadership on the issue from
Ministers, little investment in new regional and local arts initiatives
and no attempt to make it a statutory obligation for local authorities
to fund the arts. It is a sad indictment, and a depressing legacy for a
Government who took over at a time when the UK arts were renowned as
being world-leading. What will change in the future to rebuild the
confidence of the arts sector in the policies of the Government? What
positive symbols of change might we expect to see by 2015, and how does
the Minister expect the arts to generate the funding essential for them
to play their part in ensuring that regions and localities can thrive
again? I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to
say.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_29_PT_1/23D4A87F087E0E42C311F1387A4942BAA68F6B9E" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 January 2013">Tuesday,

culture in the wider economy cannot be overstated. The
Government’s priority is growth; heritage, the arts and tourism
are essential for this. Perhaps I may say straight away to the noble
Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, that the recent Cabinet meeting in
Leeds was precisely about regeneration and growth, for these activities
are a valuable asset for local and regional regeneration. Indeed, the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Wakefield particularly mentioned
regional regeneration; the recent Cabinet meeting was an indication of
that. The reception tonight of the Royal West of England Academy in
your Lordships’ House highlighted for me just how vibrant and
important the arts are in engaging in education, which my noble friend

champion of Yorkshire and of all that is going on there, including the

this was a phenomenal success. I say again to the noble Baroness, Lady

performances and events at over 1,200 venues across the United Kingdom.

Government’s policy on the future role of cultural projects and
the arts in regional and economic regeneration is delivered by bodies
that have the expertise and the regional presence to do so. These
bodies include the Arts Council England, English Heritage and the
Heritage Lottery Fund. In addition, VisitBritain aims to draw
international visitors to Britain, while VisitEngland encourages
domestic tourism. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Quin, that it is
not realistic for there to be cuts in all other areas of the public
sector and for the arts, alas, to be immune. But I am conscious of what
she and other noble Lords have said. DCMS Ministers are in discussion
with the Local Government Association about how local authorities are
approaching the pressures on existing budgets, and I acknowledge

Council has a strong regional presence and in turn is working closely
with local authorities on arts funding priorities. I know that many
councils recognise the important role that arts and culture have in

is responsible for allocating £2.9 billon of public and lottery
funding to arts and cultural bodies over this Parliament, and is
investing in capital projects, and supporting theatre, music, visual
arts, dance and libraries. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of
Whitchurch, that the Arts Council is investing in a creative people and
places programme over the next three years, and £37 million will

arts is
lowest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012991000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-0003.htm#13012991000041">In the

The priority of the Government is to encourage small and medium size
enterprises, and many of your Lordships referred to this, including my
noble friend Lord Shipley, the noble Lord, Lord Wigley, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch. The Arts Council is helping to
address problems that artistic and creative businesses can face in

will also give £55 million to arts and heritage bodies
up and down the country to build up endowments. Philanthropy all too
often passes unnoticed, yet it is integral to some of our finest arts

UK’s arts and cultural sector is, of course, essential to
domestic tourism, as well as to that from overseas. Our diverse and
magnificent cultural opportunities are a huge draw for visitors.
Between 2011 and 2015, VisitBritain aims to attract an extra 4.6
million overseas visitors and £2.3 billion in extra visitor
spend. I am proud to say that the top five UK visitor attractions in
2011 were national museums sponsored by DCMS which attracted 23 million
visitors. Many of these institutions take exhibitions across the
country. This year, Tate Modern is bringing the Turner Prize to
Derry/Londonderry as the UK City of Culture for 2013. Last week, the

dependent on these attractions. I shall refer to two examples: at the
National Railway Museum in Shildon, 79 jobs were created and
£3.6 million was contributed to the economy of the county of
Durham; and the Big Pit: National Coal Museum in South Wales offers a

to bring some focus to these provisions. This follows on from the
report of the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee’s 15th

was introduced in 2008 as the replacement for incapacity benefit. It
was designed to focus on what individuals could do rather than what
they could not, placing emphasis on their functional capabilities. This
was all part of the broad consensus concerning the importance of work
and of helping people move nearer to the labour market. The
introduction of ESA has not been without its challenges, although the
basic concept has been validated, but with periodic reviews bringing
improvements to the process. However, concerns remain about the process
and the role of Atos, so perhaps we can use this opportunity to get an
update on some of these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:31:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000004">Can
the Minister give us an update for last year on how many appeals are
entered against decisions, either to access the support group or to the
work-related activity group rather than JSA? What is the current rate
of success? I probe these points because the quantum of appeals on a
success rate is clearly indicative of how effectively the system is
making the judgments that it should. It is these judgments, made by DWP
decision-makers, which drive the conditionality in the regime and the
sanctions which flow from
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:32:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

consideration introduced from 3 December 2012 a new sanctions and
hardship regime. As the Explanatory Memorandum makes clear, the
rationale of the change is to align as far as possible the sanctions
regime with the equivalent category under universal credit. For those
claiming ESA, and in the work-related activity group, conditionality
involves attendance at a work-focused interview and undertaking
work-related activity. No conditionality of course applies to someone
in the support group, but obviously greater conditionality applies to
somebody placed on JSA rather than in the
WRAG<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:33:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000006">These
new sanctions have an open-ended period which can be brought to an end
when the claimant meets a claimant condition followed by a period of 
<?notus-xml column=482?>one, two or four weeks, depending upon the number of prior sanctions.
The effective date of the sanctions to operate is to be brought forward
in comparison with current arrangements. In addition, the amount of the
sanction is to be increased; rather than 50% or 100% of the
work-related activity component, which is currently some £28,
the sanction will be 100% of the prescribed ESA amount, currently
£71. This will leave the individual with only £28 plus
any premiums to which they might be entitled.</hs_para>

accept that the regime should involve conditionality and that this

draconian and unacceptable. Our concerns are about not only the huge
reduction of income that it entails but the risks of the system for
vulnerable people. There is provision for hardship payments; we can ask
about any differences between the regime which is being introduced by

Explanatory Note to the regulations says that in determining whether
hardship payments are appropriate, a decision-maker will take the
following matters into account: whether a member of the family
satisfies the requirements for a disability premium or an element of
child tax credit in respect of a disabled child or young person; the
household’s likely resources without hardship payments,
including whether the claimant can seek assistance from others, such as
family and friends; the difference between the claimant’s likely
resources and the amount of a hardship payment which can be made; the
difference between the claimant’s likely resources and the
amount of a hardship payment which could be made; the risk that the
claimant’s household will not have access to essential items
such as food, clothing or heating, or will have access to such
essential items at considerably reduced levels without a hardship
payment; and the length of time that these factors will
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000009">To
what extent does that description differ from the detail of the current
regime? I am particularly interested in the suggestion that people have
to go outside the household, not only to family but to friends, and
that resources that friends may have are taken into account in whether
or not the hardship payment is made. We need to know particularly about
the protections built in to this whole regime. As we have discussed on
many occasions, individuals in the WRAG, even if properly judged to be
capable of work-related activity, could suffer from a wide range of
conditions. There are concerns in particular about those with a mental
health condition, with fluctuating conditions, indeed with hidden
conditions. It was the prior intent that nobody with a mental health
condition would be sanctioned without a face-to-face visit. Is this
still the
case?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000010">Can the
Minister say something about the process attached to these sanctions
and the extent to which it differs from that attaching to JSA? Are the
good cause rules identical to the current ones? My understanding is
that the following still apply as constituting good cause: if there is
any misunderstanding on a person’s part because of learning,
literacy or language difficulties, or misleading information given by
the benefit authority;  
<?notus-xml column=483?>attending a doctor or dentist’s appointment; difficulties with
transport where no reasonable alternative was available; the practise
of a religion that prevented attendance at a set time; attending a job
interview; the need to work in a business if you are trying to become
self-employed; if you or a person for whom you were caring had an
accident, illness or relapse; attending the funeral of a close friend;
a disability that makes attendance impracticable; and any other
relevant data. Are those the rules that still apply? I want
confirmation of the extent to which they differ, if at all, from those
applying currently.

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, for his Motion to Take Note, and for giving us the
opportunity to discuss these new regulations. Standing back a bit, I
think it is worth saying from the start that there is a widespread
consensus that the welfare system in this country is in need of a great
deal of change. Clearly some of that change is in the structural area,
where we are bringing in universal credit, while some changes address
the cost of welfare and the fact that the bill for welfare is
unaffordable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000013">Under
the heading of structural change, and building on what the previous
Government did and on what the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, referred to,
we are putting the emphasis on helping people get back into work, and
into making sure that those who are able to work and those who have
been diagnosed as being unable to work but who may be able to return to
work at some point in the future, have the support that they need in
order to return to the workforce. That is what people want. When they
are on benefits and find themselves in the very difficult situation of
being out of work, particularly at the end of a long illness, they want
to know that there is an opportunity for them, as there is for all of
us. We proposed the tighter sanctions regime because we place so much
importance on the requirements to help people back into
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:41:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000014">As
the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, said, these regulations came into force
on 3 December last year. They provide for a more effective and
proportionate ESA sanctions system, but they also preserve the
important safeguards and clarity that are required to ensure a fair and
balanced system. The regulations make no change to the assessment of
who is eligible for ESA or to the requirements placed on ESA claimants.
They form part of the wider package of reforms that move the employment
and support allowance and jobseeker’s allowance sanctions
systems substantially closer to that intended for universal credit,
helping staff and claimants to prepare for the new benefit.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=484?><hs_para UID="13012956000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000015">ESA is designed to place
greater emphasis on what the claimant can do, and on the importance and
benefits of moving towards work. I will be clear that we never ask ESA
claimants to apply for jobs—only to prepare for work if they are
able to do so, and to meet their Jobcentre Plus or other trained
advisers to discuss this. Most claimants value this support and meet
the requirements placed upon them. It is only fair to those who meet
the requirements that the sanctions system places due importance on
these obligations and provides incentives for all claimants to meet
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000016">I will
now set out how ESA works. Claimants in the work-related activity group
have been assessed as having a limited capability for work and are
required to attend work-focused interviews to meet a personal adviser
and discuss the support available to help them take steps towards
employment. Claimants placed in this group can also be required to
undertake work-related activity where this is appropriate in their
personal circumstances, such as attending a training course or updating
a CV. Whether these work-related activity requirements are imposed by a
Jobcentre Plus adviser or a work programme adviser, they must be
reasonable in the claimant’s circumstances and cannot include
requirements for the claimant to look for work or undergo any form of
medical
treatment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000017">If
claimants do not meet suitable work-related activity requirements and
work-focused interview requirements without good reason, a sanction can
and should be applied. This is not new. Sanctions have been a feature
of ESA since the benefit was launched in 2008. The regulations we are
discussing today did not change what the claimant is expected to do, or
who might be sanctioned. But until these regulations came into force,
the financial consequences of the sanction did not give sufficient
weight to the importance of the requirements they enforced. As the
Social Security Advisory Committee found, claimants do not always
realise that they have been sanctioned. If claimants are unaware that
they are losing benefit as a result of a sanction, there is little
incentive for
recompliance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000018">An
ESA award for single claimants who have been found to be capable of
work-related activity is made up of two elements: the work-related
activity component of £28.15 and the personal amount of
£71. Until December 2012, when these regulations came into
force, claimants who failed to attend a work-focused interview or to
undertake work-related activity without good reason received an
open-ended sanction that was lifted when they re-engaged. The effect of
the sanction was to reduce the work-related activity component of their
award—£28.15—by 50%, which meant that their award
of £99.15 a week would decrease by £14.17. After four
weeks of non-engagement, the sanction increased to a 100% reduction of
the work-related activity component, so claimants lost the full amount
of the £28 which was on top of the original
£71<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:49:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13012956000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000083">3.45

four weeks of failure without good reason, claimants who did not meet
requirements were still left with their personal amount of £71
in payment. Further, claimants who repeatedly missed requirements but
complied within a few days would face only limited 
<?notus-xml column=485?>consequences. If they complied within seven days—for example,
being six days late for an appointment—no sanction would be
applied at all.</hs_para>

closely with claimants to agree suitable requirements, need the tools
to help them emphasise the importance of what we ask claimants to do.
We do not want claimants to miss the requirement and receive a short,
small sanction; we want them to meet the requirement in the first
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000021">The new
sanctions system will therefore apply the sanction to the personal
amount, the £71. This will better reflect the importance of the
requirements that we place on claimants. Further, to ensure that there
is an impact also on claimants who are repeatedly late without good
reason in meeting requirements, we will apply fixed, escalating
sanctions of seven, 14 and 28 days once the requirement has
been met. This is fair to the vast majority of claimants who always
meet their reasonable requirements on time. They need to have
confidence that there are consequences for those who, unlike
themselves, do not act
responsibly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000022">We

It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:47:07"></hs_TimeCode> is important
to stress that we will preserve existing safeguards: claimants will be
sanctioned only if they do not have a good reason, or a good cause, for
failing to meet the requirement. The noble Lord asked whether the
definition of “good cause” would remain the same. I can
confirm to him that there is no difference in the process or the good
cause rules. Only decision-makers can decide to impose a sanction.
Before they do so, they must consider any “good cause”
reasons put forward by the claimant. The claimant also has five days to
respond to a failure-to-comply
notice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000024">Where
a claimant feels that the requirements placed on them are unreasonable,
they can request that the adviser or provider reconsider them. It is
worth making the point that, at the point when the requirements are
first decided by the adviser, they are agreed with the claimant. In
order for the requirements properly to be defined as reasonable, it is
right that they are discussed with the claimant and that the claimant
accepts that they are reasonable from the
start<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T15:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>. A DWP

to the questions. On the information that has been given to me, it is
noted that a full impact assessment has not been published for the

society organisations. I am surprised that this does not have some
impact on civil society organisations. Many such organisations deal
with the people who are impacted by these changes. I would be glad of

response and for dealing with quite a lot of detailed questions. There
is not a difference between us on the importance of encouraging people
into work and the difference that that can make to their lives as well
as to the economy of our country. The key issue around these particular
regulations is how these things operate for a range of people who might
have a mental health condition, autism, learning disabilities or
fluctuating conditions—a whole range of
circumstances—where the approach needs to be particularly
sensitive, particularly knowledgeable and sometimes very specific, if
not individual. I do not think I got the flavour of that from the

statistics for the appeal success rate, which I thought was going to be
declining, are worrying because they seem to suggest that the process
under way for people in the WRAG or support group, or left on JSA, is
still not working as well as and effectively as it should be. It has a
chequered history. I think the approach is right—indeed we
legislated for that approach—but how it works, and is working,
in practice, particularly with Atos, remains a cause for concern. That
point is not unrelated to these regulations—it is germane to the
starting point, so I have residual concerns about that. Helping people
understand their obligations under the system to take advantage of
facilities, work-focused interviews and work-related activity, is fine.
However, a sanction of £71 a week to concentrate the mind is,
frankly, outrageous. For us, it is totally

the past 12 months, there have been sanctions for people on ESA, and

the heart of the resources that the DWP will need to address this
regime. I would be very grateful if the noble Baroness, in the fullness
of time, could follow up on that. The noble Lord, Lord Wigley, made a
very pertinent point about the impact assessment and the impact on
civil society. Perhaps the noble Baroness will share her answer on that

Secretary of State usually commissioned work on medical matters
relating to specific conditions or illnesses. For example, the board
undertook a study of cases where the highest rates of benefit had been
awarded under special provisions for people who were terminally ill and
not expected to live beyond six months, yet a number of such awards had
been in payment for more than seven years. The board was supportive of
the fact that special rules exist and should continue to exist but
nevertheless it recommended that such cases should be reviewed after
three years.</hs_parafo>

provided some excellent advice in its time. However, the defined scope
and membership of the board means that there is a limit to the type of
advice it can provide. In fact, the last time the board was
commissioned to do any work was in 2008, two years before the end of
the previous Government. Since coming into government, we have found
that using time-limited, tailored advisory groups and targeted
professional advice—as we did with the Harrington reviews of the
work capability assessment—is better than the prescriptive
approach of a standing board.</hs_para>

will start with our decision not to consult on the proposal to close
the board. The Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee accepted the
department’s explanation of why there was no legal obligation
for us to consult but it did not consider this to be in keeping with
the spirit of the consultation requirements. I should restate that the
board was not outward facing and did not have free rein to examine the
policy, operation or administration of DLA, being able to respond only
to concerns expressed by the Secretary of State. In our view, to offer
a consultation to groups with no ability to influence the work of the
board would not be in the spirit of meaningful consultation.</hs_para>

organisations have shown little interest in the board over the years.
Back in 2007 when it was reviewed as part of the normal process of
reviewing non-departmental public bodies, more than 100 organisations
of and for disabled people were contacted, but only 11 responded. Out
of those, three reported that they could not spare the time to comment
and the remainder had little to say about the functions of the
board.</hs_para>

the design of the personal independence payment, which as noble Lords
know will replace disability living allowance, we undertook three
consultation exercises. I acknowledge absolutely that no specific
questions were asked about the board during those consultations, but
the respondents had the opportunity to raise anything they wanted to
about the reform of DLA. We received more than 5,500 responses, and
again not one of them mentioned the board. We also discussed the board
in both Houses during the passage of the Public Bodies Act, and the
department has not received any correspondence or parliamentary
Questions on the subject. There have been several meetings between 
<?notus-xml column=490?>disability organisations and Ministers and officials, and again the
future of the board has never been an
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:06:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the issue of efficiency and effectiveness, which is another one of the
tests under the Public Bodies Act. The department has an existing
medical policy team covering a wide range of policy areas who can
provide medical opinion or who can commission work by others, if
needed. This is a more flexible resource than that provided by a
standing board. The team also produces guidance for operational staff,
advice on operational issues and audits the quality of outsourced
medical advice. It is our view that short-life working groups can be
set up quickly when work is needed, which is more efficient and
effective than retaining a standing collection of eminent people whose
expertise is not necessarily being put to good use consistently. For
instance, during the development of PIP, we set up a group to help
develop the assessment criteria. The group encompassed a wide range of
expertise across health, social care and disability, including from
occupational therapy, social work and a representative from Disability
Rights UK. Very importantly, we also sought the views of user-led
organisations and disabled people themselves through our implementation
stakeholder forum. This group involves more than 60 user-led,
grass-roots and national organisations working with us to get the
design and delivery arrangements right.</hs_para>

maintaining the status quo for the board places a burden on the
department because the regulations require that the membership contains
specifically qualified personnel. Therefore, if a member leaves the
board either by choice or because their tenure has ended, the
department is required to recruit even though there may be no actual
work to do. The recruitment process is expensive, resource intensive
and, in my view, verges on being disrespectful to those people who
apply for the post. We consider that using time-limited groups is more
effective than maintaining a standing body. We continue to use the
expertise of other disability groups, and our recently launched
Disability Action Alliance has convened a wide range of disabled people
and their organisations who will work alongside the department to
deliver results in a less prescriptive
manner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:08:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the test of economy. As the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee
acknowledges, it is cheaper to run one NDPB rather than two, while
Equality 2025 is a body representing disabled people that helps the
Government to understand their needs and wishes. It has been in
existence since 2006 and there have been no additional costs to that
body since the DLA board has not been used. In addition, I can assure
noble Lords that the medical policy team has absorbed some of the work
previously undertaken by the board at no extra cost. Commissioning
independent advice on an ad hoc basis is more economical than
commissioning it from board members because they were paid fees for
attending meetings and for contributing to reports, whereas the
individuals and organisations who advised the department on the
development of the PIP assessment did not receive a fee.</hs_para>

Department of Work and Pensions considers that the use of time-limited
groups will increase accountability. The scrutiny committee is of the
opinion that accountability remains the same, as the Minister will
commission time-limited groups, much in the same way as the board could
meet only at the Minister’s direct request; it disagrees with
our view that accountability will be enhanced. However, the
board’s composition was laid down in statute. It is required to
have members with professional knowledge or experience of
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, social work, nursing people with
disabilities and medical practice, as well as six or more members who
are themselves disabled and at least one carer. Now we can target
individuals with the specialist knowledge that we require. For
instance, if the department wants up-to-date information on people with
mental health conditions, it can specifically target mental health
professionals who may be better placed to provide that
advice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000054">In
addition, the board could report only to Ministers and only at their
request. Time-limited groups have the flexibility to engage with and
report to a range of parties. For example, in his independent reviews
of the work capability assessment, Professor Harrington took evidence
from hundreds of organisations and individuals and ultimately presented
his report to
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000055">On
safeguards, I do not consider that the abolition of the board will
remove any necessary protection or prevent any person continuing to
exercise any right of freedom. I say that because, as I have already
mentioned, there is a range of ways in which Ministers receive and seek
advice, and consult. There have been scores of stakeholders meetings
with Ministers and officials. These will clearly continue.</hs_para>

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness
for her introduction to this order which, as has been described,
abolishes the DLA advisory board. I join the noble Baroness in paying
tribute to those who have served on the board over the years and all
the work that they have done. We acknowledge the extensive consultation
that has taken place on the creation of PIP. The extent to which it was
always spot on is something we will have the chance to discuss when we
discuss the regulations quite shortly. However, we acknowledge that
that has been an extensive

of the board being abolished when we considered it during the passage

4.6 of the Explanatory Memorandum makes it clear that the board

DWP is better suited to the in-house team of medical advisers? Can we
have an update on the size of that in-house team and the range of
skills which it encompasses? Paragraph 7.2 of the Explanatory Note
refers to “a larger resource”, but how does the range of
skills match that which is available to the board? The Minister ranged

8.1 of the note refers to the consultation outcome and identifies that,
apart from the board members, the only person to be consulted on this
exercise is the Secretary of State, as he is the only recipient of
advice. I am bound to say that that is thin justification. It is not
the reality that the Secretary of State receives whatever advice the
board offers, keeps it to himself and beavers away night and day to
make that available for the benefit of the department and its clients.
The Secretary of State is nominally the recipient of that advice, but
it does not work like that in the department. As the Minister will well
know, and as the officials know, the information goes to other
Ministers and officials, so to use that argument as a pretext for the
Secretary of State being the only person to be consulted, frankly, is a
bit thin. I accept the formal position whereby the advice goes to the
Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State is the only person who
can commission it, but that does not excuse there not being a wider
consultation on that

board expressed its concerns about independent scrutiny of the

Equality 2025? I think that it has eight members with specific remits
anyway. To what extent is that a full alternative to the
independent scrutiny that comes from the board, or has in the past? The
board had the capacity to consider on a multidisciplinary
basis as an independent body. I ask again why the board could not serve
as an ad hoc committee with those skills. The board is, or was,
flexible, so it could take up these tasks when

consultation, the Minister will be aware of the criticism in the
Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee’s report concerning the
consultation process, or rather the lack of it, and the importance of a
proper process. The criticism that the department has not complied with
the spirit of the law is particularly damning. As the committee points
out, there are a number of easily identifiable representative groups
and charities—those which were displaying an active interest in
the move from DLA to PIP—which could have been consulted, even
more so given the highlighted interest around disability benefits in
general and the abolition of DLA and its transition to PIP. Just to
make clear what is on the record, paragraph 19
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13012956000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000077">“While
the Committee concludes that the Minister's supplementary evidence
appears to explain sufficiently why DWP considered there was no legal
obligation to consult under section 10(1)(b) of the Public Bodies Act,
we do not consider the Minister's approach is necessarily in keeping
with the spirit of the consultation requirement. In our view, it would
have been better to conduct a small, low key consultation targeted at
bodies who might reasonably be identified as having an interest (if not
a substantial interest) in the operation of Disability Living Allowance
to substantiate the Minister’s view that the abolition of the
Board will not be detrimental. We attach some significance to the
decision by Parliament to include consultation requirements on the face
of the Act, rather than relying on the Government’s general
approach to consultation. The House may wish to explore this point
further in
debate”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13012956000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000076">That

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I will start by responding
to the question the noble Lord asked about why the DLA advisory board
could not become what is commonly described as a “task and
finish group”. The noble Lord may not have noticed, but I
resisted using that phrase in my opening speech because until I had my
briefing for this debate I had never come across it—so I asked
the officials to remove it. I will answer some of the noble
Lord’s other specific questions in a moment.</hs_para>

DLA advisory board could become a task and finish group, but it is set
up in statutory terms, which specifically lay out what it exists to do
and how it can operate. Instead, we are introducing a regime that is
much more flexible and allows us, quite rightly, to draw on the
expertise that we need for our work, but to do so in a way that we
believe will work better. Indeed, there were current members of the DLA
advisory board on a group that was put together to advise us on
something recently. It is not that we do not want that expertise; we
want to be able to use it in a way that is much more flexible and
responsive to immediate
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000070">The
noble Lord asked what assessment we had made of the PIP assessment
development group and the in-house medical policy team, and how they
compared with the DLA advisory board in terms of resources and
expertise. The department’s medical policy team consists of six
officials, all of whom are qualified doctors. The medical policy team
has taken on some of the work previously done by the advisory
board—for example, producing guidance on medical
conditions.</hs_para>

requires advice from a wider range of professionals, this can be
commissioned, as was the case for the development of the PIP
assessment. Some of the DLA advisory board members were in that group,
as I have said. The group includes people from Equality 2025—Liz
Sayce of what was originally Radar and is now part of Disability Rights
UK; Professor Tom Sensky, a psychiatrist; Itai Chikomo, a community
psychiatric nurse; and Hugh Constant, a social worker—so a whole
range of different areas of expertise is
covered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000072">The
noble Lord asked who will now advise on attendance allowance and how
that would be dealt with. I can confirm that the medical policy
advisers in the department are responsible for that and that they will
use what he has calls “task and finish” and I call
“time-limited” groups, where that specific expertise is
needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012956000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012956000073">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:25:40"></hs_TimeCode>
covered the more general point about consultation in quite some detail
in my opening remarks and acknowledge the criticism in the scrutiny
committee’s report. However, as I said previously, the board did
not attract much comment on how it was operating when we gave that
opportunity to a large number of groups. Most importantly, it was not a
question of not consulting disability groups because we did not want to
hear what they have to say but that the board exists for a specific
function, as I have already described, and it would seem almost
insulting to consult disability groups about a board over which they
have no influence in terms of how it did its work. There was no
intention to prevent consultation because we did not want to hear what
people wanted to say. We felt that the way in which we were carrying
out our general process of consulting on the policies that we were
developing was very extensive and that people had the opportunity to
influence the design and development of those policies. I take on board
the point that he made but would only say again that this is a board
that had not met since 2008—so had not met under the last two
years of the previous Government, not just during this Government. I am
convinced that, in its place, we are putting 
<?notus-xml column=495?>arrangements which will ensure that we have the right expertise and
advice coming to us as we develop policy and that we are consulting
widely as we roll out that policy and taking on board the responses and
the feedback that we

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, the draft National Health Service
(Clinical Commissioning Groups—Disapplication of Responsibility)
Regulations 2012 set out the persons for whom a CCG will not be
responsible, where it otherwise would be. We are here to discuss them
today because the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
recommended that they be subject to the affirmative procedure. The
committee advised that the power being exercised to make the
regulations, Section 3(1D) of the National Health Service Act 2006,
relates to a fundamental provision of the new commissioning
arrangements. In theory it could be exercised in such a way that some
groups of people were left without a body responsible for commissioning
their healthcare services. But I hope to be able to reassure noble
Lords that this has never been the policy intention, nor is it the
effect of these
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012970000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012970000002">It
may be helpful if I first explain these draft regulations in their
wider context. As with PCTs, each CCG will cover a geographical area
defined in their constitution, and the whole of England will be covered
by CCGs, with no overlap. Under Section 3(1A) of the National Health
Service Act 2006, CCGs will have continuity of commissioning
responsibility for all patients registered with a GP practice member of
the CCG, and anyone usually resident in the CCG area who is not
registered with a GP practice anywhere. They will be under a duty to
commission secondary care health services to meet the reasonable
requirements of the people they are responsible for, with the exception
of certain services commissioned directly by the NHS Commissioning
Board, and those public health services commissioned by local
authorities.</hs_para>

relating to the responsibilities of CCGs is made in the NHS
Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities
and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012. This includes imposing on CCGs
responsibility for every person in 
<?notus-xml column=496?>their area in relation to the provision of ambulance services or
accident and emergency services. That instrument also makes provision
about the services to be commissioned by the NHS Commissioning Board.
Taken together with this affirmative instrument, this will ensure that
the board and CCGs do not have overlapping responsibilities for
particular services or particular patients. There will be no gaps, and
a commissioner will not be able to dispose of a commissioning
obligation by moving the patient out of area.</hs_para>

emphasise that both sets of regulations concerning commissioning
responsibilities do not introduce any new policies, but apply the
existing principles of PCT responsibilities to CCGs, taking into
account, of course, some necessary differences to reflect the
responsibilities of the board and local
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012970000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012970000005">These
draft regulations for affirmative resolution prescribe, by way of
exception, categories of people and circumstances where CCGs will not
have the duty to commission services. I will briefly describe the
provisions set out in these regulations. Regulation 1 defines the terms
used throughout the regulations and sets out a coming into force date
of 1 April 2013.</hs_para>

explained that under Section 3 of the 2006 Act, CCGs will have
commissioning responsibility for all patients registered with a GP
practice member of the CCG, and anyone usually resident in the CCG area

categories of people for whom a CCG will otherwise be responsible,
there will be some for whom, and some circumstances under which, it is
appropriate that the responsibility will lie with another CCG or
another health body. These are set out in Regulation 2, which has the
following
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012970000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012970000007">People
registered with a GP in England, but who are usually resident in
Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland will not be the responsibility of

a person, normally the responsibility of one CCG, becomes the temporary
patient of another, the first CCG will not be responsible for them;
instead, under Regulation 2(2)(d) the patient temporarily becomes the
responsibility of the CCG where they access GP services. This is to
ensure that the patient can access any subsequent care he or she needs
while remaining a temporary patient; otherwise, there could be delays
in their receiving prompt treatment. The provision also ensures that
the receiving CCG has responsibility for commissioning services to meet
the needs of temporary patients—particularly important in CCG
areas with significant numbers of such patients, for example in areas
containing holiday
resorts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012970000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012970000009">Regulation
2(2)(e) provides that, if a person is provided with primary medical
services by a member of a CCG and these do not include essential
services within core hours, that CCG is not responsible for that
person. Instead, they would be the responsibility of 
<?notus-xml column=497?>the CCG, a member of which does provide those services, or, if not, the

institution. In such cases the responsible commissioner will either be
the board or another commissioning body such as the Home Office. Under

another CCG is wholly responsible under Regulation 4 and

another CCG or a local authority has placed a person in a CCG’s

other provisions in these regulations, this continues the current

Continuing Healthcare, whereby the responsibility remains with the
placing commissioner. However, in these cases the disapplication of
responsibility relates only to the services for which the other CCG is
responsible. For example, where a person receiving continuing
healthcare is placed outside a CCG’s area, the placing CCG would
be responsible for nursing care but not for secondary

there is the issue of consultation. Paragraph 18 of the standing rules
says that the board “must consult” persons specified,
including Healthwatch England. The noble Baroness will probably know
what is coming. She will know that, in a week or so, we are debating
the NHS bodies and local authorities partnership arrangements. This
relates to the issue of whether local Healthwatch organisations can
campaign. There has been some controversy. Healthwatch England has not
made any public comment on the regulations. Did it respond to them? If
so, why did it not publish its
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:55:21"></hs_TimeCode>? The

relates to the issue of commissioning and relevant bodies in paragraph
34. This concerns the duty of any relevant body in respect of the
funding of the commissioning of drugs and other treatments. The noble
Baroness will know that this can often be a controversial area. She
will also know that there is continuing concern about the local
accountability—or lack of it—of clinical commissioning
groups. They can, in accordance with the Act, make judgments about
whether a treatment will be available to local people. Will the
Minister consider amending the rules to make sure that when a member of
the public wishes to appeal against a decision of the commissioning
body, a panel must be convened to hear the appeal? I noted from
paragraph 23(3) of the standing rules, which relates to decisions about
continuing healthcare that are equally controversial, that panels must

are about to start work formally. In Birmingham, I have been very
impressed with the leadership of the two CCGs with which I am in
contact. However, nationally I do not think that the public have heard
very much about them. I do not get any sense that clinical
commissioning groups feel that they are accountable to the local
population when it comes to making commissioning decisions. If a CCG
turns down a request for a certain drug or treatment to be given to a

fourth question relates to paragraph 39, which covers the important
issue of patient choice. Can the Minister say anything about how that
choice is to be exercised? In particular, what information needs to be
given to any member of the public to make a choice, and who will be
available to offer advice to that patient? It is all very well talking
about patient choice, but we all know that that is very difficult to
exercise unless there is a mechanism by which a member of the public
can obtain help and advice in exercising
it.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:59:11"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13012972000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012972000017">My
final question relates to Schedule 5, which I am sure all noble Lords
have studied with great care. It relates to the panels that must be
established to review decisions about continuing healthcare. Schedule
5(1) disqualifies a number of persons from being a chair, CCG member or
social services authority member of a review panel, including a Member
of Parliament, a Member of the European Parliament and a member of the
London Assembly. Can the noble Baroness tell me why that is so? Why is
it deemed okay for Members of the House of Lords to serve on such a
panel while Members of Parliament may not? I would be grateful for a

and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for their consideration of what I have
presented. Perhaps I may clarify for the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that
the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended that
only the National Health Service (Clinical Commissioning
Groups—Disapplication of Responsibility) Regulations 2012 should
be subject to the affirmative procedure, and that is why they are
before us today. The NHS Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning
Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012 are
subject to the negative procedure, which is why they do not form part
of today’s debate. However, I sought to set out all the elements
so that noble Lords could see what we are looking at in
context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:01:08"></hs_TimeCode>. Noble
Lords may table Motions on negative regulations, should they wish to do
so, although I am happy to answer questions as far as I can. However,
it may be that in these other areas he may either wish to flag them up
in future or we will write comprehensively to answer any questions that
I have not responded to

Jolly asked about a major disaster in a CCG area. I want to assure her
that all NHS organisations are required to maintain preparedness to
respond safely and effectively to a full spectrum of significant
incidents and emergencies that could impact on health or patient care.
From April 2013, all NHS organisations will be required to contribute
to co-ordinated planning for emergency preparedness and service
resilience through their local health resilience partnerships. No doubt
she will also be pleased to note that the board has a duty under
Section 252A of the 2006 Act to take steps as it considers appropriate
for ensuring that each CCG is properly prepared for dealing with an
emergency, and funding is a matter for the

asked about the arbiter in terms of patients. As set out in the NHS
Commissioning Board’s guidance as to who pays, the underlying
principle is that there should be no gaps in responsibility, and
obviously she knows that. The NHS Commissioning Board expects that all
disputes would be resolved locally, ideally at the CCG level, but in
cases that cannot be resolved at that level, local area teams of the
NHS Commissioning Board should be consulted and should arbitrate where

about the mandate in terms of reporting on this and on inequalities. We
will of course be using a range of evidence in addition to the NHS
outcomes framework to assess the performance of the board and CCGs

other stakeholders for their feedback. As she will know, the first
mandate between the Government and the NHS Commissioning Board was
published in November. It states that the NHS Commissioning Board is

concerned about this order going through the House without me knowing
the answer. The key question here is whether, under these regulations,
CCGs are allowed to provide NHS services for persons normally resident
in Northern Ireland, including abortion services. It is a very
important question. I do not know when this order is going back to the
Chamber, but if it goes back tomorrow it does not give me very much

Jolly—I hope that I did—when she asked about where a
patient might come in terms of who is responsible. I would like to
emphasise what I said in my introductory remarks, that the default
position is that the 2006 Act applies, covering everybody. So a CCG
where the person’s GP is a member would be responsible for them,
and if they are not registered with a GP, it would be a CCG in which
the person usually resides. Perhaps I may emphasise, in relation to
temporary patients, that if a person is registered with a GP in England
but is not resident here, the Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish body
commissions secondary care, assuming the person is in one of those
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012978000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012978000005">I am
seeking answers to some of the other questions. The noble Lord, Lord
Hunt, flagged up the point about Healthwatch England, and I remember
very acutely giving the assurance that Healthwatch bodies could

terms of local accountability, the noble Lord wanted to know whether a
member of the public might be able to insist on an appeal if certain
treatments were turned down. CCGs will be under a statutory obligation
to arrange for provision of care to meet the reasonable requirements of
the people for whom they have responsibility. The CCG must work closely
with the local authority through the health and well-being board to
assess local needs and to develop a strategy to meet them which will
inform their commissioning plans. Where a CCG chooses not to commission
a  
<?notus-xml column=505?>service, as in the kind of instance the noble Lord is talking about, it
would have to be satisfied that it was not necessary to do so in order
to meet the reasonable requirements of its patient population. The CCG
will be under a duty to involve patients in the planning of their
commissioning arrangements. The noble Lord will be aware that not
everything is possible under the NHS and never has been, but obviously,
as before, it is important that all reasonable requirements are
provided for, and the CCGs, just like the PCTs, have that
responsibility.</hs_para>

relation to future donations and loans, the power will allow us to

far as this order is concerned, the reason for extending the current
regime on donations and loans is simple. The existing legislation
providing for confidentiality of donations and loans made since 1
November 2007 falls on 28 February. The Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland has considered carefully whether it would be appropriate to
allow the current arrangements to lapse. While there is a strong case
for increasing transparency about donations and loans to political
parties in Northern Ireland, she came to the conclusion that it is
right to extend the current regime for two reasons.</hs_para>

those who made donations or loans during the prescribed
period—that is, since 1 November 2007—would be revealed
if we were to let the provisions lapse without introducing primary
legislation to provide retrospective anonymity. The guidance given to
donors and lenders at the time they contributed did not make this clear
and it would be wrong to release their identities retrospectively when
they had a reasonable expectation at the time the donation or loan was
made that this would not be the case. We therefore need to introduce
primary legislation to provide for continuing anonymity for donations
and loans made since 1 November 2007 until it can be made clear to

the general threat level in Northern Ireland remains at
“severe”. As recent events have shown all too clearly,
there remain those who are willing to use violence against individuals
with whose political views they disagree. PSNI statistics show that
there has been no general reduction in the incidence of violence or
intimidation since this matter was last considered in 2010. Indeed, in
light of recent events in Belfast, it is highly likely that the overall
number of incidents will have increased. Any decision to publish the
personal details of donors and lenders will need to be made by the
Secretary of State taking into account up-to-date information about the
risk of intimidation of donors and lenders at any given
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012978000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012978000020">As I
have set out, I believe that there is room to increase the transparency
of the donations and loans regime without compromising the security of
individuals or businesses. However, this requires the introduction of
primary legislation to allow the donations and loans regime in Northern
Ireland to be amended in a way that creates future transparency while
protecting those who have made donations in the past. At present, the
regime does not allow for that flexibility. The Secretary of State is
only able to decide between maintaining and removing the current
regime.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012978000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012978000021">I am
sure we all agree that transparency and accountability in matters
relating to the financing of political parties are important to ensure
that fraud and corruption can be avoided. The publication of donations
and loans made to political parties supports democratic decision-making
by enabling the electorate to know how and by whom candidates and
elected officials are funded. However, we need to consider the security
of individuals and businesses in Northern Ireland, and to ensure that
we do not create a deterrent to political donations that damages the
ability of political parties to contest elections and unduly restricts
the choice available to
voters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:21:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012978000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012978000022">This
decision has not been taken lightly. We all wish that the situation in
Northern Ireland had improved sufficiently that the measure would not
be necessary. The Electoral Commission was consulted prior to the order
being laid. It confirmed that it was content with the proposal to
extend the prescribed period on the basis that forthcoming legislation
will address the question of protecting the identities of those who
have

transparency in electoral finance in Northern Ireland. The Government

essential. However, we believe that the transition to that system will

Lexden:</Member></B> My Lords, this order is plainly necessary, and I
thank my noble friend for explaining it so fully and clearly. As she
said, it would be entirely inappropriate to make changes that would
oblige the political parties of Northern Ireland to divulge to the
public at large full details of their donations and loans when the
state of politics in the Province is so unstable and the security
situation so
fraught<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>. In
today’s volatile circumstances, those Northern Ireland parties
that feel strongly that the identities of their donors and lenders
should continue to be protected must remain free to protect
them—certainly for the time being. I know that that remains the
view of the Ulster Unionist Party, which is the party to which I have
always felt closest during the 45 years in which I have taken a keen
interest in Ulster’s politics. This interest was sharpened in
the late 1970s when I worked as an adviser to Airey
Neave<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:24:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012978000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012978000026">At
the same time, unionist principle demands that as soon as possible the
same general arrangements for the disclosure of donations and loans
should apply throughout all parts of our country. That, rightly, is the
Government’s aim, as it was the aim of their predecessors.
Understandably, the independent and highly regarded Electoral
Commission, to which my noble friend rightly paid tribute, is pressing
for that aim to be accomplished as soon as possible. In 2010, a full
consultation exercise took place in the Province. Research carried out
by the commission last year suggested that only 7% of the public there
favour the retention of confidentiality, with nearly two-thirds
supporting disclosure and over 30% declaring themselves happy with
either<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:25:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
Nevertheless, I am sure that the Government are right to hasten
carefully and slowly in this matter. As in so many other areas,
decisive action needs to follow the emergence of widespread consensus
among the local parties in accordance with the principles of the
Belfast agreement. It does not exist at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:25:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

proceeding with patience and understanding, our Government are able to
move forward on the basis of consensus when this order expires at the
end of September next year. In the mean time, those Northern Ireland
parties that wish to 
<?notus-xml column=509?>publish information about their donations and loans, and have the
agreement of those involved, are of course at perfect liberty to do so.
Such steps may well help hasten the overall pace of
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:26:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

controversy naturally attaches to the question of retrospective
disclosure when this order is replaced by new legislation in due
course. The Electoral Commission, the advice of which is valued so
highly, is all for it, while retaining the confidentiality of
information that would enable individual donors and lenders in years
gone by to be identified. For my part, I am deeply sceptical about the
expediency of any retrospective disclosure. Would it not be best to
draw a line under earlier years and apply new rules of transparency and
disclosure from the point at which they are
introduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:26:52"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

taking part in this debate the last time we discussed this, probably in

McAvoy:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for her clear
and full explanation of the order. I think that it was appreciated by
everyone. The forthright contribution made by the noble Lord, Lord
Lexden, and the fascinating speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Lyell,
which took us down memory lane, did no harm to our discussions. I think
that everyone in this Room understands why the legislation was passed
in the first place, and while there is a desire for uniformity
throughout the United Kingdom, the kingdom is also flexible and
realistic enough to know when it has to bend, when it has to manoeuvre,
and when it has to bring forward different legislation for different
parts of the country. Unfortunately and tragically, this legislation
was necessary, and indeed most folk would deem that it is still
necessary. The Minister has mentioned the recent events which serve to
underline the fact that when it comes to measures like these in
Northern Ireland, the word to use must be “caution”. We
have to be very careful that we do not introduce any unintended
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:31:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the Official Opposition support the Government in their position
on this order. We hope, of course, that we can move as quickly as
possible to a situation of full transparency regarding these donations,
but nevertheless it is clear that that will have to be a gradual
process. As has been mentioned, the Electoral Commission is much
respected and the Opposition is practically foursquare with its views
on the order. We want to see it amended as soon as possible so that
voters can see how parties are funded, but as I mentioned earlier,
caution must come first. I also welcome the announcement about the
timing of the draft Bill to see how quickly it is envisaged that we can
move

draft Bill, I want to put one inquiry to the Minister today. Will that
Bill raise the issue of double-jobbing? I am not quite sure about all
the intricacies, but I have told to put the question and get a
response. As I say, we support the order and the retrospective
principle contained in it. It is only right that there should be
retrospection, apart from any information that would enable donors and
lenders to be identified. It has to be a mixture of innovation and
caution. In Northern Ireland matters, that is always the right thing to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:33:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

shows consistent support for the introduction of transparency into the
funding of political parties in Northern Ireland. The Electoral
Commission has informed me that the most recent survey, carried out in
December 2012, found that 62% of the respondents felt that information
about who donates to political parties should be made available to the
public. Some 7% said that it should remain confidential while 31% did
not mind either way. That sounds like a familiar figure. We need to
deal with this situation so that the Electoral Commission is not
legally bound to publish something. We would like to see a fully
transparent scheme, but surely we all understand why we are moving
slowly on it.</hs_para>

have said, the Official Opposition support what the Government are
doing here. Our Front Bench Members have discussed these matters

assurances announced by the Minister that very soon there will be moves
to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK in terms of
transparency around political donations. There needs to be a change,
but we acknowledge that there is no agreement between the political
parties in Northern Ireland about thresholds and the amount of
information to be made available on individuals, security matters and
other issues. However, they are not drawbacks or obstacles but
opportunities to further advance the situation in Northern Ireland so

those who have made donations or loans in the past without knowing that

is important to emphasise that the Electoral Commission does very
rigorous checks in Northern Ireland on donations and loans. Although
the general regulations on disclosure to the Electoral Commission are
the same as those in the rest of Britain—beyond the publication,
of course—the checks that the Electoral Commission does in
Northern Ireland are more rigorous

how quickly primary legislation can go through this House and the other

implemented. Responses to the Electoral Commission are made quarterly

the House on 19 December 2012. They form part of a package of statutory
instruments that will enable local authorities in Wales to enforce bus
lane and some moving traffic offences. Similar 
<?notus-xml column=513?>civil enforcement provisions under the Traffic Management Act are
already in force in Wales in respect of parking contraventions. The
package of legislation will enable enforcement in Wales to be carried
out by civil enforcement officers acting on behalf of local

way of some background, Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004
provides power to the “appropriate national authority” to
make regulations for the civil enforcement by local authorities of
parking and waiting restrictions, bus lanes and some moving traffic
offences. In Wales the appropriate national authority is Welsh
Ministers. The Act also confers powers on the Lord Chancellor to make
regulations dealing with the notification and enforcement of penalty
charges, representations to the enforcement authority, appeals to an
independent adjudicator by those on whom penalties are imposed, and the
appointment of adjudicators. Section 89 of the 2004 Act provides the
Lord Chancellor with express powers to make different provisions for
Wales.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012978000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012978000051">The

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My Lords, I have reassuringly good
news for the Minister: I think it unlikely that these regulations will
be contested. Clearly they are, as she said, part of a package of
representation and appeals procedures that appear to be eminently
sensible. Obviously, the regulations are not controversial. There is a
strong consensus in favour of the regulations in Wales. As the Minister
has said, they are part of a process of devolution, and of working
together at both London and Cardiff
levels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:56:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

agree with the Minister that the mischief aimed at is very clear. It is
the assessment of the Welsh Government that the heavy workload of the
police in Wales means that a relatively low priority is given to the
enforcement of the bus lane offences. Therefore, the case is made that
local authorities, which clearly have an interest in the enforcement of
these regulations if they so choose, are likely to lead to a more
speedy and effective enforcement process. Indeed, the process is likely
to encourage a greater use of buses. It is relevant and related to the
good work of the Assembly done over “park and ride”, for
example. It may well lead to a reduction in congestion, along with many
other measures in the urban
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:57:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to put this in context, bus lanes are by definition overwhelmingly
relevant to urban areas. However, we have just heard that the financial
support for buses and rural transport has been substantially reduced.
The Assembly has just announced that in the coming financial year,
2013-14, the sum available for rural transport and buses is
£25 million, whereas in the current year it is
£33 million. That is a more than 25% reduction and obviously has
implications not only for the increasing isolation of rural areas but
for the elderly and low-income groups within those areas. It has
relevance, too, to young people seeking
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:58:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

obviously have a few questions for the Minister. Looking at the process
which she has outlined, based on the 2004 Act, it is clearly highly
convoluted and lengthy. I would be grateful if she could indicate
whether she agrees with that, and what proposals she has for cutting
that down. One obvious conclusion is that the involvement of the
Ministry of Justice and the Lord Chancellor is really a fifth wheel to
the coach. This is a series of decisions which should properly be made
in and for Wales. There is no real contribution. Think of all the
forests in Finland which have been cut down and the time wasted at the
Westminster level for this type of regulation. I hope that the Minister
and the Wales Office will be considering how best one can streamline
these procedures. That, I am sure, would be much supported in
Wales.</hs_para>

question is about the nature of the consultation. This is set out on
pages 8 and 9 of the Explanatory Memorandum, which tells us that the
consultation was undertaken between November 2009 and February 2010,
which in itself begs the question, since the consultation was concluded
in February 2010, as to why on earth has there been such a lengthy
delay since that time. What have people been doing in the mean time in
respect of this following the end of the consultation process? We are

delayed it any more, so should the net not have been extended a little
wider? Should one not have looked for motorists’
representatives, including perhaps the motoring organisations in Wales?
The AA and RAC, for example, would surely have had an interest in the
question of bus lanes and would certainly have tried to represent the
interests of the motorists as opposed to the interests of local
authorities and the other worthy groups that have been consulted. Why
were the representatives of motoring organisations and of the motoring

I will build on the question posed so well by my noble friend Lord
Jones. I know that this will be relevant to the Welsh Assembly and will
depend on the take-up of local authorities and so on, but will local
authorities have an incentive to enforce the bus lanes? We are told
that it will be self-financing, so is the assumption—there must
be some working assumptions on this—that there will be more
employment in this area by local authorities at a time when, in other
sectors, they are cutting their employment? What are the expected
numbers and are we confident that it will in fact be self-financing? We
do not know exactly the number of officials who will be employed,
although local authorities surely have an incentive to expedite the
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012978000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012978000070">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:04:00"></hs_TimeCode>
comment I always make to local authority colleagues in Wales is about
the possibility of having local authorities in Wales co-operating for
certain functions, maybe on the old county level. I can see no reason
why, for example, in my own county of West Glamorgan, Neath Port Talbot
should not work with the City and County of Swansea, if the demand is
such. That would surely be in accordance with the broad policies of the
Government and should certainly help the Welsh council tax payer. I

perhaps on an old county basis, to work together to this

Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I will be brief. I am grateful to the
Minister for her considerate introduction to the regulations. However,
do we have no statistics whatever from 2010 or 2011 on the number of
immobilisations or appeals? Has the Welsh Local Government Association
made no representations to the Government or to the Welsh Assembly
Government? Is there an estimate of the amount of work that we are
passing to local government in Wales? Do we have any insight into what
the four constabularies have put on record about  
<?notus-xml column=518?>this change? It would be helpful for the Committee to know the scale of
the work that we are passing on. That seems to be a foundation

Gale:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for bringing these
important regulations before us today. We welcome them, as they are
what the Welsh Government have requested and have been working on for
some time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:08:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The
package gives powers to local authorities effectively to manage
traffic, which will help to reduce delays and tackle congestion. I am
aware that the Welsh Government have worked closely with local
authorities, the British Parking Association, the police, the UK
Government and their legal services in preparing the regulations, which
will complement and consolidate the powers that local authorities were
given on 31 March 2008 to take civil enforcement action against parking
contraventions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012978000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012978000079">It
is important to note that these powers will not stop the police from
taking action where necessary, although the main rationale for the
changes is that the police are not able to make the enforcement of bus
lanes and road traffic contraventions priorities for action. I can give
the example of Cardiff where there are bus lanes which, of course, only
buses should be using. However, Cardiff Council is unable to take
action against other vehicles using those lanes because they do not
have the enforcement powers to do so. The Welsh Government believe that
these regulations will help improve the punctuality and appeal of local
bus services because if the bus lanes are clear, the buses can get to
their destinations a lot more quickly. The Welsh Government think that
this will help to further the sustainability of bus services, which we
know are so important to many of our communities in
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:10:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Welsh Government’s economic and social objectives and is
consistent with their national transport plan which was published in
December 2011. However, it is important that these powers are used
appropriately and that the public can trust the decisions made by
enforcement officers. The enforcement of the bus lane and road traffic
contraventions will be based on evidence captured on camera and other
approved recording equipment and devices. Another set of regulations
will be brought forward to deal with those, as the Minister has
explained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:11:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are in discussions with the Vehicle Certification Agency on the terms
of the technical service agreement to certify on behalf of Welsh
Ministers that the cameras and associated equipment used to enforce
parking restrictions in bus lanes and certain road traffic
contraventions are fit for purpose. It is important that local
authorities are accountable for their decisions and that residents know
how the money raised from fines is used, a point made earlier by other
noble

terms of accountability, the local authorities using these powers will
be required to send copies of their income and expenditure accounts to
Welsh Ministers as part of an annual report about their enforcement
activities. This will highlight the impact on journey times along key
routes. It is also important that the appeal system and the independent
adjudicator are set up, which is what we are dealing with today.
The regulations specify the procedure for making 
<?notus-xml column=519?>representations and ensure that people given a penalty charge will be
able to see the evidence against them and are given the opportunity to
challenge it. For example, they may not have owned the vehicle at the
time the penalty was

of the consultation, the regulations stipulate that local authorities
must be responsible for handling representations themselves rather than
the responsibility being contracted out. That is to be welcomed as it
ensures that people will know that they can go directly to their
council, thus maintaining a direct and transparent link. It is planned
that the regulations will be backed up by statutory operational
guidance that will provide more detailed advice on the use of the new
powers. It is important that that guidance is well publicised. The
Welsh Government are planning to work closely with local authorities,
the British Parking Association and others to prepare the guidance,
which they plan to publish this

regulations that should make a difference to road travel in Wales,
especially in town centres and other busy areas. In supporting these
plans, I understand that the Welsh Government are anxious to go ahead
with implementation at the earliest opportunity. Can the Minister tell
us when the regulations will be put before the House of Commons, as I
understand that no date has as yet been fixed? Will she also agree to
use her influence to ensure that there are no further delays in order
to enable the Welsh Government and local authorities to move forward
quickly on the implementation of these regulations? In the mean time, I
thank the Minister for placing these regulations before us, and of
course we fully support
them.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_29_PT_1/98F92FAAB3747F56ECC23E02ADE42E6A8B0947F4" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 January 2013">Tuesday,

Randerson:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for their
contributions. I will preface my remarks and my attempts to answer all
the questions—of which there were many—with a key point
that I must stress. It is important to recognise that under the Traffic
Management Act, the decision to expand the civil enforcement regime in
Wales falls within the executive competence of Welsh Ministers. They
have concluded that they should now make use of their powers under the
Act in relation to bus lane and some moving traffic offences. That
decision having been made by Welsh Ministers, these regulations are
necessary to ensure that people upon whom civil penalties have been
imposed are able to appeal to an independent adjudicator if their
representations are rejected by a Welsh local authority. In other
words, we are here today—as several noble Lords pointed
out—to carry out the desires, wishes and policies of the Welsh
Government, but we are doing so within the framework of UK
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:16:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000002">The
noble Lord, Lord Anderson, called attention to the Welsh
Government’s view that the police give low priority to traffic
and bus lane offences because of their heavy workload. That is
undoubtedly the case. I recall the police saying to me on several
occasions when I was an elected representative that they did not have
the time or resources to pay attention to such issues. It was one of
the more frustrating parts of my role as an elected representative to
try to deal with the 
<?notus-xml column=520?>concerns of local residents about things that were very important to
them but which the police did not regard as a priority—for good,
logical reasons in the larger scheme of law enforcement. The noble Lord
referred to the fact that bus lanes are issues in urban areas. He
called attention to the reduction in financial support for bus routes
within Wales. I must point out that this is a budgetary decision
entirely of the Welsh
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:17:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000003">The
noble Lord rightly pointed out that this is a lengthy and complex
process. The intention is that all four instruments to which I referred
will be laid simultaneously, once Parliament has approved the
Civil Enforcement of Road Traffic Contraventions
(Representations and Appeals) (Wales) Regulations, and the Assembly has
approved the Civil Enforcement of Road Traffic Contraventions
(Representations and Appeals) Removed Vehicles (Wales) Regulations
2013. The general provisions of the regulations will come into force a
minimum of 21 days
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:18:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000004">The
process is complex because both the UK and Welsh Governments are
involved. Noble Lords expressed frustration about this, which I
understand. Perhaps I may gently point out that the Silk consultation
is ongoing, and if noble Lords wish to make representations on this
issue to the commission, that would be entirely in order in terms of
the work that it is
doing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:19:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000005">The
noble Lords, Lord Anderson and Lord Wigley, referred to the
considerable length of time since the consultation exercise was
concluded. The time lapse can be explained by further work which was
undertaken to develop the regulations with the adjudication service,
with the British Parking Association and with local authorities.
However, as noble Lords have said, this is a complex issue. We are
working here entirely to the timetable of the Welsh Government. This is
the Welsh Government’s policy. We are working with them to
implement that policy. I am sure that we would all wish that it is now
implemented as soon as
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:20:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

by the noble Lords, Lord Wigley and Lord Jones. These are, of course,
new enforcement powers which local authorities will be able to use.
Previous statistics do not fit these powers. The previous traffic
offence statistics which exist are supplied by the police. They are not
supplied on the same geographical basis. They are not, as far as I am
aware, broken down into individual offences—although I will
check that out and write to noble Lords if I am incorrect. Of course,
those statistics reflect a police service which has said that it does
not have the time to do this job as effectively as it would wish. Any
previous statistics are therefore of relatively little application to
the current
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:21:53"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, the police will continue to have the powers to do this, as they
have at the moment. We are looking at local authority enforcement, but

in existence on the enforcement activities of those authorities which
have civil enforcement of parking. In future, these annual reports will
include bus lane and moving traffic offences. Although the concern for
statistics is entirely correct, and although I am saying to noble Lords
that the current statistics are of limited use, in future the desire to
get more statistics will be fully satisfied. There will be annual

worked well in this case. The noble Lord, Lord Wigley, asked about the
estimated cost passed to the local authorities. There is no estimate of
the cost. The enforcement is not being entirely transferred to local
authorities, because, as I have already said, the police will

Randerson:</Member></B> That is the basis on which the provisions, in
terms of the parking regulations, have been applied. This is not an
entirely new scheme, in that this approach applies already in London,
so there is the example of London to be followed. But there is also the
example of how the parking enforcement has worked, and that has been
very successful. For example, in Cardiff it has been possible to apply
that self-financing approach very effectively. In the event of there
being a surplus generated by civil enforcement at the end of the year,
it must by law be spent on transport purposes. Those purposes are
listed within the regulations, so it is very tightly
controlled.</hs_para>

citizen of Cardiff. The noble Baroness, Lady Gale, gave a very good
example of Cardiff lacking the power to take action on bus lanes. I
remember the <I>South Wales Echo</I> featuring a heated debate as to
whether Cardiff Council should have the power to enforce parking
restrictions. It was probably one of the most heated local debates
within the Welsh capital city in many
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:30:56"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
important to remember that these issues may seem to us relatively
minor, but they are of considerable importance not only to local
residents but to bus companies, commuters and, of course, the
democratically elected councils that run our cities and towns and try

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the primary purpose of the
draft order is to enable the UK’s assay offices—that is,
the bodies which test and hallmark articles of precious metal—to
set up hallmarking operations in offshore locations. The Hallmarking
Act 
<?notus-xml column=523?>1973, which governs hallmarking in the UK, currently prohibits such
operations, limiting the striking of UK hallmarks by the assay offices
to within the territory of the UK.</hs_para>

makes it an offence, during the course of trade, to describe a
non-hallmarked article as being wholly or partly made of gold, silver,
platinum or palladium, or to supply, or offer to supply, it with such a
description attached. Section 2(4) of the Act defines a non-hallmarked
article as one which does not bear the “approved
hallmarks” and a sponsor’s mark. The definitions of
approved hallmarks in Section 2(1) include one to the effect
that approved hallmarks
are,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13012983000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000125">“marks
struck by an assay office in the United Kingdom, whether before or
after the commencement of this Act, under the law for the time being in
force”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13012983000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000023">This
imposes on the UK’s assay offices a geographical limitation,
preventing them striking UK hallmarks in overseas locations. It places
them at a serious competitive disadvantage to certain EEA competitors
whose law does not prevent their assay offices from operating
offshore.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012983000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000024">The
draft order is designed to remove this geographical limitation, thus
redressing the competitive imbalance by enabling the UK assay offices
to operate offshore, thereby helping to ensure their future viability
and, in the longer term, protecting UK jobs. A feature of the scheme to
permit offshore marking is that the British Hallmarking Council will
authorise offshore-struck marks, which will be clearly distinguishable
from the existing domestically struck marks. In order to make clear the
distinction between the two sets of marks, the council will also issue
guidance to the new offshore marks. This will help to introduce clarity
for consumers, retailers and the enforcement community alike.</hs_para>

of precious metal, and the hallmarking of such goods, has moved on. It
is now a global business in which vast amounts of high-volume, low-cost
jewellery are produced, mainly overseas. In order to capture this
market, some of our EEA competitors have been busy setting up
hallmarking operations within or in close proximity to
manufacturers’ premises. They are able to do so because their
national laws do not prohibit it. The advantages to both parties of
such an arrangement are obvious and it is equally clear that failure to
adapt to this changing market will pose an ever greater threat to the
existence of the UK assay offices.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012983000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000026">In addition to the main
change to the Act, two other changes effected by the draft order are
directly related to the broadening of the scope of the Act. The first
concerns the widening of the choice of marks for sponsors and
manufacturers, referred to in the Act as a “sponsor’s
mark”. These are unique marks which identify the person or
organisation submitting an item for hallmarking. Currently such marks
must include the initial letters of the name of the sponsor. As there
are only so many permutations of letters possible, these are beginning
to run out. The order will therefore remove this requirement, making it
easier for sponsors to register their marks. To ensure that some sort
of rationale applies to the extended range of marks that 
<?notus-xml column=524?>will become available, the British Hallmarking Council will be issuing
guidance on the limits that will apply to such marks.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012983000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000027">The
other change corrects an anomaly in the Hallmarking Act whereby
articles of silver, gold and platinum cannot be coated with platinum
without the written consent of an assay office. The change will permit
articles of silver, gold and platinum to be coated with platinum
without having to obtain such
consent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000028">Why
are these changes being made only now, given their obvious value to the
UK hallmarking fraternity? The answer is severalfold. The changes being
effected by this order represent the culmination of a lengthy journey.
It has its origins, in fact, in the previous Administration, which
began the process back in 2009 under the stewardship of the noble Lord,
Lord Drayson. The Government of the day had to ensure that the
legislative process they chose to pursue was the right one. As noble
Lords will appreciate, such a process takes time. In addition, it was
essential to secure the agreement of the British Hallmarking Council,
which supervises the activities of the UK assay offices and includes
assay office representatives, as to the detail of the approach to be
taken. By 2010 this had been achieved and the order process was set in
motion.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012983000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000029">In
the intervening period, the Government have necessarily focused on
making sure that the order is fit for purpose, which has involved
clearing a number of legislative and parliamentary processes designed
to do just that. The important issue is that the order that has been
forged from all these processes will achieve our original aim of
opening up new opportunities for the UK assay offices.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012983000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000030">In conclusion, a simple
accident of drafting has led the assay offices to the situation in
which they now find themselves. It is sobering to think that four words
in the original drafting of the Hallmarking Act—“in the
United Kingdom”—have led to this unfortunate situation.
Were it not for that, the assay offices would be competing on level
terms in overseas markets and we would not be having this debate
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000031">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:39:44"></hs_TimeCode>
UK hallmarking community has been the driving force in the case for
legislative change. The consultation also revealed strong support from
the trading standards community for the proposed changes. If the order
becomes law, it will provide invaluable support to the continuation of
hallmarking in the UK, which has centuries-old traditions. By so doing,
it will have the potential to protect UK jobs while helping to ensure
that the British public and retailers can continue to rely on a
domestic market offering jewellery and other similar articles of
precious metal bearing predominantly UK hallmarks. I commend the draft
order to the

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend for his careful and detailed explanation of the order, and I
thank the officials in his department for the very extensive
explanatory document they have provided. Before I go any further I have
to declare an interest. I am a liveryman of the Goldsmiths’
Company, but I should make it clear that I am not speaking for the
company; indeed it does not even know that I am going to make this
speech and I am not sure that it will much like what I am going to say

for the regulation. As my noble friend has made clear, this is about
removing the restrictions on hallmarking within assay offices in the UK
because they put those offices at a clear competitive disadvantage. The
explanatory document talks about Thailand, India and Holland, so I
quite understand that. I also understand, particularly when wearing my
hat as a goldsmith, the extensive and high reputation of the UK assay
offices; indeed, the word “hallmark” has a much wider use
in the English language than merely being applied to the issue of
jewellery made of silver, platinum and so on. It has become a word used
to denote quality everywhere. So far, so good, but I want to probe a
couple of
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:42:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

people with different objectives as far as this regulation is
concerned. The assay offices wish to increase the hallmarking model and
they do not much care who does it, while UK jewellery manufacturers are
anxious to build and develop their trade and who, by having an
absolutely clear and unequivocal UK hallmarking standard, may have some
competitive advantage. Because it is not tackled very clearly in the
explanatory document, I would like the Minister’s reassurance
that we are not in danger of hollowing out the UK industry in our
efforts to protect the position of the assay
offices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:43:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is surely true because elsewhere in the document it says that 35% of
the jobs are going to be lost, or at least that is one of the
estimates. Further on, paragraph 12 states:</hs_parafo>

therefore rejects the notion that no benefit will accrue to the UK as a
result of the proposed changes to the Hallmarking Act. The unanimous
expression of support for change by both the BHC and Assay Offices is a
reflection of the fact that the demand for change emanated in the first
place from within the hallmarking community”.</hs_quote>

because it is looking for ways to boost its trade. It is not going to
say anything other than just, “Right on, Government”. We
need to be careful that we do not, by advancing the position of the
assay offices, remove the competitive advantage from our manufacturing
industry—an important
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:44:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

potential loss of quality and reputation. This is going to be an
interplay between individual assay offices, the British Hallmarking
Council and the international hallmarking convention. It would be
helpful if my noble friend could say a little about this when he winds
up the debate. The British Hallmarking Council is made up, I hope, of
representatives from the assay offices; I think I heard the Minister
say that. Is there a third party? Are representatives of manufacturers
and others involved in this industry part of the hallmarking council? I
ask because there must surely be a danger of some regulatory capture if
only the assay officers are represented on the Hallmarking Council. In
turn, how does it relate to the international hallmarking convention,
which obviously only some countries belong to, because it is referred
to in the explanatory document?</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=526?><hs_time UID="13012983000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000134">6.45

recognise that it is planned that offshore hallmarking by UK assay
officers will result in a different hallmark compared to that within
the UK. I think that is a commitment, and take it as such, although I
have to say that a hallmark is jolly small when you look at it, and it
will not be easy to tell what has been hallmarked in the UK by a UK
assay officer and what has been hallmarked overseas by that same
office<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:45:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:48:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I am concerned that this could be the first step in a race to
the bottom. The offshore branches of UK assay offices set up under
these regulations devalue the reputation of UK hallmarking. This
undermines the reputation of UK hallmarking within the UK, which in
turn undermines the operation of UK-based high-quality jewellery
manufacturers. There is some evidence in the responses to the
consultation that some people have concerns along these lines. We are
increasingly being told that quality counts and that UK firms that
focus on quality find a market—not a mass market but a world
brand market—led by quality and not price. I would like to be
reassured by my noble friend as to whether the Government have
considered the dangers that are stated in the overall conclusions on
page 30 of the document, where it
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13012983000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000122">“However,
there is an outcome where the UK Assay Offices act in such a way that
they collectively destroy the link between UK Assay Office marks and
marks applied in the UK. Under this scenario, marking moves off-shore

for what purpose are we doing this? If you look at where the

this. I may be taking a step in the wrong direction to say this but
neither I nor my opposite number have anything like the expertise that
has just been displayed. I have a number of points to make and would be

asked about who actually benefits from this. It is apparently being
done for the benefit of the four assay offices, but possibly at the
cost and expense of those who design, make and sell excellent quality
jewellery and related articles within the UK. We need to have regard to
that. One could 
<?notus-xml column=527?>imagine a scenario in which this legislative reform order was not
required because a strong, export-led provision of services dominated
the world markets and the quality of hallmarking and assay services
offered in Great Britain was sufficient to make the rest of the world
take us as the standard without inventing others. However, that clearly
is not
happening.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000041">It
is interesting to note that hallmarking is one of the oldest forms of
consumer protection. As the notes make clear, it has been in existence
in the UK for some 700 years. The main thrust of my argument is about
protecting consumers. As I understand it, hallmarks serve three
functions: they are distinguishing marks struck on articles, such as
items of jewellery, that are made of platinum, gold, silver and now
palladium, which guarantee to the world the purity of the precious
metal content of the article; they are an indication that the articles
have been independently assayed; and, currently, they confirm that, in
the UK, the assaying and hallmarking of precious metals has been
carried out by one of the four assay offices, which are located in
London, Birmingham, Sheffield and
Edinburgh.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000042">The
law that governs hallmarking in the UK is the Hallmarking Act, as we
have heard, and a number of pieces of subordinate legislation. The

Act, but the main one is to enable offshore hallmarking by the UK assay
offices and for items bearing those hallmarks to be treated in the same
way as items bearing hallmarks struck in the UK. It is on this issue

under Section 17 of the Act, using an affirmative resolution process,
and not under the super-affirmative resolution process that is provided
for in Section 18 of the Act. However, the document is rather vague
about what evidence was used by the Minister to justify the decision to
utilise the Section 17 procedure? Can the noble Viscount enlighten us
further on that
point?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012983000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000044">One
of the main risks to this proposal is that control of the hallmarks in
the offshore locations will be lost, which might lead to the
possibility that all UK assay office marks will be become so tainted as
to be devalued. Will that not require continuing and intensive
supervision by the Hallmarking Council and indeed by HM Government? Has
any assessment been made of that risk? If it is thought to be a real
risk, why has 
<?notus-xml column=528?>no continuing cost been ascribed to it? All we have is the rather small
sum of £25,000 allegedly for set-up

that hallmarking is at heart a consumer protection measure, as I said,
what steps will the Government take to make sure that consumers are
aware of these changes? We are, after all, talking about a global
trade, worth about £4 billion per annum within the UK at
present, with articles increasingly being produced and hallmarked in
low labour-cost countries such as Thailand and India. Hallmarks
authorised by EEA counterparts will also be sold in the UK. To compound
it all, our current style of marks is being changed. It seems to me
that this will call for a major, proactive consumer information
programme. Who will lead on that in the absence of Consumer Focus? Will
it be Citizens Advice? What sort of budget are the Government thinking
of? I would be grateful for more information on that, if
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000046">The

confirm that the additional workload on these departments has been
adequately assessed. For example, they will need to keep up to date on
the number of new offshore assay offices being established, the new
marks that are being introduced and the impact of the other changes in

there are currently four UK assay offices permitted to apply the UK

another, and, being based in London, Edinburgh, Birmingham and
Sheffield, they are apparently very different organisations. What steps

glut of offshore hallmarking offices around the globe, perhaps
competing against each other? The mind boggles at the prospect of
seeing UK assay office London, UK assay office Sheffield, Birmingham,
Edinburgh—noble Lords will get the point—in direct
competition in gold and silver factories across the globe, when we are

my noble friend Lord Hodgson for their considerable contributions. The

my noble friend Lord Hodgson for their acknowledgement of the risks
facing the UK hallmarking regime. I am particularly pleased that the
efforts of the hallmarking community in helping bring about this order
have not been in vain. The Government’s task in opening up fresh
opportunities for UK hallmarking is nearly complete. It is now for the
UK assay offices to grasp such opportunities as they wish and as their
commercial judgment deems desirable. As I see it, the most important
outcome of this whole venture is that there will be a level playing
field between the UK assay offices and their competitors in the
European Economic Area, now that the metaphorical bonds tying the hands
of the assay offices have been
undone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0001.htm#13012983000053">Also
worth mentioning is the widening of choice of sponsors’ marks.
This is in its own way a radical step. It is also an eminently sensible
one, in that it will make life easier for sponsors, who range from
craftsmen operating a small business to large manufacturers. Anything
which simplifies the presentation of articles of precious metal for
hallmarking is to be wholeheartedly

Ste<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:56:11"></hs_TimeCode>venson,
raised the issue of the cost benefits of this exercise and change. It
is best to be frank and to make the point that it is expected that a
limited number of new jobs will be created where assay offices choose
to set up offshore hallmarking operations, which is good news. Having
said that, the hallmarking community itself acknowledges that there are
likely to be some job losses in the UK as a result of the setting up of
overseas hallmarking operations.</hs_para>

my main point is that the alternative would be far worse. Failure to
grasp the opportunity to tap into the demand for offshore marking of
high-volume jewellery would further reduce the competitiveness of the
UK assay offices, which are already losing business to those
competitors who are able to hallmark offshore. For example, one assay
office has already lost about a third of its core staff—15
people—with this figure likely to increase to some two-thirds of
existing staff, simply because of the inability to compete. Ultimately,
failure to change the UK hallmarking law could lead to the closure of
one or more assay offices and even greater job losses.</hs_para>

Hodgson raised the important question of the potential loss of
reputation, as he put it, or loss of quality, as a result of the
changes. I can reassure him that different marks are required to
distinguish between onshore and offshore hallmarking operations. No
diminution of reputation or quality is foreseen, as the British
Hallmarking Council is responsible for all hallmarking

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of

Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2011. The order concerns
charging for visa, immigration and nationality services and it enables
the UK Border Agency to specify applications, processes and services
for which it intends to set a fee. I thank the noble Baroness for
attending this debate, which is playing to a rather empty Room this
evening. However, that does not belittle the importance of the measure,
because specific fee levels will be set in separate legislation to be
brought before this Committee in due course. For applications and
services where we charge more than the administrative cost of delivery,
the regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure. Noble Lords
will have the opportunity to ask questions about the fees themselves in
the debate which follows that second piece of statutory
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000069">In
accordance with our legal powers, this amendment to the Immigration and
Nationality (Fees) Order 2011 sets out new applications and services
for which we intend a fee to be paid in future, and clarifies the
powers under which some existing fees are set. The amendment enables
the UK Border Agency to simplify its current charging structure for
optional premium services and to widen the scope to develop and offer
new optional services in the future. For example, there are currently
two fees specified within the regulations for each application type
made in the UK, depending on whether a migrant makes a postal
application or one at a public inquiry office. Instead, there will be a

<?notus-xml column=532?>single application fee and a single additional uplift fee payable for
optional premium services that an applicant may wish to take up, such
as making their application in person or seeking an expedited
consideration of their application. This means that about 30 fees will
be removed from the regulations, thus simplifying the legislation as
well as giving greater flexibility to how the services are
provided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000070">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:07:14"></hs_TimeCode>

sponsors’ needs. Rather than specifying applications for a
change in the status of a sponsor licence, we want to clarify these as
requests for optional services. As a first step, we will then look to
extend premium sponsorship to tier 4 sponsors, building on the premium
offer already available to those in tiers 2 and
5.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000071">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:07:50"></hs_TimeCode>

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
very thorough and helpful explanation of the order. He need not worry;
I have no fears of not playing to a full house. One thing I have learnt
in my short time looking at immigration issues in your
Lordships’ House is that these matters are always widely read
afterwards. I am sometimes taken aback by the number of e-mails and the
amount of correspondence that follows any legislation in your
Lordships’ House relating to immigration. That is very helpful
because it helps to inform our
debates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000076">I do
not disagree with the noble Lord’s comments. He is right when he
talks about balancing the contribution between those who use the system
and the taxpayer. 
<?notus-xml column=533?>I have a couple of questions about the order which perhaps he
can help me with. First, looking at the policy background, the Minister
made it clear that the key part of delivering the immigration system
which the public expects is acquiring the necessary resources to fund
delivery and improvements in the services we offer.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012983000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000077">We are all aware,
particularly from the reports of John Vine, about the backlog and the
delays in the system and how urgently improvements are needed. The
Minister may have heard a Mr Hearne on Radio 4 the other morning, who
is about to celebrate—if that is the right word—his first
wedding anniversary next month and yet his wife, having gone over the
various hurdles that people should when seeking to make their home in
this country, still has not had a final decision about whether they can
live a normal married life together. I have had an e-mail today from a
couple who were told that they would have to wait six months for a
decision; they have now been told it will be another five months. It is
those delays in the system that bring it into dispute. I do not blame
entry clearance officers, the people making the decisions; I think it
is a resources issue. If the Minister is able to say anything about
when he thinks we are going to see some improvements in the length of
time it is taking to make decisions and the ability to clear the
backlog, that would be very helpful, given that it is specifically
referred to in the Explanatory
Notes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000078">Another
point I am unclear on, looking again at the helpful Explanatory Notes

the cost of those services is currently reflected in the application

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the
noble Baroness, Lady Smith, for raising these issues. She is quite
right that in this area performance lies at the heart of everything. I
am very grateful for the work being done by John Vine. He is driving
improvements in the service by identifying points of weakness and the
processes and individual cases about which the noble Baroness has
communicated with me—and of which I was myself aware—in
which there were delays in the consideration of someone’s
personal position. Consideration has often been deferred, putting
people in
uncertainty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:15:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000082">The
driver behind these changes is to make sure that the income that can be
generated by fees is used to improve the service. This accounts for the
pursuit of a premium service—which, I hasten to add, is not at
the expense of the normal service but enables people for whom this is
very important to have their cases dealt with in the most efficient way
to suit their personal needs. It is exactly what we want to turn UKBA
into: a consumer-oriented organisation that seeks to serve the people
who wish to use its
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:16:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000083">I
turn to the issues on which the noble Baroness questioned me. Most of
the backlog in marriage cases was accounted for by people who had been
refused by the normal process but were trying to circumvent the formal
appeals process—the noble Baroness will know that there is an
appeals process—by requesting an informal reconsideration. The
2,000 cases that were identified as requiring a decision have now been
dealt with. The details of those who requested an informal
reconsideration are being passed to Capita, who will contact them on
behalf of the UK Border Agency as part of the work to ensure that those
with no right to remain in the United Kingdom leave the country. If
they refuse, I am afraid that their removal will have to be

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> I appreciate and fully understand that.
I was not suggesting that somebody who is not entitled to remain in
this country should be able to do so. I am a little concerned about the
Minister’s reference to circumventing the process. My
understanding is that the process by which people were refused and then
looked to have their case reconsidered was part of the system. They
were not going against the rules, but acting within
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:17:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000085"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13012983000169" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000169">Lord
Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I accept that. That is why we were
concerned about it and why John Vine was right to draw the attention of
Parliament to the situation. We are very concerned to make sure that it
does not continue. This statutory instrument is about trying to engage
the involvement of the consumer in the payment of fees, to strengthen
the service that can be provided by

asked which companies act on behalf of UKBA. Within the UK, the Post
Office uses biometrics and provides a check-and-send service. Overseas,
two commercial providers offer assistance with processing applications
and premium services. I cannot provide the names of those organisations
now, but I will drop a line to the noble
Baroness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:19:08"></hs_TimeCode>. She
also 
<?notus-xml column=535?>asked why the fee was not included as part of the application fee. That
is because the UK Border Agency awarded the contract for the provision
of the third-party biometric service to the Post Office. I hope she
will understand that that is separate from the fee that is charged for
the
application.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_29_PT_1/C2106B11355A0862109894B9BF89F5E6178E408A" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 January 2013">Tuesday,

suspect—if it is not a very bad pun—that there is not a
cigarette paper between us in looking at what we can do to end the
scourge of drugs and the damage that they cause to so many young people

the order, we were concerned that it had taken a long time to

of other countries, such as Russia, which had already taken action. We
welcome the fact that <I>O</I>-desmethyltramadol is being added to the
list of class B drugs before any evidence is widely available in the
UK. We know that the drug travels across Europe and that young people
get it, and it is right that, based on the evidence of the danger that
it causes, action should be taken as soon as
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:28:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000100">When
discussing the previous order, I asked about the Government’s
relationship and co-operation with the European Monitoring Centre for
Drugs and Drug Addiction—EMCDDA. We were concerned then that the
EMCDDA had identified 90 new substances in 2010 and 2011 and, I
understand, even more in 2012. At that point, the Home Office’s
early warning system had identified only 11 of those drugs. The noble
Lord, Lord Henley, the Minister at the time, was unable to answer that
point in Committee—I appreciate that the Minister may not have
information today, but, again, I would be happy for him to write to me.
I am concerned that we should not lag behind what the EMCDDA is doing.
In the case of <I>O</I>-desmethyltramadol, it is clear that the
Government are not lagging behind, but given that 90 new drugs were
identified up to 2011 and even more in 2012, it would be interesting to
know how many of them have been identified by the Home Office’s
early warning system. How do the Government and the Home Office
co-operate with the EMCDDA? It is quite clear that if the centre has
information that is useful to us and allows early action to be taken,
as with this particular drug, it would be very
welcome.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13012983000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000139"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:32:53"></hs_TimeCode>7.30

point that I raised at the time, which is still relevant, was that of
internet stores. I know how very difficult it is to take action against
stores that are selling these drugs across boundaries—and I
would perhaps mention here that it is important that we remain in total
co-operation with our European partners and do not withdraw from
European crime and justice powers. Is the Minister confident that
progress is being made to tackle internet sales of legal highs and
those that are being made illegal? It would also be helpful if he was
able to update the Committee on action against
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:30:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000102">I
was very interested in the point the Minister made about generic drugs.
Perhaps he can just clarify something. I think what he said, although I
am not 100% sure, addressed the problem that I asked about last time.
We ban certain drugs, quite rightly, and put them on the controlled
list, but when one compound in that drug 
<?notus-xml column=538?>changes and it gets a different name, it is not subject to control or
banned. He talked about trying to address the generic compounds. Does
that address the point so that if a drug changes one compound or
changes slightly, it does not become a legal high but is still banned
under the order? I know this is quite a difficult area and how
difficult these things are to monitor, and that you have to be so
precise with the legislation. I think he said the Government are trying
to get to the point—and perhaps have, going by the language in
the order—of deriving the list of drugs and compounds. Does that
mean that if a particular named drug—I think he talked about
Annihilation, for example—was to change slightly, that because
the compound is derived from whatever chemical ingredients are in the
order itself, it would still be banned because it has not changed
significantly? I might be making the point rather badly—it is
quite a convoluted one but I hope the Minister understands the point I
am
making<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:31:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000103">My
final point goes back to previous debates on the Crime and Courts Bill
about testing at the roadside for those who may be on drugs. Every time
a new drug comes on to the controlled list or is classified as class B,
it would be interesting to know whether the “drugalyser”
that is being rolled out at the moment would pick up these compounds.
It seems to me that if we are constantly saying new drugs
are—quite rightly—going to be banned, the drugalyser
should be able to pick them up so we know if somebody is driving with
banned substances in their bloodstream. I appreciate that that is quite
a complicated point and that the answer may not be available today but
it is something we need to look at if we are, rightly, adding new drugs
to the controlled or banned list.</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness very much
indeed for her support. The drugalyser is rather a focused piece of kit
at the moment and deals with drugs that are commonly available and well
recognised as impairing people’s ability to drive properly. I
have no doubt that we will have an opportunity in future to debate how
that particular piece of equipment will be used. It is a Department for
Transport area of activity but of course we are very much involved and,
indeed, it was included in the Crime and Courts Bill, which was led by
the Home Office. We will continue to monitor it. The short answer is,
of course, that such a piece of equipment will be unable to pick up all
drugs, but that does not invalidate its introduction as a useful piece
of equipment to monitor people’s misuse of drugs while
driving<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:34:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012983000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129-gc0002.htm#13012983000106">This
order has two elements, which are innovative and have been recognised
and welcomed by the noble Baroness, the first of which is the
pre-emptive strike. To pick up on the example of the chemical

that this highly damaging drug is illegal within this

protection. As the noble Baroness said, this is difficult to put into
legislation. However, I must say that page 2 in particular is an
impressive piece of drafting. I had a modest education in organic
chemistry and can see exactly what the drafters of the legislation
sought to do. Almost all the manufactured, synthetic drugs are based on
organic chains with psychoactive elements. The legislation recognises
the derivation of these compounds, and their reassembly and
reformulation to get round the ban will be very much more difficult
through the construction of this generic, family-type ban. It will be
very
useful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T19:36:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

a question to which I do not have the answer, although I should have
had. She asked about the progress being made on the internet sale of
drugs. I will find out if I can update her on that. Clearly it is an
area where illegal marketing goes on. This is of concern and we would
want to take every measure to try to stamp it out. I hope that noble
Lords can see that this measure is particularly useful in addressing
the advent of these legal highs, and I commend the order to the

from time to time what areas there are in England that meet the
criteria for national park status, and whether it is especially
desirable that such areas should be designated. In November 2011,
Natural England issued variation orders to extend the boundaries of the

representations or expressions of support were received in response to
the proposals, including objections from five local authorities. It is
a statutory requirement that a public inquiry is held if at least one
local authority with land in a proposed extension raises an objection
to a relevant variation order. I have therefore commissioned a public
inquiry into the recommended boundary changes and an inspector from the

of the consultation responses received, we have concluded that the best
solution would be to retain the York green belt policies. This approach

The paper by Professors Ehrlich and Ehrlich <I>Can
</I><I>a</I><I> Collapse </I><I>of </I><I>Global Civilisation
</I><I>b</I><I>e Avoided</I><I>?</I> presents an articulate assessment
of the challenges facing the world. As the paper sets out, the global
population is growing rapidly, and this population growth, coupled with
greater economic prosperity, is increasing demand for food, energy and
water and putting pressure on increasingly scarce resources. Climate
change is an additional challenge, likely to exacerbate the risk of
food and water insecurity, and increase the vulnerability of
individuals, communities and
regions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012960000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129w0001.htm#13012960000198">These
challenges are not insurmountable. Science, technology and engineering,
coupled with appropriate international action, will be central to
meeting them and ensuring a sustainable future for us all. They are,
however, intrinsically interconnected and cannot be addressed in
isolation. However, a holistic approach is difficult in a fragmented
international policy
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012960000199" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129w0001.htm#13012960000199">The
paper references the need for multidisciplinary scientific effort and
foresight. Her Majesty's Government (HMG) already support both, through
funding excellence in science and through their own Foresight
Programme. This Foresight Programme, under the auspices of the
Government Office for Science and the Government's Chief Scientific
Adviser, has looked in depth at many of the challenges detailed in this
paper, including the impact of environmental change on migration, and
the future of global food and farming. Foresight reports set out the
evidence base for how these issues might evolve over the coming decades
and potential options for
policymakers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012960000200" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129w0001.htm#13012960000200">HMG
recognise the challenges set out in the paper and are working actively
to achieve global solutions, drawing on conclusions from these
Foresight reports and other policy-relevant science undertaken across
the research base. Scientific understanding informs both domestic
policy designed to address these challenges as well as the UK's
international position. HMG are working actively to deal with climate
change, and are working towards a global agreement in 2015 to keep
greenhouse gas emissions within the limits needed to avoid the most
dangerous impacts of climate change. At the Rio+20 UN sustainable
development conference last year, a key outcome was the agreement to
develop a set of sustainable development goals, which the UK supports.
These goals will aim to set the necessary global ambition to reverse
environmental degradation and put the world on a more sustainable
trajectory, rather than portend the collapse of civilisation. HMG are
also committed to universal health systems and education, as these are
essential for women's health and advancing gender equality, influencing
population dynamics, and contributing to poverty eradication and
sustainable
development.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13012960001067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130129w0001.htm#13012960001067">EU:

15 September 2011, Defra published date-marking guidance to help ensure
dates are applied consistently. Use-by dates should only be used where
the safety of food cannot be guaranteed after that date. Most other
foods should have a best-before date, only to indicate when the food is
no longer at its best, but is still safe. As a result of this guidance,
date markings are improving. For example, more labels are dropping the
confusing display until or sell-by dates that are only for stock

releasing records when they are 20 years-old, instead of 30. The move
to a 20-year rule reduces the point at which government records are
transferred to the National Archives under the Public Records Act 1958.
It also reduces the maximum lifespan of certain Freedom of Information
Act 2000 exemptions so that they cannot be applied to any information
over a certain age. This move will improve accountability by enabling
access to government records earlier, and is a key part of the

Chairman of Committees:</Member> Certain expenditure items are not
allocated to a specific House of Lords office or department and are
held centrally; these items are covered by the heading “no
specific budget”. These items tend to be of a technical
accounting nature, or to involve budgets which can be volatile or
uncertain. They are held centrally as “no specific
budget” so as not to distort any individual departmental budget.
In some cases the money is placed under this heading for budgeting
purposes and then moved to the appropriate offices as part of the
forecast outturn process, with the result that no expenditure is
recorded against the original line.</hs_para>
