throughout the nation might be tuning into our proceedings expecting to
hear us talk about the tragic developments in Algeria, but as Members
will know, and as you will know, Mr Speaker, under the Standing Orders
of the House, a statement is to be made at 11 o’clock. It is
appropriate, then, that we deal now with the private Members’
Bills, the first of which is the Antarctic Bill, and my new

am grateful that new clause 1 has been selected for debate this
morning, because it gives the House the opportunity to consider in more
depth the likely consequences of the Bill. This straightforward new
clause simply calls on the Secretary of State to lay a report before
the House, within three years of the Bill’s coming into force, a
cost-benefit analysis of the measures in it. Of course, it is in no way
a wrecking amendment and will in no way undermine the basic purpose of
this excellent Bill. The only purpose of the new clause is to try to
improve the Bill and give the House the opportunity to revisit it in
three years to check whether what was intended is actually happening.

point, because I realise that it might be unclear. I anticipate that it
would be both. It is right and proper that the Government review and
explain to the House the costs of the Bill to them and, perhaps more
importantly, its effects on private companies, research in the
Antarctic and those who want to visit the Antarctic or have their
livelihoods there. I anticipate that the cost-benefit analysis would

Nuttall:</Member></B> I am grateful for that intervention, because it
is important not to look at the Bill just in financial terms. We need
to look at it more widely. The whole purpose of the Bill is to protect
the environment of the Antarctic continent. We cannot assess the value
of the Bill just in pounds, shillings and pence, as we used to
say—I suppose we would say “pounds and pence”
nowadays. We have to look at the overall impact of the Bill and ask
whether it is achieving what it set out to achieve, which is to protect
the environment of the Antarctic. The thrust of the Bill is to bring
into UK law the environmental protection provided by the protocol on
environmental protection to the Antarctic treaty, so the analysis
should be wider than simply a financial
analysis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T09:40:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Nuttall:</Member></B> That is a very good point. It would be up to the
Secretary of State at the Foreign Office to consider what would be the
best way. My view is that we would have to consult the scientists who
are there now, at the Antarctic bases, and ask the travel companies
that want to carry out tourism in the area. We would also need a wider
consultation, because others may be put off from carrying out
scientific experiments or visiting as a result of the Bill. We are
therefore talking not just about those who are doing good, but about
those who might be put off, and whom we will have to contact in other
ways. In effect, there might have to be a call for evidence towards 
<?notus-xml column=1145?>the end of the three-year period, so that we can assess whether people
have been put off—although I will mention that

immediately put my hon. Friend’s fears to bed. I do not envisage
the report being a weighty tome, involving dozens of civil servants
conducting a detailed analysis. Clearly there will be a cost
involved—that is patently obvious—but in the long run it
is better to have the wider benefits of a cost-benefit analysis than
not to conduct one, because the important thing is that the Bill is
effective in its purpose. As I said in response to an earlier
intervention, we cannot really put a price on that. If the Bill turns

have a longer period. If there are problems with the Bill putting
people off from visiting or carrying out scientific work in the region,
we need to know about them sooner rather than later. There might be a
case for conducting a further review, because—I will touch on
this later—there may well not be an environmental emergency in
that three-year period. I sincerely hope that there is not, but that
would mean that we were unable to assess the effectiveness of some of

the schedule to the Bill provides for financial limits to the amount of

emergency arises from an event involving a ship. Unsurprisingly, given
the international nature of the agreement, the amount of liability is
fixed by reference not to pounds sterling, but to special drawing
rights, which is the international currency fixed by the International
Monetary Fund. Even allowing for those limits, however, given that the
nature of such an environmental emergency is almost unlimited and given
the understandable caution of the insurance companies, the cost of
providing such insurance might be very high indeed. It could be so high
that it prohibited visits from taking place and scientific study from
being carried out. I appreciate that that is not the intention of the

the matter and assess whether the costs involved in obtaining insurance

this: clearly, clause 5 would add to the size of the cost-benefit

be associated costs for those who have to sit down, carry out these

obligations of third-party signatories to the Antarctic treaty. We may
have rather lost sight of the fact that the Bill rests on treaty
obligations created by the UK, and that it imposes obligations on UK
signatories only. Is it not a step too far to require the UK Government
to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of all the other countries’
obligations under the Bill if they have absolutely no chance of
commanding, or persuading, the other legislatures to do anything other
than what is provided for in their own legislation? It seems to me that
Government expenditure on a cost-benefit analysis relating to matters

may be of use to the House if I give some details of the types of site
that the clause would cover. They range from simple rock cairns with
plaques attached to what are, perhaps, the most famous sites of all:
the huts used by Captain Scott in his expeditions of the early-1900s.
Crucially, these huts are located not in the British claim area of the
Antarctic territory, but on the north shore of Cape Evans on Ross
island, which is in the New Zealand claim area. There is often some
confusion between Scott’s hut and the Discovery hut.
Scott’s hut at Cape Evans was erected in 1911 by the British
Antarctic expedition which took place between 1910 and 1913, which was
often referred to as the Terra Nova expedition. When Captain Scott was
selecting a base for that expedition, he could have returned to his
previous hut erected during the Discovery expedition between 1901 and
1904, but he did not do so, first because it was incredibly cold, and
secondly because his ship got stuck. He looked for a different site,
and established the second Scott’s hut, which is the one to
which I am referring

of those sub-zero temperatures, the hut’s contents are
remarkably well-preserved even to this day. The hut remained untouched
until 1956 when American explorers excavated it from the snow and ice.
Although, sadly, some items were removed—perhaps as
mementoes—most of the artefacts remain in place. At various
times since the 1970s the United Kingdom and our friends in New Zealand
have undertaken to restore the hut. Unfortunately, however, bacterial
decay is still occurring and there are concerns that the fabric of the
hut is being affected by fungal decay. Both Scott’s hut and
Shackleton’s hut are included on the watch list of the 100 most

we have to keep a close eye on the costs that are incurred in any

environmental benefits arise from this move; the benefit for future

preserving the continent for scientific research cannot be reduced to a
simple cost-benefit analysis on a financial basis. So, again, I
question whether the hon. Gentleman is going down the right path in
suggesting that we should have one. Nor can we measure the effect of
this Bill on the UK’s foreign relations, but it is clear that
the Falkland Islands Government and others believe that the Bill, once

emergency. I do not see why the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)
does not think that such a provision is appropriate, but we will hear
from him in a moment. I think it is entirely reasonable to expect these
people to take preparatory measures, and I simply do not understand why
clause 5 should be removed.
Preventive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T10:22:04"></hs_TimeCode>
measures are included in article 3 of the liability annex; the

activities, such as the taking of flora and fauna and the introduction
of non-native animals or plants. Permits are not needed for ships or
aircraft travelling on to an immediate destination outside Antarctica
or fishing vessels unless they are linked to an expedition. The permit
requirements for British expeditions entering the Antarctic were

Friend the Member for Bury North is on to something, because what the

hon. Friend said three years—I do not know whether that was an
arbitrary figure, or whether there was any more science behind that
choice. I took his point that if there is a flaw in the legislation, it
is better to know sooner rather than later. I thought that was a fair
point. I do not know whether every three years might have been a better
amendment in the sense of the ongoing point

without prohibitive cost. That would be perfectly reasonable, and I do

I do not see the harm in doing a cost-benefit analysis. It may well be

three years, as<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T10:47:14"></hs_TimeCode>

when the Government pass legislation and tell the House that its
purpose is to do such-and-such and this is why it is important and so
necessary, there should be a mechanism to see at a future date whether
they were accurate in their analysis—whether it has done what it
said. I know that Ronseal is a topical metaphor to use at the moment,

different ways of doing these things. Perhaps there should be
a combination of both. The Scrap Metal Dealers

years; it also incorporates a sunset clause whereby, after five years,
the Act would expire and would have to be brought back again if it was
seen to be worth while. So I think my hon. Friend is on to something.

I tend to think that cost-benefit analyses are unnecessarily
bureaucratic at the best of times, but the Bill is financially neutral
anyway. That is the first point to make. Secondly, the thrust of the
Bill is to encourage operators to behave properly, especially in
planning for their activities. The idea is therefore to avoid problems,
rather than counter them. The Bill’s overall direction of travel
is to encourage that additional responsibility. I know that many
operators are already responsible, but as

intervention, but the idea is to ensure that people behave responsibly,
and we will be checking that. Clause 5 contains various punitive
measures if people do not conduct themselves in an appropriate way.
That is likely to be a more effective measure of the outcome of the
Bill. Furthermore, the Bill sets out a large number of measurement
structures, and these are well addressed in the annexes, to which our

One of the reasons why I mentioned my trip to Antarctica through the

all the risks that one could encounter. That is why clause 5 is
necessary. We have to insist, through legislation, that preparations
are properly made and that people understand the risks involved in
visiting Antarctica. By insisting that clause 5 remains in place, we
are effectively saying, “Look, this is a matter of some
importance. The necessary legislation is in place, and if you

and the measures already in place, that can already happen? The Foreign
and Commonwealth Office has the ability to give permission or otherwise
to people going to Antarctica, and environmental impact assessments
must be carried out before they travel. I understand the point that my
hon. Friend makes, but it does not explain why we need the clause when

assessments are one thing, but making preparations to visit a continent
as brutal—pristine and vulnerable though it is—as the
Antarctic can sometimes be is quite a different matter. Although an
environmental assessment is necessary in many cases, including for such
visits, it is very important to make sure that operators, visitors and
others make every preparation in the proper way.</hs_Para>

Amenas is some 18 hours by road from the capital, Algiers. It is in the

have from the Algerian authorities, the terrorists first attacked two
buses en route to the In Amenas airfield before attacking the
residential compound and the gas facility at the installation. It
appears to have been a large, well co-ordinated and heavily armed
assault, and it is probable that it had been pre-planned. Two of those
travelling in the convoy to the airfield were very sadly killed,
including one British national, and his family were informed on
Wednesday. A number of other workers were taken hostage by the
terrorists in separate locations both at the residential compound and
at the gas facility. The precise numbers involved remain unclear at

said. I think this is a reminder of two very clear points. First, we
face a large and existential terrorist threat from a group of
extremists based in different parts of the world who want to do the
biggest possible amount of damage to our interests and way of life.
Secondly, those extremists thrive when they have ungoverned spaces in
which they can exist, build and plan. I very much agree with what my
hon. Friend has said. Under this Government—as under previous
Governments—a lot of priority has been given to the funding of
the security services, and there is now a good system for bringing
together intelligence and military and political planning through the
National Security Council, and in other ways including the emergency
committee Cobra framework, which brings people together very rapidly to
ensure that all parts of the British Government and state are able to

Algeria and his staff, who have been working around the clock and have
been extremely effective in getting information to us about what is
happening. We are expanding our network of embassies and contacts
around the world but we must look all the time at how well we are
represented in different countries, and where best to thicken the
contacts we have. I think we have to do that in partnership with other
countries. For instance, there is no doubt that in parts of west Africa
the French have excellent connections with countries where we have
less-good connections, but likewise there are countries where the
opposite applies. We need to work with our partners—I discussed
this with President Obama last night—and ensure that between us
we have the strongest possible

The answer is yes, hostage negotiating experts are on stand-by with
other sorts of technical expertise that we can provide. I have made
those offers to the Algerian Prime Minister, and all those offers
stand. We do have considerable expertise, but let me make one point
clear. We must remember that the Algerian Government are facing the
challenge of a massive terrorist attack with lives immediately at risk.
While we in this country can be hugely proud of the technical expertise
and the brilliance of our security forces and special forces, one can
have the ultimate degree of planning and still find that these events
end unhappily. We should bear that in mind when thinking about the
actions the Algerians have

very good contact over the past few days but I will not hide the fact
that we were disappointed not to be informed of the assault in advance.
We want to help in any way we can with technical and other assistance,

huge threat from Islamist terrorists. They were facing a situation in

suggestion. The Chief of the Defence Staff has been looking at whether
there is more we can do in terms of military exercises, operations and
co-operation with the countries of west Africa. Clearly, with the Mali
situation it is key that Ghanaians, Nigeriens, Nigerians and others
bring forward troops to help in that country. We should be thinking
about what we can do to assist in that process. The strength of having
regular strategic defence and security reviews is that we can ask where
the threats are coming from and where we can make the greatest

for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) about the importance of political
processes. I profoundly believe, for instance in Mali, that there is a
military part to what needs to happen, which is beating back the
terrorist-sponsored al-Qaeda-backed rebels. Clearly, in all situations
like this, there needs to be political process as well to recognise the
deep political problems that many of these countries have. In the
United Nations and as a permanent member of the Security Council, we
can play an important part, in co-ordination with 
<?notus-xml column=1174?>our allies, to help to get these political processes right. However, I
caution against people who think that we can find a purely political
and diplomatic answer to the Malian crisis. There is also a problem, a

of their economy is provided by oil and gas, that those companies
should be able to operate properly there. From my experience of this
episode, I think that there is perhaps more we need to do to ensure
that the companies have a really good, up-to-date record of all the
people who work for them and who work for any subcontractors, so that
if anything goes wrong, we can have the swiftest possible information

the fact that different countries have territorial integrity and have
to make decisions that they think are in the interests of their own

ensure that, in every case, there is the best possible contact and
relationship between countries such as ours—where, regrettably,
for reasons of history, we have had to develop real expertise in
hostage rescue and negotiation—and other countries. Obviously,
we do not have the resources to have such a relationship with every
country, but we should be working with allies such as the French and
the Americans and thinking about where best we can add value in those
sorts of relationships. For example, we have a very strong relationship
with Nigeria on that front. There is perhaps also an opportunity in the

It is difficult to give a certain answer, but given the scale of the
terrorist attack on this gas installation in Algeria, the number of
people involved and the sophistication of the weapons used, it looks
like it was some time in the planning. As I have said, however, it
would be ill-thought through to say, even if there was a connection
with Mali, that we are wrong to help roll back terrorist advances in
Mali because it might threaten us elsewhere. That is entirely
wrong-headed thinking. We should be in favour of rolling back terrorist
advances in Mali because it will help make us safer elsewhere as we
squeeze the ungoverned space and recognise that these terrorists should
have no place to
hide<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:50:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

offered to help and assist the Algerians in any way we could.
Obviously, there are limitations on what we can do, given the logistics
and time it takes to put teams together and get people to the other
side of the world. On the Algerians themselves, we should show some
respect and understanding of the fact that that country has fought a
long civil war against the most aggressive and violent form of militant
Islam. We should also recognise that, yes, we have expertise and pride
ourselves on the brilliance of our special forces, but clearly the
Algerians felt that they had to make decisions very quickly and felt
that there was an urgent threat to life, so decided to act as they did.

the offers to help were, and still are, there, but we have to

me return to clause 5 of the Bill, which we were debating an hour ago.
We currently have a good opportunity to test clause 5, because
amendment 2 is provoking a constructive debate about its purposes. It
is important to bear in mind just how vulnerable some parts of
Antarctica are, particularly the Southern ocean, which is of decisive
importance to the environment, not least because it absorbs up to 40%
of carbon dioxide. It therefore plays a major part in the overall
global environment. It is also important to note that the Southern
ocean has a considerably more complex food chain than might at first be
apparent, so it is all the more important to ensure that it is
protected. That is why we are right to support clause 5 as it
stands—because it not only ensures that protection is the order
of the day, but that action can be taken if something goes wrong. That
is implicit in clause
5<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:56:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Carmichael:</Member></B> That is absolutely right. One interesting
point about new clause 1—this is one reason why we should not
support it—is that more and more nation states are showing an
interest in Antarctica. That brings pressure in respect of challenges
to the Antarctica environment as well as numbers. Some of the new
arrivals are not as interested as we are in making sure that the area
is properly protected and that responsible actions are taken. By
passing this legislation, we apply international pressure, ensuring
that other nation states that need to do the same get on with the
process and that the international focus on what is important for
Antarctica—the protection of the continent—continually
remains a top priority.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13011842000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0001.htm#13011842000272"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:04:00"></hs_TimeCode>Amendment
1 deals with historic sites and monuments. It is an interesting
amendment and it is right to discuss it because it provides an
opportunity to make a very important point. The point is that the
provisions relate to who is doing something, not to where the action is
being taken. If we wanted to take action to preserve the hut of Captain
Robert Scott and his colleagues, the fact that it is in what might be
described as the New Zealand slice of Antarctica would not prevent us
from doing so. As we would be going there to preserve the hut, British
law would apply to our efforts to ensure that it was looked after
properly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0001.htm#13011842000273">While
I have a huge amount of sympathy with the thrust of amendment 1, and
while I think that the hon. Member for Bury North is absolutely right
to remind us that we need to have the capacity to deal with all
monuments and sites of historical interest, it is with the British
people, and those connected with Britain, that clause 15 deals, and
they are more than welcome to pursue such priorities throughout the
continent of Antarctica. I therefore do not think that the amendment is
necessary, although I do think that it has given us a useful
opportunity to reinforce the point that everyone in our jurisdiction
would be covered by the clause. Indeed, as the Bill’s promoter,
I have welcomed the opportunity to comment on all three of what I
consider useful amendments—not because I think that they should
be included in the Bill, but because the House has been able to discuss
them all properly and make some important points.</hs_Para>

summarise those points. With regard to the cost-benefit analysis
proposed in new clause 1, the Bill is financially neutral. I do not
think we should add any extra burden of bureaucracy, but I do think we
should make clear that the real test is co-operation between all
interested nation states in ensuring that the continent is properly
protected, and ensuring that the measures on which we continue to work
are properly supported and  
<?notus-xml column=1183?>implemented by all of them. That is the test that I shall continue to
press for beyond the passage of this Bill, because I believe it is
critical.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0001.htm#13011842000275">The
main issue in relation to amendment 2, which proposes the removal of
clause 5, is that we are building on existing measures—and quite
right too. It is good that the House has had an opportunity to test the
validity of the clause, because it is important. It will ensure not
only that there is a line of responsibility for operators, visitors,
tourists and so on, but that they must have contingency plans. In the
absence of those two measures, such people would make themselves
vulnerable to punishment. The clause also includes the important
provision that people and organisations should be properly insured for
whatever they may do. The clause puts into domestic law a clear set of
responsibilities for operators visiting
Antarctica.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0001.htm#13011842000276">As
I have already made abundantly clear, amendment 1, which
refers to historic sites and monuments, is unnecessary, because clause
15 relates to the people who are doing something rather than where the
action is taken. However, it has provided another useful opportunity
for me to make it clear that we are taking responsible action, and
enabling others to take responsible action, in protecting monuments and
sites of historical
interest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0001.htm#13011842000277">Let

the Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall) that the Government have

insurance industry was consulted, and it was suggested that additional

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:12:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stroud made that point. Given the level of insurance

non-monetised cost of the Bill might be that operators adjust their
plans to avoid highly sensitive or remote areas. Training time may also
be needed in respect of any equipment obtained for potential response
action. Again, however, such non-monetised costs are not expected to be
significant. The main non-monetised benefit is that the Bill will
reduce the likelihood of an environmental emergency occurring in the
Antarctic through effective forward planning and providing a deterrent
to potential irresponsible behaviour. The Bill will also reduce the
environmental damage caused by any environmental emergency that does
arise; simplify permitting procedures for non-UK nationals; and improve
the conservation and preservation of UK historic monuments and sites in
Antarctica.</hs_Para>

Bill will also allow greater avoidance of the costs associated with
undertaking environmental clean-up operations in Antarctica. Let me
give the House a flavour of the costs. The most serious case of a
maritime environmental emergency occurred when the Argentine vessel
Bahia Paraiso sank in the shallow coastal waters in 1989, resulting in
600,000 litres of spilt fuel affecting nearby wildlife colonies. It was
estimated that in today’s prices the resulting clean-up bill
would be more  than $10 million. These provisions are not
reacting to hypothetical events; the Bill deals with real potential
problems for the Antarctic.</hs_Para>

wish to address two or three specific points made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:15:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bury North, the first of which relates to the point I
was making about tourism. We do not believe that the Bill will reduce
tourism to the Antarctic. Tourism is a legitimate activity to undertake
in Antarctica and its level has risen dramatically in recent decades.
In 1992-93, fewer than 9,000 tourists visited Antarctica, whereas by
2011-12 the number had risen almost threefold to 26,000. The Bill
actually helps  
<?notus-xml column=1185?>to ensure that tourism is well planned and undertaken responsibly. It is
also worth noting that the Bill implements the liability annex, which
will come into force only when all states that are party to it have
ratified it—I wish to discuss that later, because it is an
essential part of the Bill. That ensures that UK operators, including
tourists, stay on a level playing field with those from other
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:16:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000291">In
discussing his new clause 1, my hon. Friend also mentioned the need for
post-legislative scrutiny. The Bill will implement annex VI to the
environmental protocol to the Antarctic treaty, once the annex comes
into force. The Antarctic treaty consultative meeting of state parties
will review the operations of the annex across the whole suite of
Antarctic operations. We therefore feel that a specific UK review
outside the structure of these international mechanisms is not
necessary.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend’s other point that merits a specific response
relates to the exclusions from the Bill, including fishing for profit
and transiting vessels. Other hon. Members have discussed this,
including the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:17:49"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy), who rightly expressed
disappointment in respect of the conservation of Antarctic living
marine resources and the lack of agreement so far. I can give her a
categorical assurance that we are working tirelessly to ensure that we
bring the international community together to reach a satisfactory
resolution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:18:06"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, placing obligations on vessels that are just transiting
Antarctic waters on a direct route to another destination would
infringe their right of free passage in the high seas under
international law. Such obligations would therefore contravene article
VI of the Antarctic treaty.</hs_Para>

also have to say to my hon. Friend that the UK has demonstrated clearly
its commitment to the implementation of marine protected areas in the
Southern ocean. Earlier this year, the Government of South Georgia and
the South Sandwich Islands announced one of the largest sustainable
marine protected areas in the world, covering its entire maritime zone.
I must put on the record the fact that that process was begun under the
previous Government, and we have continued that important focus. So I
hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend on his points about new

the Member for Bury North on amendment 1 to clause 15, which relates to
historic sites and monuments as provided for under annex V of the
protocol on environmental protection to the Antarctic treaty. It is
important to note that any party may propose a site or monument of
recognised historic value for such designation to the Antarctic treaty
consultative meeting. As the Antarctic treaty system operates on the
basis of consensus, the agreement of all Antarctic treaty parties is
needed for such a designation to be approved. Once approved, the
proposed site is added to the approved list of historic sites and
monuments, which is kept updated by the Antarctic treaty secretariat.
As Members will no doubt recognise, the designation of historic sites
and monuments and the protection that affords them under the Antarctic
treaty and subsequent protocols is of extremely high importance to the
United Kingdom, as we have significant historical ties with and have
taken a significant interest in the Antarctic since Captain
Scott’s visit there. It is important on this day to recognise
the bravery and commitment of those early
explorers.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_18_PT_1/C418EDECDC89782628396DD7B4E69A40E962F0C0" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="18 January 2013">Friday

want to ensure that the House understands that clause 15, as drafted,
provides that the Secretary of State will grant a permit to any British
national involved in such work. That will ensure that the work is
undertaken to high standards, and that a proper system is in place

protected until they can be returned to
Antarctica<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:24:41"></hs_TimeCode>. That
is important because the British Antarctic Territory has published a
heritage strategy for the conservation of the British historic huts and
other artefacts in the territory, which has been agreed with the United
Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust and the British Antarctic Survey. That
sets out overall principles for heritage conservation in the territory,
and the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust has developed such
plans, and undertakes a programme of maintenance at some of the sites,
particularly the huts, each year. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office
has granted the trust £100,000 in 2011 to support that important
work, and the Government of the British Antarctic Territory share
profits from the sale of stamps and coins, which also helps to support
the trust’s important work.</hs_Para>

protection of Antarctica’s cultural heritage. The British
historic legacy spans right across Antarctica, as do our
responsibilities under the Antarctic treaty system. It is therefore
crucial that clause 15, which is vital to the support and

shall now address the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Shipley (Philip Davies) that clause 5 be removed from the Bill. Before
I respond to my hon. Friend, I want to ensure that the House
understands exactly what clause 5 does. It places a requirement on
people who are organising activities that are to be carried out in
Antarctica, and which are connected with the United Kingdom, to take
reasonable preventive measures designed to reduce both the risk of
environmental emergencies arising from those activities and the impact
that such environmental emergencies 
<?notus-xml column=1188?>might have. The requirement must be fulfilled before the person who is

Berry:</Member></B> I reinforce the points that my hon. Friend just
made about identifying people who might pollute the Antarctic
environment, because the Bill enshrines the “polluter
pays” principle. Historically, we have found it very difficult
to identify that polluter, and often, as time has gone by, the polluter
is no longer around to remediate the damage they have done. That is why
I strongly support the specific point in the Bill that says,
“Let’s find out who the polluter is before the damage can
be done.” I think that is very
important.<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000308"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Simmonds" PimsId="697" UID="13011842000702" xid="537" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000702">Mark
Simmonds:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely pertinent
point. He is right in his assessment of the importance of both the Bill
as a whole and the “polluter pays” principle. Many of the
clauses are designed to act as a deterrent to ensure that the
appropriate mechanisms, thought and strategies have been put in place
to stop any emergency occurring and to react quickly in the unfortunate
event of an environmental emergency in
Antarctica<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13011842000520" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000520">12.30

would argue that it is essential that steps are taken to prevent
environmental emergencies occurring. It is the
Government’s view that the provisions in subsections
(4) and (5) of the 1994 Act requiring persons organising activities in
Antarctica to make contingency plans prior to their arrival in
Antarctica are entirely sensible and appropriate. They are also a
direct reflection of the requirement in article 4(1) of the liability
annex to ensure that response plans are in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000310">The
requirement to produce contingency plans in clause 5 covers a wider set
of circumstances than both the requirement to take preventive measures
and the duty to take response action under the 1994 Act, which focuses
entirely on environmental emergencies. Contingency plans should cover
environmental emergency scenarios as well as those involving other
incidents with a potential for adverse impacts on the Antarctic
environment. They also ought not to be limited only to those
emergencies and incidents that result from planned activities, but
should consider such events as may affect the carrying on of a planned
activity. Many of these elements can be foreseen and planned for and
form part of good contingency planning practice. However, it is not
necessarily expected that every potential incident could be foreseen at
the pre-planning
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000311" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000311">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) was right to raise the
importance of prevention and preventive measures. Despite the fact that
the FCO can already require someone seeking a permit for their
Antarctic activities under the Antarctic Act 1994 to take preparatory
measures—a point that was made very clearly and articulately by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley—we are strongly of the view that there is
still a need to legislate to implement fully the requirements of the
liability annex. The annex states that each party is to require its
operators to undertake these tasks, whether or not that party has prior
authorisation<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000312">Let
me address the point that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley made in relation to guidance requirements on
contingency and pre-planning which 
<?notus-xml column=1189?>already exist, as we have signed annex VI of the protocol. The guidance
that we issue requires contingency and pre-planning because it is good
practice in the UK, ahead of the curve, not because we have signed the
annex. It is therefore important that we put this into a legislative
structure. However, it will apply only to operators who apply to the
FCO for a permit, not to all UK operators, as required by the annex.
That would clearly change if we put it in a legislative
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:33:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000313">It
is clear that there is a strong connection between this provision and
the 1994 Act. For those UK operators who go through the UK’s
permitting process, and who are already subject to these, there are
clearly advantages. For these operators the Government would be keen to
ensure that there is no duplication of effort and no additional
bureaucracy arising from these
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:33:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000314">Let
me clarify a couple of points that relate to clause 5. There
was a little confusion earlier, so let me inform the House that there
is no relationship between annex V of the protocol, which provides for
the designation of sites requiring protection, and clause 5, which
seeks to ensure that all those going to Antarctica undertake
pre-planning and prepare contingency
plans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000315">So
far, six countries have ratified the protocols—Finland, Peru,
Poland, Spain, Sweden and Australia—and we very much hope to be
the seventh. I can assure the House that once the Bill is passed we
will forcefully attempt to persuade other countries to ratify as
quickly as possible so that the contents of the Bill can be implemented
as quickly as possible.</hs_Para>

is essential that clause 5 remains part of the Bill to ensure that best
practice is enshrined in UK law. That best practice is enshrined in
international law by the liability annex. The clause must also be seen
in the global context. While the liability provisions are symbolic and
central to the liability annex, they are likely to be invoked only in
very rare circumstances and are intended primarily to act as a
deterrent. The real value of the liability annex for Antarctica is the
proposed introduction of a duty on all state parties to ensure that
their operators take preventive measures and make contingency plans

I have informed the House, I visited Antarctica at the beginning of the
new year. I went with the British Antarctic Survey, supported by the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I was pleased to have the opportunity
to go there for several reasons. The first was, funnily enough, to
understand more about why this measure really matters. That became
increasingly obvious the closer I got to Rothera, the main
base  of the British Antarctic Survey, where we have up
to  90 people working in various
ways.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000331">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:42:31"></hs_TimeCode>

Antarctic Survey. What it does really matters. I would like to
emphasise the extraordinary amount of scientific research that is
undertaken at 
<?notus-xml column=1191?>Rothera and on other bases. We were there for only five days, but we
looked at all sorts of research projects. For example, there is
research into the future of the Southern ocean, its role in
absorbing carbon, its changing food chain and the
changing temperatures of the water at different levels. All of that
matters because we need to know how our changing climate is influencing
things and what the consequences might be for that continent and the
various crustaceans, fish and other wildlife living in and around
Antarctica. It was impressive and encouraging to see that the work
being done to study the ocean is of such huge value in terms of
science, research and
commitment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:43:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000332"><B><Member ContinuationText="Oliver Colvile" PimsId="5610" UID="13011842000709" xid="1110" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000709">Oliver

this, but in the very depths of the waters of Antarctica, creatures are

Carmichael:</Member></B> Absolutely, and I thank my hon. Friend for
that intervention. Not only is he right about the new discoveries, but
another interesting point is that existing marine life is taking a
different shape in terms of breeding and growth and so on because of
the changing temperatures. All that is part of the science that we need
to see, which, of course, has been helped by really interesting
technology, most particularly a glider—for gliding through the
ocean, not the air—that is able to co-ordinate its own pathway
and send valuable signals back to Rothera about what it is finding
throughout the ocean, from top to bottom and along the bottom. We
should be taking note and celebrating that kind of research and
science. There was other scientific work  as
well.</hs_Para>

an awful lot about it. It is a very important part of the work by the
British Antarctic Survey and will remain so for some time. It is

told about long-term record keeping of weather conditions, temperatures
and so forth. That is important because we cannot just take a snapshot
now and make a judgment; we need to go back some years. The British

patterns and studying changes for nearly 20 years. That knowledge base
is important and it is used by others as a benchmark for measuring
developments in climate change.</hs_Para>

Carmichael:</Member></B> Yes I did, and the ice cores are from drilling
down into ice that is 800,000 years old. That tells us a huge amount
about what was happening to the air, because trapped within the ice are
very small air bubbles that contain strong messages and signals about
what life was like all those years ago. Ice core research is a huge
logistical exercise. First it has to be drilled and transported, and
then it needs to go to Cambridge for proper evaluation.</hs_Para>

me to the important role that the British Antarctic Survey plays in
providing logistics, not just to the scientists—although that is
crucial—but to visitors and other structures. I want to
emphasise the international nature of the British Antarctic Survey. It

discoveries and the work they do.</hs_Para>

mentioned in connection with clause 5, the memorandum of understanding
between Britain and Chile was signed before Christmas and is clearly
much appreciated by the Chileans. Britain also has relationships with
other European countries, which serves to enhance the quality of the
work—not least because a Dutch contingent of scientists at
Rothera is doing important work in the invertebrates
department—and shows the level of co-operation. Co-operation is
necessary in the Antarctic continent because the risks are
great—they really are great. Not being able or willing to help
others would be a danger, but that danger does not
exist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:50:00"></hs_TimeCode> because of
those good

British Antarctic Survey performs another important role: the simple
fact of being there. It is important that Britain has a proper location

level of dedication shown by everybody at Rothera and in all parts of
the Survey’s activities. Ultimately, they are there for their
work, and for their commitment to science and to the continent.
However, by being there, they also show Britain’s commitment to
the continent. That has to be noted, celebrated and properly
recognised. For those reasons, I was pleased to go to Antarctica and
meet people from the British Antarctic Survey, to thank them for all
they have done, reassure them of my personal support and the continued
support of the Government, and underline the fact that by visiting them
we are signalling that we appreciate the things they do. We understand

appreciative of it going through Parliament, and thanked me for
promoting it. The Bill was one of the reasons I was there, and I learnt
a lot about the impact it will have on Antarctica. I saw the
appreciation from members of the British Antarctic Survey, and noticed
that other countries were also appreciative of the Bill, particularly
Chile. I was with the Chileans for some time, as we flew to Chile
before we got to Antarctica. I had the opportunity of visiting the
Chilean Antarctic Institute, which is the 
<?notus-xml column=1193?>Chilean equivalent of the British Antarctic Survey. Like us, it has a
strong science wing and recognises the importance of
logistics—although it does not use its own, but accesses other
logistical services—and like us, it recognises the importance of
international co-operation. In terms of regional geopolitics, that
co-operation is all the more important given the issues relating to the
Falkland Islands, Argentina and other nation states. The presence and
commitment that we have demonstrated in Antarctica for decades and the
relationships we are developing with nearby nation states are necessary
to ensure that our broader interests are protected and

Sir Peter Scott, the son of Captain Scott, established the Slimbridge

fact that my constituency is interested in protecting the environment

Carmichael:</Member></B> We have discussed insurance in some detail,
because there are different types of insurance—in the shipping
world, the tourist world and so forth. Obviously more products will be
developed; the key thing is that people have to demonstrate that they
are 
<?notus-xml column=1196?>properly insured. I would have thought that things such as
self-insurance and so forth will not meet the criteria set out. As more
and more people wish to go to the Antarctic and the demand for more
complex insurance mechanisms increases, I am sure that more will be
developed. The key point, as I have said, is that there is no
governance of Antarctica; therefore we need special dispensation
through the treaty and the legislation, as in the case of shipping, to
ensure that appropriate insurance cover is always made available. We
discussed that issue in the consultation process, before the Committee
stage. That is where were are; so yes, we should see more and more
insurance packages becoming available as appropriate.</hs_Para>

second part of the Bill extends protection to flora and fauna,
including invertebrates, by ensuring that we do not import problems
into Antarctica and so on. That is absolutely right and proper. When I
visited Antarctica I noticed a keen interest in that aspect of the

other aspect of the Bill is the monuments and historical sites. We

not been much climate change, although there might have been some
global warming, mainly owing to slight tilts in the earth’s
axis. However, it also found that during the 300 years since
industrialisation began, there had been a significant amount of
acidification of the atmosphere, which had produced much of the climate
change. Acidification produces rain, which falls on to the earth or
into the sea, where it is having a major impact on our fishing stocks.
There are signs that some of the plankton and krill on which fish feed
are moving. The Bill is important because it seeks to ensure that we
are much more environmentally friendly, and I hope that the Foreign

significant amount of knowledge about this subject. I was particularly
struck by the fact that he has visited the Antarctic in his endeavours
to guide this Bill through Parliament. That shows great dedication.
Buoyed by his triumph with this Bill, he may well be thinking of
introducing a future private Member’s Bill on, perhaps, the
Caribbean, and of making it his policy to visit every place his Bills
address. If he does not do that, I am sure other Members will have

Bill is important, and my hon. Friend should be immensely proud of
steering it through Parliament. As we all know, managing the progress

Fortunately, the Members who tend to erect those barriers are not

internationally binding agreements. This is a noble cause.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:24:01"></hs_TimeCode> must focus on
both environmental protection and scientific research. Our country has
a long and proud history of being at the forefront of both of those
important endeavours, and the Bill continues that tradition. This

Bill seeks to implement the liability annex to the Antarctic treaty

the first five are already in force, so this is the next stage of that
process. Determining how the environment of the Antarctic will evolve
over the next century presents challenges and has many implications for
science and for policy makers. One reason why this is so important is
that travelling to the most distant corners of our planet is becoming
more and more popular. Such travel is becoming less of an issue, less
of a challenge and more logistically possible. It is becoming more
popular for adventurous people, such as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:25:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stroud, who want to explore distant corners of the
planet. I do not think we can call them backpackers; they are just
adventurous people. That increased popularity of travel

protection to the Antarctic treaty is so important. Implementation has
been delayed and it is an outstanding issue, which is why it needs to

excellent speeches on Second Reading and, in particular, on Third
Reading today. He set out not only why this Bill is so important, but
his passion for the subject; this was not just his personal passion,
but British passion for this particular area, which goes back hundreds
of years. The UK has been actively involved in Antarctica through the

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:27:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

and something that we should all support. The liability annex
encourages parties to take response action to environmental emergencies
when those causing them have failed to do so. That takes me to the
point that my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:30:16"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry) made
about the belief that the polluter should pay. One of the key parts of
the Bill is the fact that it entrenches that principle in legislation.
He made the point that too often in the past that has not happened and
the Bill is an important step in ensuring that it does. It also enables
the Government to recover costs in those situations where they might
have had to take action to respond to an environmental emergency,
allowing them to get the cost back. That is crucial.</hs_Para>

3, on the liability to the Antarctic environmental liability fund, is
an important part of the Bill, and that probably did not come out in
the debate as much as it might have done. It is essential, because it
requires the operator responsible to pay into an Antarctic
environmental liability fund the equivalent costs of the response
action that should have been taken. That measure is more important than
many people might understand and it was previously lacking.</hs_Para>

must accept that such emergencies are not remote possibilities that
will probably never happen. We have already experienced accidents in
Antarctica that have raised ecological and safety concerns. Indeed, in
recent years some kind of incident has taken place most years and the
Bill might well help to deal with such situations. In November 2006, a
Quark Expeditions ship ran aground on Deception Island in the South
Shetland Islands. In January 2007, we had another incident in the same
area—and so on, and so forth. I shall not go through all the
examples, Mr Deputy Speaker, as there is no need to at this point.
However, accidents are not just remote possibilities. There is every
chance that the provisions in the Bill will need to be invoked at some
point.</hs_Para>

want to touch on clause 5. We had a fairly long debate on Report about
the merits of the clause and I set out the case that it was perhaps not
necessary, but having listened to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:32:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stroud and the Minister, both of whom are experts in
this field and know far more about it than I do, I think they made a
persuasive case that clause 5 is an important part of the Bill. The
duty to take preventive measures and make contingency plans is
necessary and although there might be some requirements under the 1994
Act, the clause moves things further forward, puts more requirements on
people and is a belt-and-braces approach 
<?notus-xml column=1202?>to what is required. The Minister made the point—and I was
particularly persuaded by this—that putting something in
legislation so that it applies to everybody, not just to people who are
applying for permits through the FCO, means that there is no doubt
about people’s liabilities. That was a very good point and
certainly persuaded me of the merits of clause 5.</hs_Para>

our part in protecting a very special part of the world. My hon. Friend

put it—and that is down to his skill. He should be commended for

fiction; we actually see that co-operation—everyone working for

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:39:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stroud, who I am sure came back with pockets full of it.

shall focus on two further aspects—first, the work of the
British Antarctic Survey. We heard earlier about its fantastic work on
ice cores, which provides the most persuasive evidence of the problem
of global warming in this country. The problem is man-made, created by
the burning of thousands of years’ worth of carbon within 200
years of industrialisation. I encourage those nay-sayers who say that
global warming is a myth and unproven to look at the work on ice cores
showing the changes in our atmospheric make-up and global
warming.</hs_Para>

with the British Antarctic Survey were the first to discover the hole
in the ozone layer. I was a young man when that was discovered, and it
aroused my first interest in environmental issues. I thought I
was making a great contribution when I invested in a
Vidal Sassoon hairspray that, rather than using
chlorofluorocarbons, was operated by pumping. I was pleased to see just
a few years later that CFCs were banned. That was an enormous
contribution and shows that a continent on the other side of the world
can make a huge impact on environmental policy and thinking in our
country. The continued work of the British Antarctic Survey is to be
welcomed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:41:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

is about the hugely important “polluter pays” principle
in the Bill. When the Environmental Protection Act 1990 came into
force, there was a great kerfuffle among lawyers about whether
environmental surveys of properties would devalue them and make them
unmortgageable. To some extent that has happened. That is a case where
the “polluter pays” principle has failed. I can give an
example from my constituency. Brenbar crescent in Whitworth, the site
of an historic town gas works, was thought to be polluted and there was
concern about the value of properties there. Given that the town gas
site closed some 80 or 90 years ago, it was not possible to find the
original polluter.</hs_Para>

great advantages of the Bill is the speed at which we will be able to
act to get the polluter to remediate the damage that they do to a
pristine environment. That is particularly important when we see the
increasing tourism to the Antarctic. In 1992 there were fewer than
9,000 tourists. In 2012-13 there were 26,000 tourists. That is a huge
increase in the number of people visiting the amazing and awesome place
that my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:43:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Stroud described. I can see that it is
attractive, but we cannot let that attraction and the commercial gain
of tourism companies degrade the
environment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000420" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000420">That
is why the insurance clause, clause 6, is so important. Any of us who
have booked a holiday know that it is not unheard of for travel
companies, operators and shipowners to go out of business. We cannot
allow self-insurance and the Bill does not do so, but if we look to the
proper international shipping and insurance market to ensure that we
get protection, we can enshrine the “polluter pays”
principle and make sure that when an incident occurs—they happen
too regularly already—the money is readily available and we do
not have to argue about which country should clean up the pollution. If
it is in the British Antarctic Territory, should it be cleared up by
Britain or the Chilean Government? We are not having such arguments.
There is a clear line of liability leading back to someone who has the
resource, the desire and the ability to
pay<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:44:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000421" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000421">With
100,000 bird species, flora and fauna in the Antarctic, it is not a
desert or a desolate land. It is somewhere we must work hard to

Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport (Oliver Colvile)
spoke about the new discoveries of creatures there this year. It is
amazing to think that on a planet where we think we know everything
about everything and all the animals under heaven, we can still be
surprised to find things in this amazing environment that are new to
us. We have to be very careful that we are not losing species before we
even know they exist, because then we will not know we have lost them.
It is important that the Bill proposes a ban on commercial fishing,

it is such a rich

I want to speak about the Royal Navy’s contribution to the area.
We all believe in this House, I am sure, that we have the finest armed
services in the world. I have been involved with the armed forces
parliamentary scheme and have had the great privilege of seeing some of
the work undertaken by members of our armed forces, particularly the
Royal Navy. We might be complaining today about the icy conditions
outside, but the lowest recorded temperature in the Antarctic is minus
85°. We must pay tribute to those 
<?notus-xml column=1205?>serving on HMS Protector, who are spending long periods there, on HMS
Endurance, on HMS Scott and on other Royal Navy ships that go to the
area to police it and to rescue people who find themselves in trouble.

our armed forces who ensure that the global co-operation on keeping

Having come seventh in the ballot he could easily have picked one of
his own pet causes to promote, but instead he nobly took on the job of
piloting this measure, which at first sight might not seem the most
populist ever brought before this House but concerns a matter of great
importance. It is testament to the Bill’s lengthy gestation
period that it passed through its Second Reading so quickly in November

may wonder why such an important measure has been left to the vagaries
of the private Members’ Bill system. I might have missed it, but
I could not see it in the coalition’s original programme for
government. Given the nature and content of the Bill, I find that
fairly surprising. I would have thought that, in view of its
cross-party nature and cross-party support, it would have been an ideal
measure to put in the coalition’s programme for
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:48:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000426" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000426">I
am conscious that we have not yet heard from the Minister, so I will
restrict my remarks to one aspect of the Bill—its effect on
visitors to the Antarctic. Increasing visitor numbers is a good thing,
because it is good that more people are interested in exploring the
world and our environment. Television programmes such as the
“Frozen Planet” series will undoubtedly have had the
effect of publicising the splendour of the Antarctic to a wider
audience. However, higher visitor numbers undeniably bring a greater
risk to that precious environment. It is for that reason that we need
the Bill desperately. We are putting into law the maxim that prevention
is better than cure, which is a good maxim to follow in matters of
environmental
protection.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011842000427" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011842000427">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:50:09"></hs_TimeCode>
have heard that the number of tourists has increased enormously in
recent years. That is partly because of the growing diversity in the
nature of the tourism that is available, with more activity-based
tourism such as diving, kayaking and extended walks. People no longer
go just to look at the millions and millions of penguins that live in
the Antarctic. Activity-based tourism brings different potential
impacts on the environment from the traditional forms of
tourism.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) that the Bill is not
just of academic interest. Sadly, there have been occasions on which
ships have sunk. In November 2007, the MS Explorer struck submerged ice
with 154 crew and passengers on board and sank. Mercifully, all those
on board were rescued, thanks to a passing Norwegian cruise liner.
However, that example demonstrates that as more ships visit the region,
there is a risk that accidents will happen that damage the

in response to my hon. Friend’s remarks relates to education,
and I confirm that the British Antarctic Survey and the Royal

activity in Antarctica has increased significantly over past decades,
and the number of countries party to the Antarctic treaty has risen
from an original 12 signatories in 1959, to 50 today. As I said, in
1992-93, fewer than 9,000 tourists visited Antarctica, but by 2012-13
that number had increased threefold to 26,000. In addition to the
number of tourists visiting Antarctica, in the mid-1970s only the
original 12 signatories to the treaty had established research bases
there. The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs currently
lists 80 stations, and growing global interest in Antarctica as both a

consequences of an environmental emergency in Antarctica could be
devastating. Antarctica is one of the world’s most pristine
natural environments, if not the most pristine. The Southern ocean is
surprisingly biologically diverse, and much of the Antarctic landscape
is virtually untouched by man. On its own that is enough to make an
environmental emergency potentially devastating, and the
continent’s remoteness, harsh operating conditions and relative
lack of infrastructure serve only to exacerbate any potential
impacts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:58:00"></hs_TimeCode>. It is

crucial that the treaty parties continuously look ahead and make sound,
proactive decisions about future management. Co-operation has worked in
the past and we it hope it will continue to do so. With an increase in
the number of parties engaged, it is dependent not only on the

environmental protection measures and careful conservation of the
Southern ocean. The Government remain resolute in our commitment to the
indefinite prohibition of commercial exploitation of Antarctic
minerals. We will continue to promote the values and importance of
Antarctica, and ensure that the British historic and scientific legacy
is promoted and conserved. Working with key partners, such as the Scott
Polar Research Institute and the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, we want
to ensure that future generations can continue to be inspired by the
endeavours of our forefathers. Most importantly, the Government

use of wild animals in television and film. There is a recognition that
they form an important part of our creative industries, and that there

the heart of this debate is a conflict at the heart of Government

pathological aversion to anything that protects animal welfare. DEFRA
Ministers’ inability to make a decision and stick to it or,
crucially, to get their civil servants to act on their decisions has
long been a potent source of comedy for this House. The Government have
spent 18 months and £261,000, as well as thousands of staff
hours and hours in meetings with charities, preparing for a licensing

lack of political will. It is time for another DEFRA U-turn. Let us
have the ban on wild animals in British circuses. Too much time, too
many resources and too much money have been wasted already. The
Government need to get on with legislating for a ban to end this era of

it. The Government have already announced that they will be seeking to
introduce primary legislation to ban the use of wild animals in
travelling circuses. The Government’s policy in this area was
set out in two written ministerial statements, on 1 March 2012 and 12
July 2012. We further announced on 12 July that we would seek to
publish draft legislation this Session for pre-legislative scrutiny
that would outline our proposals for a ban. That position has not
changed. I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that DEFRA is working

Government fully recognise that—as has been mentioned
today—the use of wild animals in travelling circuses generates
significant public and parliamentary interest. In 2009, when DEFRA
consulted on the question of a ban, 94.5% of the 10,000 respondents
supported it. Since the start of the current Parliament, DEFRA has
handled more than 120 parliamentary questions and 16,500 items of
correspondence on the subject of wild animals in travelling circuses.
There have been five debates in Parliament—including two on the
licensing regulations in October 2012—supplemented by five
early-day motions with a total of 223 signatures. Many Members have
called for a ban, and during the Backbench Business Committee debate on
23 June 2011, which was mentioned earlier, the House agreed on a motion
directing the Government to introduce a ban on the use of wild animals
in travelling
circuses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011844000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011844000025">It
should be borne in mind, however, that a ban introduced solely on
welfare grounds might be vulnerable to successful legal challenge. The
Radford report on the welfare of wild animals in travelling circuses,
which was commissioned, accepted and published by the last Government
in 2007, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to ban the use
of wild animals in travelling circuses on welfare grounds. In
particular, Radford concluded that there was little evidence to
demonstrate that the welfare of animals in circuses was any better or
worse than their welfare in any other captive environment. We respect
that piece of research and the people who carried it out, but I think
that Parliament has expressed a clear opinion that reflects opinions in
the country at large, and that is what is guiding our actions
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011844000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011844000026">I
hate to use cheap clichés such as the one about the elephant in
the room, but it must be said that the recent high-profile court case
focusing on allegations of cruelty to Anne, a circus elephant, has
rekindled legitimate public interest and concern about the treatment of
wild animals in travelling circuses. However, the outcome of that case
is not in itself an indicator of endemic or systematic failure to
promote welfare in travelling circuses. It would simply not be
responsible to proceed with a ban without being confident that we would
be safe from legal challenge. I think we are now approaching a point at
which we know how to deal with the issue. In any 
<?notus-xml column=1216?>case, the new licensing regulations will ensure that good welfare
standards are in place for any circus that wants to use wild animals in
the short term before the ban comes into

that welfare was compromised; and that an outright ban might be beyond

authorities, including Cherwell district council, have been working
hard on developing a new local plan. Cherwell published its proposed
new local plan last August. Its details can be found at
www.cherwell.gov.uk/localdevelopmentframeworks. The draft Cherwell
local plan looks forward for the next 20 years and beyond. It sets out
how the area will grow and evolve in the period up to 2031. Cherwell
district council estimates that between 2006 and 2031 we are going to
need to build some 16,750 new homes in Cherwell, of which
2,542 were built by 2011. The intention is that between 2011
and 2031 some 14,208 new houses will be provided, with 6,997 new houses
being built in Bicester, 4,352 new houses being built in Banbury, and
1,709 new houses being built in the rest of the

draft plan rightly seeks to utilise brownfield sites wherever possible,
including the canal-side development in Banbury, on which it is now
possible to build as a consequence of the construction of the Banbury
flood defences and the fact that the land is now no longer within a
potential flood plain. It also seeks to use significant building on
brownfield land in Bicester as a consequence of the Ministry of Defence
divesting itself of some 227 hectares of land from MOD storage
distribution lands. So, over the survey period, Bicester will see
nearly 7,000 new houses being built. Part of the new development will
involve the new eco-town project, and I hope that Bicester can become a
new garden city.

as fast over the past 30 years as Banbury and Bicester, and they
continue to grow. Cherwell is a district that is determined to make
robust and credible housing provision for the future. The consultation
on the draft local plan proposals concluded last October. I understand
that elected councillors will consider final submissions and
suggestions at a meeting next month. It will then be a matter of
waiting for the Planning Inspectorate to be able to appoint an

Likewise, planning applications that do not accord with the adopted

that Cherwell district council has failed to make planning provision
for new houses, but rather that house builders and developers have
failed to build new houses, for which they have been granted planning
permission. Such sites include: Bodicote/Bankside in Banbury, which has
planning permission for 1,092 homes; Heyford Park, at Upper Heyford,
which was itself subject to a lengthy planning inquiry a number of
years ago and which has planning permission for some 700 new houses;
and the Kingsmere estate at Bicester, where progress is comparatively
slow because developers and house builders are building new houses only
at the rate that they are selling built
houses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011844000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011844000058">Cherwell
is not unusual in that regard, as the Local Government Association
reports significant land banking across the country. The Local
Government Association estimates that there are some 400,000 approved
units with planning approval across the country. Indeed, the LGA has
illustrated its figures on an interactive map, available at
www.local.gov.uk/mapping-unimplemented-planning-permissions-by-local-authority-area,
which allows anyone to click on to any local planning authority to
acquire their figures on approved but unimplemented planning
applications<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T14:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011844000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011844000059">Of
course the district council, district councillors and local people have
no control over the rate at which house builders build houses once
planning permissions have been granted. There is no scintilla of a
suggestion that Cherwell district council has granted planning
permissions to developers other than in complete good faith in the
expectation that house building would follow reasonably swiftly after
the planning permissions had been granted. House builders and
developers are making opportunist planning applications on sites that
they consider to be the most attractive and their arguments, put
simply, run something along these lines: Cherwell district council does
not have an adopted local plan, and because it has no local plan
housing should be allowed to go anywhere in the district and, as it is
alleged that Cherwell does not have an adequate five-year housing
supply, any new houses, wherever they are built, should be allowed on
appeal on the basis that any new houses wherever in the district they
are built will count in some five-year housing supply figure. That is
planning anarchy. It effectively means that house builders and
developers who get their planning applications in  
<?notus-xml column=1221?>first, irrespective of where they are and irrespective of the number of
houses, expect those applications to be granted, if not by local
councillors, on
appeal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T14:41:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011844000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011844000060">If
that continues to happen it will completely undermine any concept of a
local plan-led system and any concept of localism and neighbourhood
planning. I obviously do not expect the Minister to comment on any
individual planning application and I fully appreciate that it would
indeed be improper for him to do so. However, I want simply by way of
example to highlight the sort of difficulties about which I am
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T14:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011844000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011844000061">In
the draft local plan, Cherwell district councillors have determined
that the southern boundary of Banbury should be an ancient trackway
known as the Salt way. Not unreasonably, local councillors are keen
that Banbury should have some reasonably well defined boundaries. They
are also keen that there should be clear green buffers made between
Banbury and surrounding villages to make sure that they maintain their
own identities and prevent areas from

seems to me to be a wholly reasonable and proportionate policy
objective for a local planning authority to want to set planning
boundaries and to ensure adequate green spaces between towns and other
communities. A local landowner recently applied to build 150 houses on
land below the Salt way. The application was refused, the applicants
went to appeal and it is now clear that other landowners and developers
who own options on land below the Salt way are not waiting to argue at
the examination in public that their sites should be included in the
new local plan. Those landowners and developers are now simply
submitting planning applications in the hope that under the present
system, whereby Cherwell does not have the protection of an adopted
local plan and whereby they hope to persuade a planning inspector that
Cherwell does not have an adequate five-year housing supply, any
housing, built anywhere, will be

developers are making planning applications for housing in villages
that they consider to be particularly popular and attractive, even
though such villages are required by the emerging local plans to take
only limited new development consistent with Cherwell district

Bicester. It is particularly galling that some of those house builders
have had planning permissions to build on sizable sites elsewhere in
the district, but have failed to build houses and now seek to pray in
aid the fact that those houses were not built as grounds for being
allowed to build houses elsewhere in the district where they would
prefer to build—not where local councillors or local communities
want them built, but where house builders decide they want them to be
built. Again, I suggest to the Minister that that is akin to
anarchy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T14:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011844000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/debtext/130118-0002.htm#13011844000064">What

me turn to the issue that my hon. Friend raised about sites that have

Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark), now the Financial
Secretary to the Treasury. The framework is very clear that sites with
planning permission should be considered deliverable until that
planning permission expires unless they have become clearly and
demonstrably unviable. I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree that
if, for instance, a scheme were proposed, perhaps in the heady years of
the boom, that was even then a marginal scheme the economics of which
did not seem to stack up, it would not be sensible for it to be
considered a deliverable part of the five-year plan that the council is

associated with the original application. There needs to be clear
evidence, which will be considered by the inspector in their

welcome the Comptroller and Auditor-General’s (C&amp;AG) report
on the trust statement which recognises the improvements HMCTS has made
in its accounts. The statement shows in 2011-12 HMCTS collected more
than £484 million from offenders. A record
£22.3 million in compensation has been paid to
victims of crime—funded by criminals’ cash and assets
recovered through confiscation orders. During 2011-12 the total value

deported or who cannot be located, £40
million (3%) relates to orders which are being appealed and cannot be
enforced while under appeal; and £154 million (13%) relates to

occupational pension scheme, which is managed centrally by the
Secretary of State. As an unfunded scheme, there is no actual fund,
instead the Department maintains a single notional fund for all members
and employers, which is used to set the contribution rate. The TPS is
entirely separate from the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) and,
as part of the reform of public sector pension schemes, these different
funding methods will be maintained. There are therefore no plans to
include teachers' pensions for converted academies in local
authorities' pension pools, and the level of pension the teachers
receive should be unaffected by the academy
conversion.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_18_PT_1/4FE6266C95328D751B6471110C01C52B7F18CF1D" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="18 January 2013">Friday

October 2012 International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) reported
that the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP)
had reached their surge targets of 187,000 and 157,000 respectively.
These figures include all personnel who have been recruited, but not
all have yet been inducted at the training centres. The most recent
figures published by ISAF show that at 20 November 2012 the ANA stood
at an inducted/fielded force of 174,645 and 148,499. By the end of
February 2013 all recruited personnel are expected to have been
inducted into their respective Service with all personnel fully
trained, equipped and fielded by the end of 2013. Nationally, the
Afghan Local Police (ALP) currently stand at approximately 18,500 at
the end of December 2012, with approximately 600 of these at the UK
mentored sites in central
Helmand.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011846000361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/text/130118w0001.htm#13011846000361">The

Task Force Helmand, specific responsibility for the development of the
fielded ANSF is primarily provided by the UK Brigade Advisory Group
(BAG) and the Police Mentoring and Advisory Group (PMAG). As transition
continues, the level at which we mentor the ANA and ANP is lifting so
that by the end of 2013 we no longer expect to routinely mentor the
ANSF below Brigade level. In tandem, the Afghan Uniformed Police are
also taking greater responsibility for the training and recruitment of
the ALP. The UK's role in both has therefore decreased and we now have
limited involvement with their recruitment and a reduced role in their
training.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13011846000043" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/text/130118w0001.htm#13011846000043">Armed

Robathan:</Member></B> Members of the armed forces have a commitment to
service worldwide and their remuneration package is structured
accordingly. The level of pay for service personnel is set
by the Government based on the recommendations of the Armed Forces' Pay
Review Body (AFPRB). The 2012 AFPRB report states
that average working hours for junior ranks, which for the
Army is private to corporal across all services were 45.5
hours per week during 2010-11, which equates to an hourly
base pay rate of £7.28. On a comparable basis, a
soldier earning around £18,842 a year would equate to
an hourly base pay rate  of
£7.96.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13011846000373" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/text/130118w0001.htm#13011846000373">It
is inevitable that when soldiers are on operations they will work
longer than average hours. However, where eligible, soldiers will
receive the operational allowance and the longer separation allowance.

Interdependencies is an estimate of the knock-on effects of disability
living allowance (DLA) overpayments on caring and disability premiums
on income-related benefits, which depend on the rate of DLA in
payment.  <Sup>2</Sup> Social fund (SF) estimates are included
in the “Others” category. SF official error estimates are
derived from a continuous measurement exercise which covered the period
April 2011 to March 2012. It is estimated that 4.0% of expenditure was
overpaid due to official error corresponding to £8.7 million of
net 2011-12 expenditure (which was in total £220 million). The
confidence intervals surrounding this estimate were [3.2%-4.7%] or
[£7 million to £10 million].  <Sup>3</Sup>
“Others” includes council tax benefit and unreviewed
benefits (unreviewed benefits are Christmas bonus, employment support
allowance, maternity allowance, statutory sick pay, statutory maternity
pay, industrial disablement benefit, industrial death benefit, other
industrial injuries benefits, attendance allowance, specialised vehicle
allowance, winter fuel payments, social fund, discretionary housing
payments, over-75 TV licence, job grant, new deals, small benefits, new
enterprise allowance, severe disability allowance, cold weather
payments, widow's benefit/bereavement benefit, return-to-work credit,
in-work credit and state pension transfers). These benefits have never
been subject to a specific review as they tend to have relatively low
expenditure, which means that it is not cost-effective to undertake a
review. For these benefits the estimates are based on assumptions about
the likely level of error.  <I>Notes:</I><I>  </I>1.
Expenditure rounded to the nearest £0.1 billion.  2.
Official error rounded to the nearest £l0 million.  3.

Webb:</Member></B> We are not seeking to provide a definition in law of
'vulnerable tenants’ for the purposes of administering UC. Any
attempt to do so would risk some people with needs failing outside of
any definitions and thus not receiving the help that they may need. We
accept that for a minority of claimants alternative payment
arrangements may be required and this may include the payment of their
housing costs (rent) direct to the landlord. This alternative payment
arrangement will be considered on a case by case basis and assessed on
their individual merits, and would be time-limited and delivered in
conjunction with appropriate budgeting support to ensure claimants make
a successful transition over time to monthly budgeting wherever
possible.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13011846001333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/text/130118w0002.htm#13011846001333"><B><Member PimsId="488" UID="13011846001780" xid="515" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130118/text/130118w0002.htm#13011846001780">Chris

Office, which advises that the European Council conclusion of 16 June
2005 called on Israel to 
<?notus-xml column=986?>halt settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories,
including the abolition of financial and tax incentives and direct and
indirect subsidies, and the withdrawal of exemptions benefiting the
settlements and their inhabitants. This conclusion did not place
obligations upon individual EU member states, but rather, confirmed
Europe's political commitment to the resolution of the middle east
conflict. It also exhorted all parties to the middle east peace process
to continue to take positive steps to ensure peace, and comply with
obligations under international law. The British Government's position
on Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is
clear: they are illegal under international law, an obstacle to peace
and make a two-state solution, with Jerusalem as a shared capital,
harder to achieve. The UK routinely condemns decisions taken to build
settlement units, calling for these decisions to be reversed, and for
Israel to cease all settlement activity.</hs_Para>

was awarding its Front Office Counter Services contract to Post Office

the contract to continue to create further innovative solutions for

states regarding travel advice. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's
(FCO) travel advice provides information and advice to help British
nationals stay safe abroad. The safety of British nationals is our main

the risks applicable to its own nationals. The FCO does, however,
regularly exchange information with EU partners about travel advice and
other consular

October 2012, <I>Official Report,</I> column 1025W. The British embassy
in Sana'a continues to offer a limited consular service to British
nationals in Yemen given the range of security challenges within the
country. Any decision to provide a fuller range of consular services
will be judged against the security implications for staff serving at
our embassy in Sana'a, and will be fully reflected in the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office travel advice which can be found on our website
and, at the present time, advises against all travel to
Yemen.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-01-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_18_PT_1/Index/A1A6EBE42BDA187E54D84FD0921B7246CEDE2B47" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="25" cday="Friday" cmonth="January" cyear="2013" date="18" day="Friday" issue="99" maxparts="1" month="January" part="1" price="5@010c00" printing="daily" session="201213" type="back" volume="556" year="2013"><tocdate col="1143">Friday
