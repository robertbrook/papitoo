That risks increasing the benefits bill, as most will go into the
private rented sector where rents are higher. However, I want to ask
for a clear assurance about the brave men and women serving in the

millionaires, I gather they are hankering after the halcyon days when
they used to pay only 40% income tax and 18% capital gains tax. On his
point about service personnel, let me make it absolutely clear that in
the case of a couple with a young adult who is going off to serve with
the forces, when that young person leaves the home to serve on the
front-line we cease to assume that they are making a rent contribution.
When that person goes off to serve, the housing benefit will, in
general, go up.</hs_Para>

the full rate of national insurance, which is an extra 1.4%, but they

that we were left. We are already bearing down on the problem. The
figures show that we are making inroads into welfare fraud. Universal
credit will have a much better record in this area, because we will be
able to use real-time information to check up on who is in work and
what they are earning on a monthly basis, rather than having to wait
until the end of somebody’s time on tax credits at the end of a
year and reconcile the figures over a long period. Under the current
tax credits system, £5 billion has been written off as a result
of fraud and error, and it looks like another £5 billion will
also be written
off.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000094"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Rob Wilson" PimsId="4849" UID="13012811000423" xid="878" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000423">Mr

born on the same day will get a higher pension, that is simply not
necessarily the case. People are wrongly comparing the £144 flat
rate with the £107 basic pension, plus a variable
SERPS—state earnings-related pension scheme—pension, so
the figure might be higher, but it might be lower. The new system is
not more generous overall than the one it replaces. All I would say,
through the hon. Lady to her mother, is that a man born on the same day
as her mother will draw his pension significantly later, so she will
have the benefit of that pension for perhaps up to two years more than
a man born on the same day.</hs_Para>

would like to make three further points. The first is about the need
for the line. HS2 will be the first main line to be built north of
London for almost 120 years. Some say we do not need another, but the
truth is that we are already good at squeezing the most out of our
present Victorian railway network—and yes, we will get even more
out of it in the coming years with the massive investment we have
already announced. We are electrifying 800 miles of track, and building
Crossrail and the northern hub upgrade. These will help to keep us
going for the next decade or two, but what
then?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000186">Rail
passenger numbers have doubled over the last 15 years, and
demand will keep growing. The west coast main line is filling up. There
is not enough space for all the commuters, freight trains and
inter-city trains that need to use it. That is why, after very careful
consideration, I am publishing my initial preferences for phase 2 of
HS2. The case for going ahead rests on the capacity it will provide and
on the new connections it will create. It is not just about
faster trains to London, but about changing the way in which our great
cities work and work with each other, providing easy links on journeys
that are difficult today, giving muscle to the economies of the cities
beyond London and producing an estimated £2 in economic benefit
for every £1
spent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000187">Frequently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:34:33"></hs_TimeCode>,
colleagues in this House call for better services to their local
stations—they are right to ask for them—and High Speed 2
is part of the solution. Creating free space on existing routes will
allow better services to places such as Milton Keynes, and more
trains for commuters in areas such as Staffordshire, Leeds and
Manchester. I am determined to ensure that the benefits of HS2 run much
wider than the places directly served by the new
line.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000188"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:34:50"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me turn to my second point. The detail of the route I am announcing
today follows the Government’s announcements last year about
phase 1 between London and Birmingham. On the western leg from
Birmingham to Manchester, I propose two new high-speed stations. 
<?notus-xml column=672?>The first will be in the heart of Manchester, alongside the existing
station at Manchester Piccadilly, allowing easy connections to places
such as Salford, Stockport and Bolton and a journey time to London of
just one hour eight minutes, down from over two hours today.

station will be at Manchester airport, giving direct access to the

serve Crewe via a dedicated link, and high-speed trains will continue
on the existing railway to Liverpool, Warrington and Runcorn, which
will also benefit greatly from reduced journey times. Further north,
near Wigan, HS2 will connect with the west coast main line. High-speed
trains can then continue at regular speeds to places such as Preston,
Carlisle, Glasgow and Edinburgh. I am working with counterparts in
Scotland on their aspirations for high-speed rail. I have already set
out a long-term ambition to get journeys to Scotland below three
hours.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000190">Turning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:36:29"></hs_TimeCode>
to the eastern leg, we will construct three new stations to bring
people and businesses in the east midlands and Yorkshire closer to
Birmingham, the north-east and London. The east midlands station will
be located between Nottingham and Derby at Toton, and links will be
upgraded to provide fast access to both. The second station will be at
Sheffield Meadowhall, which already has good connections that can be
improved further, allowing it to serve all of Sheffield and south
Yorkshire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000191">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:37:08"></hs_TimeCode>
third station will be located in the centre of Leeds alongside the
South Bank area. As with the western leg, there will be a connection
from HS2 on to the existing rail network. A connection to the east
coast main line, just nine miles from York, will allow the north-east
to benefit, too, with London to York taking just one hour 23 minutes

a decision on how best to serve Heathrow will be taken after the

than now via a major new interchange at Old Oak Common, linking to the

third point I want to make today is about design and help for those
most affected. Many hon. Members want the Government to take that
extremely seriously, and we do. Although the line will benefit the
country as a whole, it will also create great anxiety among those close
to the proposed route. We will therefore consult properly, design
carefully and compensate fairly. Let me stress that today I am
announcing an initial preferred route: this is the start of the
process, not the end. We are ready to listen, and ready to improve. I
want this line to create jobs and prosperity, not harm them. Where
businesses may be affected, we will work with them to find a solution.
We will now begin a period of informal consultation on phase 2 that
will inform the official public consultation, which was originally
planned for 2014 but which, I can announce, will be brought forward to
this year. The aim is to reach a firm decision on the route of phase 2
in 2014.</hs_Para>

understand how such proposals can affect property markets. Compensation
will therefore be as generous as on the first phase, and more generous
than when we built the motorways. Today I am launching a public
consultation on the exceptional hardship scheme for 
<?notus-xml column=673?>those who must sell but cannot do so because of HS2. Under this scheme
we will pay the full price, valued as if there were no HS2. That will

Secretary of State was generous enough to say in his foreword to the
Government’s Command Paper, which was published today, HS2 is a
project that was started by the last Government. Having successfully
built HS1, Britain’s first new railway line for more than 100
years, we were determined that the rest of the country, not just the
south-east, should benefit from vital investment to increase capacity
and reduce journey times on our
railway.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000198">I
assure the Secretary of State and the House that we are 100% behind
this project. We want to see the line built, and we will continue to
offer cross-party support, which will include helping to ensure that
the necessary legislation reaches the statute book. I know that the
Secretary of State faces considerable challenges in securing the
support of colleagues on his side of the House. I have spent much of
today defending the project in interviews opposite Conservative
Members. I hope and assume that the right hon. Gentleman’s
lengthy experience as Chief Whip will come in handy when it comes to
quelling the
rebellions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000199">The
reason why we need to build this new high-speed railway line is clear:
capacity. Our existing three main routes between north and south are
congested, and in the case of the west coast line, nearly full. If we
do not act now, we will face even worse overcrowding. Doing nothing is
not an option. Continuing to patch and mend our existing lines is no
longer good enough, and will not bring us the major reductions in
journey times that HS2 will
deliver.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000200">Given
the importance of the scheme, I wonder whether the Secretary of State
appreciates the level of frustration at the slow progress made so far
in the current Parliament. The consultation on the first phase has been
botched, not by him, but in his Department. Submissions have been lost,
and the Government now face defeat in the courts, which has the
potential to take us back to square one on the consultation. The draft
route for the second phase was finally set out only today, two and a
half years after the election. No legislation has been published.
Today’s Command Paper suggests that Royal Assent to the
Secretary of State’s first hybrid Bill will not be achieved
until some point in 2015, not by the time of the next election as was
previously intended. This scheme is too important to be subject either
to further delays or to incompetence in the Department for Transport. I
hope that the Secretary of State will now do all that he can both to
speed up progress and to avoid any further errors.</hs_Para>

judicial review, will the Secretary of State update the
House on when he expects to receive a judgment, and on the impact that
a ruling against his Department would have on the plans that he has set
out
today?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000202">Let
me now turn to the specific details of the route announced by the
Secretary of State. First, will the right hon. Gentleman think again
about his decision to commit himself only to introducing legislation
covering the first phase of the line from London to Birmingham in the
current Parliament? Of course it is true that a single Bill would need
to await completion of the consultation on the second phase of the
route, but by introducing the Bill later in this Parliament and
carrying it over to the next—as we did with the legislation for
the building of Crossrail—we would secure Parliament’s
approval for the whole route earlier than we would under the
Government’s plans. That would open up the possibility of
beginning construction in the north as well as the south, which is
something that the Transport Committee has urged the Government to
consider.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000203">Secondly,
will the Secretary of State look again at the issue of connectivity
between HS1 and HS2, which many, including his own party’s Mayor
of London and also Transport for London, believe to be totally
inadequate? The proposal to make use of an existing part of the North
London line looks like a back-of-an-envelope fix that is not focused on
the long-term potential for international rail travel. Surely we need
to build a dedicated, purpose-built link between HS1 and HS2.
I urge him to look at this
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000204">Thirdly,
will the Secretary of State listen carefully to the concerns that he
will have heard today about the decision not to connect HS2 with our
major city centres in some instances? I appreciate the difficulty, not
least in terms of engineering and cost, of taking a new rail line into
an existing major rail station and enabling through services, yet the
consequences of not doing so are potentially economically to
disadvantage city centres and encourage out-of-town development; and
passengers losing much of the journey time savings achieved by using
the new line as they transfer to get to their city centre destination.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:44:32"></hs_TimeCode>I know that
there are differing views on this from city to city, and there is no
single right answer, but the Secretary of State’s proposals
today make it clear that the recommendations are just
“initial” recommendations and I hope that that indicates
a willingness to continue a dialogue on these issues, not least with
the cities
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000205">Finally,
will the Secretary of State accept that today’s decision to kick
into the long grass how HS2 will connect to Heathrow is a major error?
As he knows, our preference, as a result of our policy review, is to
take the line direct via Heathrow. That was the Conservative
party’s position before the last election and I am sorry that it
no longer supports it. However, the Government’s compromise of a
spur was at least a recognition of the need to provide a direct link to
Heathrow from HS2. Abandoning that today sets back the potential for
HS2 to deliver transfer traffic to our hub airport via high-speed rail
rather than short-haul flights, an approach that has the potential to
free up valuable slots that could be used for new long-haul flights to
serve emerging
markets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012811000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0001.htm#13012811000206">The
Secretary of State says that that decision has been taken because the
Davies commission on aviation will not report back before 2015. Surely
the answer is not to delay decisions on HS2 but to speed them up on 
<?notus-xml column=675?>aviation. Will the Government finally accept that 2015 is far too late
to have an answer to our longer-term aviation capacity needs? Will he
agree to our call for the commission to produce its final report way in
advance of 2015, enabling cross-party talks on a way forward that can
be put to people at the next election? That would deliver the certainty
needed not just for aviation, but on the route for HS2.</hs_Para>

that HS1 was finished by the previous Government, but if we needed to
get into a debating argument, I could say that it was started by the
previous Conservative Government, who had the foresight to say how
important it would be. Anyone who uses St Pancras station will

is the start of the process and not the end of it, but I say to her

regions, and so this goes a lot wider than just the cities. Some cities
will have a station in them, because of the way in which things have
been constructed and the way in which we can engineer into them. In
certain other areas the engineering is much more difficult and a lot
more expensive, but as I have said, we will of course listen. I have
engaged with the city leaders—I know that some of them will be
disappointed that I have not been able to say to those cities exactly
where the route has gone until today—and so that process is

It is a fact that no new railway line has been built north of London

we are to add to the capacity, it is right that we should take

Gentleman in this matter. There are two points to mention.
First, he can pursue the route of tabling questions on the Order Paper
to highlight his continuing concerns and the absence thus far of a
response to them. Secondly, I note in passing that the
Deputy Leader of the House is in his place, and that in my experience
the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the House are always
attentive to parliamentary courtesies. If the hon. Gentleman has been
promised a response or some other commitment has been made to him,
which has not yet been honoured, I say in all seriousness to him that
that will be a source of some legitimate concern to the Deputy Leader
of the House. Indeed, it is conceivable that the two of them might wish
to have a chat outside the Chamber. I do not know; we shall

must have a sense of humour. Today, as I am sure you know, Mr Speaker,
is the anniversary of the death of his late Majesty King Henry VIII, so
it seems only appropriate that we should be discussing the Succession
to the Crown Bill on such an anniversary. After all, King Henry
introduced three succession to the Crown Bills, and some of the
problems we are dealing with today originate with his
reign<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:51:26"></hs_TimeCode>. I have

clause 1 is the crucial part of what I am proposing. It is a
development within the context of the Bill to attend not just to one
discrimination but to a second that is inherent within the current
rules governing the succession. From time immemorial, the
succession has gone to the eldest male heir, but since the Act
of Settlement 1701 it has had to go to a Protestant. There has been a
religious discrimination as well as discrimination on the grounds of
sex. My new clause seeks to amend that to allow for anybody of any
faith to succeed to the Crown while making provision for the
established
Church<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:52:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

countries in the world have a Crown that is only temporal; they do not
have a Crown that is spiritual as well. The mediaevalists debated at
great length where power should rest in those two spheres, and I do not
wish to rehearse the schoolmen’s arguments. There are, however,
two distinct and separate powers and authorities: the temporal one that
deals with the laws we live by and how we should lead our lives in
respect of society; and the spiritual one that looks to the higher
plane and the greater authority that comes with religious belief and
religious
conviction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:53:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012834000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0002.htm#13012834000013">In
our country, those two powers are merged in the Crown. The
Crown is both the spiritual head of the Church and the temporal head of
the nation for one part—and one part only—of the Crown.
On Tuesday last week, on Second Reading and indeed in Committee, we
debated whether that was right and how it applied in a more
modern age. It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:53:40"></hs_TimeCode>
is worth looking, as we did last week, at some of the detail.
Because the Queen is Supreme Governor of the Church of England, she is
or has under her an established Church in Scotland, but she is not
formally head of it. She puts in a Lord High Commissioner to represent
her at meetings of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, but
she is not the Supreme Governor of the established Church in Scotland
in the way she is Supreme Governor of the Church of England. There is
no established Church in Wales; there is no established Church in
Northern Ireland. As far as I am aware, there is no established Church
in Antigua and Barbuda, in Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize,
Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, St
Christopher-Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, the Solomon
islands, Tuvalu or in Her Majesty’s other realms and
territories. When we deal with one discrimination but not the other,
therefore, we leave a discrimination that applies only to a very small
part of the totality of the Crown.</hs_Para>

Friend not been meeting His Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales last Tuesday, he would have heard the debate on an amendment that
I tabled to clarify this matter, because the current Bill, rather than
maintaining any system of primogeniture, might simply create co-heirs.
Of course, the concept of monarchy has an unfairness
in it—the very word “monarchy” means that one will
rule; it cannot be everybody in the country. However, the reasons for
having discrimination on the grounds of faith—in 1688,
formalised in the Act of Settlement in 1701—are very different
from those that apply today.</hs_Para>

if you think back to Richard the Lionheart, Mr Speaker, as I am sure
you often do, with his fine statue outside the House of Lords, you will
acknowledge that it had been necessary since time immemorial to have a
king who was able to fight, lead armies in battle and show his great
strength, and that was easier for a male than for a female. The last
king to lead troops into battle was George II.</hs_Para>

therefore, there may have been reasons for having a religious
discrimination, a discrimination on the grounds of sex, and the obvious
discrimination within a monarchy of it being rule by one. As the
discrimination on the grounds of sex is no longer necessary, or can no
longer be argued for logically, nor can exclusions on the grounds of

reason for the religious bar in the late 17th and early 18th century

Catholic nations in Europe. In the reign of Elizabeth I, of course, the
Spanish had been the threat, but by the reign of Queen Anne, the French
were the greater concern. Through the secret treaty of Dover, Louis XIV

I also think that the law should represent the reality. It is
inconceivable that if a sovereign of Canada—including,
obviously, Quebec—decided to convert to Roman Catholicism, that
sovereign would be deposed, thrown out and replaced. I think that even
in this country and even with an established Church, we cannot accept
the idea that a sovereign on the throne who decided to
convert to Rome would be suddenly chucked out of Buckingham palace.
When the law has moved away from the reality, and we are amending the
law in any event, perhaps it makes sense to carry out a comprehensive
reform of the law to make the two match
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012834000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0002.htm#13012834000029"><B><Member ContinuationText="Michael Ellis" PimsId="5709" UID="13012834000658" xid="1203" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0002.htm#13012834000658">Michael

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point, and
that might have been an amendment worthy of consideration. It is not
the amendment I tabled. My amendment sought to maintain the supreme
governorship of the Church of England in a regency whenever the
sovereign was not in communion with the Anglican Church under the
Regency Act 1937, which requires the regent to be a Protestant and to
meet the terms of the Act of Settlement. I would prefer to keep things
that way because the Crown and the headship of the Church of England
could come back together when a future sovereign was an Anglican, and
my approach would not permanently separate the two. However, I am
grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing forward new thoughts on the
matter; one of the reasons why it would have been better to have had a
longer time for, and longer gaps in, debating this important subject is
because then such ideas could have been discussed.</hs_Para>

new clause is extremely simple. It is a recognition—no matter
how much I am sometimes reluctant to recognise it—that the
modern world is different from the early 18th century. There may have
been many glories in the early 18th century, but one of the glories of
this modern age is that we are tolerant—we are tolerant of
different religions. We believe that people practising other faiths is
something to be welcomed and encouraged, and that has made us a
stronger nation rather than a weaker one. Therefore there should no
longer be a bar on the grounds of faith in respect of the
sovereign, as long as we can make provision for the established Church
of England, which there is and which I support.</hs_Para>

century point. The language of coronation oaths of the late 17th
century shows that people are obsessed by Jesuit dissemblers and
believe that a sovereign who wants to get around the oath will come to
the throne—he could have his fingers crossed behind his back or,
even worse, a dispensation from the Pope saying that he is allowed to
say that he is a good, honest Protestant when he is not. A sovereign is
not likely to behave in that type of Jesuitical dissembling way. Our

Friend. The Act of Settlement deems somebody who has been a Catholic
for a minute to be dead in terms of the succession, and it passes over
them as if they were dead. Once we allow the marriage of a Catholic
into the line of succession to the throne, that provision makes
absolutely no sense. We could be arguing that at the point of a
Catholic baptism, the child was a Catholic even though it given no

decided to be confirmed as a Catholic would be excluded, but it is
perfectly possible, not least because our Churches are coming closer
together, for somebody to be confirmed a Catholic at the age of 12 or

to be offered to him that he might prefer to be an Anglican. We need to
be clear about when people are excluded, so that if an heir to the
throne decided that the religious bar meant that becoming King of
England was worth changing religion for, the result would be clear and
decisive. We do not want the monarchy to pass from one generation to

However, I agree with my hon. Friend that there will be a debate as we
move through this century about all our institutions, including the
monarchy. That is why I was disappointed that his amendments were not
selected, because I think we should have had a debate about alternative
forms of Heads of State and the ways in which we can select them,

will leave my argument there. I needed to put on the record why I put
my name to the proposed new clause and why I tabled a similar
amendment. It is about ending discrimination. On Saturday, I attended
the annual dinner for pensioners organised by Botwell Catholic church
St Vincent de Paul Society. When I told them about the two things that
we were legislating on this week, the women cheered for ending gender
discrimination, but everyone cheered for ending discrimination against
Catholics. I say to hon. Members that this is not an historic
thing—it is relevant. If someone in this country is born
Catholic or into any other religion, or if they have no faith, and they
are still discriminated against, that is unacceptable, as successive
Governments and Members of this House have said. Now is the opportunity

introduced a ten-minute rule Bill and tabled early-day motions on the
subject. We were constantly told that it was all too difficult and

in this day and age, a person should not be barred from a position such
as Head of State just because of their religion or lack of religion.
There are many people in this House who have no religion and who do not
wish to come to Prayers or who do so just to reserve their place. They
are just as worth while as Members. There is no reason why we have to

Even if the new clause were accepted by the Government, it is extremely
unlikely that it would be activated in our lifetimes, or indeed ever.
As far as I know, there is no likelihood of Prince Charles or Prince
William becoming a Catholic. It is therefore somewhat academic, but
just because an amendment is academic does not mean that it is not
worth debating and acting on if it is the logical and right thing to
do. It is unlikely to be activated not just because of the nature of
the likely successors to the throne, but because a person who is
brought up as a member of the royal family is surely extremely unlikely
to want to bar themselves from the throne or put their chances of
succeeding to the throne at

generation, somebody will not want to be part of it for quite profound
reasons of personal conscience. That is why this matter is important.
It is not just an academic, legalistic debating point; it is a matter
of deep personal conscience. What is more important to an individual
than their faith or lack of faith? It is somewhat strange in the modern
age to say to somebody that if they want to become the head of this
particular state, that job goes with being a member of a particular

“Oh, here’s just another Catholic pushing his own

ecumenical. I am a member of Lincoln cathedral council. I think that

hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) will no longer
follow my argument; indeed, he will strongly disagree with me—is
the advance of secularism and the fact that religion is retreating from
more and more aspects of national life. Even “The Sunday Half
Hour” on Radio 2 on Sunday nights has been banished to 6.30 in
the morning. Maintaining the established Church as a symbol—only
a symbol—is terribly important, as is what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:40:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
is doing today. He is trying to square the circle, to be absolutely
fair and say that as a modern nation we should respect people’s
conscience to maintain their own religion—or lack of
it—and succeed to the headship of state. He
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:40:34"></hs_TimeCode>is also trying
to protect the established Church, and although other solutions might
have been offered, including the one proposed earlier that the

hangs in Stonyhurst college in your constituency, was offered the
throne on the condition that he renounced his faith. He refused to do
that although he could have succeeded Queen Anne. In fact, I understand
that about 50 people had a superior hereditary claim to George I, but
they were all bypassed because, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:41:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

ensuring an Anglican Head of State.</hs_Para>

simple truth on which we should focus, as a modern Parliament, is that
people should not be disbarred from a job—especially one in
which they would represent all people, such as Head of
State—just because of their religion or lack of it. The current
bar is not even logical in its own terms. As my hon. Friend the Member
for North East Somerset has made clear, it does not apply to Scotland,
where the Queen is not the head of the Church, and it would not apply
to countries like Australia and Canada. So even in its own terms, what
the Government are trying to do is illogical. We all know that they are
trying to do it to preserve the established Church, because—like
me—they believe it to be important. But it is perfectly possible
both to respect people’s conscience and to maintain the
established Church and this figurehead post—and it is only a
figurehead post. Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I invented it as a post
of real power and authority, but nobody actually suggests that in
reality the queen or king in a modern country tries to interfere with
the established Church, although they may sign off the appointment of
bishops. Unlike Mary Tudor, Henry VIII or Elizabeth I—or even
Charles I—a modern queen or king does not try to ensure that
their own people are made bishops, or determine whether the
Church is high church or low church. It is absurd. Supreme Governor is
only an honorific post, and it is not therefore necessary that the king
or queen is Supreme Governor. I do not want to get rid of the
post—it is deep within our traditions and there is nothing wrong

1 makes an important point. It is almost as important as the one that
my hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset made. If the
legislation stays as it is, we will return to the world of the Act of
Settlement, in which people were incredibly suspicious of some kind of
papist plot. If someone had been tarnished in any way at any time in
their life with Catholicism, they were excluded from the throne. As it
happens, my eldest son is 640th in line to the throne, because he is
descended from the Electress Sophia through his mother. He is not
excluded from the throne as he was baptised as Russian Orthodox,
although he has been raised a Catholic. So in our family we have found
a way around the bar, but if the Bill stays as it is, we will return to
a ridiculous, bizarre and absurd situation in which someone must never,
at any point in their life, have taken communion in a Catholic church.
As my hon. Friend pointed out, there are many mixed marriages and we go
to each other’s churches regularly. Even those who oppose new
clause 1 must accept that the logical and right thing to do is for the
person to be able to make an election at the time they become Head of
State.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012834000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0002.htm#13012834000107"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Bryant" PimsId="2350" UID="13012834000708" xid="76" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0002.htm#13012834000708">Chris

has made the same mistake several times in this debate and in previous
debates. There is no such thing as Russian Orthodox baptism. There is
Christian baptism, end of story. All Churches accept one
another’s baptisms. The one difference between the Roman
Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church—and perhaps as a
Roman Catholic he could persuade senior people in his Church to change
their position—is that the Catholic Church believes that
Anglican orders are null and

order if I get into the intricacies of baptism, and which baptism is
recognised by which church. In fact, the Catholic Church does recognise
Russian Orthodox baptisms and considers itself in communion with the
Russian Orthodox Church. The problem lies not with the Catholic Church,
but with the Russian Orthodox Church, which does not want Catholics to
take communion in its churches.</hs_Para>

have the right to be judged on one’s faith at the time that one
becomes Head of State or wants to become Head of State, and not be
judged on what baptism one has received, what churches one attended in

is extraordinary that a Bill presented as a reform or great change

We are very sniffy about them when we consider other religions and
other parts of the world where one member of a family has
absolute power in arranging the marriages of relatives, but that is
what we are doing in this great reforming Bill. I do not know where the
idea comes from that one person should be allowed to dictate the
marital choices of six of her—later his—relatives. Is
this a Liberal Democrat Bill? Is this the cutting edge of the future
reforming zeal of the Liberal Democrat party: to espouse the concept of
arranged marriages? This is the modern world.</hs_Para>

about precisely how the Queen has dealt with these matters. From my
standpoint, I see her as someone who has used her position in the
Church of England in a way that is generally beneficial to society, by
setting out the importance of spiritual things and laying
emphasis—as she did in her most recent Christmas
broadcast—on some of the moral and ethical conclusions that one
might draw from these things. That is something of a satisfaction to
non-conformists, Roman Catholics and members of the Church of Scotland,

come to this House not to disrespect any of the institutions that are
cherished by other Members and that are part of the British
constitutional settlement. Where I can, I will support moves to remove
and relieve aspects of discrimination wherever we find them. I said
last week that this Bill does two valuable things in that it removes a
layer of gender discrimination in the succession to the Crown and it
lifts one layer of religious discrimination —the bar on a
Catholic marrying the heir to the throne. However, as we heard in last
week’s debate, those proposals in themselves leave many
questions. As we heard, for some of us, one question concerns the
remaining areas of discrimination, whereby anybody who at any stage in
their lives had either been a Catholic or been deemed to be a Catholic
would be barred from being an heir to the throne. In effect, it is the
McCarthyite question: “Are you now or have you ever been a
Catholic?” For anybody who has ever been a Catholic in any shape
or form, that 
<?notus-xml column=717?>is it—they are out; they count as dead for
these purposes. Clearly that is wrong and anomalous. I do not believe

n<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:15:40"></hs_TimeCode>ew clause 1 is
simply respect for the Church of England. Obviously I am not an
Anglican, and I am not even English. In many ways I feel sorry for the
Church of England. In a way, because it is an established Church,
everybody keeps taking slices off it, on one issue or another. In many
ways, we as legislators find ourselves invited to vote or decide on
matters pertaining to the Church of England, whereas I would be much
more comfortable not encroaching on any matter relating to the Church
of England’s life as a Church. That is why I have not put my
name to new clause 1, which does at least deal cleverly and
constructively with the other question that arose for Members last
week, which was: if the heir to the throne were allowed to marry a
Catholic, what would happen if a child of that marriage was then a
Catholic? That would affect issues around the succession to the
throne—it would affect the Protestant ascendancy, as we heard
last week—as well as the Church of England.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for North East Somerset has tried to address and reflect on
the arguments and concerns that arose on both sides of the issues
raised by this Bill. I therefore hope that the Government will respond
to this debate by making it clear that they agree that Parliament will
have to go further, because to say, “Well, we don’t have
any more to do,”—to suggest that the possibility of a
Catholic marrying the heir to the throne and their children perhaps
being raised as Catholics would not raise any future
questions—leaves us with a doubt, which a number of us also
expressed last week, about clause 3(1). We are concerned that the power
of controlling marriages—which, for the first six people in line
to the throne, remains in the hands of sovereign under this
Bill—will in effect be the way to deal with any risk that might
arise of someone who has been raised as a Catholic at any point being
close in the line of succession to the throne.</hs_Para>

are therefore genuine issues and questions left by the degree to which
the Government have legislated to date, as well as the form and limits
of the legislation to date. Unless those other issues are
addressed—by these amendments or others—the Government
will leave us still harbouring the doubt that clause 3(1) is really
about ensuring that the issues opened up by clause 2 will never
actually arise in practice. I do not believe that is good enough. We as
legislators cannot say, “We’re going to put in place
flawed legislation that we know gives rise to all these other
questions, but we’re content either that it’s not going
to happen or that it’s not going 
<?notus-xml column=718?>to happen soon enough.” As legislators, we have to address things
in our time according to what is right, what is fair and what is
proper. In the 21st century, we should not be leaving any residual form
of discrimination against any person of any one
religion.</hs_Para>

It was a wonderful speech; it is a long time since we have heard such a
wonderfully erudite exposition in the House. It was very much about
equality between the members of all religious faiths and none in regard
to the ability to hold the position of monarch of this country.

the Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn) mentioned the fact that the
Church in Wales had been disestablished since 1920. Speaking as a
Welshman and a member of that Church, I recognise that that has created
a sound constitutional relationship between that Church and the monarch
in England. However, that debate and the debate on religious equality
in regard to the throne are debates for another time.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:22:58"></hs_TimeCode> is not to

Regency Act 1937, which requires that the regent should meet all the

to be a Protestant, and in communion with the Church of England. The

with that response. However, the difficulty with the regency
legislation is that there is more than one Act. There have been a
number of amending Acts. He referred to the 1937 Act, but since then
there have been what some people have referred to as ad hoc departures
from that legislation. In fact, the Act talks about the best person
succeeding to the throne, rather than the next in line. What on earth
does that mean? How do we define the “best person”? This
underlines the point that the legislation will inevitably have
unintended consequences that will have to be looked at in detail, with

balance, we agree with his interpretation of the Act of Settlement and
the Bill of Rights as

key elements of the Act of Settlement and the Bill of Rights stay
standing, and I reiterate that today. I do not see this Bill as
creating further constitutional crises than could be wrought out of the
existing law.</hs_Para>

the record, before moving on to my second argument about the two
amendments, let me state again that the Government are absolutely
committed to the Church of England as the established Church, with the
sovereign as its Supreme Governor. We consider that the relationship
between Church and state in England is an important part of the
constitutional framework. It has evolved over centuries and the
Government have no intention of legislating to disestablish the Church
of England. It is important to state
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>. The

me move on to my second argument and address the substance of the two
amendments. I suggest that, if they were made, they would add greater
uncertainty to the line of succession. For example, let us consider
someone who is brought up as the heir to the throne and is clearly in
preparation for that vocation over their lifetime. In the
Government’s view, it would make that person’s position,
and the position of their immediate family, very difficult, if they
could be superseded at any stage by someone who converted from Roman
Catholicism to the Protestant faith. By extension, that could also
raise the prospect of the reigning monarch being subsequently
supplanted by someone who was theoretically higher in the line of
succession on that latter person’s converting from Catholicism
and joining in communion with the Church of England.</hs_Para>

want to succeed to the throne, they will have experienced both Churches

the Bill does not seek to change the entirety of the Act of Settlement
and the Bill of Rights, for reasons that went through at some length
last week and a little earlier today,. I put the Government’s
point: the Bill is narrow in scope and does not seek to enter into the

House had sufficient time to debate all the matters that were in scope

traditional role of the monarchy. There is not public support for the

questions about what the relationship would be between the sovereign

3 is a brief and helpful proposal to remove the specified date. Lord
Armstrong has recently reminded us of how atrocious we, sadly, are in
this Parliament at legislating. When we legislate in haste we often
legislate in error, and what Lord Armstrong has said, having gone
through the Bills passed in the 13 years of the previous

atrocious piece of legislation, because there is no need to limit us to
a date. We are dealing with a situation where the child is likely to be
born—this is referred to in the Bill—in the summer, but
there is no need to make a decision now. We can give ourselves time to
improve the Bill and avoid the unintended consequences it
contains.</hs_Para>

cannot see why we should not apply this provision now. If this is such
a good idea—there is an almost universal approval in the House
for the main proposition of getting rid of discrimination against
women—why not do it immediately? Why should it apply in 40
or 60 years’ time? Why should it not apply immediately?
The effect of that might be nothing at all, because those in the line
of succession in the foreseeable future are predominantly male, barring
problems that might occur with premature deaths, accidents and so on.
However, it is conceivable, although unlikely, that there could be a
female in direct line to the throne. Are we going to wait until the
child that is going to be born in July reaches maturity for this
beneficial legislation to come into force? If it is worth doing, it is
worth doing

Chloe Smith:</Member></B> I will be equally as brief as the hon.
Gentleman. I, too, understand that the effect of his amendment would be
to make the gender of any person in the line of succession irrelevant
when determining succession to the throne. I put it to him that the
Government did not make an omission; the way we set out the Bill was a
deliberate choice. His amendment would change the current line of
succession. Specifically—I suspect he has this in
mind—their Royal Highnesses Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, and
their descendants, would move below Her Royal Highness Princess Anne
and her descendants. The Government do not believe it is fair or
reasonable to alter the legitimate expectations of those currently in
line to the throne. The hon. Gentleman’s amendment is a
retrospective provision and there would need to be good reason for
it.</hs_Para>

leaders have agreed to remove the male bias in succession to the Crown
for the future. For reasons we have already discussed at length, the
Government view that agreement as being important to maintain, and it
does not envisage the current order of succession being disturbed.
Rather, when new members of the royal family are born they will enter
the line of succession without there being any preference for males
over females, and I know that the hon. Gentleman shares that latter
principle with

Smith:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution. I
note that the different clauses of this Bill do carry slightly
different connotations of retrospectivity. I would be happy to explain
that, but we did cover some of those issues in detail in Committee. He
is right to say 
<?notus-xml column=729?>that what is relevant in clause 1 is the legitimate
expectations of those currently close to the throne in the line of
succession. We do face a question about what is fair and reasonable to
them. Clause 1 strikes a fair balance by providing that gender is
irrelevant in this regard for persons born after the date of the
agreement reached by the Commonwealth realms on 28 October 2011. That
element of retrospection is justifiable.</hs_Para>

clause 1<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:07:12"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
also clear that that deals with a future occurrence, as opposed to

hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David) asked whether, under the
Statute of Westminster 1931, individual Parliaments in the respective

following:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13012839000641" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0002.htm#13012839000641">“And
whereas it is meet and proper to set out by way of preamble to this Act
that, inasmuch as the Crown is the symbol of the free association of
the members of the British Commonwealth 
<?notus-xml column=730?>of Nations, and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown,
it would be in accord with the established constitutional position of
all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any
alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the
Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of
the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United
Kingdom”.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13012839000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0002.htm#13012839000030">To
put it another way, our opinion is that the Statute of Westminster 1931
is politically rather than legally binding. A statement in a preamble
is different from a section in an Act. Bearing that in mind, the
Government have consulted the 15 other Commonwealth realms in order to
reach agreement as to how the laws on succession to the throne should
be changed. We have secured confirmation from Heads of Government and
Cabinet Secretaries that each realm is in a position to take the steps
necessary to bring the changes into effect. We consider that the
appropriate steps are a matter for each respective realm in their
particular context. Although some realms will not find it necessary to
involve their Parliaments, others
will.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012839000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0002.htm#13012839000031">The
Bill is about equality. The Prime Ministers of the 16
Commonwealth nations of which Her Majesty the Queen is Head of State
agreed during their meeting in Perth in 2011 to work together towards a
common approach to amending the rules of succession to their respective
Crowns. All those countries wish to see change in two areas: first, to
end the system of male-preference primogeniture, under which a younger
son can displace an elder daughter in the line of succession; and,
secondly, to remove the bar on the heir to the throne marrying a
Catholic. One effect of the proposed change is that if the Duke and
Duchess of Cambridge were to have a daughter and then a son, the
daughter would precede the son in the line of succession. I am proud
that the Bill will remove two long-standing pieces of discrimination

of the monarch once they are created—most titles are in fact a

abolish a title except those deemed, under the doctrine of merger, to
resort back to the Crown. In that case, will he tell us what will

following might be helpful. The Scottish titles currently held by the
Prince of Wales—Prince and Great Steward of Scotland, Duke of
Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Lord of the Isles and Baron of
Renfrew—can 
<?notus-xml column=731?>pass automatically to a female heir apparent. Those titles have always
hung together. The removal of the male bias in the line of succession
could therefore not result in the detachment of the titles from the

constitutional monarchy is a form of government that places the Head of
State beyond political competition. That is surely to be welcomed. The
sovereign, as well as being Head of State, is head of our nation. As
one of our most distinguished constitutional experts has argued, the

itself—that is its central function, its essential justification

in our numerous discussions on this matter. We have heard them all: the

prejudicial to some group or other. For example, one could argue that
the law that says that the oldest person, whether male or female,
should take precedence over young siblings is also biased. It is also
prejudicial because it is ageist in that it favours older over younger.
One could go on ad absurdum. I suggest that we try not to get too

example, when, for the purpose of inheritance, both the father and the
eldest son die in the same instance, such as in a road traffic

is because the law has to develop types of legal
regulation—legal fiction, one might call it—in order to
make sense. I use this as an example to indicate with caution that
attractive though it is in principle to remove all types of bias, there

reduced to six. So whether it be the heirs of Electress Sophia or
whether it be six people, the principle remains the same. The
sovereign has special rights and responsibilities. Of course it is true
that in ordinary families no head of the family would have such a say,
but it is nonsense to suggest that the royal family should be in that
position. It is right that some demarcation be made so that the
sovereign can exercise control. My understanding is that in other

restrictions are placed on the marriage rights of those closest in

for Northampton North (Michael Ellis). When he talked about the temple

support the two main thrusts of what the Bill is trying to do, but I
think that we will end up ruing its passage. That is not because I
disagree with the principle of abolishing male-preference primogeniture
so that women can inherit equally with men, nor because of the minor
adjustment to the provision on those who marry Roman Catholics being
allowed to continue in the succession. My problem with the Bill is that
it does something very significant that I do not think the Government
intend it to do. The Royal Marriages Act 1772 provided that
an individual who was in line to the throne had to get consent from the
monarch at the time of marriage. If the monarch refused to provide
that consent, or the individual refused to ask for it, their
marriage would simply become null and void. I do not think that any of
us believes that anybody should be able to declare anybody
else’s marriage null and void.</hs_Para>

legislation that we are seeking to agree will have no effect on the
validity of the marriage, but it means that the person will be removed

Parliament decided what should happen at the deposition of Edward II.
In the case of Richard II, the decision was made by the

Westminster Hall gathered by Henry Bolingbroke. One could argue that it
was not a proper Parliament because Richard II was not present, but

than to anybody else. Then, when the Stuart line was going to
end with Queen Anne, Parliament decided how the succession should
proceed. Again, when Edward VIII tried to abdicate in 1936, the
abdication could be allowed only because there was a statute of

to be helpful in last week’s debate, I raised some concerns
about the other titles and assets that accompany the sovereign. It is
easy to talk about changing the succession without realising that our
monarchs are more than that—they have other titles, such
as the Duke of Rothesay, the Earl of Carrick, the Duke of Lancaster and
the Duke of Cornwall. Some are merely titles without asset, while some
are titles with asset, but they are all very important. They are
regulated by more people than just one Government lawyer. I am
surprised by the lack of consultation with key people such as the Lord
Lyon King of Arms in Scotland and the Garter Principal King of Arms in
England. These people monitor and, in effect, register letters patent
to make sure that the power and extent of a title is upheld. This is
not as easy as saying that we can change the succession and everything
else will fall into line. I am

gave the example of one or two Scottish titles that can follow through
the female line. That is absolutely correct, as in the case of titles
such as the Countess of Mar—one of the oldest titles in Britain.
However, my right hon. Friend missed out the fact that that takes place
only when there is no male heir as a sibling; when there is, they will
get the title under the rule of primogeniture. We have heard the
example of what would happen if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had a

Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall are titles that come with
asset, and they have a very significant impact. I understand the
Government’s line, and I accept that it is likely—almost
certain—that the monarch will continue to enjoy the incomes from
those assets, but not necessarily the assets themselves and control
over them. A situation could arise whereby the Duchy of
Lancaster’s assets, which are considerable— the
latest valuation is over £400 million—reside with the
son, but the income is diverted to the monarch. That is fine the first
time round, but the second time round, when the son of the son has the
asset, the asset will get further away from the title, as will the
control that may go with it, and the process will

hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) mentioned how the six
people nearest in line to the throne could lose their place if the
Queen did not consent to their marriage. It is important to say on the
record that the explanatory notes state clearly that that would be the

think, therefore, that it is fair to say that the issue has not been
referred to properly in the House—it has been referred to in the

the coming four years, Sport England has allocated £6.8 million

it is not my intention to pit sport against sport, the only fair way of

funding of other sports. Hockey, for example, has 109,000 weekly

Netball has 159,000 weekly participants and it will receive £25
million, or £39 a year per player, which is more than three

51,000 weekly participants and £17.5 million funding. That is

slightly differently from individual sports. My point, however, is that

argument about UK Sport and its decision to remove funding from
basketball is that the facts do not add up. Since UK Sport funding for
basketball was initiated, both the men’s and women’s
teams have gone from the bottom rung of the international ladder to
being some of the most respected teams in Europe. At London 2012, the
men were one basket away from achieving their UK Sport quarter final
target, and they recorded an historic 32-point win against China, which
was ranked 10th in the world. They lost by just one point to eventual
silver medallists, Spain, and they almost beat Brazil, which finished
fifth overall at the Olympics. These results were unthinkable just four
years ago, and demonstrate not only the huge progress that has been
made, but the potential for basketball in the future.</hs_Para>

league in the world, the NBA. He has written to the Prime Minister to

UK Sport to categorically state that neither adult team has any hope of

has been made over the previous one and a half funding cycles, and it

the Minister’s recent assertion that the Great Britain
basketball teams are unlikely to qualify for either Rio or the 2020
games also looks to be wrong. For example, the men’s team has
qualified for the 2013 European championships, and because it has risen
significantly in the world rankings over the past 12 months
it has avoided a number of the higher ranked teams in the group stage
draw. It now has every chance of qualifying through to the next round.
As a result, Rio qualification is a real possibility, and choosing to
write the team off at this stage would be a gross miscarriage of
justice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012839000578" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0003.htm#13012839000578">I

understand the concern felt by British Performance Basketball, so
before it makes any official appeal to UK Sport, it would be grateful

credibility others sorely lack. It is no wonder that it is as
popular as the hon. Gentleman described. Basketball was
consistently one of the most viewed events at the Olympics and

me finish on the point I raised in my intervention on my hon. Friend
the Member for City of Chester (Stephen Mosley). To my mind, the
Olympic legacy is the participation of as many young people as possible
in sport. We all know that basketball, with a court set up in the
corner of a playing field or across the full pitch, attracts youngsters
in numbers, particularly in urban communities. If there are
international and national figures whom they can look up to and aspire
to be, the pyramid of participation will widen. Whatever the sport, the
wider the base of the sporting pyramid, the better chance we have of
seeing the pinnacle—the elite athlete—come through.
Therefore, the withdrawal of funding is short-sighted. We only have to
compare our record in the London Olympics with what happened five, six
or seven Olympics back to see how dramatically Britain’s
sporting success has increased across the spectrum. To a large extent
that is about funding, as well as the enthusiasm of the various
sporting organisations. I hope it will be possible for those
responsible for funding basketball to realise that mass participation
is part of the Olympic legacy for our young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:41:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_28_PT_1/7FC86BFC4B9A7E7B6DF3FCC527BFC87522CD46E6" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="28 January 2013">Monday

point that has been made is that young participants, male and female,
gain great health benefits from their involvement in the sport, no

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>If we are to be
successful in basketball nationally and internationally, the first
requirement will be to build up that grass-roots support. Nothing comes
from nothing, and we will succeed at elite level only if we can get
youngsters from the ages of eight, nine and 10 onwards to participate
in the sport. That model has worked well in other sports, and it is no
different for basketball, except that basketball reaches parts of the
community that other sports might not.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:50:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for City of Chester (Stephen Mosley) on securing the debate
and on the manner in which he presented his case. This was actually
going to be the third thing I intended to say, but it is probably worth
saying it now. I shall proceed with certain amount of caution tonight.
The appeal is due in front of the UK Sport board—on Wednesday, I
believe—but that, in any event, is not the end of the process,
as there are a number of further hurdles over which progress could be
made. If the terms of the appeal are right—many points made
tonight will, I suspect, form part of the appeal—it strikes me
that there will be a case that will provoke some further thought. Let
me go no further than that. Tonight’s debate does come at a
slightly delicate moment.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012839000621" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0003.htm#13012839000621"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:51:07"></hs_TimeCode>I
have a couple of other points to frame my remarks before I answer some
of the specific questions raised. First, it is important—I hope
hon. Members will forgive me for making this point—to frame this
debate against the fact that this system works. This country’s
elite performance system is the envy of almost every other Olympic
system in the world. Back in Sydney, we were 10th in the medal table
with 28 medals; here we are in London, 12 years later, third
with 65 medals. The Australians would kill for this sort of system, as
would many others. People in this country are looking at how we did it
and trying to work out the processes we adopted. I know from talking to
many Australians that they feel they will have to be much tougher and
come far closer to our no-compromise approach if they are to catch up
some of the ground they feel they have lost.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012839000622" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0003.htm#13012839000622"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:52:04"></hs_TimeCode>I
was talking to a forum of performance directors this morning. Knowing
that I would be responding to this Adjournment debate, I said,
“Let me road test this on you. Have we got this right? Have we
gone too far, and do we need to crank it back?” They said,
“Absolutely 
<?notus-xml column=756?>not.” They felt that the way the funding awards were made this
year was the fairest and most robust method they had been put through.
These were performance directors who had done this for a number of
years, and they had nothing but praise for the way in which they had
been guided through the system by UK Sport and the results that had
been reached. I absolutely understand the passion expressed about a
sport for which many Members deeply care, but that needs to be balanced
with the fact that the performance system for a country of our size has
just produced 65 medals and third place in the Olympic medal table.
That is an extraordinary success by anybody’s
standards.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012839000623" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0003.htm#13012839000623"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:53:02"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me deal quickly with a couple of other points.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:53:01"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Knowsley (Mr Howarth) is absolutely correct: I can set the
overall strategy for UK Sport, and indeed I do, but it is not up to me
to make individual funding decisions within that, because about two
thirds of the money that goes to any of these funding awards is lottery
money. As anyone who has been in this House for any length of time will
know, that is not for Ministers to direct.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012839000624" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/debtext/130128-0003.htm#13012839000624"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:53:33"></hs_TimeCode>My
other point is that funding, although I would wish it otherwise in this
area, is not inexhaustible. We have done very well to increase the
overall budget for Olympic and Paralympic sport by 11%—the only
host nation ever to achieve that—and for the Rio cycle, but that
does not mean that we can avoid taking tough decisions. This has been
one of them. Having been through the decision-making process with UK
Sport—it took me through it and Sport England was there, too, so
we could look at both funding settlements together—I know it has
a chart, and the question is about the point at which we slice up and
down the funding pole. That is done by UK Sport on the basis of medal
success in Rio.</hs_Para>

me run through the various issues raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:54:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for City of Chester. He asked whether I had met UK Sport,
and indeed Sport England. I see both chief executives every month, and
I spent close to three hours with both organisations going

I take on board the comments that have been made, UK Sport made the
decision on the basis that basketball had failed to demonstrate a
realistic chance of qualifying for Rio 2016, or medal potential for
2020. Basketball may be on a fast improving pathway, but the
men’s and women’s teams won only one of the 10 games that
they contested at the London Olympics, which is not a great performance
record.</hs_Para>

are such decisions made? GB Basketball puts a submission forward that
goes to UK Sport, and it is then considered by a performance panel with
independents on it. Each and every aspect is considered. Other
performance directors I spoke to today said that was the best iteration
they had been through in a number of cycles. The process is incredibly
detailed, and considers not only medal potential for Rio but for 2020.
For Rio, the line was drawn at a point where the basketball team needed
to medal, which might explain the slight discrepancy in relation to
qualification.</hs_Para>

I have been involved in sport as a politician since 2004 when the
Conservative party was in opposition. Throughout that time, basketball
has been a frustration because it has obvious and enormous potential,
as many of the contributions to this debate 
<?notus-xml column=757?>have acknowledged. It is a sport that can reach into communities in a
way that some other sports cannot, yet it somehow fails to catch
alight. That may be because people who play basketball do not always
respond to the active people survey, so participation levels are
underplayed. There may also have been weaknesses in the structure of
the sport.</hs_Para>

try to get more young women back into the sport. As a result, netball
has been rewarded with a considerable increase in funding.</hs_Para>

question is: what does basketball need to do? I have not yet met him,
but I am told that there is a very good new independent chairman. A
huge amount of fuss and bother is what impresses people least, so the
best thing he can do is take a long, hard, clinical look at the sport
of basketball—I hope that many of the hon. Members who have
shown enthusiasm for the sport in the debate tonight will play a
part—and look at team sports that have tackled this situation
successfully. He should look at how cycling has put half a million
people on its performance base, and at what netball, a team sport, has
done. There must be some transferable lessons from netball to
basketball. There is enormous performance-based expertise, which has
driven this country from 10th in the medal table to third, so he should
make use of the experts in academia and UK Sport, and turn the sport
inside out.</hs_Para>

is this hope: although the initial funding decisions have been made and
announced, there is an appeal process, and if basketball presents the
right case, it will have a perfectly good chance of securing funding.
This is not the end of the story, and if the basketball team starts to
perform and show that it is likely to qualify, and has the chance of a
medal in 2016 or 2020, wherever that turns out to be after the IOC
decision this summer, there will be the opportunity to fund
it.</hs_Para>

leave the House with the story of gymnastics. I have seen
representatives of that sport recently. Its funding was
cut—almost completely removed—after a disastrous Olympics
in Athens, where the competitors were basically washed out. Gymnastics
is a different sport from basketball, but its position is not entirely
different. Those people went back and engaged in a long
“dig-out” to discover what was required to ensure that
the young athletes whom we all see in gyms in our constituencies could
turn into Olympic medal-winners in the future. They turned the sport
inside out, and established a really 
<?notus-xml column=758?>tough performance-based culture. The result was plain to see in London,
where gymnastics was not only one of the great successes, but arguably
one of the most unexpected.</hs_Para>

social aspect, I entirely accept the point about basketball’s
social reach. However, we do not confine our funding to sports that
have a reach of that kind, such as athletics, cycling and, in
particular, boxing, which was one of the great successes of London 2012
and which has a huge reach into deprived communities in inner cities. I
can reassure Members that UK Sport makes its decisions on the basis of
performance.</hs_Para>

Attorney-General (Mr Dominic Grieve):</Member></B> On behalf of the
Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, I am today depositing
in the Libraries of both Houses an updated version of the Code for
Crown Prosecutors. The code sets out how prosecutors working in the
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) make decisions and is supported by
comprehensive legal guidance on a range of topics, further details of
which are available on the CPS website at:
www.cps.gov.uk.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1301282000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/wmstext/130128m0001.htm#1301282000010">The
code was last revised in February 2010 and has been updated following
consultation to provide more focused and streamlined
guidance for prosecutors. In this latest version, the evidential stage
of the full code test remains much as before; however the code
no longer lists the public interest factors tending in
favour and against prosecution. Instead prosecutors are provided with
questions to address to assist them in identifying the
public interest factors relevant to the case. The revised code also
highlights the need to consider proportionality at the public interest
stage.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1301282000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/wmstext/130128m0001.htm#1301282000011">The
code is published to provide transparency to the decisions taken by
prosecutors. To ensure the code’s accessibility, it will be

of asylum decisions by gender because sample sizes are not large enough
to identify the contribution of gender to differences in quality in a
statistically meaningful way. Under the new quality assurance process
being developed for the asylum process, the agency will continue to
collect data on quality and gender. The intention is to monitor how
interviewers and decision makers handle gender-related issues on a six
monthly basis and monitor trends in performance over the longer term.
Areas where specific gender-related performance issues are identified
will be addressed through, for example, further guidance, training or
staff management.</hs_Para>

issues identified in the agency's thematic review of asylum claims
based on gender were that, in some cases, full consideration had not
been given to whether women claimants were members of a particular
social group under the terms of the 1951 Convention Relating to the
Status of Refugees, and that, in some cases, there was a lack of
investigation into instances of domestic violence committed by
relatives other than a husband. In light of the issues raised the
agency has developed dedicated training on managing asylum claims from
women and this has been delivered to decision makers. The agency has
also been working closely with corporate partners on a number of other
actions aimed at improving the gender sensitivity of the asylum

trafficking with a range of international partners. We do so to tackle
the international drugs trade and minimise the threat it poses to the
UK. It is important to protect activities which form part of the UK's
contribution to the international counter-narcotics effort and to
respect the principle that international partners are able to operate
in secrecy on matters of national security against organised crime. As
such, it is our policy not to disclose details of our counter narcotics
work, as to do so risks reducing its effectiveness and damaging

in which children and young people who have special educational needs
(SEN) or who are disabled are identified, assessed, and supported. Our
proposed legislative reforms will improve the system for 0 to

focusing on the outcomes that they want. Local authorities will provide
clear information about local services for all children and young
people with additional needs. Education, health and care services will
jointly commission services to meet the needs of children and young
people. We will introduce a new integrated assessment and plan, the
Educational Health and Care Plan, which will replace Learning
Difficulty Assessments and Statements of SEN—retaining all the
protections provided by Statements—but will better reflect the
child's or young person's plans for the future as well as their current
needs and there will be a stronger focus on preparing for
adulthood.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012847000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/text/130128w0001.htm#13012847000101">We

Simon Burns:</Member></B> Development of airports' winter weather
resilience plans is a matter for airport operators in collaboration
with airlines and other partners. At Heathrow airport, which operates
throughout the year at almost full capacity, cancelling a proportion of
a daily flight schedule in advance of forecast severe winter weather
allows resilience for necessary snow and ice clearance from runways and
taxiways, and for increased take-off and landing separation in poor
visibility. The decision to reduce a flight schedule is reached jointly
only after analysis of weather forecasts by the airport operator, air
traffic control, Heathrow's Airline Operators Committee, airlines, and
the independent airport slot co-ordinator. The airport considers that
it is a better option to cancel a proportion of flights in advance so
that normal operations can resume quickly the following day, than risk
short-term flight cancellations which cause more annoyance and
inconvenience for air
passengers.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13012847000052" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/text/130128w0002.htm#13012847000052">Metals:

Community Infrastructure Levy is optional and when local planning

requirements, provided through Section 106 agreements, are locally

the treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
While  
<?notus-xml column=595?>animal welfare concerns over the production of foie gras have been
considered by the EU, trade in foie gras is not currently restricted
under EU law. Consequently, a unilateral ban by the UK on the import or
sale of foie gras would probably contravene the provisions of the TFEU.
The UK would likely be referred to the Court of Justice of the European
Union for this breach of EU law and would certainly face multiple
damages claims from importers, exporters and other traders in foie
gras.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012848000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/text/130128w0003.htm#13012848000112">Ultimately,

Benyon:</Member></B> The cost-benefit analysis for the Thames tideway
tunnel was published in November 2011 and it does not address
individual parliamentary constituencies. Since water industry
privatisation in 1989, it has been standard practice for the costs of
capital investment by licensed undertakers to be spread across all
their customers as the fairest way to apportion costs. The large number
of customers of Thames Water's sewerage services in London has enabled
the customer bill impact of investments in sewerage infrastructure
outside London to be kept down to the benefit of customers outside
London, particularly those in rural and smaller urban areas. This has
helped to ensure that Thames Water sewerage bills are currently the
cheapest in England. For example, Reading residents have benefitted
from this approach as the £80 million new Reading sewage
treatment works has been paid for by all Thames Water customers,
including those in London who derive no benefit from it.</hs_Para>

Government policies which help households to save energy will more than
offset the necessary cost of investing in new capacity and greater

internal processes for re-allocating budget to other priority areas.
Where underspends cannot be re-allocated, the Government's stated
policy is that Departments can use the Budget Exchange mechanism to
transfer forecast underspends from one year to the next, up to certain
limits. Details on Budget Exchange can be found in the Consolidated

the case that an underspend in a given financial year cannot simply be
carried forward into the next. That is why we have taken steps in year
to maximise the use of the capital budget for fuel poverty for 2012-13.
We have also adjusted budgets internally so that there is funding
available in 2013-14 for Warm Front installations relating to
applications received in 2012-13. This is necessary because we
continued to accept Warm Front applications up to 19 January 2013 in

to assist clubs to develop contingency plans, which include provisions
for emergency evacuations, and how those plans may be tested by a range

regulations—aimed at improving economic governance in the euro
area—contains provisions for enhanced surveillance when euro
area member states request financial assistance. It refers to possible
requests from a range of financial instruments, including the European
Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM). While there is agreement that
there should be no new commitments from the EFSM now that the European
Stability Mechanism (ESM) has been established, the EFSM is referred to
in the “two-pack” because the regulation which
establishes the EFSM is still in place, and EFSM programmes for Ireland

condition that income is applied to charitable purposes. Where a
charity's income and gains are not applied solely to charitable
purposes, its exemption from tax may be restricted. HMRC carries out
inquiries into charities using a risk-based approach and applies a
range of sanctions on charities that claim exemption on income applied
for not wholly charitable purposes.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> In the consultation ‘Punishment and reform:
Effective Community Sentences’, the Government sought views on
how to promote greater compliance with community orders. The
consultation paper suggested the creation of a new power for offender
managers to impose a fixed penalty notice on an offender for the breach
of a community order, without having to return the offender to the
court. However, while many respondents welcomed the idea of increased
discretion for probation staff, most argued that courts were best
placed to deal with breaches and that a financial penalty for low
income offenders could be counter-productive, potentially leading to
further offending. As a result, the Government decided not to take
forward the
proposal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301293000574" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/text/130128w0004.htm#1301293000574">The
Government is considering what further action might be taken to improve
compliance with community orders and on 3 December 2012 the Government
implemented the power for a court to fine an offender for breach of a
community order.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> Courts have a range of powers to seize assets from
offenders in certain circumstances. The Government has also introduced
provisions in the Crime and Courts Bill to make it clear that when
fixing the level of a financial penalty courts can require offenders to
provide information about their assets as well as their income. In this
way, courts will be able to take into account an offender's assets when
setting the value of a fine. The Government has also recently consulted
on a range of measures to ensure convicted criminals pay back legal aid
in the Crown court, including seizing and ultimately selling the
vehicles of those who do not pay their
contributions.</hs_Para>

Work is under way to increase both the effectiveness and efficiency of

Kingdom and the United States is governed by the Council of Europe
convention on the transfer of sentenced persons. Each case is
considered on its individual merits and the length of time taken to
determine each case may vary. In 2012, 11 prisoners were transferred
from the US to England and Wales. In these cases the shortest period of
time between NOMS consenting to the transfer and the prisoner being
repatriated was 110 days. The longest period was 191 days. The average

consent of the British authorities to transfer does not mark the
conclusion of a case. Once our consent is given it still requires the
US authorities to determine whether or not they wish to proceed with
the transfer. This decision will be based on information provided by
the British authorities, together with its consent, on the
administration of the sentence following transfer. Should the US
authorities agree to transfer, the prisoner is then required to give
his consent. This takes place at a consent verification hearing before
a US magistrate. Only once this hearing has taken place can
arrangements be made for the return of the prisoner to the

senior school and the family will have made adjustments to this next
stage of a child's life. However, the responsible carer of a child aged
13 or over may have the hours that they are expected to undertake
work-related activities and be available to undertake paid work,
tailored to the specific care needs they have in relation to the child.
These claimants will need to show that the restricted hours still offer
reasonable prospects of finding paid
employment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301293001305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/text/130128w0005.htm#1301293001305">In

claimant is expected to do all that is reasonably possible to fit in
responsibilities with employment on offer. Where there are no current
vacancies that fit with the claimant's caring responsibilities in their
particular locality, the adviser will consider whether nevertheless the
claimant is doing all that they can to give themselves reasonable
prospects of finding work when it becomes available in their locality.
If so, the restrictions will be permitted. Each case will be considered
on its own merits taking all the individual circumstances into
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301293001307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130128/text/130128w0005.htm#1301293001307">If,

consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient
care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are
counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent
the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one
episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays
in the same year. Some procedures have many more FCEs than eligible

having been given no date of admission at the time a decision to admit
was made. Booked admissions are those in which the patient was admitted
electively having been given a date at the time it was decided to
admit. Planned admissions are excluded as they are usually part of a
planned sequence of clinical care determined mainly on clinical
criteria, which, for example, could require a series of events, perhaps
taking place every three months, six months or
annually.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>4</Sup>

published a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) Outcomes Indicator Set

chosen on the basis that they help contribute to the overarching aims
of the NHS Outcomes Framework. They will help CCGs and health and

other documents intended to help local clinicians deliver more
