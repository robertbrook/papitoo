ways of identifying and developing the sources of that resistance.

increased research on plant diseases. I pay tribute to all those in the
Forestry Commission and the DEFRA agencies who conducted a totally
unprecedented survey of the whole United Kingdom—2,500 pieces of
land, each 10 kilometres square—and analysed where the disease

more constructive question. The public can play a key role. We know
that there is a genetic strain that is resistant; we have seen it in
Denmark and Holland. Organisations such as the Woodland Trust can play
a vital part in helping us to identify the trees that are resistant so
that we can start to breed from

for Keighley (Kris Hopkins), we need an army of people to go out into
our forests and woods, to act as detectors of disease, and to help us

is exactly the way in which we will confront some of these diseases. As
I have said, a number of trees are resistant, and it would be
enormously helpful if the public became involved in searching for them.
There are some 80 million ash trees in the country; officials cannot
spot them all, but the public can, and that could be immensely
beneficial. I pay tribute to the members of the public who paid a key
role during the week in which we surveyed the entire United

schemes take several years to plan and this really is not a party
political issue; schemes were built by the previous Labour Government
from which we are benefiting now and we are building schemes now that
will last for a generation. There are substantial schemes in play. The
circumstances have been incredibly difficult because of the awful mess
we inherited—we still have the worst deficit in western
Europe—but despite that we plan to spend £2.1 billion to
protect 145,000 properties. In the spending round in

claims history. I urge my hon. Friend and his constituents to use their

pregnant, that provides immunity, rather than disease, so we might also

disappointed to see Arla Milk Link’s recent milk price reduction

the cut, but they would have to give between 12 and 15 months’
notice before being able to leave their contract. That is against the
commitments made in the voluntary code of practice and runs counter to
the good progress made in the past few months by other processors, such
as Dairy Crest, which is based in my constituency of South Derbyshire.

no basis on which to ask the British public for their consent to such a

interest in a new vision for Europe, such as the one the Prime Minister
set out yesterday. That vision is attracting support right 
<?notus-xml column=464?>across Europe, including from the Finnish, Czech, Dutch and Danish
Governments. They recognise that what is required is a more flexible,
more competitive and more open Europe that is democratically

democratic accountability was most important. But Labour has no vision

Indeed, one of the most remarked-on things about the Prime

Britain, but the whole of Europe. All of us in wider Europe need to
create a more flexible and competitive Europe; that goes particularly
for eurozone countries, whatever their needs may be in terms of
integration in the eurozone. As for energy, when it comes to being part
of a single market and meeting the 2014 deadline, delivering that kind
of competition is exactly what we need to do to demonstrate the
benefits of European Union

countervailing views not just in school or college, but in the bedroom

it calls the gerontocracy—to summarise, the fact that the will
of the old is trumping the needs of the young. We have had all sorts of
debates recently—about the winter fuel allowance and so
on—that are characteristic of that. It is a statistical
fact—there are many statistical facts in that report—that
there are more 63-year-olds who are able to vote than 18-year-olds.
However, this is not simply about the absolute numbers of older people
who are able to vote. We also know that their tendency to turn out and
vote is higher, while 18 to 24-year-olds under the current franchise
have the lowest tendency to turn out.</hs_Para>

takes me back to an earlier intervention. One of the reasons why that
cohort has a low tendency to turn out is that most people in that group
miss the opportunity to vote when they turn 18. It happened to
me—I was 18 in 1984, and so was not able to vote for the first
time until the 1987 general election. Now that we have guaranteed
five-year Parliaments, someone who turned 18 in, say, mid-May 2010 will
be 23 before they can vote in the next general election. Lowering the
franchise from 18 to 16 will bring down slightly the average age at
which people first cast their vote, from their early 20s to about 19
perhaps. The idea that swathes of 16 year-olds will be deciding the
election is therefore simply not true.</hs_Para>

the voting age to 16 also makes it more likely that people will vote
while they are in the stable environment of home and education. Voting
is habitual. We know from various studies that if someone votes for the
first time when they are just 18, they pick up the pattern of voting
for later life. Lowering the voting age also makes it easier to
register—a point made earlier. In Northern Ireland, where
individual voter registration is ahead of England and Wales, 16 and
17-year-olds are now registered in school. Registering 16-year-olds
would be quite easy to do and add 1.5 million to the
franchise—about 2,500 voters in each English constituency and
different amounts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</hs_Para>

my 2005 Bill had been accepted, the UK would have been a trailblazer,
but not now. Austria, which has been mentioned, extended the vote in
2007. In German local elections, the Bürgermeister of Hannover
can be elected by 16-year-olds, but those wishing to vote for the mayor
of Bristol, which is twinned with Hannover, have to wait until they are
18. Brazil—the fourth largest democracy in the
world—gives the right to vote to 
<?notus-xml column=488?>16-year-olds and Argentina extended that right just two months
ago. However, it is here in the British Isles that the most fundamental
change has taken place: 16 and 17-year-olds are now able to
vote in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, but it is in the devolved
nations that the most profound change has taken place. On 4 July the
Welsh Assembly voted to reduce the voting age to 16, and on 6 November
the Northern Ireland Assembly did the same—but the power lies
with us. Most profoundly of all, in the Scottish referendum, which I am
sure we will hear about shortly, 16 and 17-year-olds will be given the
right to cast their votes, in what I think will be a much more
important referendum than the one we heard about
yesterday—one that decides the future of the United Kingdom. If
Scottish 16 and 17-year-olds can vote on the future of the UK, surely
it would be untenable to withhold that right from their English, Welsh
and Northern Ireland counterparts.</hs_Para>

the Backbench Business Committee for allowing it to take place. It is

most Members of Parliament, I spend quite a bit of time visiting sixth
forms and meeting members of school councils, and teachers and pupils.
Just last Friday, I was at Roundhay high school in my constituency,
where I met the politics AS-level group—a group of about 20 16
and 17-year-olds. We had a discussion for about an hour and a
half, and it would have been longer if they had not had to go to a
different class. The quality of the teaching and, more important, the
quality of the opinions and the questions, was absolutely brilliant.
That made me realise that I was right to co-sponsor the hon.
Gentleman’s debate this afternoon. Listening to those 16 and
17-year-olds, I felt that they were well ready to make a decision about
who should represent them in this Parliament, who should be the
Government of the day and—something that we have perhaps
overlooked—who should run their local authority. Local
authorities are still important bodies in the lives of the young people
in our towns, cities and regions. I felt reassured, listening to those

asked me deep, searching questions about why I became a politician,
what we do in this place and how that affects their lives. I feel that

want to take Members back to what was a low point in this
country’s electoral history: the police and crime commissioner
elections. I am not going to rehearse the reasons why those elections
had such a poor turnout—in west Yorkshire, it was
13.7%—but I venture to suggest that if 16-year-olds had had the
right to vote on 15 November, turnout might have been over
15%. That is still an absolutely appalling figure, but it would have
made some difference. There was a thirst for and an interest in voting
among young people—even in those elections, which were so badly
publicised. Indeed, when I visited Roundhay high school last Friday, I
was asked about the turnout of those elections and the reasons why they
had taken place in November in the first place.</hs_Para>

school—a long, long time ago, in the ’60s and
’70s—we studied a subject called civics. I know that that

subject was to understand the institutions of government, both locally
and nationally. How many Members have had e-mails and letters from
constituents—many such constituents are pretty mature, certainly
well over 16 or 18—saying, “Dear Member of Parliament, I
want you to do something about the state of the streets in my
area”, or saying that they want them to sort out their council
house, their property, or the windows? They believe us to be
councillors, too. I even got an e-mail the other day from somebody that
began, “Dear Councillor Hamilton”. She wanted me to sort
out what was purely a local authority issue, and I had to point out

pass the age of 16—while they were still studying, they could
cast their vote in a local authority election

Member for Bristol West (Stephen Williams) for an incredibly thorough

focus on the constitutional issues that this subject raises. One reason
why we are having this debate is that two things have changed: the
proposal to lower the voting age to 16 for the referendum in Scotland;
and the new fixed-term Parliaments, which mean that voting takes place
every five years and not before. The important point was made, but it
is worth repeating, that that means that if an 18-year-old’s
birthday happens to fall the day after the general election day, they
will be 23 before they are able to vote. Nobody is proposing that we
raise the voting age.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:15:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Leeds North East (Fabian Hamilton) referred to the
things that people gain the right to do overnight, as it were, when
they become 16, 17 or 18. The situation is 
<?notus-xml column=493?>totally different with the voting age, because people do not usually
wake up on their 18th birthday to discover there is a general election;
usually, the election will occur at some point during the subsequent
five-year period. I doubt whether the Members who oppose this motion
are making the case for raising the voting age, so we need to look at
lowering the voting age to make sure that more young people can
participate.</hs_Para>

important. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:16:16"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Leeds North East spoke eloquently about
school councils and citizenship classes, which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:16:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bristol West also mentioned. We must be honest—the
experience of citizenship classes is patchy. In some places,
citizenship is taught excellently by dedicated citizenship teachers; in
others, it is not so good. However, if we lowered the voting age to 16,
citizenship, the importance of democracy and the role of political
parties would be taught better at schools. It would encourage MPs,
local councillors and other elected representatives to visit schools
and make the case for why politics is important.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438000445" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000445">The
counter-argument, which I hear quite a lot, is that politics should not
be taken into schools. I totally disagree. Politics is important to
16-year-olds, just as it is to older young people. Politics decides
what kind of schools we go to. Politics has ensured that there is
access to free education for all. It is politics that meant that the
school sports partnerships were abandoned. It is politics that decides
what people learn at school—which classes are compulsory and
which are not. In Derbyshire, the youth services have been seriously
undermined; it was children and young people who were campaigning to
keep their youth services open and active. This is straightforward
politics, and it is good for young people to engage in
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000446" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000446">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:18:11"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) mentioned
the youth mayor in Newham. Let me give an example from my own
constituency of young people taking responsibility. A budget was given
to the school council at one of my primary schools, and after much
discussion with the teachers, the school council decided to spend the
entire £50 on rabbits. The teachers recommended that it not do
so, pointing out that they would take a lot of looking after, but it
decided to go ahead. Sure enough, they did take a lot of
looking after, but those children learnt that if they make such a
decision, contrary to advice, there are consequences, and that they had
a duty of responsibility to those rabbits. I hope those rabbits are
still alive—I have not visited them recently. Even though that
is a small story, it demonstrates that if we give young people
responsibility, they have to learn how to deal with it
properly.</hs_Para>

that it is a matter of respect. We as parliamentarians should be saying
to young people, “We respect you enough to allow you to make
your own decisions about matters that affect you.” This is an
important issue that concerns the widening of the franchise and human
rights.</hs_Para>

Kingdom is a signatory to the United Nations convention on the rights
of the child. My hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)
is shaking his head, but the convention states that when decisions are
made that affect young people, they should have a say in those
decisions. As has been pointed out 
<?notus-xml column=494?>today, we make decisions in the House about the age at which people are
allowed to join the armed forces—as opposed to the age at which
they are allowed to go to the front and lose their lives—and the
age at which they are allowed to go to work and pay tax and national
insurance. They can do those things from the age of 16 onwards. We make
decisions that affect young people, but they have no way of voicing
their opinions about what we
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000449" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000449"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Barry Sheerman" PimsId="663" UID="13012438001493" xid="531" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438001493"><B>Mr

Engel:</Member></B> My hon. Friend and I have had long discussions
about this issue. I do not disagree with him about the preservation of
childhood—in fact, I entirely agree with him about it—but
I also think that lowering the voting age to 16 will not encroach on
people’s childhoods. What it will do is give them
responsibility, which is very different from taking their childhood
away. My counter-argument is that, although we make decisions here that
affect the day-to-day lives of people aged 16, 17 and 18—and, in
my view, those aged up to 23, because many people are knocking on 23
before they are able to vote—we have taken away their right to
have a say in issues that affect them. That is what I find so deeply
offensive and
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000451" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000451">The

the franchise. I think that this really is a matter of human rights. It
is slightly different from the issue of giving the vote to women, but I
agree with the hon. Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley) that
the sky will not fall in if we give 16-year-olds the vote. The sight of
a 16-year-old in a polling station putting a cross on a ballot
paper—not one, two, three—should not panic people. This
will not mean that the entire polling station is full of 16-year-olds;
it will merely mean that younger people too will participate in the
decisions that we make in the House. It is a shame that people are so
fearful, and worry so much about 16-year-olds taking part in a general
election.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000452" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000452">The
Scottish referendum will give us an opportunity to see how giving
16-year-olds the vote could work. Why should we not view it as a pilot?
After 16, 17 and 18-year-olds have had their say in the referendum, we
can look at how it went. I agree that the genie is out of the bottle
once 16-year-olds are able to vote in a referendum, because after that
it will be very difficult to say to them that they are to be denied a
vote in the general election that will take place in the following
year.</hs_Para>

point is that although those young people are capable of asking very

that we should give them the vote. If that were the basis on which we
were making these decisions, I would have to agree to give
seven-year-olds, eight-year-olds and nine-year-olds the vote because
they ask some of the most searching questions. So it is completely
spurious to trot that argument out as a way of saying that these people
should be able to vote. This is not just about people’s
education, intellect or ability to ask searching questions; it is about
people’s life experience, too. That is what gives people the
basis on which to vote. It seems to me that 18 is a far better cut-off
point than 16. I am perfectly happy to concede that these are matters
of individual judgment, but I believe that 18 is the right
point.</hs_Para>

they held a deep-seated principle that 16-year-olds have the education
and information to make these informed decisions, I would have more
respect for it, even though I might not agree with it. But that is not
the case, because all the people who have so far advocated reducing the
voting age to 16 are exactly the same people who voted to increase the
age at which people could decide to smoke from 16 to 18. The point is
that people are either informed or they are not—they are either
educated or they are not. They are not educated on one matter of voting
but completely clueless on everything else. They 
<?notus-xml column=497?>can either make an informed decision or they cannot. I agreed with
increasing the age at which people could buy cigarettes to 18, because
I believe that 18 is the right age at which to trust people to make

they should be able to vote but they have no idea about whether or not

hon. Member for Leeds North East (Fabian Hamilton) says that it is a
matter of public health. But that is an argument for banning smoking
altogether. If people wish to say that they want to ban smoking
altogether, let them say that—but they do not do so. They say,
“We want people to be 18 before they are able to make that kind
of informed choice.” People have not been arguing for banning
smoking; they have been arguing for raising the age limit to 18. The
same should apply to voting as applies to smoking. It cannot be that
one is suitable for 16-year-olds and one is suitable for 18-year-olds,
as that is simply illogical. Therefore, it is not a matter of principle
for people that 16-year-olds are able to make these informed choices;
it is a matter of convenience.</hs_Para>

To be perfectly honest, it is rather pathetic. It would be better if
they at least had some sound logic behind their views and really did
trust 16-year-olds to make decisions—all decisions. What we have
heard today is hon. Members saying that they believe that 16-year-olds
are capable of voting but are not capable of making other decisions
that affect their lives. Voting can be very harmful. I say to hon.
Members that if the public ever decided to put the lot on the Labour
Benches into government again, that would be very harmful to them. So
it is not just smoking that is harmful when people make a bad decision
at 16; voting can be a very harmful thing, too.</hs_Para>

believe that people should make a decision at the age of 18 on all
these matters, be it whether to smoke, whether to drink alcohol and
whether to vote. The people who take an opposite view have not yet
persuaded me and they have not come up with any logical reason to
support their belief that the smoking age should be increased from 16
to 18 whereas the voting age should be reduced from 18 to 16. It is a

Nandy</B> (Wigan) (Lab):</Member> I speak in support of lowering the
voting age because I start from the perspective that extending the
franchise has historically always been a good thing and that in a
democracy people should have the right to shape the decisions that
affect them, unless there is a really good reason why not. My 
<?notus-xml column=498?>starting point is not, “Why lower the voting age to 16?”
but, “Why not lower the voting age to 16? Why prevent people
from voting until they are 18 or even 23, as in the case of some young
people voting in a general election for the first time?
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:34:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

acknowledge that there are arguments of some merit against such a move,
and I will spend a little time discussing them, because some young
people themselves make those arguments. Recently, I went to talk to a
large group of young scouts who had very mixed views about lowering the
voting age. They were marginally in favour as a group, but many of them
were against. Some talked about the problem of maturity, but far more
of those young people talked about a lack of knowledge and the
difficulty of gaining the necessary tools and information to make
meaningful choices of political parties. That is why I agree with so
many hon. Members that lowering the voting age should go hand in hand
with good-quality citizenship education in all our schools. Also, so
many young people have made the point to me that citizenship education
should not be an afterthought or an add-on; it should be a high
priority for schools in enabling young people to make those
choices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:35:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000477" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000477">I
want to go further than that, because I am a huge supporter of the
UNICEF rights respecting schools programme, which some hon. Members may
have seen in action and which is incredibly important. We have heard
the argument, “Why stop at 16? Why not go earlier?” We
have debated that, but from a very young age children can and should be
involved in shaping the institutions and communities they are part of,
thus having an impact on the decisions that affect their lives. I say
to hon. Members who say that that somehow does not protect childhood
that it is an active part of childhood; children are people—they
are citizens—who live in communities and they are not atomistic
individuals who should be seen only through the lens of their parents.
The UNICEF rights respecting schools programme is incredibly important,
because it enables children to learn about politics in an active and
not a passive way; surely we want those sorts of adults in the
future.</hs_Para>

argument that some people do not want the vote and that some will not
use it completely misses the point. The point is that many 16-year-olds
and 17-year-olds do want the vote and do want to use it. Hon. Members
have referred to evidence from overseas, and, in particular, from
Austria and Germany, which suggests that if young people start voting
at 16—this is the crucial point—when they are still in
formal learning, they continue to do so. The argument that 18 to
24-year-olds are less likely to vote therefore again misses the point.
Now is a very opportune time to introduce this measure, because we are
raising the participation age so that young people stay in some form of
formal learning until 18. That is often advanced as a reason not to
give young people the vote, but all the evidence suggests that it is in
fact a reason to do so, as they will still be in formal learning and
can be given the information and skills they need to make the
decisions.</hs_Para>

agree that young people mature at different rates, and that is
reflected in the different ages at which we allow people to do
different things. I will not rehearse those differences, because we
have had a great deal of 
<?notus-xml column=499?>discussion about them, but I wish to make two
points. First, I do not believe that representation should be directly
linked to taxation. Lots of people in this country do not pay tax, for
whatever reason; unemployed people are one such example. I hope that
most hon. Members would not agree with the idea that such people should
not have the vote—that idea appals me. The argument that someone
has to pay taxes before they are allowed to vote is completely
spurious.</hs_Para>

the fact that young people mature at different rates surely cannot be a
reason to say to all 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds that they are simply
not allowed to vote. We have not always got right the ages at which we
decide that people are mature enough to do things—in my view,
the age of criminal responsibility is far, far too low in this
country—but the fact that we are even having a debate about
whether young people should wait eight years from when we hold them
criminally responsible for their actions to when they are allowed to
have a say in the criminal justice system that we are catapulting them
into is completely wrong.</hs_Para>

means that many of them would like to vote, but we know from the
turnout figures that very few 18 to 21-year-olds vote—often less
than half. I do not say that that is a reason for not giving the vote
to 16 and 17-year-olds, because, as has been said, people do not have
to vote. We do not have compulsory voting in this

for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) about young people having to
wait five years before they can vote in a general election. That is
true for people who turn 18 the day after the last general election now
that we have fixed-term Parliaments, but it was equally true in 1992
and 2005, when there were five-year Parliaments. In all areas of the
country, there will be opportunities to vote in local elections before
the next general election. Of course, millions of young people in
metropolitan areas will be able to vote in elections three years out of
every four. That is true of my constituency, as it is of the whole of
Greater Manchester.</hs_Para>

has been mentioned that some countries have reduced the voting age to

It is 20 in Japan and 21 in Pakistan and Malaysia, so there are
international comparators where the age at which young people can vote
is higher. There is an argument that making young people wait until
they are 18 before they can vote shows how important and serious the
act of voting is. The Youth Citizenship Commission examined the
question of lowering the voting age in 2009 and found that it was not

stand in local elections when they are 18, and they do—and get
elected. The discrepancy has narrowed. My key point is this: if we
educate young people to understand the issues, as the House’s
education department does, and as we do when we go into schools; if,
when children are still at home, parents educate them on the issues;
if, as colleagues in all parts of the House have said, we are keen for
people to be more competent to make financial decisions when they leave
school; if we want to make sure that young people understand how to
apply for work, and look for training, a university or college,
apprenticeships and so on, and have the information that they need; we
should logically link that with the ability to see what the options are
in life, and who makes those decisions.</hs_Para>

increasingly well with an increasingly bright cohort—and there
is a gap of up to five years before they can apply what they have

unrealistic. However, it is often young people who are the most
idealistic in the world—who want to change the world, and live
out what they believe. If we start saying, “No, you can’t
get involved at this age. I’m sorry, you’ll have to wait.

children born now will live to 100. As a percentage of the lifespan,
childhood is a very brief period. I want to celebrate childhood. I want

commercial pressures on young people today. Take advertising. Look at

childhood from the commercial world is tremendous. We as politicians

take childhood through to 18. I know that we cannot apply that to
everything, but 18 gives us a standard by which to judge how far

part of the demand and the fashion of votes at 16 comes from the fact
that our parliamentary democracy is in deep trouble. We know that only
65% voted at the last election and that 6 million people did not
bother to register. We all know that the three main parties
represented in this place have hardly any members in their
constituencies—tiny numbers of people active in politics. I know
that the Liberal Democrats have believed in proportional representation
to do something about that, but we are all floundering around because

not deny that there are arguments for it, but I worry that it is a
pretext for not looking at the deeply worrying decay of parliamentary
democracy in our country. I hope this does not come to a vote. Everyone
on the Labour Benches knows that I am a reasonable man. At the very
least, I would like the Government to set up a commission on an
all-party basis to look into the matter. If my concerns and worries
about the protection of children are ill-founded, an independent
commission looking at that might give me cause not to worry any longer,

about today. There are different ages of responsibility between the
ages of 16 and 18. There are certain things that 16-year-olds can and
cannot do, there are certain things that 18-year-olds can do, and there
certain things that people cannot do until they are 21. We sometimes
have to draw a line when it comes to these issues, but to say that 16

people do not get the opportunity to vote in a general election until
six or seven years after their citizenship education—whatever

can see why many in the Government might not want to extend the right
to vote to 16, for very practical reasons from their point of view.
Policies are often shaped in recognition of the power of the elderly
vote, and rightly so—that is what democracy is about. However,
young people have borne the brunt of this Government’s policies,
with the abolition of the education maintenance allowance, the increase
in tuition fees, the scrapping of the future jobs fund, turning the
clock back with GCSE and A-level reforms, and much more besides. How
differently those issues might have been viewed if 16 and 17-year-olds

said that it is a matter of principle and practice. In practice, the
evidence from elsewhere appears to be that lowering the voting age
proves to be a good and not a bad thing. Austria did it five years ago,
and the evidence appears to be that interest in politics among its
young people has greatly increased. The evidence on their voting is
that turnout is similar to that among other age groups, as is the
pattern of voting. That should lead us to conclude that 16-year-olds

responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:24:41"></hs_TimeCode>.

young people from all walks of life to enable them to have their say in
civil society.
Carly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:29:20"></hs_TimeCode> stated
that many young people are dissatisfied with local issues but struggle
to know how to become properly involved in politics. She argued that
there was a need for better education and noted that not all adults
made arguments based on solid reasoning. Another young

that not all adults

that a lot of older people lacked an interest in political engagement
and awareness but the same ideas about requiring a level of knowledge

A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:28:51"></hs_TimeCode> number of

Members. Some of the most passionate debates in the long history of
this House have been about the extension of the franchise, including
those on the Reform Acts of 1832 and 1867, the Representation of the
People Act 1884, the removal of the requirement to own property in
order to be able to vote, the extension of the franchise to women in
1918 and to everyone over the age of 21 in 1928, and, of course, in
1969, the extension of the franchise to everyone over the age of 18.
Like those reforms, extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds for
all elections is a matter of civil rights. It demonstrates that, when
it comes to participating in the democratic process, equality should be
our prevailing
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000586" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000586">Article

my view, extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds would boost our

<?notus-xml column=515?>parliamentary election would have to wait until they were nearly 23
years of age before they could cast a vote to choose a Government or
elect their constituency Member of this Parliament or the Scottish
Parliament. Evidence shows that the longer people wait to cast that

16 and 17-year-olds can serve as company directors, get married or
enter a civil partnership, be members of our armed forces and
contribute to and benefit from our welfare state. As the Power

reduce the systematic exclusion from democracy of tens of thousands of
our young people and increase the likelihood of their taking part in

countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Austria in beginning the

in doing so, to further the cause of

that we hear against the change seem to range from protecting democracy

essentially what we heard today from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:40:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)—that despite all the things on
which we are letting children down, such as product placement and
sexualisation, the one point where we can draw the line is by keeping
the voting age at 18 to somehow protect their childhood. That is an
argument of complete
misdirection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:40:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000598" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000598">We
should consider what reducing the voting age would mean for our
democracy and for how people appreciate their status as young citizens.
If we want 16 and 17-year-olds to identify themselves increasingly as
young citizens, perhaps we should mandate, recognise and equip them as
young citizens by giving them the right to vote, which is a basic
thing. That is why I support the motion, just as I supported the
proposal in the last
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:41:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000599" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000599">We

the change. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:41:17"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) made the point
that the argument for extending the vote to 16-year-olds is not the
same as the argument in the past for extending the vote to women.
However, the arguments that we hear against it are pretty similar to
those that were used against giving votes to women—they do not
really want it, they are ill-informed, they would be too frivolous or
giddy, they are distracted by other things, and if they do vote they
will vote according to what somebody else tells them. Perhaps the
danger is really that if they vote, they will not vote according to
what somebody else tells them. Those are all the same arguments that
were used against extending the franchise to women. The arguments for
the change are not the same, but the arguments against are uncannily
and disgracefully
similar<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:42:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000600" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000600">We

for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)—this is my version, which
might not be as good as that in <I>Hansard</I>—that we will have
a whole load of people who cannot vote and will not vote. Who is he to
say that they cannot and will not vote if we put them on the electoral
register? They could have as much competence as he or I. Many political
parties allow 16 and 17-year-olds votes within the party. People can
become members of my party at 14 and vote in it at 16, and other
parties allow young people to vote in internal elections, including for
party leaders, at 15. Those elections have a pretty significant impact
on the country, so if parties allow that in their own democracy, I do
not see why people should not be allowed on the register at that
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:43:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000601">Members
have mentioned various places that have already moved to allow, and I
would mention that a constitutional convention has been established in
Ireland by the current Government. It includes parties and non-party
interests, including from Northern Ireland, and is examining the issue
of reducing the voting age. It is considering a voting age of 17,
because that is the age of consent in the Irish Republic. It is not
considering an age of 16, because it does not want to open up another
debate that might never be resolved, but I hope that the advance to 17
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000602" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0002.htm#13012438000602">It
is important to recognise that although extending the franchise will
allow people to vote, of course many will not do so. It will mean that
people have a chance of 
<?notus-xml column=517?>exercising their first vote at a better age. We have
heard that fixed-term Parliaments will mean that the maximum age at
which people could have their first parliamentary vote will be 23. If
the change to 16 were made, that would mean that that age would be 21.
That does not seem unreasonable or shocking to me. It would not be too
radical or drastic, and it seems sensible.</hs_Para>

change would also increase the prospects of people casting their first
possible vote, because more of them will be at or near home and able to
do so. Having the voting age at 18 means that people are often away
from home by the time their first vote comes up, and they have not
thought about a postal vote, so they miss out. The change would help
the integrity of the franchise by ensuring that it counts, and that is

I have said, we ought not to amend something as important as the
electoral franchise without a clear case for doing so. I note that
there are great divergences of opinion in wider society. Most studies

the voting age—perhaps that is not surprising—but the
situation is not always clear. A 2009 YouGov survey of 14 to
25-year-olds conducted for the Citizenship Foundation, another
organisation for which I am sure hon. Members have great respect,
showed that a majority of that age group—some younger and some
older than those in the category we are debating—opposed votes
for 16-year-olds: only 31% were in favour, but 54% were against. That

ways. The British Youth Council has received funding from the
Department for Education to promote the voice of young people at
national and local level. That includes establishing a new national
scrutiny group of representative and elected young people to advise
Ministers across the UK Government directly. I look forward to my first
meeting with the group. The Cabinet Office is working with Bite the

engaging directly with young people and black and minority

Members have argued that 16 and 17-year-olds ought to be able to vote
in order to help engage young people at an early age in our democratic
and political processes at an early age, but they do not yet convince
me. I have not seen compelling evidence. The Youth Citizenship
Commission, which the previous Government set up in 2008—no
doubt it was part of their onward journey—considered ways in
which to develop young people’s understanding of citizenship and
increase their participation in politics. It also considered whether
the voting age ought to be set at 16. In its summer 2009 report, it
felt unable to make a recommendation on whether the voting age should
be lowered. It suggested that there was a lack of evidence regarding
the merits of votes at 16, and noted that there were vigorous views on
either side of the debate, which we have heard in the debate. It said
that it

findings were in line with those made five years earlier by the
Electoral Commission in its 2004 report on the age of majority. The
commission recommended in its report that the minimum age stays at 18
years. It also recommended reducing the minimum candidacy age from 21
to 18 so that voting and candidacy are the same—a number of hon.

introduced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000654" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000654">The
evidence is therefore not clear cut. We should certainly continue to
consider the question, and I welcome the role of the Backbench Business
Committee in that. Perhaps the more pressing question is what we can do
to increase registration and turnout in groups who can vote.
Registration among young people is lower than among other population
groups. Recent Electoral Commission research shows that 55% of 17 and
18-year-olds and 56% of 19 to 24-year-olds were on the register,
compared with 94% of over-65s. Those figures are
telling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000655" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000655">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:09:29"></hs_TimeCode>
also note that the turnout figures for 18 to 24-year-olds have been
falling. At successive elections from 1974 to 1992, approximately a
quarter of that group did not vote. That is important to know and
something we all ought to take seriously and work on. There is clearly
an issue about engagement, particularly with younger electors, which
goes beyond franchise, and the Government are trying to address
it.</hs_Para>

better 
<?notus-xml column=524?>by introducing individual registration. It will create a legislative
framework to allow alternative channels for registration, such as
online registration. The move from paper to digital will make
registration more convenient and increase accessibility—a
significant transition. We want to ensure that during this period we
enable as many people as possible of all ages to register to vote. We
know we need to go further than those changes alone. I mentioned that
the Government are working with a range of organisations to seek to
engage individuals and communities from all sections of society into
the political process, and specifically to drive up registration rates

have been Westminster Hall debates every year since 2008 to consider
Holocaust memorial day, on 27 January each year. Sunday will
mark the 68th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau by
the Russian army, which liberated the concentration camp and the death
camp. These debates are always well attended, and I look forward to
hearing from many Members who will have their personal views on what
this means to them. I would like to frame today’s debate in
three ways: first, through personal experience and the experiences of
my constituents; secondly, by examining why bringing this debate to the
Chamber at this time is important; and thirdly, by exploring what we as

commended the fantastic work of the Holocaust Educational Trust,

like to do the same. It was through the trust’s “Lessons
from Auschwitz” project that I was able to visit the camp with
schoolchildren from my constituency in 2011. I went knowing what
Auschwitz was, but I left understanding what it means. What struck me
most about my visit was that the 11 million who are
estimated to have died were like all of us in this room. The lists of
names, ages, professions and home towns built a picture of lives and
told stories of living, breathing people with hopes and fears, just
like our own today. I left feeling harrowed, but uplifted by the
thoughtful, emotive responses of the pupils I had visited Auschwitz
with. What is so effective about such projects is that the children
returned to their schools to share their experiences with so many
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:28:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

and I agree with him. As people grow old and pass on, it is up to us,
our children and our children’s children to ensure that their
story is always told and never forgotten. When I was a little lad of 10
in my home town, I remember a Cheshire Regiment soldier who had been
part of the liberation of Belsen telling me about the camp. I had had
no comprehension of such things as a 10-year-old; I had always thought
that we had been the plucky Brits who fought the war and beat the
Germans. The idea of the holocaust had never occurred to me. I remember
him telling me how he had been affected by coming upon Belsen as a
19-year-old British soldier, and how it had affected him for the rest
of his life.

Ireland. If there is one place in the UK that could benefit in a

time. Anti-Semitism, homophobia and prejudice still exist all across

pilot who said that if there had been a peace treaty in 1945 and if the
Germans had come to negotiate for peace, the bombing would have stopped
overnight. They did not want to kill women and children; they wanted to
bring the second world war to a close. The moment it did close, the
bombing was stopped. I do not think for one moment that if there had

Dresden bombing raid, right at the end of the second world war, was
dreadful but the Tokyo fire raid in 1945 was far, far worse. More
people were killed in that raid than were killed in Hiroshima or
Nagasaki. All bombing of civilians is a terrible thing, but the point I
am making is that the Nazis’ “final solution” was
hell-bent on ring-fencing a group of people and annihilating them from
the face of the earth. The “final solution”
was not a decision made on high by a few, but a calculated move riding
on a wave of ill will which swept across Europe—a wave which,
lest we forget, also encompassed the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

well-preserved and looked after by the Polish authorities. The guides
are professional and they give visitors a very clear story, sometimes,
quite naturally, with a Polish bias. But on getting to Birkenau, one
can see almost unspoilt—if I can put it 
<?notus-xml column=535?>that way—the horrors of that camp. There is the railway the hon.
Gentleman described, that goes from the beginning—from that wall
and that gate—right through to the crematorium and the showers:
the gas chambers, which were partially destroyed. There are the huts,
originally built for horses, which were imported from Germany and, so I
understood from our guide, contained up to 1,000 people who were kept
captive there. The facilities there were horrifying. The prisoners were
treated probably worse than the horses would have been treated. The
Nazis destroyed most of those huts, leaving—as other Members who
have visited the camp will recall—a sea of chimneys, all in
straight lines, where the boilers and fires were, to give some
rudimentary heat in the depths of
winter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000890" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000890"><Member ContinuationText="Mr John Spellar" PimsId="781" UID="13012438001777" xid="555" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001777"><B>Mr

whom we visited the camps—thanks to the Holocaust Educational

politically; not for the children, of course. However, one of my good
friends in the House—I hope that he will not mind my mentioning
this—is the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir

us went to Krakow at our own expense, and hired our own guide, a young
woman called Kasia. She had been doing the job for about 10 years, and
I think that it had burnt her out. Although Polish, she was not Jewish,
but just the experience of 10 years of guiding people around had made
her into a very nervous person. I believe that she retired from the job
subsequently. It can only be done for a limited time because the pain
is so great. Even someone with no personal involvement cannot but be
absorbed into what happened to those many hundreds of thousands of
people who were victims of the Nazi persecution. We had a fascinating
time. My wife had never been there before. She is not Jewish,
but I am. We saw the photographs at the “reception
centre”, which had not been there in 1998, but many hon. Members
who have been subsequently will have seen it. We saw the pictures of
the families that had been taken from the suitcases and from their
belongings, and put on the exhibition boards at the exit to the
so-called “reception centre”. My wife looked at them and
what she saw were no relatives of mine but people who looked like my
relatives—they looked like people from my family’s

Member for Tonbridge and Malling, I was asked by the BBC in Leeds to
make a documentary. This is important, as it involved the HET and two
young people, a young Muslim boy of 17 from Bradford and a young Jewish
girl of 17 from Leeds. I was the adviser on the programme, and the BBC
producer and interviewer was Liz Green, who runs a daily show on BBC
Radio Leeds. This very unusual radio documentary was called
“Moon and Star”, after the symbols of the two faiths.
What was most fascinating was the reaction of those two young people,
who could not believe what they were seeing. Their reactions were
almost identical, even though the Jewish girl knew the history perhaps
better than the Muslim boy. It was very hard to stop the tears towards
the end of that documentary, when we were standing outside the remains
of the crematorium and the gas chamber. We came back, and the programme
was then edited, broadcast and syndicated. I believe it is available in
all schools today, and I was proud to have been involved in
it.</hs_Para>

the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood), I would like to
mention two holocaust survivors. I will then try to finish my remarks
in order to let others contribute. The first is a gentleman called Arek
Hersh, who at the age of 11 was taken off the streets of Lodz in Poland
and to a number of different concentration camps. I met him first in my
constituency and subsequently at Yad Vashem in
Jerusalem, which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:01:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Weaver Vale has mentioned. A room there was being dedicated to Arek
Hersh, who survived five years in concentration camps. Hon. Members who
have visited Yad Vashem will recall the recreation of the main square
of the ghetto in Lodz. The most moving moment came when Arek, who had
been lifted from that square, was standing in the reproduction of the
square. I saw a man, by this time in his late 70s, in tears because he
felt he was back there, aged 11—it was very moving.</hs_Para>

course, as the guide said, when children, young people and adults were
taken to the concentration camps they had a number tattooed on their
wrist—many hon. Members will have seen these. Arek rolled up his
sleeve and there was a number. His friend Yitzak, who lives in
Jerusalem and who had been there with him, rolled up his sleeve to show
the next, consecutive number. The two boys had shared a bunk together
for five years until they were liberated from Theresienstadt in 1945.
Arek Hersh now goes around Leeds, Yorkshire and the country telling his
story—he is one of those survivors. He is now in his early 80s
and he is still very lucid. If any hon. Member wishes to get in touch
with him, I will give them his number, because he is one of those last
survivors who is still able to articulate his experiences very clearly,
in his beautiful Yorkshire-Polish accent.</hs_Para>

other person I wish to mention is Iby Knill, who is very interesting. I
invited her here, with Mr Speaker’s permission, to talk to
Members about two years ago. Unfortunately not many Members attended,
so perhaps we did not publicise the talk well enough. She wrote a book
called “The woman without a number” because she had not
been tattooed. She is Jewish and was originally from Bratislava,
although she escaped over the border into Hungary. She was captured as
a political prisoner, and her experience is remarkable to listen to.
She was in Auschwitz—she was in that camp in Birkenau—and
she met some of the most evil representatives of the Nazi regime every
single day. She volunteered for a slave labour factory because that was
the way to prevent herself being starved to death. She was quite a fit
young woman and she was a nurse. She got together with other young
women who were in the medical profession and they all survived because
they kept together as a group. She said, “If you allowed
yourself to be picked off one by one, that was the route to an early
death. But if you kept together and kept some solidarity, you generally
kept alive—if you were very, very lucky.” She was lucky;
she went there fairly late.</hs_Para>

I want to mention members of my family, as I said earlier. I have never
relayed this story in public before, although I have told one or two
close friends about it. In 1985, my late father, who died 25 years ago
next week, rang me up and said, “Fabian, I’d like you to
come to Salonica with me this weekend.” I said, “Why,
dad?” and he said, “I have just discovered that my aunt, 
<?notus-xml column=538?>who I thought had died in Belsen during the war, survived.” That
was 1985, 40 years after the war. He was 63 and had last seen that part
of the family when he was 14 in
1936<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:05:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000904" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000904">We
took the next flight to Salonica, which is where most of his family
came from, and were met at the airport by a tall, elegant 93-year-old
called Ida Uziel. Uziell is my family’s name, and Hamilton was
given to my father during the war when he volunteered for the Special
Operations Executive. Ida was very elegant and had survived Belsen with
her daughter, Bella, and her granddaughter, who was three at the time.
They were all there in the flat in Salonica to greet us and told us
first hand their account of their lives in Belsen. It was staggering to
hear. What was all the more moving was that they had lost all their
original photographs and family mementoes, but my father had duplicates
that he had brought along together with the family tree. We sat in
Ida’s flat and looked through the different family relationships
as we heard this first-hand account of life in Belsen—I had
never heard such an account before and I was 30 years old at the time.
We heard of the liberation by the Russians, their recapture by the
Germans and their re-liberation by the Russians.</hs_Para>

story they told us was that they were, of course, starving. They were
lucky as they had gone to the camp late, which was why they survived. A
lot of people who were liberated at the time immediately ate whatever
food they could—of course, that is the first thing anyone would
do—but the family were lucky because they were with a doctor,
who told them not to eat any dairy products as their bodies would not
be able to absorb the fats and it would be very damaging, if not fatal.
Sadly and ironically, people died from eating fats that their bodies
could not absorb after years of starvation. I am glad to say that the
Uziel family did not, as they took the advice of the doctor and ate
bread, light food, vegetables and fruits and gradually allowed their
bodies to readjust to the nutrition they had been denied for so long.

survived the war by ducking and diving, weaving and dodging. I should
explain that that part of my family had come from Switzerland to live
in Paris in the 1930s. My grandmother lived in Paris throughout
the war, but luckily she had a Portuguese passport and was spared
persecution. Her brothers were not so lucky; one was killed, but the

were called Raina and Isaac Sevilla. I have plenty of photographs of
them in my parents’ albums. They had come to Paris from
Switzerland and taken French citizenship. When the Nazis invaded Paris,
and Paris fell, they were asked to register. My grandmother told me
that the Nazis

cousin Peggy found a death certificate issued in Auschwitz

That work is aimed at ensuring that we understand each other’s

not for the reason people might expect. I visited Yad Vashem on a trip

of the things that particularly angered me was that Auschwitz-Birkenau
murdered 1.3 million people— 1.3 million—yet we

of Auschwitz-Birkenau with empty carriages, no one noticed that they
went in full and came out empty. When the local traders delivered food
and supplies to the guards, did they not 
<?notus-xml column=541?>notice the people standing around in the freezing cold in the striped
uniforms? We are told that no one noticed. That made me angry. No one

to the camp is the Polish town that bears the name Oswiecim, or
Auschwitz. Before the war that had a population of about 12,000, of
whom 58% were Jewish. The Jewish and non-Jewish population lived side
by side harmoniously—Jewish bakers, synagogues, a whole range of
shops which showed that there was a vibrant Jewish community living
harmoniously alongside the non-Jewish population. The local council,
much like my own council in Barnet, had Jewish and non-Jewish
councillors working together for the good of the town, yet shortly
after the war started, there were no Jews left in Oswiecim, not one,

one in two houses. Would I not have noticed? If the same happened in

we are having this debate today is that we are approaching Holocaust
memorial day, the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau,
but people might not realise that it is a relatively recent
commemoration, and indeed one that was decided by this Parliament. It
originated with a private Member’s Bill introduced by Andrew
Dismore, who at the time was Member of Parliament 
<?notus-xml column=542?>for Hendon. The Bill was enthusiastically supported by the whole House
and led to the creation of Holocaust memorial day, a day on which the
whole community focuses not just on what happened in the holocaust and
ensuring that people know about it, but on learning the lessons of what
happened. Both are extremely

Monday evening I attended a reception in the House organised by the
Holocaust Educational Trust, of which I am a council member. The trust
was set up by two parliamentarians—Lord Greville Janner, who was
a Member of this House and is now an active Member of the other place,
and the late Merlyn Rees—because they wanted to ensure that the
knowledge of the holocaust was known to new generations and that its
lessons were learned by everybody. At Monday evening’s

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:22:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

would like to draw hon. Members’ attention to the story of one
particular survivor, Ben Helfgott, a very remarkable man. He spends
most of his time talking to young people and others and working in the
wider community to create good community relations and ensure that
people know about the depravity of what happened in the past. He found
what I think is an excellent way of communicating his life story and
what happened. He was the guest on a very memorable episode of
“Desert Island Discs” in which he told with great
pathos—at times it was almost unbearable to hear—the
story of what happened to him as a young lad and to his family. It was
a compelling broadcast. I understand that Kirsty Young, in the middle
of interviewing him, had to stop the recording to recover her
composure. I commend that broadcast because I think that it tells, in a
way that is very different from what we usually hear, what happened and
the intensity, pathos and horror of Ben’s experiences. The
important thing about Ben’s life is that he spends his time not
just talking about what was bad and evil but working for good, and with
a positive attitude to the whole of humankind. That is what inspires

has been made to what is happening in other countries in Europe, with
the rise of the blatantly anti-Semitic Jobbik party in Hungary and the
Golden Dawn party in Greece, which should give us growing cause for
concern. In this country, yes, the situation is different, but there
are still things that we should all be concerned about. The Jewish
community in this country is a proud community of proud British
citizens working hard as members of this society. However, there is
unease. I commend the work of the Community Security Trust, which works
within the Jewish community and, indeed, the wider community to
identify anti-Semitism and prejudice against any other groups. In the
first six months of last year alone it recorded 299 anti-Semitic
incidents—a lot of incidents and a cause for concern. The trust
does not only work with the Jewish community; it is now working with
the Muslim community to show them the methods it uses, to ensure that
anti-Semitic incidents and deplorable Islamophobic incidents will be
recorded in a way that is seen as absolutely reliable by the police,
who are then able to act. I commend the Community Security Trust for
the work that it does. It is a remarkable institution doing excellent

is also the issue of rhetoric—the kind of anti-Semitism that its
perpetrators often do not recognise they are carrying out. I say to
people who, in arguments about any topic, refer to Jewish power,
alleged Jewish influence or Jewish conspiracies, or use images such as
Jews as snakes, that they should realise that they are reflecting
anti-Semitic rhetoric. They should think about what they say, because
when Jewish people hear those terms a little shudder is felt within
most of us as we recognise that those are the words and images of the
blatant anti-Semitism that was used in such a horrendous way by the
Nazis. Some people do this through ignorance and simply do not
understand what they are doing; others, I suspect, are not so ignorant.

tarnished as a result, is a process that will never lose its
significance. In so many ways, the holocaust stands alone in its sheer
horror as a direct warning of the dangers of intolerance and prejudice
when coupled with unchecked political power. Numerous events since

previous generations were forced to witness. History must therefore
always have an important place in our education system, and not just
lessons about the second world war—it must go further

and religions spread through this country in waves on many
occasions, and that the inclination to persecute people because they

58% of the population of Oswiecim was Jewish. We then visited Auschwitz

piles of belongings seized by the Nazis. Finally, we spent time at the
main killing centre of Birkenau, where the day concluded with candle
lighting and a period of reflection to remember the 6 million
Jews and Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Roma, Sinti, gay, disabled and
black people, and other victims of the Nazis killed during the

We refurbished an IT suite at the local secondary school, built a

Fourteen years after the horrific violence that took the lives of 8,000

contribution I was able to make towards that goal during my time there.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country still tilting uncertainly between
its past and its future, and could slip backwards without sustained
international attention. Now more than ever, it is vital that the
international community does not forget about conflicts that many see
as behind us in areas such as Bosnia. We have to keep supporting the

taking people when they are so young to see such a terrible place. The

scale of the holocaust against the Jews has not been reached since, the

Dynevor grammar school, Swansea, where I had an inspirational teacher
by the name of Mr Graham Davies. He once told the class about a
short, silent film—I have never been able to track it
down—called “Prejudice”.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>I have never
forgotten the theme of that film. It showed a group of schoolchildren
in a playground. All of them were hopping around on their right legs
and they seemed to get on very well, but at some point another child
came into the playground and he hopped around on his left leg.
Gradually, the viewer could see the members of the larger group ganging
up against the individual who was different, and eventually they
attacked and killed him. The film was simply called
“Prejudice”. It had a lesson for me then and it has a
lesson for us still today.</hs_Para>

want briefly to tell the story of two little girls who were caught up
in the holocaust against the Jews. One was my cousin, Chana Broder, who
got in touch with me back in late 2007 as a result of something in the
press about my decision to resign my life membership of the Oxford
union debating society because of its ill-conceived idea of giving a
platform to the holocaust denier David Irving and to the leader of the
anti-Semitic British National party. As a result of those two
individuals being given that platform, I decided that the Oxford union
debating society was not an organisation with which I wished to
continue to be associated. My cousin Chana read something about it out
in Israel, where she has lived for many years since the war, and got in
touch with me to say that she was pleased I had done that. I thought
about her story and decided to relate it in a previous Holocaust
memorial day debate in this House. It bears relating once again,
because that debate took place five years ago, at the beginning of
2008, and a lot of people present today were not in the House of
Commons then.</hs_Para>

quite simple. It is the story
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:56:46"></hs_TimeCode>of a small
family in a village in eastern Poland called Siemiatycze—which
we always anglicise and pronounce
“Semiatich”—which was occupied initially not by
the Germans but by 
<?notus-xml column=550?>the Russians, because when world war two broke out, less than a
fortnight after the Germans had invaded from the west, the Russians
invaded from the east, as hon. Members will be aware, and they carved
up Poland between them. The Jews of that part of Poland occupied by the
Russians were safe for the time being, but after the German invasion of
Russia they were in the front line. I remember my late father telling
me that the first time he knew that his family had had it was the only
time he heard Siemiatycze mentioned in a radio broadcast, when he heard
that invading German forces had reached that place.</hs_Para>

our family—approximately 50 or so people living in that
village—only five survived. Three of the five were Chana and her
parents—that little family—and all the ones who survived
did so only because they were sheltered and protected by Poles, at the
risk of their own lives. Chana and her parents used to run a little
village store. A family called the Krynskis, who were a very poor
Polish farming family, used to come into the store—a convenience
store, I suppose we would call it today—in the years before the
war. Sometimes my cousins could see that they were rather short of the
wherewithal to make the purchases they wanted to make and they would
say, “Look, Mr Krynski, Mrs Krynski, take what you
need and pay us when you can.” Little did they imagine that that
simple act of charity would result in the Krynskis saving their lives
when many other doors were closed to them, as they fled from the
liquidation of the ghetto that was formed in Siemiatycze, preparatory
to the extermination of the Jews. My cousin’s family lived for a
year and a half in a bunker under a barn, coming out only late at night
when it was safe to do so. The Krynski family gave them the sustenance
to survive all that time, until the Russians overran the village of
Siemiatycze once again and they were saved. They subsequently went to
Canada, and then to Israel.</hs_Para>

sad part of the story is that, when people later tried to persuade Mr

of his family, he decided that it was probably better not to do so,

after the war. He felt that it would not be a good thing for him to go
back to live there, having been rewarded for saving Jews. I know that
Poland has moved a long way from those attitudes today, thank goodness,
but that was the situation then.</hs_Para>

second story is of a young girl called Nina Karsov. She is a
friend of mine. She and her parents were on a train being taken to an
extermination camp. They came from Warsaw. Somehow, they managed to
jump from the train. The mother was killed instantly, but the little
girl, who was two, lay in the snow for quite some time until her father
managed to make his way back to find her. He took her back to Warsaw,
where they were separately sheltered, again by gallant Polish families.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:01:15"></hs_TimeCode>One day, there
was a raid on the quarter of Warsaw in which the father was being
hidden. In order not to give away the people who had been sheltering
him, he raced across to another building, climbed to the roof and threw
himself off so that he could not be forced to disclose the identity of
the people who had sheltered him. Nina survived and was brought up by
the person she calls her Polish mother. She is today a researcher in
the House of Commons, working for me.</hs_Para>

anybody who fell under the spread of the barbarism of Nazi Germany and
survived would have had to go through something like that. Those
“ordinary extraordinary” stories affect different people

knowledge of what happened to my family has motivated me always to take
the view that it is folly for peaceful democracies to be weak while
vicious dictatorships arm themselves and become strong.</hs_Para>

found herself being brought up in post-war Poland under the communists.
Despite everything that she had been through, she nevertheless worked

she was sentenced to three years in jail by the communists for standing
out against what communism meant in post-war Poland. I am pleased to
say that, as a result of a campaign by Amnesty International, which
made her its prisoner of the year in 1968, she was freed after serving
two years of her sentence and came to this country.</hs_Para>

not think there is any danger of our forgetting the lessons of those
terrible times. Nina’s story is told in a book called

Members have spoken in moving terms about their personal experiences.
My interest in understanding more about genocide arose through visits
to Rwanda. Members may be aware that there is a Conservative social
action project, known as “Project Umubano”, in which I
participated in 2008, 2009 and last year.
Up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:06:01"></hs_TimeCode> to 2008, my
career had involved running a business in my home town and my overseas
visits had been limited to family holidays. I left school at a time
when we did not do gap years. I had never been to Africa or to a third
world country. When I applied to join the project, I knew very little
about Rwanda’s history. I had vague memories of pictures on TV
at some time during the 
<?notus-xml column=552?>’90s, and I watched pictures of a conflict that, to me at that
time, was in a distant country with little relevance to my
life.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438000980" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000980">Before my
visit in 2008, I started to read up about what had happened in Rwanda
throughout 1994. The more I read, the more places I visited while I was
there and the more accounts I heard of how the conflict had affected
people, the more shocked I became and the more I struggled to
understand how the world had stood by and allowed a genocide to
happen.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438000981" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000981">I was
particularly interested to hear the accounts of survivors, via
the work of an organisation called “SURF”, which is the
Survivors Fund. When, a couple of years later, SURF brought a number of
survivors to Bilton school in my constituency, I was keen to go
along to add my contribution about what I had seen and to hear more
accounts from people who had lived through the atrocities, many of whom
had seen their neighbours hacked to death. I was interested in ensuring
that the message about genocide got across to the next
generation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438000982" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000982">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:07:50"></hs_TimeCode>
was what encouraged me to take up the invitation, about which many
Members have spoken, to visit Auschwitz with the Holocaust Educational
Trust, which I did last year. When the invitation arrived on my desk, I
was prompted to accept because I felt by then that I knew more about
what had happened in Africa in 1994 than I knew about what had happened
on my own continent during the second world war, which had affected so
many of my fellow countrymen. Like other Members, I joined a
party of students from Rugby high school at Birmingham airport for a
flight to Poland. We then made the harrowing visit to the concentration
camps.</hs_Para>

was particularly interested in the reactions of the young people I
travelled with. In common with
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:08:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Weaver Vale (Graham Evans), I found that these
usually chatty, vociferous and noisy youngsters became silent over the
day, as they took in the magnitude of what they saw around them. We saw
the massive number of people who were crammed into tiny buildings, and
came to understand something of the arbitrarily imposed punishments. We
walked around the sites of the gas chambers—the buildings having
been blown up as the Russian army advanced.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438000984" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000984">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:09:25"></hs_TimeCode>
recollection of my feelings on that day is that I was surprised and
almost felt guilty that my visit had less impact on me personally than
I thought perhaps it might. I wonder whether that was because of the
visits I had made to Rwanda and my awareness of the Rwandan genocide,
which was much more recent—only some 15 years earlier. I
recall visiting the Murambi Genocide Memorial Centre, where I saw the
mummified bodies of victims whose Achilles heels had been slashed with
machetes so they could not run away. As I finished my visit to
Auschwitz, I felt that I could not be shocked any more.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438000985" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000985">That leads me
to an issue that Members have raised this afternoon. As we start to
lose the generation of people who were survivors of Auschwitz, the
challenge for organisations such as the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust
is, how we keep those memories alive? It is vital for us, as Members of
Parliament, to encourage those organisations to ensure that as many
people as possible are made aware of what happened, and that the
atrocities I have seen in Rwanda and Auschwitz do not happen
again.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

by the description that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey) gave of perpetrators in
Rwanda hacking victims’ Achilles heels to stop them moving. It
is such events, seemingly tiny in the giant scale of these shocking
atrocities, that make the point powerfully. My hon. Friend the Member
for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) will clearly never forget the experiences
he described. Such descriptions paint a real picture of just how
“normal” and “ordinary” these dreadful
things are, some of which happened within the last 20 years. That is
why debates such as this are so important. Otherwise, we can easily
forget; in some cases, it was many years ago.</hs_Para>

involved in all of these debates since the last general election, and I
am very supportive of the Holocaust Educational Trust. To me, one of
the strongest reasons for having such debates is not just that they
remind us of the dreadful and shocking things that happened then, but
that history keeps repeating itself. The work of the trust and other
such bodies is very necessary; otherwise, the awful atrocities that
still occur would probably happen even more often. We in this august
Chamber must each year remind ourselves, and everyone in the UK who
follows these debates, of what happened.</hs_Para>

my colleagues, I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau a few months after the last
election. To me, it seemed that I knew it well, because I had seen it
in so many Hollywood films. That sounds bizarre, but that is the
reality. Of course, I did not know it at all. As I walked around, the
things that really struck home, as a number of Members have mentioned,
were the mechanics: the orderliness of the functionaries; the fact that
they kept expert notes; the fact that they diverted freight trains full
of victims, while at the same time fighting a war to the death with the
Soviet Union. It was literally
insane.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438000992" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000992">Last
night, as I was preparing for the debate, I was reminded of the great
writer Primo Levi, whose work I read when I was a young man. As I am
sure all Members know, he was an Italian chemist, a Jew, who had been
in Auschwitz and who wrote about his experiences, and his general
philosophical approach, a few times after the second world war. I was
reading a couple of quotations last night to remind me of the books
that had had a seminal impact on me when I was only a
teenager.</hs_Para>

was such a good writer, Primo Levi was able to describe the
organisation that was involved in a way that is so simple and yet so
horrific. He wrote:</hs_Para>

questions.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13012438000994" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438000994">That
is the point. It appears that there are a certain number of complete
monsters who are the dictators, who lead and who do terrible things,
but who can do absolutely nothing other than annihilate people around
them. They can do nothing on a grand scale without all those
functionaries.</hs_Para>

consider that so important is that I cannot accept, will not accept and
never have accepted that we are all so pure and that we would do it
differently, given that functionaries could behave in such a shocking
way—ordinary, normal people like us and the people listening to
our debate. Earlier, a Member mentioned the train driver who said that
he did not see anything. That is ludicrous. If a driver sets off with
20 full freight cars behind him and leaves with nothing, he will
obviously notice that. However, there is something within humanity that
just shuts such things off. I do not know what it is, but I do not
believe that that could not occur here. I do not believe that there is
something that was just so much worse for people over there. The reason
I mention that, and the reason the debate is so important to me, is
that I believe that the more we in the Chamber can demonstrate the
truth of just how ordinary that shocking behaviour was, the harder it
will be for society to park it over there and say that it could not
happen here.</hs_Para>

been mentioned. I was born and brought up in Mombasa, in Kenya, which
is a super country no more than a couple of thousand miles from Rwanda.
Some dreadful things happened between the Kikuyu and the Luo only about
a year a half ago. Members may remember hearing the news of the
explosion between them. One thing led to another, one group suddenly
turned on the other, and bang! About 1,000 people were shot down.
Houses were burnt, women and children were killed. I knew those areas

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:22:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

I was growing up, we had no education about the holocaust in school. I
was fortunate, because I grew up alongside Jewish children, so I could
hear at first hand some of the stories about the horrors that their
families had gone through before the war, during the war and after the
war when they were refugees. That is one of the things that is
life-changing for most of us, because when we contemplate that
systematic murder of 6 million people just because they were of the
Jewish faith, we find that it is almost beyond our consciousness; we
cannot imagine how any human being could contemplate doing that. We
cannot imagine why a nation would not stop it, but they did not. The
fact is that those 6 million people—they were all
individuals—lost their lives for no other reason than because
the most hateful political regime ever in history sought to exterminate
them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438001003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001003"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:23:26"></hs_TimeCode>There
are some life-changing moments that we all go through. I first visited
Yad Vashem, the holocaust museum in Jerusalem, some 20 years ago,
before the current museum, which is much larger, was in operation. I
went as a tourist and I spent a full day there. The museum had already
started capturing the testimonies of survivors of the holocaust on
film; as we have said in this debate, so many of these people are,
sadly, no longer with us and it is important to capture the testimonies
so that we remember what happened. The museum had started to put the
exhibitions together, and people could see the full horror of what
happened to the Jews in Germany, not just during the second world war,
but from the rise of Nazism in Germany. We could see how it all came
about. We need to learn those lessons, because in many ways the rise of
the Nazis started at the end of the first world war with the treaty of
Versailles, which imposed such terrible conditions on Germany that it
set the economic climate that allowed the Nazis to come to power and
exert that power in the way that they did.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438001004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001004"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:24:40"></hs_TimeCode>I
represent a part of the country that, according to the most recent
census, has the most concentrated Jewish population. As a result, I
have had the opportunity to meet survivors, people who came by the
Kindertransport 
<?notus-xml column=556?>and people whose families have related personal
experience of what happened in the death camps and concentration camps.
Sadly, they often do not even know where their relatives are.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438001005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001005"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:25:06"></hs_TimeCode>I
have now had the opportunity to go to Yad Vashem five times, and every
time I learn more about the horrors of the Holocaust. I would recommend
anyone going to see it first hand in Jerusalem, because there is no
greater education. I have also had the opportunity of going with the
Holocaust Educational Trust to Auschwitz-Birkenau and seeing, together
with young people, the horrors of that place. Three things stood out
for me. First, visitors walk across what is essentially a parkland. It
is very peaceful and almost deathly quiet. The birds are not singing
and there are the ponds where the Nazis put the ashes of the people
they systematically gassed and then burnt. It is a terrible
place.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438001006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001006"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:26:09"></hs_TimeCode>The
second thing is the maps, which show the systematic approach of
transporting people from all over Europe to put them in a death camp
and murder them. It is then that it comes across that it was not just a
few evil people who did those things; there was a systematic approach
and thousands of people were involved. Thousands of people were guilty
of involvement and millions of people turned their backs and ignored
the reality of what was going on.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438001007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:26:42"></hs_TimeCode>The
third thing that brings home the reality is the collection of
belongings behind glass in cabinets: boots, shoes, spectacles and other
things that were stolen from the people who came to Auschwitz and never
left. It is very important to commemorate the work of the Holocaust
Educational Trust and the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust. They both bring
to life the cold, hard reality of what happened.</hs_Para>

week, there will be two great events in my constituency. The Chief
Rabbi is coming to Park high school on one of his last public
engagements before he retires and one of the students who came to
Auschwitz-Birkenau is giving a lecture to other students at Bentley
Wood school on Tuesday. Those things are vital. I hope the Minister
will comment on the fact that it is vital to continue holocaust
education in our schools and ensure that it is part of the curriculum
for ever more.</hs_Para>

Members mentioned the international aspects of rising anti-Semitism.
Hungary, Greece and Egypt have been mentioned, but we should remember
that every years marches take place in Latvia and Lithuania to
commemorate the Waffen-SS, the exterminators who killed 750,000 Jews
not in concentration camps but by wiping them out wherever they
went. Today, those marches still commemorate those evil people and
celebrate what they did. Such activity is on the rise yet again.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:28:28"></hs_TimeCode>On the Piers
Morgan show on CNN, the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denied
the holocaust and said that it never took place. Here is the president
of a country who denies the holocaust; we must always be fearful of
people who deny the holocaust.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman) mentioned the rise in
the number of anti-Semitic attacks. One thing she did not mention was
that anti-Semitic attacks in London are up by 48% according to the
figures from the Community Security Trust. We must be on our guard at
all times.</hs_Para>

work of the Holocaust Educational Trust and the Holocaust Memorial Day
Trust is vital in ensuring that everyone understands the lessons, so
that we never 
<?notus-xml column=557?>allow such a thing to happen again. Words are sometimes worth repeating,
and I would repeat that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
Unless we remain eternally vigilant, the Nazis and other people could
come back and do it all
again.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_24_PT_1/B3DB1BD8D359594AE9322D532DD1671514FD76AF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="24 January 2013">Thursday

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:31:14"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Ealing Central and Acton (Angie Bray)
reminded us of the role that this country played in offering refuge to
people fleeing the Nazis, and in defeating the Nazi tyranny that led to

happened.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001015">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

about what he witnessed.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:32:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) talked about the impact on young people
of visiting the scene of Nazi atrocities. He took an important

it gave the fascist David Irving a platform from which to
spread his vile

hon. Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey) spoke about the genocide in Rwanda.
It is incredible, really, that after the horrors of the holocaust in
Nazi Germany, a genocide on such a scale could be repeated in
relatively recent times. He talked movingly about speaking to survivors
of the genocide in
Rwanda.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001018">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:33:47"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Eastbourne (Stephen Lloyd) spoke very thoughtfully and
thought-provokingly. He said it was essential for this place to guard
against the normalisation of the horrors of genocide, and for us to
remember that monsters are few. For atrocities to be 
<?notus-xml column=558?>perpetrated on the scale that they were, the acquiescence of
functionaries is required. He also said it could happen again—it
could happen here. It is worth reminding ourselves that Nazi Germany,
which has been the focus of much of the debate this afternoon, was a
sophisticated western civilisation when the Nazis came to power. Who
would have thought that a “sophisticated” nation could
perpetrate such horrors? Yet it happened. I pay tribute to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Eastbourne for reminding us that it was not due simply to some
monsters over there. It can happen anywhere, and we must

genocide<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001019">Finally,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) spoke about how he heard at first hand
from his friends in the Jewish community with whom he grew up about
their parents’ experiences. He spoke about the
incomprehensibility of what happened, and I share his view. To me, to
all of us in the Chamber and to any decent-minded person, it is utterly
incomprehensible that such horrors could be perpetrated. Again, the
hon. Gentleman spoke about the importance of education to ensure that
those horrors are not repeated in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001020">I

is a triumph for democracy that, for the past six years, the House has
hosted this debate, and it is a triumph for decency that Holocaust
memorial day continues to attract significant interest since it was
first launched 12 years ago this Sunday. Perhaps the most famous line
of remembrance comes from Laurence Binyon’s poem, “For
the Fallen”—“We will remember them.”
Those words, captured most famously in the “Ode of
Remembrance”, were written in the year that the first world war
ended. That was about 25 years before the unspeakable horrors that took
place in Nazi Germany, but they remain just as relevant today because
today is about remembering the millions who suffered those barbaric
deaths—the innocent children who must have followed their
parents and grandparents, perhaps naive in their anticipation, but
innately sensing that something dreadful was about to happen, and the
knowing parents, so many of whom must have endured the unimaginable
agony of foreseeing the most horrific fate that awaited them, as first
their captors extinguished their hope, then extinguished their dignity
and finally extinguished their
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:37:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001022">But
today, and every day since the true scale of the holocaust became
apparent, has also been about learning. For if society cannot learn
from the wrongs of the past, what hope does it have? That is why I echo
the sentiments that we have heard from most Members applauding the work
of the Holocaust Educational Trust. The work of that organisation is
most worthy, not just because of the vitally important issue at its
heart, but because of the extraordinary way in which the message is
delivered. The strapline on the trust’s logo states:
“Reaching Generations”.</hs_Para>

us think about those words for a moment: “Reaching
Generations”. It sounds aspirational, but the incredible thing
about this most awful story is that it has reached generations. The
contributions from a number of Members, including
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:38:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Leeds North East, and the intervention from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:38:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood), who is not in her
place, made that point. Ask virtually 
<?notus-xml column=559?>any child over the age of, say, 10 and many below that age, and they can
most likely tell you more than a little about the holocaust. It remains
relevant for our children in the same way as it is relevant for us, for
our parents and for their parents before them. Was it the lowest ebb
known in world history? Very
possibly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:39:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001024">But
we must not be complacent. Just because society knows what happened
before is no reason to believe that it is not capable of repeating
those wrongs in the future. We need look no further than the atrocities
in Rwanda, Bosnia and Cambodia for proof of that. The painful truth is
that we must keep remembering.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:40:50"></hs_TimeCode> must keep
learning, too, because the truth is that the dreadful crimes of the
late 1930s and the 1940s were not restricted to Nazi concentration
camps. Historical evidence suggests that in some areas there was
collaboration, and in others there was just
abstention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001025">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:40:50"></hs_TimeCode>
people try to excuse the Nazi soldiers who enacted those awful crimes
because they were just following orders. They might apply the same
logic to the ordinary citizens who simply accepted it as part of their
society, or the other nations outside Germany that simply turned a
blind eye because a war was on, a point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:40:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Finchley and Golders Green (Mike Freer). None of them is a valid
excuse—an explanation, perhaps, but not an excuse. The moment we
start excusing those who contributed to this—arguably the
greatest atrocity for which the human race has been
responsible—is the moment we lose sight of why we
remember.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001026">Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:40:45"></hs_TimeCode>
today, global society has not learnt all the lessons it should have
learnt from the past. Let us think about three of the groups the Nazis
targeted: people targeted because of their ethnicity, because of their
disability, and because of their sexuality. Have we solved the problem
of discrimination based on ethnicity? Have we ended discrimination
based on disability? Have we got rid of discrimination based on
sexuality? We have come a long way on all three, but the answer to each
is, unfortunately,
no.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001027">The
great worry is that in some areas discrimination is increasing. A black
footballer might now be much less likely to be abused from a football
terrace than he was 30 years ago, but incidents of Islamophobia, for
example, are on the increase. That is why our job here today is not
simply to agree that the monstrous acts that took place in Nazi Germany
must never be repeated; we must be vigilant in preventing the
circumstances that enable fascist ideology to
grow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001028">There
are not many issues that this House agrees on, but reaching consensus
on this issue is the easy part. We should not simply pat each other on
the back for agreeing on something on which it would be impossible to
disagree and then move on to the next business. The hard part is
providing the leadership when we go back to our constituencies, our
communities, our towns and cities, our friends and neighbours, our
colleagues, customers and clients, showing the leadership that proves
that society can learn from its mistakes, that it can move on from its
troubled past, but that it will always
remember.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0003.htm#13012438001029">It
is becoming even more important that we remember because the austerity
that is currently gripping European nations has given a foothold for
fascist extremists to peddle their insidious doctrine. The hon. Member
for Harrow East touched on that when he talked about the circumstances
that led to the rise of the Nazis in Germany after the treaty of

unimaginable atrocities, and yet even in those dark times there was a
glimmer of hope. There were individuals whose consciences would not

because it helps to restore the names, memories and identities of those
who suffered—not just 6 million Jews, but more than 1 million
Cambodians, 1 million who died in Rwanda, hundreds of thousands who
died in Darfur and thousands killed in Bosnia. Holocaust education

the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) on securing the debate, on his
powerful advocacy of the value of having high quality further education

deputising for the Under-Secretary of State for Skills, my hon. Friend
the Member for West Suffolk (Matthew Hancock), who is currently abroad
on official business. I will of course attempt to address the points
that have been raised. I have to admit, perhaps to the disappointment
of the House, that my hon. Friend’s absence may well deprive us
of an interesting discussion on the finer points of cricket, as I
understand that both he and my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:13:09"></hs_TimeCode>are such
passionate followers of the game. I will not attempt to stand in my
ministerial colleague’s shoes on that particular subject as I
fear I would not be particularly eloquent—I apologise to the
House for that. Instead, I shall turn to the points that my
hon. Friend has raised in his

extended a kind invitation to me and my colleagues at BIS to visit
Worcester. I confess that I do not think I have ever visited Worcester,
so I was unable to picture the areas he mentioned in his speech. Who

not visit the college—it is not in my portfolio—then
perhaps there will be a range of post offices undergoing

capital investment, as my hon. Friend knows and outlined, for decades,
colleges were starved of the funding for capital renewal that both
schools and universities enjoyed.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:19:35"></hs_TimeCode> was therefore
no surprise that when the Learning and Skills Council offered
significant capital grants, the colleges jumped at the opportunity.
Bids were encouraged, including bids to grow, with atriums, spas and
other such luxuries. Promises were made without the funding being
available to match them. Hugely expensive projects with poor cost
controls delivered poor value for money in some of the projects that
were completed, so the Learning and Skills Council ran out of money.
Suddenly building projects were stopped, sometimes after huge expense
on plans and with holes in the ground. It was not a happy time, as my
hon. Friend eloquently
explained—my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:15:09"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier) also managed to
contribute his experiences to the debate.</hs_Para>

is in that context, as well as the wider catastrophe of the public
finances that we were bequeathed, that we are now rebuilding. We have
been working hard to ensure that lessons are learned, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:15:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worcester urged. Inevitably, one of those lessons is
that we should have a firm focus on value for money, the physical
infrastructure needs of colleges and the benefits that capital
investment can bring to students, employers and the communities they
serve. The approach is also coupled with a focus on affordability. This
provides the background to how we have moved forward, set priorities
for capital investment and given hope and a better sense of certainty
to both general FE colleges and sixth-form colleges. I hope he will
agree that since 2010, this coalition Government have done everything
possible to rectify the disaster that the previous Labour Government
left us. Indeed, between May 2010 and November 2012, we made more than
£330 million available to the Skills Funding Agency for
investment in the general FE college estate, with more than £120
million made available through the Education Funding Agency for
investment in the sixth-form college estate, making a total of
£450 million over that period.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend raised capital funding issues in relation to two important
institutions in his constituency: Worcester technology
college—the general FE college serving his
constituency—which had issues around its recent unsuccessful bid
for capital funding; and Worcester sixth-form college, which had issues
relating primarily to the Department for Education’s building
condition improvement fund. If I may, I propose to respond on the
latter first, as I would like to cover the more substantive issues
raised in relation to the technology college in some detail.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012438001094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0004.htm#13012438001094"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:17:16"></hs_TimeCode>On
the capital funding available to Worcester sixth-form college, my hon.
Friend explained that his local college had made great progress
already, with improvements to the cladding and structure of the
building, and set out what else it was keen to do, with the science and
other facilities. He made a good case for a two-year allocation
approach, which would provide greater flexibility in build and delivery
options. As I have mentioned, capital funding for maintenance in
sixth-form colleges is provided annually by the Department for
Education through the Education Funding Agency. However, I understand
that the Department is currently undertaking a property data survey of
the school estate, which is due to be completed later this year. It
will inform wider thinking in that Department on the scope and options
for longer-term allocation periods from 2014-15 onwards, which I am
sure my hon. Friend will welcome.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:19:35"></hs_TimeCode> am also happy
to ensure that I draw the comments he has made about this issue on
behalf of his sixth-form college to the attention of my colleagues in
the Department for Education, as I am sure they will be interested to
hear what has been said, both by him and by the principal of Worcester
sixth-form college, who I think was Mr Kitcatt—maybe if he is
lucky, he will have a break in the next funding round.</hs_Para>

me return to Worcester technology college and the allocation of capital
funds by the Skills Funding Agency. It might be helpful if I explain
the broad approach we took to capital investment in general FE
colleges. Ministers set the priorities for capital investment. The
Skills Funding Agency then consulted the sector on the detailed
criteria for deciding allocations and took the sector’s advice
on timing and process issues, to minimise burdens while ensuring a
focus on value and impact. The agency then launched the various
schemes, publishing the agreed criteria for all to see. The agency then
offered advice to colleges, assessed bids and, with input from the
sector, undertook moderation to ensure fairness. At the end of the
process, the agency confirmed funding decisions to colleges.</hs_Para>

with all competitive bidding processes there are winners and losers. Of
course I recognise and understand the concerns—such as those
expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:19:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:19:49"></hs_TimeCode>
the principal of Worcester college of technology—about ensuring
that those colleges that most urgently need capital funding support can
get it. I also understand their concerns about the assessment process
carried out by the Skills Funding Agency before grants were awarded,
although I would say that the agency’s approach to capital
funding has, by and large, served the general FE college sector well.
As I have said, it was based, as such processes inevitably often are,
on competitive bidding between colleges against a set of published,
sector-endorsed criteria, with sector representatives involved in
moderating the assessment of bids in order to ensure fair
play<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:20:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=571?><hs_Para UID="13012438001097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0004.htm#13012438001097">I
understand my hon. Friend’s point about the seemingly bizarre
scenario in which points would be awarded for not yet having complied
with disability discrimination legislation. I would say, however, that
whether the situation involved access issues for students, health and
safety issues involving asbestos, or issues relating to the basic
structure of a building not being windproof or watertight, if there
were a needs-based element to the criteria, issues such as those would
be taken into account to some extent to ensure that the money was being
spent where it was most needed. I understand my hon. Friend’s
point, however; he certainly put it very
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:21:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0004.htm#13012438001098">I
am given to understand that Worcester technology college’s bid
in the last exercise, announced in the autumn, was assessed as
primarily falling short of the required standard in its description of
the benefits to students’ education and of the area’s
prospects for economic growth that would result from funding being
awarded. That was obviously a great disappointment to my hon. Friend
and to the college and its students, but I can only conclude that that
was a reasonable outcome on the basis of the funding criteria then in
place. I am sure, however, that my hon. Friend will want to ensure that
his college is well placed to make further bids that will have a more
positive outcome. He has certainly made a strong case for his college
today, and I am sure that he will continue to advocate powerfully for
it.</hs_Para>

such as that one, and those that other hon. Members have raised with
the Minister on previous occasions, serve to underline the fact that we
now need a change of approach in the capital funding of general FE
colleges, and such a change was set out in the FE college capital
investment strategy published on 6 December 2012. Our shared commitment
to working with the further education and skills sector to help it to
provide the best possible service to adults and young people is clear,
as, indeed, is the £550 million of funding for general FE
college capital projects that was announced in the skills investment
statement, which was also published on 6
December<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:22:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012438001100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/debtext/130124-0004.htm#13012438001100">Accordingly,
we want all general FE colleges to feel able to help to shape the
programmes and processes involved, so that we can most effectively
manage and  
<?notus-xml column=572?>allocate public funds to those capital projects that need them most. My
hon. Friend the Minister has already asked the Skills Funding Agency to
continue working closely with a sector-led capital reference group to
ensure that issues and concerns are known, shared and addressed. He is
also keen to ensure that colleges have access to help and advice in
developing their plans. I note my hon. Friend’s point about
feedback, and it is important that good feedback should be given when
bids are unsuccessful, to help plans for future bids to be
developed.</hs_Para>

14 December, the Skills Funding Agency wrote to all 60 colleges that
had been unsuccessful in securing funding last time around, to set out
the next steps and the options available to them. Today, I want to
encourage Worcester college, and all colleges with an interest, to
engage constructively with the agency and the capital reference group
as we develop and implement our new FE college capital funding
programme. It will be a more flexible programme that will include
project development support, published time scales and the opportunity
for colleges to resubmit applications that fall short of the standards

say to my hon. Friend, and to the college whose interests he has so
ably represented today, let us move forward rather than dwelling on the
past. I am sure that he is nodding in agreement with that. I understand
that, as a first step, Worcester technology college authorities are due
to meet representatives of the Skills Funding Agency tomorrow to
discuss the options available to them. I sincerely hope and expect that
that will be an important first step towards ensuring that the
college’s urgent capital funding needs are met before too much
longer, and that it succeeds in gaining its fair share of the

the Freedom of Information Act 2000 was the most important step forward

potential effect on local newspapers. My area has a unitary authority,

commercial companies who want to collect a lot of information and could
afford to do so if there were charges; or requests from less well
funded organisations, including small local newspapers, which are not
going through a very profitable period at the moment. Those requests
could be made in other ways. If a charging system were introduced,
requests from private individuals might well be handed over to media
organisations, in pursuit of a legitimate campaign, for example, to
find out what was going on in government.</hs_Para>

something about frivolous and vexatious requests. The folklore about
the Freedom of Information Act tends to imply that all public

requests appear frivolous, and vexatious requests can of course be
rejected, by following procedures that experienced public authorities
use. We were told stories about applications for information about
ghost sightings in the town hall and things of that kind, but it is not
too difficult for the public authority simply to reply that it has no

should be set in statute, which could be further extended in complex
cases. The Government disagreed with us, preferring to rely on the

not go along with the view of some people in the university world that
universities should be exempted from freedom of information

out public functions. All those that are not wholly private in their
funding are subject to freedom of information provisions. We think that
should remain the case, but we recognise that there is a problem with
the premature disclosure of continuing research projects. That has been
dealt with in Scotland by different legislation, and we believe that
there should be better protection, or pre-publication exemption, under
section 22 of the Act, for research carried out by higher education
institutions. There should be a dedicated exemption on the lines of the
Scottish provisions. We are pleased that the Government have accepted
the recommendation, and I should just like clarification of how that

said that I would mention a significant problem, and it becomes more
significant with each new announcement that the Government want to use
the private sector as a major provider of public services. The problem
is how freedom of information is applied to private organisations,
commercial companies or, indeed, voluntary sector bodies that carry out
public functions. There was some uncertainty about the interpretation
of section 3(2)(b) of the Act, which provides that information held by
a private company on behalf of a public authority with which it has a
contract is subject to the Act, but other information held by such a
company is not. It is quite reasonable that other information should
not be 
<?notus-xml column=156?>covered—the Freedom of Information Act does not apply to the
commercial activities in the private sector of a commercial
company—but there is a genuine and appropriate concern about
what happens when such a company does what would otherwise be done by a
public authority.</hs_Para>

favoured the use of contractual terms to deal with the issue, as
currently happens in many cases. The body that commissions the
services, whether a probation or health trust or a Department such as
the Ministry of Justice, should ensure that the contracts that it
writes will protect the access that it requires to all material
relevant to potential freedom of information requests, so that it can
respond to any freedom of information bid.</hs_Para>

gone further by suggesting that they will amend the section 45 code of
practice to encourage public authorities and contractors to provide
information on a voluntary basis, going beyond the minimum covered by a
request to an authority. It seems to us that that openness follows the
public money, in just the same way as the Public Accounts Committee
wants accountability for spending to follow the public pound, and that
the best way to achieve that is not to put a commercial organisation in
the rather confused position of being partially subject to FOI, but to
put it under contractual obligations that, if it carries out a service
on behalf of the taxpayer, it is obliged to the body that commissions
it to provide the
information<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:58:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000050">The
Committee will take further evidence in a couple of weeks from the
Information Commissioner on the work of his office. We may then follow
up some of the issues that I have outlined. We welcome his work and
have a good relationship with him. It has long been the
Committee’s view that the Information Commissioner should be an
Officer of Parliament, like the ombudsman, the health ombudsman or the
Comptroller and Auditor General. That is the situation in Scotland,
with the Scottish Information Commissioner. That would underline the
commissioner’s independence.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:58:53"></hs_TimeCode> was struck by
the fact that in yesterday’s debate about blacklisting, which
relates to another side of the commissioner’s
responsibilities—data protection—my right hon. Friend the
Business Secretary stressed the fact that the Information Commissioner
is an independent regulatory official, running an independent
regulatory body, and not a creature of the Government. That, indeed, is
how things work in practice. However, it would be much better to
underwrite that position, by making the commissioner fully a creature
of Parliament rather than, technically, as he is now, part of the
governmental
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000051">When
considering the overall impact of the Freedom of Information Act, we
need to bear in mind something that kept coming up in different ways
during the Committee’s proceedings. Since the Act was conceived
and then passed, a significant change has affected the whole freedom of
information issue: the explosion of internet use and the new
opportunities created by it. That has made access to published
information easier; it has allowed published data to be searched in
ways that were virtually impossible with manual searching; and it has
posed a challenge to the quality and effectiveness of some public
sector databases. Kent county council has explained to us that getting
its database to the point at  
<?notus-xml column=157?>which it could effectively be interrogated by the techniques that are
now available would be a major and costly  task. The internet
explosion has also created internet- based mechanisms for
making freedom of information applications, along with organisations
devoted to assisting people to make such applications. We must keep the
matter under constant
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000052">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>
Freedom of Information Act set out principles that we believe should
apply to Government for all time, but precisely how we apply them and
the context in which we do so are things that change, and the
Information Commissioner’s Office has a significant role in
assisting us with that. Because of its data protection
responsibilities, the office happens to have a great deal of knowledge
within it about mechanisms that are relevant to data protection and to
freedom of information and how information is
accessed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:01:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000053">More
generally, our view is that the Freedom of Information Act has
significantly enhanced our democracy. It is working well and achieving

Act was the product of many years of campaigning, discussion and
commitment from various political spheres. When the Act came into force
in 2005, it proved, I believe, to be a landmark piece of legislation. I
do not think that it would be hyperbole to say that the Act
revolutionised how the public were able to engage with public
authorities and with local and central government. It presented a
radical development in the extent to which the public were able to
engage, and I emphasise that because whether the Act has fulfilled that
purpose is a matter of some
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000056">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:03:29"></hs_TimeCode>
December 2011, the Justice Committee, of which I am a member, called

Freedom of Information Act. Those giving evidence were asked to
consider whether the Act worked effectively, what its strengths and
weaknesses were, and whether it was operating as intended. As our

we are to adjudicate on whether the legislation operates effectively,
it is necessary to set out the primary motivation for introducing it in

post-legislative scrutiny of the Act identifies four objectives:
increasing openness and transparency, improving accountability,
facilitating better decision making, and increasing public involvement
in the decision-making process. In its evidence to the inquiry, the
constitution unit based in University  
<?notus-xml column=158?>college London identified another objective—to promote better
understanding of the Government’s decision making. The Committee

the Act’s first objective, that of increasing openness and
transparency, before the Act’s provisions came  into
force in 2005, information on decision making in central and local
government and in other public- facing organisations was
obtainable only through official documents and leaked information that
had made its way into the press. By contrast, the new legislation
provided for a statutory right to gain access to information held by
public authorities, and placed a duty on the authorities to establish a
proactive publication scheme that was subject to the approval of the
Information Commissioner. It sought to make public authorities more
transparent in a reactive sense, in that anyone would have the right to
put questions to such an authority via an FOI request, and by
encouraging a more general cultural change through proactively

Freedom of Information regime must be viewed in the wider context of
information storage and retention. The internet is an exciting place in
many respects. It is a vital educational tool, but it is also fast
evolving. According to the National Archives, digital records
deteriorate faster than paper records. The preservation of records is
important for the accountability of officials, not just today, but for
posterity. Indeed, many people—I am

the whole, the evidence gleaned by the Committee was that the Act is
operating fairly well. The costs associated with its administration are
greatly outweighed, although not always, by the transparency and better
accountability of those who make decisions that affect the
public’s daily life. Freedom of information requests may lead
indirectly to a reduction of costs because public authorities are now
fully aware of the risk of exposure if they misuse funds. Although the
Act has succeeded in its primary aim of increasing transparency and
accountability, it is less clear whether it has facilitated decision
making, and it has not gone far down the road of creating greater
confidence in those of us who serve in public office.</hs_Para>

of the media’s tendency to sensationalise bad news, it was
perhaps unrealistic ever to expect that the Act would contribute to

the tools to engage with decision making as a result of the Act, but
those who choose to participate are usually those who have a
professional stake in the outcome. The FOI regime offered enhanced
democracy, but in the years since it was drafted, the parameters of

something that has come to me through a constituent, a respected Mr

organisations are obviously affected as well. A bit of a stir has been
made by universities, because of the anxiety that some are publicly
funded and the information is held in a particular way. Outside
organisations can even apply for their own materials of the university,

therefore subject to freedom of information. However, I seek to discuss

prices and payments, numbers of patients treated, time taken to treat
them, performance quality reports against a range of specific
indicators, figures on MRSA and clostridium difficile infections, and
reports on complaints, equality monitoring and certain other matters.
There are also obligations to comply with NHS dataset requirements. In
addition, the commissioning body may request any other information that
it reasonably requires to monitor the provider’s performance in
relation to the agreement. However, if the commissioning body does not
consider that it requires particular information to monitor the
provider’s performance, the information will not be available

us suppose there are suspicions about the use of outdated, or
potentially substandard, or even contaminated supplies by hospitals.
For an NHS hospital, the Act could be used to obtain details of stocks
of the product, analysis results, correspondence with suppliers,
minutes of meetings at which the problem was discussed, concerns about
the issues raised by staff and details of how they
were handled, as well as information showing what measures were
considered, why particular options were rejected and what was
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000105">Such
information would not be available in relation to independent providers
treating national health service patients. A commissioning body may
take the view that it does not require that information to monitor the
provider’s performance under the contract because it does not
believe that there is a real problem, because  it does not
believe that the information sought by the requester would throw light
on it, or because it is already feels satisfied, from its knowledge of
the provider, that any problem would be properly handled. In that case,
it seems unlikely that there would be any contractual obligation on the
commissioning body to seek the information or on the provider to
produce it. In cases of doubt, we think contractors would be likely to
vigorously oppose any attempt to interpret a contractual provision of
that kind

further problem is that key aspects of the Act cannot apply to
contractors. The Information Commissioner’s powers relate only
to public authorities. He cannot investigate a contractor’s
claim that it does not hold or cannot find the information needed to
answer an FOI request. His power to serve information notices,
requiring public authorities to supply him with information required
for an investigation, does not extend to contractors.  He
cannot serve a decision or enforcement notice on  a contractor,
or take action against a contractor that appears to be failing to
comply with its contractual obligations to assist with FOI
requests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:48:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

that applies to a public authority that deliberately destroys, alters
or conceals a requested record to prevent its disclosure does not apply
to a contractor that does so to prevent the authority disclosing it in
response to an FOI request. Once a contract has expired, any
contractual disclosure requirement may lapse, so removing the right to
information about past events. Even if the contract stipulates that
disclosure requirement survives, it could only be enforced by a civil
action for breach of contract against the contractor. The prospect of
such action being taken for failing to assist in replying to an FOI
request is highly
implausible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000108">The
FOI Act envisages that the contractors who provide a service on behalf
of a public authority, which it is the authority’s function to
provide, can be designated as a public authority subject to the Act in
its own right. The use of that provision to make contractors directly
subject to FOI should now be considered. Failing that, the Act should
be reassessed in light of contracting out and amended to ensure that
the public’s rights to information about public authority
services and functions are fully preserved when they are provided by
contractors. There is real value in that, and from the
Government’s point of view, too. Confidence in the Health and
Social Care Act, for instance, and the commissioning process would be
reinforced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000109">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:49:31"></hs_TimeCode>
is a grave suspicion—this is what lies behind the idea about
privatisation of services in the national health service—that
there will be the opportunity for outside contractors and so on to pick
and choose and that they will not be liable to provide to the public
the basis on which they can judge whether a contract is appropriate.
That is the whole purpose of freedom of information—that we can
acquire the information that can give us the ability to make a judgment
on the probity and priorities that operate within those who are
essentially, if not totally in many instances, funded from the public
purse. There is a direct link. They would not be in business without
public moneys and contracts coming their way. That is why there is an
urgency about making this point and examining this question. I commend
it to the Justice Committee. Thank you, Mr Hollobone, for your

Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), about the
quantity of Members in this debate have been laid to rest by the
quality of the contributions. We have had three outstanding
contributions by Members who are quite expert on this subject. There

the Labour Government did. Of course, if we were here to discuss all
the good things that the Labour Government did, we would use up the

the stance that the Select Committee has taken in its report but also

with on the policy issues dealt with in the report, although perhaps
there is a slight degree of complacency in relation to some of the

publication of data is not only a good thing in itself, but can assist
the process of freedom of information. Clearly, if more information is
put into the public realm and if public authorities get into the habit
of being transparent about the way they conduct themselves, that is not
only complementary; it actively assists and removes some of the
bureaucracy from freedom of information. However, the two things should

policing functions while also being a representative body for chief

freedom of information was a big concern of theirs—that is, not

research, with which I do have some sympathy, but the idea was that
universities should not be subject to it because, they were saying, it
costs them money and they are relatively small organisations in the
great scheme of things. I am not sure that is true, for a start, but
the number of requests that an organisation receives probably bears
some relation to its size and therefore to its means. I suspect that

I am a prolific but I hope responsible user of the Act, so I can say

comprehensive information timeously and obey not only the letter but
the spirit of the Act. Many do
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000133">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:02:53"></hs_TimeCode>
shall give one example. It is not an extreme example at all; it is very
typical. On 26 October last year, I made a request to my local
authority. I was aware that it had delegated to itself, from committee
to officers, the ability to sell off property as it became vacant, but
it was not reporting it anywhere. Simple questions: how many properties
have you sold in the past four years and what is the value of those
properties? Every two or three weeks after the 20-day deadline passed,
we chased them. Nothing was done. There was no attempt to comply with
the Act—“You’ll get it next week.”
“We’re very sorry. Don’t you have that
yet?” Those were the kinds of faux-amateur ways in which it
responded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000134">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:04:37"></hs_TimeCode>
am sure that I would not have the answers now had I not written to the
chief executive earlier this week and said that I was going to raise
the matter in this debate. The very straightforward answers arrived
yesterday. They reveal that over that period, more than 200 properties 
<?notus-xml column=169?>were sold, at a value of more than £88 million, which, in the
past two years, represented more than 10% of the total stock that had
become vacant. Those facts and figures are important, not only because
of the amount of public money involved, but due to the policy and human
implications of disposing of good quality property that could be
re-let, when 11,000 people are on the waiting list and many of my
constituents are being moved out of London because it is said that
there is no affordable accommodation. Those data should and could be
available, not in 20 days, but in 20
hours.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000135">That
is a mild example. In other cases, I have waited over two years for
responses. If a public authority does not wish to respond, it can find
myriad ways not to do so. To give another example, we have a
proportionately large number of free schools and academies in my
constituency and I wanted to see the financial base on which they were
funded, the capital grants, the costs they were paying for land and
matters of that kind. Two years on, I still do not have that
information. The excuses I have been given vary from
commercial confidentiality to the notion that it would be embarrassing
for those organisations, lest they are not successful, to reveal what
their basis for bidding is at the time. They have even been based on
tiny semantic points.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:06:01"></hs_TimeCode> was not one
of mine, but another request asked what a particular piece of land was
sold for, and at the end of the process the response came back after
months of delay, “Although contracts have been exchanged, there
has not been completion, and therefore it cannot be right to say that
this property has been sold.” I thought that was slightly
disingenuous given that the people who bought it were building on the
land at the
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000136">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:04:20"></hs_TimeCode>
will not take up the House’s time with my private grievances,
but I use those examples to show that if a public authority does not
wish to follow the Act, it can find myriad ways not to do so, which can
range from using unqualified staff and devoting insufficient resources
to deliberate obfuscation and devious avoidance. The problem is, as the

for further delay. I have taken cases to the Information Commissioner
where that process has had to be gone through, and unfortunately, it
can take one or two years—longer in some cases—by which
time, saving the most important cases of national interest, the issue
will almost certainly be dead. That, of course, is the objective of the
defaulting party. I hope that there is more scrutiny, by Government and
the Ministry as well as the Select Committee, of the simple procedural
operation of the Act and whether its spirit and letter are in turn

Committee has seen through those objections and does not recommend
change. I hope the Government will follow that view. There is a risk,

hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd acknowledged, that people will try
to subvert or get round the Act in many ways, and we have heard
examples of using private devices or e-mails to keep things out of the
public realm. The last thing that we want to do in response to
that—we should acknowledge the problem and try to work out ways
of challenging it—is to say, “Well, in that case, we
should allow more secrecy, because that is the only way to get that
balance right.” Those debates will continue, because the agenda
is both moving and changing.</hs_Para>

are other issues, which I had hoped could have been put to rest, that
the Government in their response have kept going and even revived. The
first is the issue of fees. I appreciate that the Government have
resisted that, which is right, and requests to cover their costs. None
the less, they have introduced the possibility of fees at tribunal,
which may be a slippery slope. Certainly, if a complaint has reached
such a level, which is quite a challenge for any applicant to achieve,
the issue of fees should be resisted.</hs_Para>

Newspaper Society, in its briefing for today’s debate, as well
as the Campaign for Freedom of Information and a number of national
newspapers, have tried to draw attention to the worrying fact that ways
are being found to limit access by way of cost. Generally speaking,
those are occult ways of doing it; it is not a head-on attempt to
restrict. When I say occult, I am not referring to the ghosts and
zombies in the Cabinet Office or in Leeds city hall. I am talking about
ways that are, ironically, not open.</hs_Para>

number of questions for the Minister to answer.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:11:21"></hs_TimeCode> the
Government are thinking of reducing the number of hours beyond the
marginal levels that the Select Committee proposes, what are those
proposals and how can they be justified? Are they thinking of
introducing the aggregate claim, whereby an individual or an
organisation will only be able to put in a certain number of claims
before hitting the cash limit? Moreover, in totting up the number of
hours on any individual request, will the Government include thinking
time? If they do, what is the rationale for that and where is the
impact assessment that will show the effect that that will have?
Maurice Frankel quotes an estimate that says that just the thinking
time clause alone will affect 4% of requests to central Government and
10% of requests to other public bodies. Those are significant figures,
but, as Maurice Frankel points out, that is based on the actual time
spent and not on the estimated time, which of course could be a lot
greater. Any one of those measures, let alone the aggregate of them,
would have a 
<?notus-xml column=171?>significant effect on the number of requests that
are refused on the grounds of cost, which is a route that we do not
want to go down.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012448000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000144">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:13:32"></hs_TimeCode>
is a general acceptance, I think, that there has to be a limit on
costs. No one in this debate has said that the overall cost of the Act
is prohibitive and I do not think that the Government have said that
either. None the less, cost is a convenient way to turn down requests
without having to justify things more thoroughly. As I have said, I
have had every possible reason thrown at me. One very common one is
commercial confidentiality, which is often presented in a nonsensical
way. Let me give an example. There was a significant and controversial
land sale in my constituency between two public sector
bodies—part of the BBC estate was being sold to Imperial
college. The whole matter was resolved; there were no outstanding
issues and no ongoing negotiations. Yet both parties resisted requests
on the basis of commercial confidentiality. We need to be more
sceptical about some of the excuses that are used.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:14:16"></hs_TimeCode>I hope the
Government will not be seduced by those arguments, and that we can have

that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:14:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000145">There
is an argument when it comes to research. I do not accept the argument
for exemption of universities, but, given what is happening in
Scotland, it may well be that the Government are right on this. We want
to protect genuine research, but we do not want to allow that to become
a catch-all for refusal. We should consider exemptions very carefully.

conditional fee agreements, a review of judicial review, and charges
increasingly being introduced for courts and tribunal services. That is
a poor record, and a signature of this Government of which they should
be ashamed. Let us not add freedom of information to that catalogue. So
much has been achieved over the past 15 years with a reasonable degree
of consensus. We want to allow the citizen far, far greater access to
information, and to change what has been very secretive government in
this country, under all parties, into something that is genuinely open.
That will be as beneficial to the Government as it will to the citizen,

its use was justified in other contexts on more than one occasion last

have said, the Government did indeed carry it out for the Act. That is
necessary to establish whether the laws that we pass do the job for
which we pass them. For years, Parliament hardly ever carried out such
scrutiny, but now we do it systematically. It is a good thing, as
today’s debate shows, even if the proceedings were distinguished
more for their quality than their quantity, as

hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Sir Richard Shepherd) has been a
doughty fighter for freedom in general and freedom of information in
particular, and he raised some interesting points about how the
provisions for private contractors can be made to work. All the
examples he gave should be covered by freedom of information. The only
question is whether the contracting method will work as a way of
dealing with them. I am sure that he, as an experienced business man,
will recognise certain difficulties: it would seem inappropriate for
example, for freedom of information to apply to a company’s
deliberations about whether to bid for a contract. That is the company
deciding in which direction to take its private sector work. However,
once it is engaged on the 
<?notus-xml column=177?>contract, its quality of service, the disciplinary measures that it uses
to maintain that quality, and all such things are freedom of
information matters. We should ensure that the contracting arrangement
can cover them. If it cannot, we shall have to think again about our
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:39:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012448000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000184"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Richard Shepherd" PimsId="670" UID="13012448000260" xid="533" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/halltext/130124h0001.htm#13012448000260">Sir

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:39:08"></hs_TimeCode>For instance,
when private contractors bid they would also like to know what their
rivals are bidding, and the secrecy behind that process conceals true
costs and is not an impetus to competition. That point was made by
Tarmac in the original discussions
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:39:39"></hs_TimeCode> Rhodri
Morgan had long ago in the Justice Committee’s predecessor
Committee. Tarmac’s directors were advocating that they wanted
their contract details and their costs—in other words, their
bidding prices—to be available, because they believed that their
competitors were putting in false under-bids that they could not
sustain and that would fall on the public purse. That, of course, was
their argument, but there are good reasons why that information should
be made public.</hs_Para>

in areas such as contracting for rail franchises. However, it is a
difficult balance to strike: having a healthy private sector, which can
also usefully take up Government contracts, and also having a
Government mechanism that properly supervises those contracts and
ensures that freedom of information requirements are met. We have
suggested one approach to strike that balance. We hope that it can be
made to work. However, if it does not, then—as the Minister
herself conceded—we will have to think again about how we
satisfy that fundamental requirement in relation to public
services.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter), the Labour Front-Bench
spokesman, covered some very important points. In particular, he
focused on some of the things that the Government have not yet decided.
Clearly, as the Minister said, there is a lot of work still to be done.
There still seems to be some uncertainty about how committed the
Government are to measures that we have indicated may be difficult, but
which the Government are interested in in an attempt to deal with what
they see as the costs of freedom of information. We will be watching
rather carefully this process of discussion that is going on from here,
and I hope that the Minister will take very carefully into account all
the points that have been made in this debate. On things that have a
certain amount of urgency about them—I mention in particular the
separate provision to protect university research—I hope that we
will not find it necessary to wait for some general further measure in
relation to freedom of information if other ways can be found of
bringing things forward

and responsive planning system is vital for delivering sustainable
development. We want to promote the use of brownfield land to assist
regeneration, and get empty and under-used buildings back into

help us promote economic growth and still ensure that we safeguard

April 2011, we ran a consultation “Relaxation of planning rules
for change of use from commercial to residential” which sought
views on introducing permitted development rights for change of use
from commercial to residential uses. Following that consultation we
included a policy statement within the national planning policy

this policy change, in the written ministerial statement of 6 September
2012, <I>Official Report</I>, column 34WS, I announced the introduction
of permitted development rights to enable change of use from commercial
to residential purposes. These new permitted development rights build
on the policy set out in the national planning policy framework and
will encourage developers to bring underused offices back into

residents.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012435000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/wmstext/130124m0001.htm#13012435000059">The
new permitted development rights allow change of use from B1 (a)
offices to C3 residential. They will provide badly needed homes for
local people and  will make a valuable contribution to easing
our national housing shortage. By bringing underused offices back into
effective use they will also help create jobs in
the 
<?notus-xml column=17?>construction and services industries, and help regenerate our town
centres and former commercial areas. These new homes will bring a
greater resident population to our high streets, increasing footfall
and supporting local
shops.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012435000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/wmstext/130124m0001.htm#13012435000060">In

Action on Adoption” describes the national crisis in adopter
recruitment and puts forward the Government’s proposals for
addressing it in the short and long term. Copies of this document have
been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The number of children
approved by the courts for adoption has been rising steeply, with no
comparable increase in the number 
<?notus-xml column=21?>of adopters approved. We have identified some significant structural
weaknesses which undermine the effectiveness of the adopter recruitment
and approval system. These weaknesses must be addressed swiftly and
decisively in the interests of a significant and sustainable
increase  in the number of adopters. We are therefore proposing
to take a new legislative power at the earliest opportunity. This would
allow the Secretary of State to require  local authorities to
seek approved adopters from other
organisations.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012435000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/wmstext/130124m0001.htm#13012435000134">If
necessary, we will use that power to reform the adopter recruitment
system. However, we recognise that this is a radical step. If local
authorities are able to bring forward alternative proposals that would
deliver a similarly radical shift in the system’s capacity, then
we will not need to use this
power.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012435000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/wmstext/130124m0001.htm#13012435000135">We
want to see the system reformed for the long term, but we need
short-term action too for children in the system now. So today I am
announcing that the £150 million early intervention grant
top-slice, which the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government confirmed in announcing the local government settlement for
2013-14, will be returned in full to local authorities in the form of
the adoption reform grant. This funding will help to secure reform of
the adoption system. The adoption reform grant will be in two parts:
£100 million of the £150 million will not be ring-fenced
and will be available to local authorities to support adoption reform.
It will enable local authorities to target funding at the entire
adoption process and the specialist support children need. They will
retain the discretion to use this funding to address their highest
priority needs, such as the major backlog of children waiting for
adoption.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012435000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/wmstext/130124m0001.htm#13012435000136">The
remaining £50 million will be ring-fenced. It will support local
authorities to address structural problems with adopter recruitment,
particularly the uneconomic fee that local authorities are charged for
adopters approved by other authorities which is lower than that charged
by voluntary adoption agencies. It will also help in the search for
adopters willing and able to take children who are more difficult to
place, and so tend to wait longer for new
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012435000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/wmstext/130124m0001.htm#13012435000137">I

analysis of the benefits of trade liberalisation between the EU and the
USA; however, analysis of this particular aspect of trade
liberalisation is limited. Studies suggest that liberalisation of
non-tariff measures combined with regulatory convergence should provide
significant benefits. For example, analysis by the research and
consultancy company Ecorys of a 50% elimination of non-tariff measures
and regulatory convergence showed potential benefits of 0.7% of GDP for
the EU and 0.3% of GDP for the US. The impacts on the UK economy would

estimates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012463000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/text/130124w0001.htm#13012463000209">Further

an oil and gas industry strategy in late March. The relationship with
Norway is an important one in the North Sea and the strategy will be
informed by work which Norway undertakes to support its supply chain. A
May 2012 Harvard Business School report entitled Norway: Oil and Gas
Cluster stated that the Norwegian oil and gas supply chain employed
114,000 people. Although the Norwegian Government owns 67% of Statoil,
which is the dominant player in the Norwegian sector accounting for 70%
of production, protectionist measures were phased out in 1994 when
Norway entered into a free trade agreement with the EU.</hs_Para>

were unemployed or inactive, resident in Woking parliamentary
constituency and the UK. These estimates are compiled from APS
interviews held during the period October 2011 to September 2012, the
latest period available, and the 12 month periods ending in
December from 2008 to 2011. It should also be noted that the estimates
also include people who were employed but have not provided enough
information to be accurately included in either the public or private
sectors.</hs_brev>

who raise funding to bring alternative source of energy to their
community. Bath West Community Energy has raised £722,000
through a community share offer. This in turn has helped them secure
£1 million loan finance to fund 12 of their projects. This
enabled the installation of solar, photovoltaic, hydro and wind

Government's policy is to maximise the amount that the national lottery
raises for good causes. The percentage of sales income that each
national lottery game returns to good causes have never been set by
Government in legislation, but has historically been at around 28%
averaged across all national lottery products. The precise percentage
breakdown of how much is returned to good causes varies depending on
the game, the channel it is being sold through, the
level  
<?notus-xml column=384?>of sales and the period of the licence that has been reached. For some
games, increasing the amount available for prizes helps to maximise
sales and increase the actual amount of money available to good causes,

recognised term in the Ministry of Defence. Any discharge upon medical
grounds is exactly that. However, on entering military service, where
stringent medical observations are made during training, it is

may not be known to the individual. These conditions may be treatable
but some may be
chronic.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012463000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/text/130124w0001.htm#13012463000399">In

cases referred for discharge are taken upon their merits. There may be
periods of back-classing, rehabilitation and leave to enable treatment
or recovery from such a condition. However, for example, in the naval
service there is an absolute upper limit of 12 months from recruitment
as a window where this method of termination of employment on health
grounds can be used.</hs_Para>

officer (for example non-return of the annual canvass form); this

in which children and young people who have special educational needs
(SEN) or who are disabled are identified, assessed, and supported. Our
proposed legislative reforms will improve the system for 0 to
25-year-olds by giving parents and young people more control and
focusing on the outcomes that they want. Local authorities will provide
clear information about local services for all children and young
people with additional needs. Education, health and care services will
jointly commission services to meet the needs of children and young
people. We will introduce a new integrated assessment and plan, the
Educational Health and Care Plan, which will replace Learning
Difficulty Assessments and Statements of SEN—retaining all the
protections provided by Statements—but will better reflect the
child's or young person's plans for the future as well as their current
needs and there will be a stronger focus on preparing for
adulthood.</hs_Para>

endangered species. Rather, we are keen to ensure that where trade in
endangered species is carried out, it is done so sustainably. We do
this through membership of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES). Under CITES, the UK works with 176 other
countries to monitor and restrict international trade in endangered
species to ensure their long-term survival. Where trade in a particular
species is unsustainable, or there is evidence that endangered species
are being taken from the wild illegally, we shall not hesitate to
support appropriate international action. An example of this is the
current ban on trade in
ivory.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13012463000099" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/text/130124w0002.htm#13012463000099">Neonicotinoids</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13012463000766" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/text/130124w0002.htm#13012463000766"><B><Member PimsId="546" UID="13012463002086" xid="523" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/text/130124w0002.htm#13012463002086">Mr

Heath:</Member></B> Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is not a notifiable
disease and, as such, reporting of cases is voluntary. During the UK's
2012 lambing season the impact on infected farms of proportion of lambs
affected was approximately 2% to 5%. A European Food Safety Authority
report based on information from all affected member states and
published in November 2012 indicates the maximum proportion of SBV
confirmed sheep flocks per region is 6.6%. Economic assessments for
infection in UK flocks in 2011, in counties from the midlands south,
estimate that losses at twice this level would cost the industry
approximately £1 million per annum. This is less than the
economic impact of other common industry diseases such as foot
rot.</hs_Para>

season of lambing has just started and may continue until early May
depending on flock type so there are many ewes still to produce lambs.
There are anecdotal reports of up to 40% of lambs affected in around 30
flocks. This has mostly been in the western fringes of where it is
known that SBV infection occurred in 2011; these are areas at greatest
risk of infection from early spread in 2012. Many early lambing flocks
have synchronised mating periods, which means that the ewes are all
within a few days of the same stage of pregnancy and so a large
proportion of the flock is vulnerable if SBV arrives on farm at the
critical time in pregnancy when infection results in malformed
offspring. AHVLA is supporting the National Sheep Association in
collecting data on the effect of SBV in this lambing period.</hs_Para>

Heath:</Member></B> Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a new virus first
found in Germany and the Netherlands in late 2011 and in the UK in
January 2012. It is not notifiable in Europe and so reporting by
farmers and vets is voluntary. Surveillance testing and reporting
across the EU has found that SBV has spread rapidly and is now present
in many member states. Our own surveillance reporting over the summer
and autumn 2012 has found SBV in all rural counties in
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012463000801" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/text/130124w0002.htm#13012463000801">SBV
is a vector borne disease and has been found in midges. Effective midge
control is very difficult, and livestock movement controls would
provide ineffective control of disease spread. A number of companies
are currently developing a vaccine against SBV which would require
authorisation by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) if efficacy
and safety can be proven prior to it being available on the market. It
will be a decision for farmers to make, supported by their vet and
considering their management practices if use of a vaccine will benefit
their livestock. Immunity, natural or vaccination, will protect against
infection the following
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012463000802" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130124/text/130124w0002.htm#13012463000802">DEFRA

seekers who are recognised as refugees usually receive section 95
support for short periods of time because they are able to access the
full UK benefits system after they receive the positive decision.
Failed asylum seekers continue to be supported if they have children.
This means that they stay on support for longer periods if their
departure from the United Kingdom has to be enforced.</hs_Para>

on the total number of individuals who self-harmed in English and Welsh

self-harming in 2011. The sum of individuals in the table will add up
to more than these numbers as some individuals may be counted in more

information on additional support provided to prisoners at risk of
self-harm is not held centrally. The ACCT care planning process will
identify any specific support needs of individual prisoners. For (4)
The National Offender Management Service has in place a
prisoner-focused care planning system for those identified as at risk
of self-harm or suicide. The system, Assessment, Care in Custody and
Teamwork (ACCT), has helped prisons to manage prisoners' risk of
self-harm and suicide since 2007. The vast majority of self-harm is not
directly life threatening but nevertheless can be extremely distressing
both for those affected by it and those who have to deal with it. There

House of Lords administration and the expenses and allowances payable
to Members of the House of Lords. The Comptroller and Auditor General
reports the results of his audit to both Houses of Parliament. I
