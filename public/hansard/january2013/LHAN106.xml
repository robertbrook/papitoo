Montgomery of Alamein:</Member></B> My Lords, the Bill, which has come
from the House of Commons and was ably piloted through there by the
honourable Member for Stroud, Neil Carmichael, now comes to us for
further consideration and, I hope, for its passing into law. My
interest in the Bill has been compiled entirely from
information received from the Polar Regions Department, a very
impressive department within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It
represents us at the consultative meetings of the Antarctic Treaty
system, which take place regularly and regulate, as far as is possible,
all activities in that great continent. It is the largest continent in
the world and contains no less than 70% of all the fresh water
available in it, so it is very important that we take everything
connected with the Antarctic very seriously.</hs_para>

enhance the protection of the Antarctic environment. This is partly on
account of the fact that Antarctic touring during the summer season,
which is now—in January and February—has increased
considerably, what with yachts, ships, cruise ships and other things
all visiting in the very limited period when there are 24 hours of
daylight, as opposed to the June/July period when there are 24 hours of
darkness.</hs_para>

1 of the Bill, headed “Environmental
Emergencies”, would implement Annex VI to the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty into UK legislation,
which is headed, “Liability Arising from Environmental

obliges the consultative parties to require that Antarctic operators,

measures and to establish contingency plans in order to reduce
environmental emergencies in Antarctica; secondly,</hs_para>

guarantees to reimburse another party or pay into a special fund the
costs of response action to an environmental emergency arising from
their activities, which the operators did not, or could not, undertake

arrangement and I have to make apologies for the fact that it seems
intensely boring to some of your Lordships. It is in fact of
considerable importance to the whole process.</hs_parafo>

set out the framework by which those who fail to make effective
responses to an environmental emergency in Antarctica would be liable
to reimburse the costs to those who take such action. Under the
liability annexe, only a state may bring civil proceedings against an
operator to recover the costs of response action undertaken. Following
the successful passage of this Bill the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
will establish an expert advisory group, consisting of UK Antarctic
operators and others with appropriate expertise, to advise on what
would have constituted “reasonable response action” in
order to determine the level of payment which British operators should
reasonably be expected to pay.</hs_para>

to enable all financial liability matters to be resolved without the
need for court proceedings. However, the Bill would provide the
framework for such matters to be settled through the courts as a last

reduced if the operator is also liable for the same costs under Part IX
of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, which relates to salvage and
wrecks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000007">The

to demonstrate that they have taken measures to mitigate the
environmental risk arising from an emergency. This requirement for
contingency plans would cover both the handling of the response to an
environmental emergency as well as the response to an incident that is
not an environmental emergency but which may have a potential adverse
effect on the Antarctic environment. These plans may include what
action should be undertaken in response to potential emergencies or
incidents, but it is not necessarily expected that every potential
incident would be foreseen at the pre-planning stage.</hs_para>

is proposed that it would be a criminal offence to fail to notify the
Secretary of State of an environmental emergency in Antarctica that an
organiser of activities becomes aware of as a result of them, their
employees or their agents carrying out activities there. Organisers of
activities will be required to ensure that mechanisms are in place to
require their employees who become aware of an environmental emergency
to ensure that the Secretary of State is notified as soon as
practicable. The intention behind this requirement is to report all
environmental emergencies that the activity organiser becomes aware of
and not just those arising as a result of activities they have
organised. This would ensure that the UK Government are in a position
as soon as is practicable to notify the other operators in
the region, determine the likely cause of the environmental emergency,
and consider what response action should 
<?notus-xml column=1765?>be taken, in consultation with other treaty parties. This
could result in some duplication of reporting but
that would be better than no notification. The Government would use the
criminal sanctions for failure to make such a notification only in
extreme cases, and particularly where there was a specific intent not
to make such a
notification.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="13020135000480" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000480">Lord

Antarctic Survey, which provides a British permanent presence in the
British Antarctic Territory, and other parts of the public sector who
enter Antarctica on official business, as part of the Crown. It will
also have the benefit of exempting those organisations from requiring
insurance, as the UK Government provide self-insurance for their

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:16:45"></hs_TimeCode> Bill defines
an environmental emergency as an accidental event that results in, or
imminently threatens to result in, any significant harmful impact on
the environment of Antarctica. This definition is derived directly from
Article 2 of the liability annexe to which I have already referred. The
definition of response action sets out the action that
operators would be expected to undertake following an
environmental emergency arising from activities. The Bill includes a
definition of what constitutes reasonable response action. This is also
derived from the Article 2 of the liability annexe. Operators will need
to ensure that any response action they take meets these
criteria.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000015">The
proposed amendment to the Act would enable the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office to issue permits to non-UK nationals wishing to undertake such
activities, for the purpose of education or scientific research, while
they are participating in a British expedition. Under the Antarctic Act
1994, it is an offence to damage, destroy or remove any part
of a site or monument designated as a historic site or monument.
However,  in recent years, as a result of the warming climate
in Antarctica and increasing access to such sites, it has become
necessary to undertake considerable conservation work on historic sites
and monuments in Antarctica. The provision to amend Section 10 of the
Antarctic Act 1994 would enable a permit to be given for such
conservation work including, where necessary, the removal of historic
artefacts for their conservation or repair, consistent with
environmental protocol obligations.</hs_para>

Earl of Selborne:</Member></B><B> </B>On 25 May 1994, the noble
Viscount, Lord Montgomery, moved in this House the Second Reading of
the Antarctic Bill, which ensured that we updated our obligations under
the Antarctic Treaty, which we had been the first to ratify in 1961.
After 19 years, he has returned. Once more, we have an obligation to
update the treaty. We are enormously indebted to the noble Viscount for
once more bringing it to our attention and enabling us to enact this
legislation. He explained why it is necessary. After 19 years, with the
recognition of just how sensitive the Antarctic is to climate change,
environmental impacts from the increase in tourism and the vast
increase in interest in the research that is being undertaken in the
Antarctic, it is perhaps not surprising that the parties concerned have
determined that in a number of respects the requirements of the
Antarctic Treaty need updating.</hs_para>

explained, the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
Treaty already has five annexes in force, and Part 1 of the Bill, with
the liability annexe, introduces a sixth. I assure the noble Viscount

agree with him on that—it would not be boring if an
environmental emergency happened; it would be a total disaster that
would have untoward consequences without a doubt.</hs_para>

most relevant of all, attending these annual Antarctic Treaty
consultative meetings is the International Association of Antarctica
Tour Operators. If you really want an example of how international
treaties work at their best, the Antarctic Treaty could be set up as an
exemplar. All the parties, whether involved in scientific research,
tourism or competing territorial claims, have agreed that territorial
claims should be subsumed into this treaty. No other part of the world

collaboration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000020">I

Rothera on the Antarctic peninsula two years ago. At exactly the same

Bishop’s Bar on that occasion. Nevertheless, I look forward
enormously to hearing my noble friend’s first-hand experiences
of the impact of being in such an astonishing part of the world. All
visitors cannot help but be impressed by how all the research bases
work together. There are some 80 bases belonging to 28 countries around
the Antarctic, and they have to work together not just in times of
crisis but in helping each other with fuel caches and in sharing
research results. It is a wonderful example of international
collaboration, particularly as the relevance of the Antarctic to so
many studies of climate change,

particularly relevant here to look at the marine environment. There is
an enormous number of quite astonishing organisms in the Southern Ocean

question that my noble friend Lord Forsyth posed to the

impact to create a major emergency in the marine environment. It would
not need a large Argentinean tourist liner; quite a minor spill could
have impacts. We should remember how long some of these organisms take
to grow; hundreds of years is not unusual. You do not have to visit
Rothera, which is in the Antarctic peninsula at sea level, where they

simply that the Government having produced an excellent draft Bill,

longer than I would have hoped for  it to come before

Bill tightens the protection of the Antarctic environment by enabling
us to bring into force the mechanisms in the liability annex to the
protocol, “Liability Arising from Environmental
Emergencies”. 
<?notus-xml column=1770?>The simple description of this process is that the polluter pays, as the
noble Lord, Lord Giddens, explained. Every person, public or private,
who organises an activity in Antarctica must take reasonable, prompt
and effective action to deal with an environmental emergency, defined
as an event which threatens or results in significant harm to the
environment. Operators are required to insure against liabilities that
may arise under this provision. The explanation by the Minister in
another place of how the limits on liability in the schedule complement
those in the 1996 protocol to the limitation of liability for maritime
claims generally under the 1996 protocol was not entirely clear, and I
look forward to discussing that with my noble friend the Minister,
although I have no intention of delaying the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000037">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>
most likely type of major environmental disaster to happen is the loss

“Nordkapp” ran aground near Deception Island and spilled
757 litres of diesel oil, for instance, while the
“Explorer”, with 150 passengers on board, sank near the
South Shetland Islands in November 2007. Recently, much larger cruise
ships have sailed into these waters, and, considering that the
UK-occupied sections of the territory are the most popular
destinations, I wonder whether the Government would consider imposing a
charge for permits based on the number of passengers carried. Looking
at the fees charged by the tour operators, £500 per passenger
would not be an unreasonable levy, enabling us to accumulate a fund to
cover some or all of the clean-up costs that were not within the
maximum liability. I dare say the Minister will point out that if other
parties to the liability annex did not impose similar levies, the
operators would seek permits from state parties where the cost was
lowest. Have the Government broached this subject with the other
parties and would they take a lead on the matter, bearing in mind their

larger the volume of tourism to Antarctica, the greater the danger to

dependencies, which are the most popular destinations such as Deception

suggesting would help to slow down the growth of the traffic, as well
as providing a shield against recovery costs that exceed the limits in
the
schedule.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000039">Tourism
is not the only threat to Antarctica’s environment. Large-scale
fishing operations have developed in recent years, and my noble friend
will be able to confirm that they are not covered by the Bill. The
activities carried out in Antarctica which are dealt with in Part 1 are
defined in Clause 13(9) as those carried out on a British expedition,
defined in turn in Section 3(3) of the Antarctic Act 1994 as an
expedition organised or starting from the UK. That would seem to
include the tourist ships but not fishing vessels, which are treated

Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources,
CCAMLR, has committed to designating a network of marine protected
areas, including the Ross Sea, but according to The Last Ocean, that
means allowing commercial fishing, including krill trawlers. The CCAMLR

seems that there is a possible conflict between the objectives of the
CCAMLR and the purpose of this Bill, which is to reduce the likelihood
of environmental emergencies anywhere south of 60 degrees latitude, and
to provide the resources for dealing with the situation when
emergencies do occur. Allowing more shipping into sensitive areas such
as the Ross Sea is bound to increase the risk of accidents, in addition
to the risk of disturbing the ecosystem if the scientists who advise
the CCAMLR get it wrong. Yet the duty to take preventive measures and
make contingency plans in Clause 5 does not apply to fishing operators,
nor will they be required to notify the Secretary of State as soon as
they become aware of an environmental emergency. They may be required
to pay compensation for any environmental emergency they cause under
the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, but not to the Antarctic Environmental
Liability Fund, as would be the case if they were subject to the Bill.
Can my noble friend explain whether, in the event of an environmental
emergency caused by a ship which is not an expedition, that fund
receives compensation, or alternatively, how the operators can be made
to pay the recoverable costs of the response action? In practice, the
costs of recovery will fall on the BAS, and there must surely be a

that visit. I have to say that it was one of the most expensive trips
that I have ever taken anywhere. It is very difficult to get there and
the costs and difficulties of operating there are
immense<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:48:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000050">Having
been to Antarctica, I have to confess that I did not see any penguins
or any animals at all because I went to the interior to climb a
mountain and landed at the Union glacier, where it is so cold that no
animals or even bacteria can exist. It is a completely lifeless place.
For me, it was a quite astonishing, almost spiritual, experience. If
you stand on a mountain in Antarctica on a calm day, which does not
happen very often, the air is so clear and unpolluted that you can see
for many more miles than we are used to doing in other parts of the
globe. The thing that is most striking is the silence. There are no
birds or airplanes. You look out on a completely unspoilt
environment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000051">I
am not noted as a great champion of rigorous regulation but the
Antarctic Treaty has been an absolute triumph, as my noble friend Lord
Selborne pointed out. Despite the injunctions of the noble Lord, Lord
Giddens, I shall resist the temptation to compare it with European
Union treaties. It has indeed been hugely successful.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:50:00"></hs_TimeCode> I went to
Antarctica, I was supported by an organisation run by former members of
the British Antarctic Survey. We should be really proud of that body

people involved are incredibly professional and understanding of what
is required to operate in a very harsh and unforgiving environment. A

for example, before you can leave Chile to get to Antarctica, you have
to be briefed and you have to be aware of a set of rules. I do not wish
to be indelicate but one thing that people always ask me about the
expedition is: if the temperature is minus 35 degrees and you are in a
tent, how do you manage with your ablutions? Under the rules,
everything —and I mean everything—has to be carried back
to Chile. It has to be put in a bag, frozen and carried back. Under the
terms of the treaty, you are not allowed to take anything out of
Antarctica and you are not allowed to leave anything behind. The only
things that you can leave behind are your footprints, and the only
things you can away are your memories and photographs. This is
rigorously
enforced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:51:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

friend asking why that is. If people were to pee in the snow, there
would be a series of yellow ice stacks up the mountain as the snow was
blown away due to the katabatic winds. Therefore, strict control is
applied right the way through. The result is that, when you go to Mount
Vinson, it is as 
<?notus-xml column=1774?>God left it—it is completely unspoilt. That is in stark contrast
to other high mountains in the world such as Everest, Aconcagua or
Kilimanjaro, which are completely strewn with rubbish and desperately
polluted. The fact that Mount Vinson is unspoilt is entirely due to the
operation of this treaty, and therefore I very much welcome the Bill,

should like to make—this may seem a little hypocritical, having
been there—is that when you go to Antarctica you fly from Punta
Arenas and land on a natural ice runway in a Russian plane without
windows, which is quite a scary experience. As you leave the plane, you
immediately find yourself in Narnia: you are confronted with a blinding
white light and a completely unspoilt environment. There is a camp
there, which has to be set up every year, and it is amazingly well run
and organised. Some of the best food and wine that I have eaten and
drunk was at Union glacier. When I complained to the organisers that it
seemed a bit extravagant to have such splendid claret, he said,
“The cost of the claret is incidental. The real cost is getting
it here and taking it out again”. Therefore, Union glacier is a
very comfortable camp.</hs_para>

of course the mountaineers. The next most interesting were the

the ice cap, measuring the effects of climate change and working out

vessel visiting Antarctica has  a duty to have contingency

need to have adequate insurance cover or other financial security to
cover liabilities in the event of an environmental emergency. The UK
Chamber of Shipping and the International Group of P&amp;I
Clubs—that is, protection and indemnity clubs—raised some
concerns while the Bill was going through the other place. They thought
that it needed to be made clear that the liability limits found in
existing conventions which allow ship operators to limit liability, as
ratified by the UK, would be respected in implementing this
Bill’s limits for environmental
emergencies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:57:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
Several exchanges took place and I believe that a ministerial Statement
was made in the other place to try to quantify those concerns. I hope
that the Minister can confirm that under this Bill the liability
provisions will come in only when existing liability provisions,

maritime conventions to which this country has provided ratification

right to limit liability under the Convention on Limitation of
Liability for Maritime Claims—the LLMC—of 1976, to which
a protocol was added in 1996. In essence, the right to limit liability
for ships or ship-source pollution stems from the need for the risk to
be quantifiable, and therefore insurable, with the advantage of prompt
settlement of claims arising from such incidents. I should be grateful

is scheduled to visit this year. Basically, this Bill relates to the

exploration in remote areas of the Antarctic Peninsula in the spirit of
Scott, seeking to further the bounds of human exploration and
knowledge. I attended the report back at the Royal Geographical Society

Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling with the BAS for the past 14

environment is changing, it becomes more liable to artificial risks, a
point made by the noble Earl, Lord Selborne. However, as the noble
Lord, Lord Forsyth, commented, some of these accidents may well be
deliberate. Indeed, a novelist approached me recently to ask for
various fiendish methods by which we could destroy the environment, so

welcome Clause 5(2)(a) on the obligation to reduce risk, but Clause

Surely, the Secretary of State should have power to require information

work has been done to preserve the physical environment, the ice where
historic pollutants can be detected. I understand that, for example,
that one way of measuring the impact of lead emissions from vehicles
has been be looking at the ice cores—fortunately now declining
as lead emissions are themselves declining. It has been an
extraordinary historical source of the study of pollutants and the
history of the climate. To pick up one of the points made by the noble
Lord, Lord Avebury, about fisheries, it is evident that the remarkable
fish stocks in the surrounding seas of the southern ocean are also at

opposed the protection zone around Antarctica being continued. Again,
because of the fragility and circumstances on the continent, it is
essential that Her Majesty’s Government take an inflexible line

an extremely interesting speech, the noble Lord raised a large number
of interesting points. I am amazed and sometimes appalled by the level
of his expertise on parts of the world that often I have to start
researching by looking them up on a map. On the question of how we
might charge for permits to cover clean-up costs, the
Government’s consideration on this is that the limits on charges
and maximum liability set out in the Bill are already significant.
Liability for the smallest vessels is just under £1 million. For
larger vessels we are talking about anywhere between
£12 million and £30 million. These are
generous limits for the 
<?notus-xml column=1782?>potential emergencies that we could envisage. Once the liability annexe
comes into force, the Antarctic Treaty parties will review the
liability limits. Many consider that they will then need to be raised,
for example to come into line with the new limits to be introduced

noble Lord raised the question of protecting Mawson’s huts. The

The Government are aware of a very extensive Australian restoration
programme for Mawson’s huts and so do not think that they will
fall into disrepair without British involvement. However, if the UK
Antarctic Heritage Trust was invited to contribute expertise to that
restoration project, I am sure that it would seriously consider the
opportunity, which the Government would encourage it to accept. The

noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also raised the question of marine protected
areas and fisheries. I confirm that Clause 9(3) specifically excludes
the activity of fishing for profit from all requirements in Part 1 of

Protection to the Antarctic Treaty does not cover fishing activities,
which, as the noble Lord pointed out, are the subject of separate rules
and regulations under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic

“Camlar” as an acronym. As a result, they are

the designation of marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean.
Earlier this year, the Government of South Georgia and the South
Sandwich Islands announced one of the largest sustainable-use marine

extend liability to cover increases in tourism and shipping and the

This is an extension. Much of what the noble Lord is concerned about

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to open by thanking the
many campaigners who have supported the causes that will see what I
hope is a moment of success with this Bill: Mr Peter Lawrence, who is
here today, has been a tireless campaigner; the noble Lord, Lord
Boswell of Aynho, who drafted the original Private Member’s Bill
that he brought before the other place some years ago and which is
remarkable for its similarity to the Bill before us today—he did
some extraordinary work in drafting that first Bill; John Glen, the
Member of Parliament for Salisbury, who sponsored the Bill in the
Commons and took it through that place successfully—he has been
an important campaigner; the Justice Committee of the House of Commons,
whose hearings and 12th Report of Session 2012 have been pivotal in
developing the issues and convincing a wide number of political parties
and the establishment to recognise that this Bill is needed and should
be supported; and the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Runaway and
Missing Children and Adults, chaired by Ann Coffey MP, which held
hearings that again brought many of the key issues to public notice.

if I have to stress one group above all who have pushed forward the
causes covered in the Bill, it is the charity Missing People, and again
members of the staff of that charity are here today. The charity does
extraordinary work with the families of both children and adults who
are missing and for missing individuals themselves. The charity
recognises that these provisions  
<?notus-xml column=1786?>could make a big difference to people who suffer as family and friends
go missing. I want also to thank the Ministry of Justice and the team
led by Paul Hughes, all of whom have been very supportive by providing
information that has enhanced our understanding of the whole
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T11:41:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

It applies to England and Wales similar legislation that already exists
in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It creates a new court procedure and
an associated process of authoritative registration. The court
procedure enables a person with sufficient interest to obtain a legally
binding declaration from the High Court that a person is to be deemed
dead for all purposes, including the end of their marriage or civil
partnership. If the Bill is passed, the High Court would make the
declaration if it is satisfied that the missing person has died or has
not been known to be alive for a period of at least seven years. The
court also has the power to deal with the myriad consequential
property-related issues that may arise as a result of the
declaration. Why do we need the Bill? Around a quarter of a million
people are reported missing each year. Thankfully, most come home or
make contact, while a small number are sadly found dead. However,
obviously this is not true for all. In 2010, the UK Missing
Persons Bureau had on its records some 1,400 cases of people who have
been missing for more than seven
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T11:42:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020135000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000122">The trauma for families
and friends when a person goes missing is horrendous. As time passes
without contact or information, some families conclude that the only
possible answer is that their missing relative is “presumed
dead”. After seven years they can start to take steps to resolve
the legal affairs of that person, but without a body they have no death
certificate, and without a death certificate a person is legally
assumed to be alive. Currently, there are steps that relatives or
interested persons can take. The MoJ has kindly listed the six
procedures, each of which is a different legal process under which a
person may be presumed dead just for the specific purposes of that
procedure. You really could not invent a more bureaucratic and
stressful system, one that often requires lengthy processes and
extensive support from legal counsel. Both the Justice Committee and
the APPG on Runaway and Missing Children and Adults, of which I am
part, heard traumatic stories from families trying to find legal
resolution. The emotional impact of accepting loss is hard enough
without the added stress of a legal hunt-the-thimble, multiple
applications, multiple different processes and multiple
certificates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T11:43:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

problem by putting in place one procedure under which a family member
or other relevant party can apply for a single presumption of death
certificate which can be used for all valid purposes. The same
certificate can be used to dissolve a marriage, dispose of property,
close a bank account and so on. The court decision is entered into a
register by the Registrar General for England and Wales. I should say
that some of the existing procedures will remain on the books, as it
were, so that people who want to seek presumption of death for perhaps
only one narrow purpose will still have the procedures available to
them. My honourable friend Lady Hamwee will explore some of those
issues.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1787?><hs_para UID="13020135000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000124">As I said earlier,
similar systems have been in place in Scotland since 1977 and in
Northern Ireland since 2009. Based on their experience, the number of
declarations a year is expected to be between 30 and 40, so none of
this is onerous for the courts. Similar legislation also exists in
Australia and Canada and supports the notion that we are looking at
something like 30 to 40 declarations a year. Of course, a person
declared dead may suddenly reappear, and I believe this has happened
once in Scotland. The Bill therefore has powers for the court to make
revocations and when it provides the declaration, it can require the
trustees to take out various forms of insurance, for example, to
protect innocent purchasers of property or insurance companies which
have paid out on presumed
death.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000125">I think
that there can be no argument with what is in this Bill. Those who have
read the debate in the Commons will recognise that it has very broad
cross-party support and that every Member who spoke wished it speedy
progress through this Parliament. But there can be an argument about
what is left out of the Bill. Noble Lords will be well aware, again
from evidence both to the Justice Committee and the APPG on Runaway and
Missing Children and Adults, that the families and associates of
missing people are often left in an intolerable limbo well before the
seven-year mark is reached. Indeed, even at seven years, many families
may not want to give up all hope and declare a loved one
“presumed dead”. Because we recognise the plight of these
families, the Justice Committee, the APPG and most of us campaigning
for this Presumption of Death Bill have also been pressing for
guardianship orders to be made available through the courts to protect
the financial position of the missing person and his or her dependants
at a much earlier stage. For example, relatives may need to access a
missing person’s bank account to pay that missing
person’s mortgage; or a business partner may need to sign new
contracts or sell part of the business under an arrangement that would
normally have required both signatures. There are many instances of
this kind and they cause absolutely critical problems.</hs_para>

needs more advocates. My noble friend—and friend—Lady
Kramer has explained the need for this Bill very clearly. I have to
apologise to her as I do not think I have prepared to cover the issues
that she thought I might cover. If anything does need covering, we can
talk about it outside the Chamber, although I do not think it does. We
have also had an indication from the Government, and those two factors
should be
enough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T11:52:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I speak
today not just because of the importance of the issue of practical
legal assistance for the families of missing people. That is something
which impresses itself on everyone who learns of the problems, although
it has to be said that few people know of the problems unless through
personal experience or personal contacts they are brought up against
them.</hs_para>

her parents, Diana and Paul Lamplugh. I was a councillor when Janet
Newman and Mary Asprey set up the National Missing Persons Helpline and

of the things which impressed me during that work was the evidence of
Peter Lawrence, who has already been referred to, and I hope I do not

dealing with bureaucracy in the worst sense: the tram-lined thinking of
banks, insurers and so on. However, Mr Lawrence was clearly more or
less defeated—I hope that is not the wrong way of putting
it—in trying to deal with his daughter’s practical
affairs. The evidence that we heard was about the need for
guardianship, to which my noble friend has referred. That is not in the

in my local area. Perhaps it is less so elsewhere unless there is a

and—what we are dealing with here today—frustrations. It
seems that the Bill will almost achieve the impossible and come close
to proving a negative, certainly more so than the rebuttable common law
presumption. As I read the Bill, the court may well take on more of an
investigative role than we are used to our courts dealing with in
England and Wales, and it is right that it will be the High Court that

much closer to panic when a family suddenly loses its main wage earner.
It occurs to me that by the provisions of the Bill we may find that
there is scope for the prospect of an insurance payout, to take one
example, being accessed and used as security for a short-term loan. I
am very aware of the different attitude of banks many years ago. On the
occasion of 
<?notus-xml column=1790?>a family bereavement, the bank manager, whose name we knew, was prepared
to be imaginative, co-operative and helpful very

small organisation. For the past two years it has run a missing people
campaign. It has taken to doing that digitally via Twitter. In the
first year of the campaign the organisation took 48 people
who were missing and over 24 hours a team of people sent out Twitter
messages about that person. The teams continued to work on
each person for four hours. Missing People has some very well known
celebrity supporters such as Victoria Beckham and Stephen Fry; they did
that too.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020135000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000143">The
net effect of the campaign was that the issue was raised. It trended on
Twitter and there was an awful lot of traffic to the Missing People
website, and I believe it generated some income. But the really
important thing is that Missing People managed to find at least six of
those 48 missing people. That has set a completely new standard in
charity campaigning. The way in which, with comparatively few
resources, Missing People has managed to achieve not just its purpose
as a charity but the legislative advances that we are going to help it
with today, as well as raising awareness within the general public of
these technical and difficult issues, is truly commendable. I encourage
all noble Lords to go and look at the Missing People
campaigns.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13020135000457" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000457">12.03

number of people who are reported missing each year runs well into the
hundreds of thousands. While most disappearances are resolved within a
short period of time, a small but significant number are not.
Eventually some families accept that their relative is missing,
presumed dead.</hs_para>

expect to wait at least seven years before a court might assume a
missing person to be dead, but that will not resolve all the many
outstanding issues. The emotional trauma in itself can be considerable,
but in England and Wales the situation is made much worse by the
difficulties that are faced by families as they attempt to resolve
their loved ones’ financial and legal affairs. It is difficult
to register a person’s death or obtain a death certificate in
the absence of a body.</hs_para>

certificate, families have to struggle to prove that their relative has
died: for example in order to administer their estate, dissolve a
marriage or claim benefits and life insurance. This obviously creates a
number of problems and sometimes acute financial hardship for surviving
spouses or partners. For example, the property of a missing person
cannot be distributed in the way it would if death could be confirmed

separate legal processes have to be pursued to resolve different

has also already been said, it is anticipated, based on experience in

not been known to be alive for at least seven years.</hs_para>

provisions of this Bill will not solve all the problems that families
can face when a family member goes missing and remains missing, since
such a person cannot be presumed to be dead until a significant period
of time has elapsed. In the mean time, the financial affairs of that
missing person can effectively be destroyed, if bills or insurance
premiums are unpaid and goods or property are repossessed, with
dependants unable to access the financial resources of the missing

noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, has explained the reasoning behind not
including such a provision in this Bill, but it does mean that the Bill

present, the law of England and Wales provides a number of procedures
that can be used by those left behind if they wish to establish that a
missing person is to be deemed to be dead. The problem is that some of
these procedures, as has been illustrated by several noble Lords, can
be used only in certain circumstances and at times have very limited
outcomes, meaning that several procedures might have to be followed in
any single case. This demonstrates the challenge, as my noble friend
Lady Kramer highlighted so
eloquently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000157">One
example will suffice to illustrate the problem. One of the procedures
is the “leave to swear death” procedure under the
non-contentious probate rules. This procedure will open the way to
administering the property of the missing person as if he or she were
dead. However, it will not dissolve the missing person’s
marriage or civil partnership. A separate procedure must be followed
for that purpose. As has been acknowledged by the noble Lord, Lord
Rosser, as well as by other noble Lords, creating a single,
general-purpose presumption of death procedure to overcome this problem
may not sound terribly significant, but it is significant because of
the human cost of the present law. There are many case histories that
we can cite in this respect, including those recorded by the All-Party
Parliamentary Group for Runaway and Missing Children and Adults and by
the Justice Committee in their respective inquiries in another

the interests of brevity, I shall reflect on just one case, that of
Jeremy Hoyland, who went missing in a jet ski accident off Bali in
October 2008. His body has never been found. Media reports make clear
the practical and emotional difficulties faced by his family until a
death certificate was finally obtained in only May last year. His wife,
Jacqui, is reported as saying that it was the issue of the death

difficulties with everyday issues such as paying a mortgage and
operating bank accounts in her husband’s

the missing persons issue for a moment—we must not forget the
anguish and loneliness felt by anyone who loses a loved one and the
barriers that they have to face. They are going through one of the most
emotional times in their life. Let us then consider the trauma that is
added by that dimension of the missing person, at a time when one needs
an easy process to overcome that trauma. Never can that loss be
replaced. Never, too, perhaps, can closure be achieved, but the role of
the law should at least be to assist in that process.</hs_para>

make the declaration and send it to the Registrar-General for England
and Wales, who will enter the required details in a register of
presumed deaths. This register will be searchable, and certified copies
of an entry in the register will be legal proof of the relevant
person’s death for all purposes and against all
persons.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020135000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000162">The
declaration of death will have consequences for the
ownership of the missing person’s property and may
have consequences for the ownership of other property. The Bill
therefore gives the court power to deal with property issues at the
same time as the declaration. We expect that, on average, between
30 and 40 declarations are likely to be issued in England
and Wales
annually.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000163">The
deemed death will therefore be for all legal purposes a real death.
However, unlike a real death, a deemed death can be undone by the
person presumed to be dead returning. The Bill deals with this
possibility by making provision, as my noble friend Lady Kramer
mentioned, for variation orders that can revoke or amend declarations
of death. These revocations or amendments will be notified to the
Registrar-General and the appropriate amendments made to the register.
Given the rigour of the initial procedure, we expect variation orders
to be rare. In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:14:45"></hs_TimeCode>
Scotland, I understand that there has been only one case of a
reappearance of a person presumed to be dead under the Presumption of
Death (Scotland) Act 1977.</hs_para>

making of a variation order could make it necessary to alter
dispositions of property made as a consequence of the original
declaration of presumed death. The court is therefore given wide powers
to deal with these situations. These powers are not, however, absolute.
The provisions of the Bill on this subject are relatively complicated,
but I will mention two of the most important limits on the power of the
court to undo transactions made as a consequence of the original
declaration of presumed death.</hs_para>

five years have passed since the making of the original declaration of
death, the court can make further orders in relation to property only
in exceptional circumstances. Secondly, the court’s order cannot
in any event provide grounds to challenge an acquisition of a property
made in good faith and for value. Of course, this means that a loss
will fall on someone else, but this is inevitable where there is
property to be
claimed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000166">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:16:06"></hs_TimeCode>
remainder of the Bill is ancillary to these core provisions. I shall
mention some of the more important ones. First, rules of court and
registration regulations will have to be made to specify the detail of
the procedures under the Bill. The detail of the rules is still to be
settled, but on the basis of what is required under current procedures
and under equivalent rules of court already in force in Northern
Ireland it is reasonable to assume that full details of the applicant,
the missing person and other persons, including insurance companies,
interested in the application, as well as confirmation of the required
advertisement of the application, will be required by the
court.</hs_para>

the court will have power to compel the provision of information where
the information is necessary to dispose of the proceedings. Thirdly,
although some of the existing procedures will be repealed, others will
remain available. Finally, the Bill provides that certain time periods
specified in the Bill, including the period of seven years that may
form the basis of making a declaration of presumed death, may be
altered by order made by the Secretary of State. However, I say in
response to the question asked by my noble friend Lady Hamwee that
there are no plans to exercise this power at
present.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000168">In
short, the Bill provides a robust court-based procedure to establish
that a person is to be deemed to be dead and an authoritative
registration process to record the outcome in a readily accessible
fashion. The absence from the law of England and Wales of such a
procedure is perhaps all the more surprising given that the law of
Scotland has for many years provided one, as my noble friend Lady
Kramer pointed out, and that Northern Ireland followed suit in 2009
with very similar legislation. My noble friend’s Bill will
therefore bring the law in England and Wales broadly into line with
that in Northern Ireland and
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:17:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:18:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000169">I

answers. I always welcome her input not just on this issue but across a
wide range of issues. In response to her question on published
guidance, I can confirm that, as recommended by the Justice Committee,
the Ministry of Justice and the Missing Persons Bureau have published
guidance for police and, more importantly, the families of missing
people on existing procedures for a person presumed to be dead. This
guidance is available on the Missing Persons Bureau website and across
government websites. I recognise that we need to ensure that relevant
links appear on different websites. If we are meant to be easing a

15 of the coroners Act, which it was hoped would be published last
summer. This forms part of the guidance to which I have already
referred. The Bill was introduced in the other place by my honourable
friend, the Member for Salisbury. He did this before the Government
responded to the Justice Committee but after the noble
Baroness introduced her own Presumption of Death and Provisions
Relating to Missing Persons Bill. That Bill, which is in part very
similar to the Presumption of Death Bill that is now before your

of the guardianship of a missing person. The Government are very

better provision for missing persons and those left behind, for both
her dedication and pragmatism and for taking up this Bill, introduced

Best:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great privilege to bring this Bill
before your Lordships. The Bill aims to end to some disgraceful
practices which have been widespread in an industry with which few of
us are familiar. If enacted, it will make a huge difference to the
lives of thousands of largely forgotten people who currently live with
the fear of harassment and ill-treatment at the hands of some
unscrupulous bullies. Credit for this legislation goes to a number of
people to whom we should all be very grateful. First, there is the
noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, who has campaigned tirelessly in
support of those living in mobile homes or park homes for over
30 years. I hope that today represents a gratifying milestone in a long
journey he has taken to achieve justice for this group.</hs_para>

there are the Members in the other place who have also fought long and
hard on this issue, including Annette Brooke MP and the other members
of the Mobile Homes All-Party Parliamentary Group chaired by
Christopher Chope MP. I think that a special tribute is due to Grant
Shapps MP who, as Housing Minister, took up the challenge presented by
the problems facing mobile home owners and, following an extensive
consultation process by his department, really got behind the
formulation of this legislation. However, none of these efforts would
have brought us to the positive position we face today were it not for
Peter Aldous MP, the honourable Member for Waveney, who used his place
in the ballot for Private Members’ Bills to sponsor this Bill on
mobile homes. Although 
<?notus-xml column=1798?>I was hugely impressed by the unanimity of support for this Bill across
party lines, piloting a Private Member’s Bill through the other
place can represent an unpredictable and hazardous task. A great many
Private Members’ Bills have fallen along the way, so I

surveyor and his local knowledge as a constituency MP, so assiduously

mention of the people living in mobile homes, who themselves have
fought long and hard to achieve wider recognition for the problems that
they face. I am personally grateful to Brian Doick of the National
Association of Park Home Residents, who has been advising fellow owners
on a voluntary basis for more than three decades on these matters and
who kindly showed me around a number of sites and introduced me to many
other residents; he has been a stalwart in all the campaigns for
changes to the law in this field. I know that many others have also
done sterling work, including the Independent Park Homes Advisory
Service, the Park Home Owners Justice Campaign, the National Park Home
Owners Congress and other resident associations and alliances. My final
congratulations and appreciation go to the hardworking civil servants

all noble Lords will be familiar with the mobile homes that are the
subject of this Bill. These are static, immobile homes, often called
“park homes”. They are not holiday homes, but provide
permanent, residential, owner-occupied accommodation, mostly for
retired individuals and
couples<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:29:25"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
estimated that there are 85,000 park homes accommodating
approximately 160,000 people on 2,000 sites. Homes may be worth
anything from £25,000 to, I gather, £300,000. They are
grouped together on pitches on land originally made available, very
often, by a farmer who retained ownership of the site and provided
services—looking after paths, drains and the supply of
utilities, et cetera—in return for a combined ground rent and
service charge, or pitch fee. As well as this revenue, the site owner
is entitled to 10% of sales proceeds whenever one of the park homes
gets sold.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020135000182" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000182">At
best, these mobile home sites have been described as “little
paradises”, often in an idyllic country setting with a friendly
site owner and a strong, mutually supportive community. But over recent
years many of the original site owners, or their heirs and successors,
have sold up and highly undesirable purchasers have taken their place.
In these cases, residents have been exposed to exploitation in a number
of ways: services are not undertaken, with drains left blocked;
pathways are impassable; street lighting is out of action, and so on.
Meanwhile, service charges or pitch fees are inexorably increased.
Exorbitant fees are added to charges for Calor Gas and other brands of
LPG, for use of a gas meter or for other supplies.</hs_para>

who want to sell have seen  the sale blocked by the site owner,
who can invoke the “approval of the buyer” rule. This
sale-blocking takes the form of the harassment and intimidation of park

<?notus-xml column=1799?>homes residents by rogue site owners, who can make tens of thousands of
pounds’ profit in these circumstances. The aim of the
unscrupulous site owner is to prevent the mobile home being sold to
anyone other than himself. Various tactics are deployed by the site
owner to acquire these properties for trivial sums, often on the
pretext that the mobile home is virtually worthless because of its age
and condition. The site owner then resells for an enormous profit or
replaces the existing home with a smart new version, which can be
installed for a fraction of the new sale price.</hs_para>

meet the site owner as part of the process of that owner approving any
new purchaser, rogue site owners block the sale by scaring potential
buyers, perhaps by telling them that the home is defective and will
need to be demolished or that the site is to become a Gypsy site, with
animals free to roam. He may leave piles of rubbish outside the home or
even parade his own criminal background, all to deter any purchaser. In
other cases, the whole of a park home site is worth more for
redevelopment than in its current use and the site owner has sought
gradually to acquire all the mobile homes—using every
conceivable ploy to persuade current occupiers to leave—so that
he can sell the land with vacant possession.</hs_para>

Institute, which gives regular reports on these nefarious activities,

operators, in pursuit of obscene windfall profits, have exploited the

has pursued operators named Small who own approximately 17 park home
sites. Other site owners are even bigger businesses, controlling up to
40 sites. What was once a cottage industry now has a turnover in excess

these malpractices? Can it drive out the gangsters and the rogues from

recognises that local authorities are the agencies best placed to
insist on and enforce decent standards of behaviour and performance by
site owners. Here, I declare my interest as president of the Local
Government Association. The Bill gives local authorities proper
incentives and powers to require good practice by the owners of sites,
while protecting the rights of those owners with proper provision for
appeals against local authority decisions.</hs_para>

authorities have to license park home sites but in reality this has
been little more than a formality and, in any case, hard-pressed local
authorities have faced a heavy financial disincentive to get involved
with these cases. The Bill makes licensing a meaningful arrangement,
requiring standards to be met. An annual fee will be required from the
site owner, which is to be set by the local authority but is likely to
be on average around £1,350 per annum per site, to pay for the
council’s costs of administration. There will be serious 
<?notus-xml column=1800?>sanctions where the terms of the licence are breached. If the site owner
is aggrieved by the local authority’s actions in this regard,
they can take the matter to the Residential Property Tribunal, which is
given new powers in the Bill. Putting local authorities centre stage
and giving them the resources to do the job is likely to make a
significant difference to what goes on at these
sites.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000189" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000189">Clear

blocking, the aim is to prevent the site owner disrupting the sale

currently takes place between the obstructive site owner and all
prospective buyers. The Bill sets out that two months after enactment,
irrespective of what is said in the existing agreement
between the site owner and the resident, the position of the site owner
will change dramatically. There are two aspects to this change. A
distinction has to be made between the position for existing occupiers
and for those who have bought from existing occupiers. For the latter,
when they come to sell, the site owner will have no say at all in the
process. For existing occupiers with agreements in place, the position
is slightly different.</hs_para>

if existing agreements were subject to too much change, objections
could be made that the legislation was retrospective or that it might
offend the human rights of park owners—including, of course,
blameless park owners—provoking the ire of those in another

that the Bill does nothing to overcome problems of sale blocking for
existing park home owners. On the contrary, the position will change
significantly after enactment of the Bill: the site owner will no
longer be involved in meeting any prospective purchaser nor is the
owner’s permission required to assign the agreement when the
sale is about to be completed. The only information they will be
entitled to receive about potential buyers is their name and, if the
site has rules, certain information to be prescribed in regulations.
For example, if the site is exclusively for those over pensionable age
and that is clear in the site rules, it may be legitimate for the site
owner to require information on the buyer’s age.</hs_para>

introduced. The Bill gives powers to the Secretary of State to
introduce by way of secondary legislation just such a requirement.
Regrettably, there are ways in which devious operators can hide behind
a network of companies or switch the ownership and management of parks
between family members. Establishing the true position and policing it
would not be a trivial matter. The Government have made clear that they
will not impose a duty to instigate and enforce a requirement for the
manager of a site to be a fit and proper person in the immediate
future, but that this provision in the Bill will be used if it becomes
clear that this is an essential ingredient in improving the industry.

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, I follow the noble Lord, Lord Best,
with great pleasure. I endorse all that he said. We are very much in
his debt for piloting this Bill through your Lordships’ House. I
have had a very long association with mobile homes. I shall say in
parenthesis that my only criticism of the Bill is its title. I wish it
were the Park Homes Bill.</hs_para>

association with park homes. At one stage, I was told that there were
more sites in my constituency of South Staffordshire than in any other
constituency in the country. I had many long and agreeable
conversations with my friend the noble Lord, Lord Graham, when we used
to meet to talk about the plight of the home owners. This is the thing
that we have to underline in this debate time and time again: we are
talking about home owners, people who have invested, sometimes their
pension lump sum, sometimes the product of a lifetime of saving, in a
modest home in the country. Some of these homes are quite palatial, but
most are modest, scrupulously clean and very well looked after. Their
owners take great pride in them. There were no communities in South
Staffordshire that were truer communities than the park home sites. In
some of them residents and owners spent hours every week making sure
that not just their own gardens were tidy, precise and attractive but
that the whole site was beautifully kept.</hs_para>

of my 40-year membership of the other place, I had very few complaints
from owners of park homes about the activities of site owners. Then in
the last decade of my membership of the other place, I had a very great
number of complaints about two or three unscrupulous owners in
particular, whose practices not only verged on, but sometimes became,
criminal. The noble Lord, Lord Best, spoke of intimidation.
Intimidation can take many forms. The knock on the door in the night
was not unknown, with no one there when the door was opened. Dogs,
rather fierce ones, prowling around was not unknown. The blocking of
sales, which the noble Lord, Lord Best, referred to, was quite
frequent, an appalling exploitation of the provision by which the park
home owner is able to veto the prospective purchaser. There were so
many other things. The noble Lord, Lord Best, talked of drainage not
being repaired and of excessive fees being charged for fuel. I know of
one site called Silver Poplars. Many of the trees around it 
<?notus-xml column=1803?>were, not surprisingly, poplars. In the course of one particularly
disturbing weekend, most of them were chopped down. The anguish and
distress caused to the home owners at the despoliation of their very
attractive rural environment was palpable.</hs_para>

for the most part, want nothing more than to live a tranquil life in a
place of quiet and tranquil beauty without being interfered with by
anyone. The way in which some of these owners behaved was such that it
became absolutely necessary for important legislation to be produced.
Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Graham, and I go back a long way. We
remember the noble Lord, Lord King of Bridgwater, introducing the first
Bill many decades ago. It was the beginning of the recognition of the
need for some form of regulation, but the problems that we talk about
today did not exist then and the provisions of that Bill are not
adequate to deal with them. We now need an Act that can be enforced and
can make these people—and let us stress that they are still a
minority of site owners—realise that what they are doing will
land them in very deep trouble indeed.</hs_para>

Staffordshire there are still many owners. Indeed, the council owns a
very good site called Hinksford. There are many sites where the owners

extraordinary anguish to so many home owners that they have to be dealt
with. I am delighted to know that my noble friend Lady

may be successful in so doing—if they are, we will have to deal
with them. It is not right that a particular group of home owners in
our country should be treated as badly as Rachman treated his tenants
all those decades ago. These are the Rachmans of the mobile home world;
they do not deserve a place in any civilised society—they
deserve to be hounded out of what they are doing, to be fined unlimited

your Lordships will have gathered, I am a passionate supporter of this

Lord Best, indicated that they are static—they are not the sort
of homes that are dragged around the country—and are not to be
confused with those taken from site to site. They are permanent
dwellings, owned by those who live in them, who deserve all the rights
and protection that the owner of a long lease deserves and, for the
most part, enjoys. I hope that this day marks the beginning of a new
chapter for those living in those homes and that the Bill speedily goes
on to the statute books—and that there will be no delay about
its enforcement, or complications arising therefrom.

give just one example of the way in which site owners can hugely
exploit park home owners and their beneficiaries when a sale occurs. A
park home owner in east Sussex used his life savings to buy his home
for £72,000. He then spent the rest of his savings on improving
that home. When he died only four years later, he left his home to his
two daughters, who wished to sell it. However, before they put it up
for sale, the site owner approached them and said that he would take it
away for them for £1,000. Less resilient inheritors might not
have understood the position and gone along with that. However, the
man’s daughters put the home on the market, initially for
£60,000, as the market had obviously gone down in the interim,
and were prepared to sell for £50,000. But even at that point
when they had a buyer, the site owner stepped in, spoke directly to the
buyer, told him that the recently renovated home was subject to
dilapidation and was waterlogged, which was untrue, and that he would
be foolish to pursue the sale. He clearly did that to a number of
potential buyers but eventually one came forward and the home was sold
several months later for £37,000, of which the site owner
received 10%. Therefore, the home was sold for significantly less than
half the purchase price that had been paid four years previously. That
is a typical case, but there are worse examples where sales do not go
ahead at all and where the site owner effectively obtains the home for
a mere pittance for his own use and onward
sale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:59:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Scott of Needham Market:</Member></B> My Lords, I join in the thanks to
the noble Lord, Lord Best, for taking this Bill through the House. His
expertise in housing matters and his diligence will be put to good use
in this regard. I also pay tribute to Peter Aldous, the MP for
Waveney—which for the uninitiated is in my home county of
Suffolk—both for choosing this topic for his Private
Member’s Bill and for the skill with which he steered it though
the Commons. I am particularly pleased to see the noble Lord, Lord
Graham, in his place today. He has fought very hard for this over many
years and must be delighted to see that we are finally making some
progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T13:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000219" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000219">During
the debate that I secured in the Moses Room on this topic last summer,
it became apparent that the Government intended to support the Bill,
and I know that the Minister will deal with it in her customary
efficient and sympathetic way. Many changes were introduced in the
Commons—many by the Government—and they are most welcome,
but I think that it has resulted in a little confusion about exactly
what the Bill does and when the various provisions will come into
force. Some of those have been clarified very well by the noble Lord,
Lord Best, today but there are still a few areas of confusion to which
I shall allude. If the Minister does not have time in her summing up
today, perhaps she could write to explain exactly when some of the
provisions will come
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000220" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0001.htm#13020135000220">It is more
than 20 years since I first became a councillor, and my experience was
very similar to that of the noble Lord, Lord Cormack. There were a few
problems initially and then the situation got worse and worse. By the
time I finished, problems on park home sites were very common, and they
have been quite well rehearsed: poor site management, breach of licence
conditions, misuse of the tariffs for charging electricity and gas,
breaches of fire safety regulations and general 
<?notus-xml column=1807?>quality-of-life matters. The council did what it could, but it lacked
the statutory framework that it needed to deal with many of these
issues.</hs_para>

power that the Bill gives to local authorities to tackle some of these
abuses is most welcome. I understand that some park home owners regret
that that is not a duty on local authorities but I agree with the
Government’s more localist approach that we should be looking at
powers and not duties. However, it means that it is essential that the
Government work with local authorities on best practice with park home
owners to ensure that they are fully aware of the new rights that they
have under this

the power given to local authorities to carry out work where site
owners fail to do so and then recharge them for it. This will
concentrate the minds of site owners wonderfully on the need to get the
job done. I hope that this provision can be brought in without delay
and I ask the Minister to clarify the timing. There has been some
debate about which provisions might be caught by the
Government’s moratorium on new regulation. I accept that to an
extent red tape is in the eye of the beholder, but in this case it is
not red tape; this is fundamental to the quality of life of the several
hundred thousand residents of park homes. I also think it is important
when considering all this to look at the potential for a bonanza of bad
behaviour, which might carry on if there is a delay in bringing in the
new provisions. I fear that some of the bad owners will make hay while
the sun continues to shine.</hs_para>

has shocked me and many of my colleagues is how criminality has crept
into the park homes sector. It has been able to thrive due to a
combination of an inadequate legal framework and a very poor
understanding of what is going on. The way in which intimidation has
been used to prevent sales, for example, is absolutely scandalous. I am
delighted that, at long last, we are tackling the legal framework and

but one in which at least existing park home owners have far more
rights than they previously have, and in which they are not likely to
be subject to challenge under the Human Rights Act. That is very

with regard to the information that has to be sent under the new regime
to the park home owners. I think the noble Lord, Lord Best, said it
would include their name and issues around their compliance with the
site regulations, around age and so on. When we look at the regulations
for this, I would be very keen to ensure that the information that has
to be given cannot lead to their being readily identified by the site
home owner because we know that some of them will use intimidation,
including knocking on their doors, if they are easily identified. So I

many others, good site owners can welcome this, as can the residents
because it is important that there are some controls on those who are
able to move in. I share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
about the delays on the introduction of a fit and proper person test.
It has always seemed bizarre to me that we set standards in all sorts
of areas, but not for park home owners. I am very concerned that, given
the track record of many of them, there will be another three years
before these things can be considered. Although I accept that
devolution means a thousand flowers can bloom, it would be very odd if
a site owner was barred under the provisions made recently by the Welsh
Assembly as not being fit and proper, but was allowed to run a site on

aspects of the Bill, as noble Lords know, is to talk in terms of
increasing the powers of local authorities up to level 5. Level 5 fines
are £5,000. We have already had it explained that that will be
transformed within 12 months: it will be moved up from £5,000 to
an unlimited sum. I look forward to the day when the first
£50,000 fine is levied. It will not make much difference to the
people I am talking about, but it will be a warning. I also look

is to ask the Government to speed up the Bill in any way they can so
that it can be put into practice. There are blemishes, of course. It is
intriguing that site owners do not take account of the views of their
residents. There are some parks—I have their names—where
despite the fact that they qualify, the site owner simply ignores that;
he just “takes notice” of something. The Minister should
know that many site owners ignore moves made by her department to make
sure that they act properly. Today we have an opportunity of speeding
this Bill through, and it certainly has my very warm

that is thoroughly deserved. He is not alone. We have heard from the

their only affordable route to a home in or near a place that they know

uncontrolled levels of service charges, particularly for utilities,

that in the form of sale blocking. We heard some grim examples of how
that intimidation is inflicted. There are examples of failure to
undertake the proper maintenance of sites and inadequate licensing
processes. As the noble Lord, Lord Best, explained in his opening
remarks, the Bill will do much to improve the detail of the position.

follow other noble Lords in congratulating and thanking the noble Lord,
Lord Best, for introducing 
<?notus-xml column=1813?>this Bill into this House and my honourable friend Peter Aldous, MP for
Waveney, for all that he has done to promote and take it through
Parliament. I also thank noble Lords who have mentioned my right
honourable friend Grant Shapps, who finally grasped the nettle of this.
It is something, as other noble Lords have said, that has been bobbling
around for far too long. I remember well the very first debate I was
ever asked to do from the Front Bench in this House, which
was to answer, on behalf of the Opposition, the noble Lord,
Lord Graham, and discuss mobile homes. It took us back a bit but we did
it. Ever since, I have admired enormously the expertise and the
absolute, sheer determination of the noble Lord, Lord Graham, to see
that something was done about this absolutely dreadful situation, which
has put so many people into such jeopardy. There have also been others,
including the notable campaigners who have not given up all the
way through. At last Parliament is able to take a role and try to bring
an end to some of these real
travesties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000253" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000253">If
enacted, this Bill will afford much better protection to park home
owners, and it is good to see it so warmly supported by all sides of
the House. As other noble Lords have said, it affects only a relatively
small number of homes in England. However, we heard that the Welsh
Assembly is also taking this seriously, so it will affect England and
Wales. It is hugely important to the people who live in these
homes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T13:32:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I believe
there are around 85,000 park homes, on 2,000 sites. The sector
represents less than 8.5% of the housing stock in England, but just
because this part of housing is tiny, it does not mean that we should
not address the injustice that is rife and of which we have heard
various examples today. That is why this Government fully back this

Bill builds on the thorough and searching inquiry into the industry and
its practices, which the Communities and Local Government Select
Committee held last spring, and takes forward a number of the
recommendations that the Committee made. We want to create a level
playing field where the good site operator—and we know there are
good site operators—does not face unfair competition from
unscrupulous ones who ignore their obligations and the rights of
others. We want to see the park home sector put on a sustainable
footing for the future, where those who run a decent and honest
business can flourish and which has no place for the unscrupulous and
criminal. Above all, we want homeowners to be confident that their
homes are safe and, perhaps most importantly, that their rights are
respected. The Bill aims to achieve these objectives by introducing
measures targeted at those who ignore their obligations and exploit
their residents, while placing minimal burdens on those businesses
which manage their sites well and respect their residents’
rights.</hs_para>

Best, has given a very clear exposition of what the Bill says. It
focuses on four key areas: reforms to the antiquated licensing regime
that applies to park home sites; removing the ability for unscrupulous
operators to block lawful sales by residents of their homes; preventing
owners from imposing unreasonable site rules for their own benefit; and
ensuring that increases in pitch fees are transparent to prevent
residents being overcharged. These issues were particularly identified
in the department’s consultation
paper.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000256" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000256">The
licensing reforms will mean that for the first time local authorities
in England will be able to recover costs incurred in licensing directly
from the site owner through fees and costs in recovery enforcement
action. These functions will no longer have to be subsidised by the
local taxpayer. Authorities will also be able to serve notices
requiring works on sites to be carried out, and the courts will be able
to impose large fines on site operators who do not comply. I note that
the noble Lord, Lord Graham, was very modest in wanting to achieve
£50,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000257" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000257">The
changes to selling a home will remove altogether the need to seek
approval of a purchaser by the site owner. This is one of the most
important provisions. This new system will apply to all new agreements
and from the second assignment of existing agreements. On the first
assignment of existing agreements, site owners will retain a role but
the circumstances in which approval can be withheld will be specified
to those relating to the site rules. In particular, it will be
for the site owner to establish at the residential property tribunal
that a purchaser does not meet the relevant site rules. In both
circumstances, however, there will no longer be a requirement that a
prospective purchaser needs to contact or meet the site owner or that
the site owner has to agree to the assignment of the agreement when the
buyer and seller, as it were, exchange
contracts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000258" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000258">The
Bill also includes a provision that would permit the Government to
introduce the “fit and proper person” test through
secondary legislation in the future. I hear what noble Lords say about
the importance of this aspect. It was a recommendation of the Select
Committee and I will say a few words about why the Government have
accepted this recommendation. It is not the Government’s
intention to impose an industry-wide fit and proper requirement at
present. New burdens on business are always a last resort, but we must
also ensure that the conditions in this sector improve. That is why the
Bill focuses on making it unprofitable for unscrupulous operators to
exploit residents, but we accept the risk that some of the worst
operators will persist and that it may be necessary to use these powers
to directly remove them from the industry.</hs_para>

reviewing the situation after a suitable period—I hope that
would be shorter rather than longer—to see how behaviour in the
industry has changed. If unscrupulous practices persist, we may have to
consider introducing the fit and proper test as well. It will be in our
back pocket should it be needed, although that may not be likely if
this Bill achieves its purpose of hitting the unscrupulous and criminal
operators in their pockets.</hs_para>

Bill does not include everything that the Government consulted on. The
policy reasons are explained in the published response paper, which is

concluded that legislative change is not the best solution. It is also
a matter of size and what can be achieved in a Private Member’s
Bill. This Bill runs to 15 clauses, which is quite unusual for a
Private Member’s Bill, and some of those clauses are very long.

Motion, I would like to refer the House to its wording at the bottom of
grouping sheet, which has somehow been printed at the bottom of all the
amendments to the Bill. This is what I am speaking to now. It is
unusual to put down an amendment to a Motion such as this, but we are
in slightly unusual times—as we come up to the end of the
Session—because we had two days’ notice of the Committee
stage today. I had a useful meeting with the noble Baroness, Lady
Wilcox, and her officials on Monday, where I said it was particularly
important that we should see a reply to the letter which we had all
been sent from Brian Simpson MEP, chairman of the Transport Committee
in the European Parliament, to the Secretary of State for Transport. I
said that I needed to see that reply before we discussed it in
Committee. Once I knew what the date was, I put the amendment down on
Wednesday night and, miraculously, the letter appeared on Thursday
morning. That was good news, but it gave 
<?notus-xml column=1818?>us just 24 hours to consider it. As it did not answer the
main question that Mr Simpson had asked, I felt
it was reasonable to ask for a week’s delay to the
Committee, which is what my amendment is
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T13:48:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T13:48:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

very odd that in this Bill we have a definition of the management,
qualifications and experience required for a PEC holder when there is

UK law. I am not very sure, because I have not had time to check it,

extraordinary that we were not told about this at a previous stage of
this Bill because it directly relates to the debate that we had at
Second Reading, and which they had at many stages in the House of
Commons, about the qualifications for pilotage. For the record, the
latest reference for this is in European directive 2012/35, which was
completed on 21 November last year and will be presumably be brought in
by regulation within two years. However, it is already there from the

PEC holder is qualified. That seems a quite extraordinary
misinterpretation of the rules. It is not up to the master to change
the requirements for training or seniority of a person to allow him to
become a PEC holder, because the convention we are talking about lists
three specific cases in which penalties are to be applied. If the
master is found to have allowed unduly qualified persons not holding
the right

very interested to hear the Minister’s response as there seems
to be a serious conflict on the management, levels and skills required

through Europe, to here and what is in the Bill. Can the Minister say
whether this conflict was known about? I presume that it was and I am
sorry that noble Lords were not told about it earlier. I suggest that
the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, being forward a
suitable amendment on Report, if it can be done, to link the existing
regulations in the directive with the relevant parts of Clause 2
because there will otherwise be court actions coming out of
people’s ears. When people find out that they have two
regulations, and that one works for them and the other does not, they
will all be going to court—and the ports, the pilots and
everyone else will be the losers. It is very important that this matter

Eames:</Member></B> My Lords, in supporting the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, I declare an interest as a member of the Royal Yachting
Association. I cannot imagine a greater recipe for the lawyers of our
knowledge than the conflict that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has
exposed before us today. The question of qualifications, training and
their wedding with experience is a very sensitive area in the maritime
world. We are not dealing simply with a technical matter. We are
dealing with one of the most sensitive issues, which concerns people
who are transported, people within the marine industry and people with
an interest in our ports. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has put his
finger on one of the most sensitive issues—this is not a
technical attempt to restrain the legislation or prove difficult about
it—which has to be given the closest possible attention because
there is a conflict in places between these two edicts. The conflict,
in my experience, will lead to an open charter for many months and
years to come unless we are satisfied as a House that every possible
examination has taken place of the difficulties between these two
approaches.</hs_para>

convinced that where there is any question of conflict, not only does
it raise issues of a purely legal nature, but it puts into contempt the
sort of respect that people ought to have of the whole industry. For
that reason, I too will be very interested in what the Minister says
about what examination has been made of this conflict. Has it been
given the attention that it deserves?</hs_para>

regret the way in which the legislation has been produced today, on a
Friday, with so little notice to many of us who come a great distance
to attend the House. At this early stage, I ask that very serious
consideration be given to the Bill by the Minister, for whom I have the
highest regard and who has always been most helpful when I have raised
issues with him. However, in this instance I believe that the full
import of what the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, says has yet to be
realised by the Government.</hs_para>

Chidgey:</Member></B> My Lords, noble Lords will remember that at
Second Reading we had a mutual admiration for the
ancient mariners of Watchet. We all seemed to know
Watchet very well, to my great surprise. I mention it in the context of
this Committee stage because noble Lords will acknowledge the goings-on
in Watchet in the past week. There was almost a terrible tragedy when
an infant in his pushchair was swept into the harbour in high
winds. He was rescued—and the point is about the definition of
people’s roles—by one 63 year-old George Reeder, who
jumped into what was probably 30 feet of water to rescue the child. He
was variously described as a port master, a dock master, a marine dock
master and a harbour master. Each of those titles carries a certain
responsibility and weight in maritime law. If we cannot get that
straight, just imagine what will happen if we do not get this
straight.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-01?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_01_PT_1/068BAAB1FAB5AE0669F8AAD5C6ADB410285CEEEC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 1 February 2013">Friday,

pre-empt discussion on Clause 2, which I hope that we can have today,
but I will say now that this clause does not propose such a thing. I
may be able to satisfy the noble and reverend Lord, Lord Eames, at this
point. A junior rating is not a deck officer, though a

Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not intend to repeat what I said
at Second Reading, or what I said on my earlier amendment, as we have
had a good debate on the issue in Clause 2. My concern remains only
with the inclusion in the clause of the phrase “deck
officer” without a definition of the qualifications and
experience of a deck officer and a recognition of the importance of
being high up in the management tree of the
ship<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:09:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000298" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000298">My
noble friend mentioned junior ratings. With his knowledge and
experience, I am sure that he has a good point but I feel that
nowadays, and in line with the EU regulations that we talked about
earlier, it is important to have a definition of who can and cannot be
given a PEC as a deck officer. It is very easy to say that a competent
harbour authority will not give someone a PEC unless he is qualified,
but it is like so many of these things—on a good day, when
everything is going well, it will work out all right, but, sadly, we
have all had experience of when things do not go quite right 
<?notus-xml column=1823?>and sometimes a harbour authority is less competent than it might
be. Where two ports are sited reasonably close
together and are competing for trade, there must be a temptation for
one of them to offer a PEC to somebody on a particular shipping line if
that will attract the ship into that port and bring in probably much
needed revenue. I would like to try to persuade the Minister to be as
generous as he can in giving a tighter definition to the meaning of
“deck officer” as applied in this Bill. If it can be
related to the IMO deck officer that we discussed earlier, that would
tie everything together and would probably also reduce the number of
future court cases, which we all wish to
avoid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:11:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000299" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000299">I

what I have been told, Liverpool Pilots brings in for training master

told that they undergo six months’ intensive training and are
required to excel in local knowledge, as well as completing in excess
of 100 training trips and an examination to become a pilot of the
fourth class, giving them the authorisation to have the conduct of
vessels not exceeding 95 metres in length. The letter that I received

to what level of training and experience will be required for a

definition of “deck officer”. I appreciate that that deck
officer is not the same as an authorised pilot, but what I understand
to be the level of training and experience required of a pilot at
Liverpool would suggest that there has to be at least a considerable
period of training and experience before that deck officer is given the
pilotage exemption certificate. It would be very helpful if the
Minister could say something about that and about how, in particular,
the Government see the
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Pilotage Act, which refers to the exemption certificate, provides
that an examination for an exemption certificate must not be unduly
onerous—I do not know quite what that means—in relation
to the requirements of an authorised pilot. That sort of wording
indicates that the training and experience may well be significantly
less than that required for an authorised pilot. Perhaps the Minister
can comment on that and, once again, explain how the Government, who
are supporting the Bill, see its provisions working in relation to the
giving of a pilotage exemption certificate to a deck
officer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:18:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

suggestion that part of the case for putting forward this measure
related to giving deck officers more experience and developing their
skills. To an extent, one can see that that argument might be made.
However, certainly a view that has been expressed to me—I can
only put it across and invite the Minister to comment—is that
the PEC is an exemption granted to bona fide masters or mates of
regular vessels for commercial convenience in a compulsory port in
order that those vessels need not engage the services of an authorised
pilot. It is a local exemption, not a formal Merchant Navy
qualification, and has no bearing on a junior officer’s
promotion prospects. Indeed, some ports will grant exemptions without
even the formality of an examination. That rather calls into
question  the strength of the argument that this is needed as
part  
<?notus-xml column=1825?>of the development programme for more junior officers on vessels. Again,
it would be helpful if the Minister could respond on that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000307" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000307">At
Second Reading, the Minister was good enough to provide me with a
response about whether the changes proposed in the Bill will be to the
financial advantage of any groups of individuals, organisations or
companies. The Minister said that the impact assessment for the Bill
considered that there would be a small financial benefit to shipping
companies, achieved through more flexible crew rostering and the
possibility of reducing the cost of marine pilotage. I do not know
whether that reference to reducing the cost of marine pilotage would
have an impact on authorised pilots. The letter I have received does
not say that that is the case. However, the reference to there being a
small financial benefit to shipping companies does not quite tally with
some of the reasons that have been put forward to us about why the
shipping companies think it would be achieved through greater
flexibility over rostering, which would suggest that they might see a
significant financial advantage in having that greater flexibility. In
his reply, the Minister referred to the impact assessment for the Bill,
saying that there might be a small financial benefit. I am not sure
which camp the Minister is in on that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:21:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000308" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000308">At
Second Reading, I also raised the question of whether the competent
harbour authority would be able to insist on or provide for a limit on
the number of pilotage exemption certificates that it would give in
respect of officers on a particular vessel. The answer that I have
received is that a competent harbour authority would not be able to
insist on a limit. That raises the question, which I also put the
Minister last time, of whether there would be a requirement for someone
who had been granted an exemption certificate to exercise their
responsibilities in relation to piloting on a minimum number of
occasions. As I understand the answer I have received, once you have
the certificate, there will not be any requirement to carry out those
responsibilities on a minimum number of occasions. If I have understood
the Minister correctly—I am sure he will correct me if I have
not—it seems odd that any competent harbour authority would not
be able to insist on a limit. Clearly, if you have a number
of people on a vessel who have the certificate, then
presumably they would carry out that responsibility on fewer occasions.
Concern has been raised about the implication of this provision in the
Bill and the extent to which people will be experienced in the pilotage
role if they have the pilotage exemption certificate. Once again, it
would be extremely helpful if the Minister were able to give some
reassurance on that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:23:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000309" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000309">We
indicated our support for the Bill in the Commons and I recollect that
I reiterated that support when we discussed it at Second Reading.
However, as the Minister knows, we have concerns. They include the
experience of people who receive a pilotage exemption certificate and
their rank and status; the numbers of such certificates that might be
issued; and the frequency with which they might be required to carry
out their skills in order to ensure that that experience is retained.
On the assumption that the Minister will not support the withdrawal of
Clause 2, I hope that he will be able to

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley,
eloquently set out the concerns that he and maritime pilots have about
Clause 2 when he gave notice of his intention to oppose the Question
that the clause should stand part. I understand perfectly the desire to
ensure 
<?notus-xml column=1828?>that marine safety is promoted and that nothing is done to undermine it.
I believe that this desire is felt all around the Committee and across
the maritime industry. Therefore, I will try as hard as I can to meet
noble Lords’
concerns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000324" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000324">The
sole purpose of Clause 2 is to remove the limitation in the Pilotage
Act 1987 that restricts the issuing of pilotage exemption certificates
to the master or first mate of a ship, and instead to allow any deck
officer to apply for a certificate. It does not grant one; it merely
allows a deck officer to apply to the competent harbour authority for a
PEC. It changes none of the other provisions in the Act relating to the
demands made on an applicant for a certificate: namely,
that the applicant must be a bona fide deck officer of a ship.
The clause does not open up the possibility of unauthorised pilotage
services being established. I know that that is a concern of pilots and
of the noble
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:34:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000325" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000325">The
applicant must be a genuine member of the crew of the ship named on his
PEC. No doubt if the pilots in a harbour knew something was going wrong
in this regard, they would take it up with the competent harbour
authority. If the authority did not listen, they could take it up with
the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. If the agency did not listen, they
could take it up with the noble Lords, Lord Berkeley or Lord Rosser,
with me or with the shipping Minister. There are plenty of routes for
aggrieved people to take up this
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000326" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000326">Furthermore,
under the Bill, the competent harbour authority could immediately
revoke the PEC if it becomes aware of any problems. The competent
harbour authority must be satisfied that the applicant has the skill,
experience and local knowledge sufficient for them to be capable of
piloting the ship named on the certificate. The PEC applies only to one
ship and one
harbour.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:35:18"></hs_TimeCode> To my
mind, this is the crucial safeguard that restricts the issuing of a
certificate only to those mariners competent to use one. It is much
more relevant than a job title in determining whether someone can
safely navigate in specific
waters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000327" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000327">The
certificate applies to a specific harbour or part of a harbour as
appropriate. If anyone seeks to be certified elsewhere, they must
demonstrate their skill, experience and local knowledge for those
waters to the appropriate competent harbour authority. The competent
harbour authority may decide, in the interests of safety, to satisfy
itself that the applicant has a sufficient knowledge of the English
language. The competent harbour authority decides the method by which
it will satisfy itself of an applicant's qualifications, which may be
through examination or by reference to other requirements. The
certificate remains in force for no longer than one year and it can be
renewed only if the competent harbour authority remains satisfied about
the foregoing
points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:36:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000328" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000328">I

outlined what this clause does not change, I turn to what it would do.
The clause would permit a competent harbour authority to award a PEC to
any deck officer who meets the criteria that I have outlined. The
desire for making this change comes from the shipping industry, which
has identified a number of potential benefits to several factors,
including roll-on roll-off passenger ferries, small domestic ferries
and aggregate
dredgers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:37:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000330" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000330">The
clause would permit increased flexibility for shipping companies in the
rostering of deck officers, especially in the event of disruption and
staff sickness, which currently can be problematic. The additional
flexibility would also assist when supplementary or release sailings
are chartered, increasing the call on deck officers. Though a
comparatively small sector, the change would allow improved flexibility
for vessels such as dredgers to operate in piloted waters for extended
periods and mitigate the risk of fatigue for certificate holders on
these
ships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:38:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000331" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000331">The
industry also wants to respond to demographic trends affecting
certificated deck officers, which is a point made by the noble Lord,
Lord Greenway. A large proportion of officers are approaching
retirement within the next five years and the industry needs to train
younger officers to be capable of fulfilling senior roles in the near
future. Although it varies between competent harbour authorities,
qualification for a PEC may require around 10 to 18 berthing operations
to be conducted under the supervision of a pilot. This could reasonably
form part of the training for deck officers who have reached a suitable
stage in their career development, but who are not yet employed as a
master or first
mate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:39:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000332" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000332">On
the terminology of a deck officer, I want to be clear: we are not
talking about junior ratings. We are talking about those officers who
have navigational responsibilities. It usually takes between three and
four years to qualify as a junior deck officer, so potential applicants
will have experience at
sea<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>. Even then,
it is most likely that only the more senior deck officers will be able

Berkeley, suggested that there should be a stricter definition of
eligibility tied to definitions in the international standard of
training, certification and watchkeeping code. However, mariners on
domestic routes do not need to seek certification on this code. Such an
approach would be unduly restrictive and certainly tighter than current
arrangements. The national association for ports and shipping has
agreed that it is preferable to use the definition of “deck
officer” in this clause and provide guidance to the competent
harbour authorities on the attributes and skills that might be sought
in the Port Marine 
<?notus-xml column=1830?>Safety Code’s guide to good practice. The guide already
recommends that a competent harbour authority should seek a certificate
of competence from applicants. The Port Marine Safety Code steering
group, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, composed of
representatives from industry, trade unions, the pilots’
associations, the Government and other maritime experts, has agreed to
establish a subgroup to consider and recommend any enhancements
required for the

noble Lord, Lord Rosser, who said that the regulations should not be
unduly onerous. It is important to remember that a PEC can be limited
to a specific ship and a specific harbour, or even a specific portion
of a harbour. The noble Lord asked about training and talked about the
Port of Liverpool. The Committee will understand that the Port of
Liverpool is a very complicated port with all sorts of difficulties. It
is not surprising, therefore, that the training requirements to be a
pilot for the Port of Liverpool are extensive. However, smaller ports
will need less training. It is for the competent harbour authorities to
determine what is required, as they do now. There is no change in the
training requirements, only a proposal to change the eligibility, and
training for a PEC will be similar to that for a
pilot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:43:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the number of PEC holders that can be on a ship, which is a good
point. He suggested that there could be numerous PEC holders on a ship,
but that they would not have sufficient experience. It is not clear to
me why a shipping company would want to incur the cost of PEC training
and go to the effort of training officers if there was insufficient
opportunity for them to exercise the certificate. Furthermore, if the
competent harbour authorities believe that a PEC holder was a bit rusty
and did not 
<?notus-xml column=1831?>have enough experience, they may pay greater attention to the
reassessment process. There will always be the alternative for a master
to take on board a maritime pilot if circumstances mean that none of
the PEC holders on the ship are available to pilot it because of hours
worked or if the structure of the crew does not permit it. If a
suitably qualified person is available, there is no justifiable reason
to prevent them from holding a PEC and piloting the ship simply because
they do not have the right job

articulated in the debate in the other place, under Clause 5 of the
Bill an unelected “designated harbour authority” would
have greater power to create new criminal offences than a
democratically elected local authority. Secondly, harbour authorities
are generally not well placed or adequately resourced to create new
criminal offences, and the proposed power to create 
<?notus-xml column=1833?>new criminal offences contains none of the supervisory safeguards
usually imposed in relation to lawmaking bodies in a democratic
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000349" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000349">It is
a key principle of the Government’s localism policy that power
should be placed back in the hands of individuals, communities and
councils, and where such power is to be exercised by local institutions
such institutions should be subject to the democratic checks and
balances enabled by full transparency. However, many harbour
authorities are not democratically accountable and are not subject to
the Freedom of Information Act 2000. It would run counter to basic
democratic principles and the Government’s own localism policy
to grant an unelected designated harbour authority lawmaking powers
that are not subject to democratic checks and balances and full
transparency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020135000350" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-0002.htm#13020135000350">Shortly
after tabling this amendment, I learnt of the discussions that took
place no later than yesterday on the whole question of a code of
conduct on harbour directions. That discussion was greatly welcomed by
those who were telling me of their concerns, and the RYA would like it
placed on the record that it felt this had moved the whole problem a
long way. On behalf of the RYA, I pay a very warm tribute to the two
Ministers involved for the way in which they facilitated that

amendment, I still have to ask certain questions regarding the code of
conduct. First, are the Government prepared to implement this code of
conduct and to make provision for it in ways that can be seen, heard
and recognised across the marine industry as constituting acceptance by
the Government? Those who attended the discussions to which I have
referred welcomed the attendance of representatives of the department,
but they seek an assurance on the record—and what I do with my
amendment will be dependent on the answers that the Minister may be
able to give me—that the Government are concerned to implement
the code of conduct to which I have

if the code of conduct is in existence and there is general agreement
on how it should be implemented, which is the reason for my first
question to the Minister on whether that assurance can be given, what
consequences does he envisage there being for any denial of that code
of conduct, disobedience to it or even neglect of what it says? Does he
see this as something that in the sense of what I referred to earlier
might open the door to vast legal consequences? Will this code of
conduct that was produced yesterday be sufficiently strong in the eyes
of the Government to be implemented in terms that the courts can
recognise and accept? In my experience of public life, I have often
seen codes of conduct produced, not least on how we operate our work as
this House, but it is one thing to have a code of conduct that people
can feel warm about but quite another if that code of conduct is not
given the wings of legal

shall probably have some more probes later. I have a copy of the code
of conduct, which, as he said, was agreed yesterday lunchtime. That
probably shows, but at least I understand that it has been agreed. It
is unclear to me who makes the order designating a harbour authority as
having the powers for general direction. Is it the Department for
Transport? From reading the code of conduct, it seems to me as if the
harbour authority makes its own designation, which I am sure is not
right. It does not sound right anyway. I believe that the designation
is under Section 40 of the Harbours Act, but what criteria will the
Department for Transport, which I presume it will be, look at when
deciding whether an applicant is a fit and proper organisation for
having harbour direction

of conduct and probably of Clause 5 is to enable harbours to be able to
make directions without having to wait sometimes several years for the
Department for Transport to approve them. I hope that the department,
if it is to be the approving body under the new arrangements, will be a
lot quicker than that. How long will it be and, as the noble and right
reverend Lord asked, what enforcement will there be if things go wrong?

the proposal for a Council decision on ratification of the 1997
protocol amending the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear
Damage of 21 May 1963 (the Vienna Convention). The proposal meets the
criteria set out in the coalition agreement with regard to EU justice
and home affairs measures. In particular, the Government consider that
it is in the UK’s interest to opt into the proposal because it
will be of general benefit to EU citizens but it will not create any
obligations in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020134000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-wms0001.htm#13020134000005">The
proposed decision authorises member states which are contracting
parties to the Vienna Convention to ratify the protocol of 12 September
1997 amending the Vienna Convention in the interest of the European
Union, or to accede to it. The Vienna Convention was established to
ensure fair and adequate compensation is available in the event of a
nuclear accident. The protocol amendments will be beneficial to
potential victims of nuclear accidents for which nuclear operators in
states that are contracting parties to the Vienna Convention are
responsible. In particular, they mean that an increased amount of
compensation will be available in respect of a broader range of damage
across a wider geographical
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020134000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130201-wms0001.htm#13020134000006">The
proposal will only apply to member states that are party to the Vienna
Convention ie Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,
Lithuania, Slovakia and Poland (Latvia and Romania have already
ratified the 1997 protocol). The proposal will not apply to the UK
which is party to another international convention on liability for
nuclear damage—the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in
the Field of Nuclear Energy of 29 July 1960 as amended—which is
based on similar principles to the Vienna
