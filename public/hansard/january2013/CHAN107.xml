in an answer to me earlier this month, still intend to go ahead with

far too many people, the housing market is not working. Not enough
homes are being built at a price that is within reach in many areas of
the UK, particularly in London. The drastic cut in the budget for new
affordable homes has unsurprisingly led to a considerable fall in the
amount of new social housing. My right hon. and hon. Friends have set
out a series of initiatives to build 100,000 more affordable homes,
which I strongly support, but even if the Chancellor were to start
listening and house building and construction were to begin to return
to good health, it is questionable whether sufficient homes would
become available to challenge the shortage of supply in key parts of
the country at a price that more people can

is in danger of having a housing market that has priced out those who
live and work in our city. It is already virtually impossible to
envisage that someone on average earnings could afford to buy a
property within the Circle line area and to live in it. In Westminster,
average earnings were almost £43,000 last year, while average
house prices pushed close to £800,000—a ratio of price to
earnings of 18:1. The suburbs of London are heading in the same
direction as house prices continue to creep up. In Harrow, where my
constituency is, average earnings last year were £30,000, while
the average house price was £309,000—10 times average

no set income is required to secure a 90% mortgage on an average
property, the scale of difficulty facing people in the suburbs and
inner London when trying to buy a property is revealed by the
rough-and-ready guide offered by online mortgage calculations, which
suggest that an individual income of around £80,000 or joint
income of around £90,000 would be required to secure a mortgage
of £280,000. That is a challenge for many families, to put it
mildly, particularly in
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T12:42:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0001.htm#13013066000211">This
Bill would give urban local authorities the opportunity to create a
more affordable market in the sale of former social housing by
extending the use of local occupancy clauses, which were allowed under
the original right-to-buy legislation. Under the original rules, local
authorities in areas of outstanding natural beauty were allowed to
include a covenant limiting the freedom of the tenant to sell on
property that they purchased to people living or working in the area,
so creating a second tier to the housing market in those areas that
allows more affordable house sales and helps to ensure local people
have the opportunity to get on to the property ladder at an
affordable price in the area in which they 
<?notus-xml column=911?>have strong local connections. My Bill seeks to extend that exemption to
other areas of the country where the huge rise in house prices has made
a house purchase extremely
costly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T12:43:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0001.htm#13013066000212">Surely,
helping local people who are not rich, who have lived and/or worked in
an area for a considerable period and who are an integral part of their
community to afford to buy by allowing local authorities to designate
sales of former social housing to be just for local people was a
sensible measure in the 1980s for those living in national parks and
would be again now for many other areas of the country, particularly
London. It does not alter the fundamental principle of the right to
buy, which I have always supported, but it recognises the reality of
the difficulties that too many people face in wanting to buy a home.
Estate agents in national parks, where the exemption operates, are
clear that it makes a significant difference to the price of some
ex-local authority housing of between 5% and, in some cases,
30%—and typically between 10% and 20%. To qualify to buy such
properties one has to have lived or worked or done both in the area for
three years prior to
purchase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T12:34:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0001.htm#13013066000213">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T12:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>
exemption makes the price more affordable and essentially restricts the
sale of some homes to people on lower incomes and those who have strong
ties to an area. My Bill would increase the restriction to help more
explicitly those who have a long-standing connection to the community
that they live in. Clearly, such a change would need to be
phased in, as new tenants move into new social housing and consider
whether they want to buy the
property<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T12:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0001.htm#13013066000214">The
second part of the Bill deals with co-op housing, for too long the
forgotten part of the housing sector. It makes up only 0.6% of the
UK’s housing supply, compared with 18% in Sweden, 15% in Norway
and 6% in Germany. Tenant-run co-op housing has especially good
satisfaction rates, but co-op housing also offers additional options
for those who are working, who want to get on to the property ladder
and who cannot completely afford to buy their new dream home. My Bill
would require local authorities to promote co-op housing
options<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T12:45:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

requires Government to consider afresh the problem of land banking by
housing developers, where land is deliberately not developed, often
because the developer is waiting for prices to rise. That slows the
supply of affordable housing, and the undeveloped sites are often a
considerable blight on local communities. If a developer does not want
to develop the land, there are few incentives to change its mind, which
in turn exacerbates the shortage of affordable homes and affects the
amenity for local
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0001.htm#13013066000216">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T12:49:31"></hs_TimeCode>

on banking union, we understood from the start the case for a single
supervisory mechanism for the eurozone. We were clear that that we
would not participate in it—and we are not participating. We
suggested that the European Central Bank would be the best institution
to take on this role—and it is taking it on. Crucially, we 
<?notus-xml column=917?>said we wanted safeguards for the single market—and we got them.
The outcome of those negotiations was of fundamental
importance, and it is proof that fair arrangements between eurozone and
non-eurozone members can be achieved. That is a good precedent for the
future, and it is something of a contrast with previous
negotiations when the previous Government gave up £7

alone: the Dutch, the Swedes, the Danes, the Finns and the Germans were
all in the same position. We have established a group of 12 like-minded
member states to push for urgent action on EU growth, and we have
expanded that alliance, which advocates completion of the single market

Friend for giving way. For many years, successive Governments have been
bedevilled by the perception in many other member states that Britain
is not completely comfortable within the European Union, which may or
may not be true. He referred earlier to the importance of working with
like-minded member states to get the successes that he has rightly
listed. Is it not hugely important that this debate is couched in terms
of finding a better way for Europe and Britain showing leadership in
Europe, which has been lacking for many years, and that it is not
presented as a cloak for disengagement from Europe, which some people

economics, senior British figures, including Sir Richard

Foreign Secretary did his very best to use the expertly drawn-up brief

endorse the Prime Minister’s approach last week, but he was
careful to give a series of quotes that endorsed a process of
reform—not a single quote welcomed the prospect of a referendum,

at risk. The Foreign Secretary does not need to take my word for that.

threaten growth. Why would a referendum on Europe, affecting an export
market worth £9 billion, cause instability and threaten growth,
but a referendum affecting an export market worth £45 billion
not be a cause of instability? I have to say that when I heard the
Deputy First Minister speak, I thought irony had left the

Foreign Secretary had his fun today on the matter of clarity, but
within moments of the Prime Minister ending his speech it emerged that
he could not tell the country how he will vote in his anticipated
referendum. He cannot tell us what people will be choosing to stay in
or to stay out. Crucially—this reflects the point I have just
answered—he cannot tell investors whether the United Kingdom
will be part of the world’s largest single market in four
years’ time. I am sure that even the Government Front-Bench team
would accept that in any negotiation, European or otherwise, there has
to be give and take. However, the Foreign Secretary cannot or will not
tell us whether his party would advocate a yes vote or a no vote at the
time of any potential in/out referendum if they had secured only 50% of
the negotiating objectives—or indeed 60%, 70%, or perhaps even
80%. That is partly because we do 
<?notus-xml column=932?>not know what the negotiating objectives are, and partly because the

approach. We do not support the idea, when we have seen a 0.3%
shrinkage in the British economy in the last quarter, that now is the
time to call for an in/out referendum. We listen to the voices of
businesses in communities across the country. If the hon. Gentleman
suggests that economic stability should not be the priority, I fear
that he falls into exactly the area that the Prime Minister used to
define his leadership by opposing. Does anyone remember the days when
the Prime Minister talked about modernisation? He used to say that the
Tories were going to have a different approach to the health service,
and then they delivered the biggest reorganisation that the NHS has
ever seen—one that the chief executive said could be seen from
space. Does anyone remember the time when the Prime Minister said,
“We’re going to be a different kind of Conservative
party. We’re not going to be the nasty party anymore.
We’re all in this together”? Then they delivered a
millionaires’ top-rate tax cut. Does anyone remember the time
when the Prime Minister said, “We’re going to stop
banging on about Europe.” Well, that is exactly what
we have now from those on the Government

However, he is giving us the clear impression that he will accept that

that, yes, we want that change, and we want to direct and be involved
in negotiating that change, but that we cannot at this stage say that
we will accept the results of that change whatever it may be. If he
wants to stop uncertainty, surely he should be making it clear that
either the Labour party will accept the evolution of change regardless
of what it throws up in the next few years and that we will still be in
the EU whatever it may be, or that there may be a stage where he has to

Frankly, it set out far more details of specific changes that we would

manage in his speech. We do not suggest that the status quo is what we
will or should advocate. We want to see change in Europe. We also
recognise that change is coming to Europe. However, there is a

course there are differences between our parties’ approaches on
what those changes should include. My judgment is that the reason the
Prime Minister was unable last week to set out the changes he wanted to
see, beyond the change in working hours for junior doctors, was that
the brittle façade of unity to which he is aspiring will
crack—indeed, will disintegrate—as soon as he starts to
get into the specifics, whether on employment law, social policy,
fisheries policy, or a wide range of other issues. I commend the speech
I gave, because it details changes in policy. We want to see Europe
moving towards growth, and specific policies within the Commission to
advance growth, rather than the approach taken in recent years. We see
some institutional changes that are required. Of course there are other
areas that we will look at, and they are set out in the speech. It is a
matter of regret, however, that the Prime Minister felt unable even to
match the shadow Foreign Secretary in the level of detail he could
provide in his much-trailed speech last
week.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000419" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0002.htm#13013066000419">One
other point on which there was only obscurity last week was that of
timing. The Prime Minister seemed unable to be clear on the most basic
issue, because it remains uncertain whether treaty change will
even happen on the time scale he suggested. At present, no
intergovernmental conference is planned for 2015 and most EU
Governments now claim there is no need for a big treaty revision for
years to come. The only certainty, therefore, is of more uncertainty
delivered by the Prime Minister.</hs_Para>

the Prime Minister’s speech and the Foreign Secretary’s
speech today, we have been left with a commitment to an in/out
referendum on a repatriation agenda that is unknown, within a time
frame that is uncertain and towards an end goal that remains wholly 
<?notus-xml column=934?>undefined. In the debate in the House in 2011—when, incidentally,
the Foreign Secretary voted alongside me in the Division
Lobby—we argued that to announce an in/out referendum in these
circumstances would not serve Britain’s national interest. Our
position remains: reform of Europe, not exit from Europe.</hs_Para>

recognises, as I have sought to suggest, that the need for EU reform
did not begin with the eurozone crisis, which is why our agenda for
change must address the need for institutional, as well as policy,
reform. That means tackling issues such as how to give national
Parliaments more of a say over the making of EU legislation and
delivering credible proposals for reform of the free movement directive
and family-related entitlements at EU level.</hs_Para>

immediate focus, however, must be on changes that promote and create
jobs and growth. That is why we have consistently called not just for
restraint, but for reform of the EU budget. The budget might be only 1%
of GDP, but it could be better used, with a greater focus on securing
growth and continued reform of the CAP. Alongside reform of the budget,
we have argued for a new position of EU growth commissioner and a new
mechanism better to assess the impact of every new piece of EU
legislation to promote growth across the
EU.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000423" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0002.htm#13013066000423">Protections
for the single market and revival of the prospects for growth should be
Europe’s priority for change, but to support and defend the
single market—this was the point I was alluding to
earlier—we must first understand how the market works. The
internal market involves more than simply the absence of tariffs and
trade quotas at the border. Common regulatory standards covering issues
such as consumer rights, environmental standards and health and safety
rules are not simply additions to the workings of the single market,
but the basis on which it is
built.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000424" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0002.htm#13013066000424">That
means that a credible growth strategy for the UK as part of the EU
cannot, and should not, be pursued on the basis of cheap labour, poor
labour standards, poor safety standards and environmentally shoddy
goods. If European partners, such as the Germans and the Dutch, can
compete in global markets with high European standards, why do some
Government Members claim that Britain cannot do so? The Opposition
understand that the real agenda on certain Government Benches is not
only to bring powers back, but to take rights away.</hs_Para>

every aspect of the working time directive. Perhaps the Foreign

and secondly the changes we can envisage to the eurozone in particular
do not involve significant additional transfers of powers from the UK
to the EU. Indeed, as we heard at length from the Foreign

it would trigger the referendum lock legislated for in this Parliament.
I hope that that offers some comfort to the right hon. Gentleman that,
in any circumstances, if there were a significant transfer of power,
the referendum lock would be considered. Frankly, however, it is far

whether we could strengthen the yellow card procedure with a red card

than economics and labour markets. Fundamentally, it is about the kind
of country we are and the kind we aspire to be. In a century that many
have taken to calling the Asian century, the Labour party is clear that
the case for EU membership remains strong. Indeed, if the mechanisms

trade. We have discussed today the EU free trade agreement. Is it not
ironic that the Prime Minister’s No. 1 ambition for his
presidency of the G8 this year is an EU-US free trade area? What could

or even of party ideology; it is a matter of simple arithmetic. In an
age when countries are the size of continents, our membership gives us
access to, and influence over, the world’s biggest trading bloc,
prising open new frontiers that would otherwise be unreachable to the
UK. In an age of common threats that permeate national borders,

the past 50 years, Britain’s foreign policy has

powerful partnership with the US. Let us be honest: both
those foundations are at risk, with a US Administration increasingly
pivoting towards Asia and an EU in which the UK could potentially
marginalise its future role. It is a time when Britain must navigate a
careful course, and the priority must be to make Britain a leading
force within Europe as part of an increasingly multi-polar world.

focusing on a future agenda for Europe, the Prime Minister has sadly

Ireland than to Brazil, Russia, India and China put together. Global
success is to be found in single markets. Let us look at the economies

want to focus on the important impact that the European Union has on
growth, investment and jobs in the north-east of England and my
constituency of Sunderland Central. I was extremely concerned last week
to hear the Prime Minister stating his support for an in/out referendum
on our membership of the European Union. His announcement weakens our
negotiating position and creates uncertainty in the markets and in
industry, which will impede investment and thus jobs and growth. The
timing of his announcement could not be worse. Last month in my
constituency there were just under 4,000 people unemployed, 34% of whom
had been unemployed for over 12 months. As the threat of a triple-dip
recession looms large over our country, the Government’s
priority should be ensuring stability, investment and
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000464" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0002.htm#13013066000464"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T14:19:39"></hs_TimeCode>This

another four are employed throughout the UK. The Sunderland plant is
the company’s most productive factory in Europe. Nissan has
invested a huge amount in Sunderland: some £3.6 billion since

those jobs would disappear overnight if Britain withdrew

William Cash</B> (Stone) (Con):</Member> The ultimate question that
lies at the heart of the five principles that the Prime Minister set
out in his speech is about our democracy, 
<?notus-xml column=941?>because everything ultimately depends on the fact
that we agreed, in the European Communities Act 1972, on a voluntary
basis, to accept the legislation that came out of the Council of
Ministers when it made decisions. Those decisions are increasingly made
by qualified majority vote now.</hs_Para>

1971 White Paper—the basis on which the legislation went
through, albeit by only six votes—categorically stated that
there would be no erosion of British sovereignty in this House, and
that it was vital that we retained the veto, not only in our national
interest but in the interests of the European Community as a whole.
That remains fundamental because, in a democratic nation faced with the
pressures for federalism that people are seeking to impose from
outside, it has to be right that the Prime Minister has taken the
decision to challenge the nature of the structure of the European
Union. He went to the heart of the issue when he rejected the notion of
ever-closer union, and I commend him for that.
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>I also believe
profoundly that we must bring this programme forward rather than
waiting until 2017. For reasons of uncertainty, of practicality and of

will add another point. The recent analysis by VoteWatch Europe, which
has been through every decision taken by the Council of Ministers in
the past three years, demonstrates that in 91.7% of votes taken in that
forum, the UK Government—under the aegis of UKRep and through
the Council of Ministers itself—have voted in favour of the
proposals in question. That is effectively a forced consensus, because
we have only 8% of the votes in the Council of Ministers. When
I hear Ministers and others talking about the degree of influence that
we exercise in relation to qualified majority 
<?notus-xml column=942?>voting, I say yes, we have to have alliances, but we know that if others
are not going to be in alliance with us, we will not get the kind of
result that the British people deserve.</hs_Para>

this is about one fundamental question. It is not about just the word
“democracy”; it is about democracy in action and its

that when someone goes into the ballot station, votes in secret and
casts his or her vote based on a manifesto in which they are told what
the party in question is offering them in a general election, that is
what democracy is all about. When they cast their vote, they expect the

Cash:</Member></B> I am grateful for that intervention for a very good
reason. One of the reasons why I believe it is right for the Prime
Minister to insist on the “in or out” question is that
now, after all the agonising over all these years—including the
Maastricht rebellion, for example, which I was able to participate in
and lead at the time—all these things have culminated in
this referendum. We have fought for a referendum. Precisely because the
question is “in or out?”, it raises the question of the
European Communities Act 1972 and whether the British people, having
voted in the ballot box, should be expected to receive legislation that
comes automatically into law when they might not in fact agree with it.
That is the problem: that is why I believe we must have the right
question, but it must also be at the right time. As far as I am
concerned, if that democratic principle is not upheld, I will vote to
come out, because the democratic principle is the fundamental issue for
the British people, many of whom fought and died for this

the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin) and I wrote a

the Member for Croydon South said, “one size fits all”
does not work. We must have an association of nation states. I
appreciate that that challenges the centralisation that has gone on for
so long in Europe, and I appreciate that it challenges the
democratic deficit. I appreciate, too, if I may say so, that
this would increase trade, increase opportunities and help to
liberalise the rest of the world in the global marketplace. All these

free trade agreement that we negotiated has already increased our trade

Europe: full sovereignty must lie with the United Kingdom. That would

constituents. I know that the Prime Minister will keep his promise on a
referendum. If renegotiation does not mean that sovereignty will be
returned to Britain’s shores—I am sorry, to the United

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:12:49"></hs_TimeCode> driving
forces of anti-Europeanism are fear and pessimism—fear of
meeting the challenges of the 21st century and pessimism about our
country’s role in the world. Many Eurosceptics would like us to
believe that they are patriots, but their actions tell a different
story and show a deep belief that Britain’s future is inevitably
one of decline, lowered ambitions and a downgrading of our role in the
world. I do not think, based on the same evidence as that used by the 
<?notus-xml column=957?>hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr Turner), that
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:13:23"></hs_TimeCode>most British

Eurosceptics talk of being free from the drag of co-operation, from
shared obligations and from any common purpose, and when they talk
about Britain going it alone, they think that that is a proud statement
of intent. It is not. It is an admission that they have lost faith in
the future of our country. Those who say, “Go it alone”
do not believe that we can succeed, as any modern nation must, in
collaboration with others. They think that if Britain tries to work
with others we must inevitably be losers—that it will always be
them bossing us, rather than us influencing
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:14:13"></hs_TimeCode>. The debate

Eurosceptics and the neurosceptics have made the Conservative party
ungovernable. The Prime Minister, who lacks the will, ability or
interest to lead his party, was forced into last week’s speech.
That pessimism is in their language. Historians will surely puzzle over
how the party of Winston Churchill—indeed, that of Margaret
Thatcher—became the party that sees Britain’s future in
Norway and Switzerland and about how a country with all our history,
all the capabilities of our people and, notwithstanding our current
difficulties, all our strengths should consider countries a 10th our
size and with little of our influence as role
models<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:17:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000603" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0002.htm#13013066000603">The
pessimism is there in the Eurosceptics’ policy and in the call
to withdraw from most of the provisions of the social chapter. They
will say that it is about sovereignty, but it reflects a deeper belief
that the creation of wealth is incompatible with ensuring that wealth
is fairly shared among all the people who help to create it. They want
us to turn our back on a broadly shared European value that we helped
to create, which is that economic growth and social justice can go hand
in hand. That is what leads neurosceptics like the Mayor of London to
speak against serious banking reform, despite the damage done to the

debate is often clouded by concerns, sometimes quite legitimate, about
this regulation or that regulatory threat, but those concerns are the
cover for a much bigger and more pessimistic view of Britain’s

sharing of wealth, on decent protection at work from exploitation and
danger and on the shared obligation to protect our environment, which
the Prime Minister attacked last week. That is the pessimist vision: a
Britain that can compete only by offering ourselves to the worst
regulated, most unstable and least committed global economic forces.

influence with the USA or with China and the rest of the BRICs than as
an influential part of the EU; or that our constituents would be safer

smugglers, the weapons dealers, the terrorists and the paedophiles will
think, “Oh, Britain’s leaving the EU. We won’t go

many friends in Europe. Had he come to the House and said,
“Let’s change the state aid rules so that countries that
want to develop an active industrial policy can do so within the single

friends in Europe. Had he said, “Let’s change the rules
on the movement of people so that benefits are only for those who have

British people voted to stay in the European Economic Community in
1975, it was for real world reasons—for jobs, for growth and for
the common market—and at that time the EEC gave every impression
that that was its purpose. The EU needs to give us and our constituents

by debt—I remind the House that as a whole, Europe currently
owes €10.9 trillion—and it has high rates of
unemployment, with the EU average currently running at 10.7%. That is
unsustainable. Furthermore, politically we are seeing that the federal
model of ever-closer union is simply not capable of accommodating the
needs of the eurozone as well as those of us who

It is a long list, and the big leader is Germany. On the right is a
list of the 10 nations outside the eurozone, and if Norway, Switzerland

that the European Union is not always—and of late has
increasingly not been—supportive of our, or its, ability to
unlock that strength. In particular, it has begun to develop a series
of policies and directives on genetic modification that are holding
back this country’s leadership. Global food demand is set to
increase by 70% in the next 30 years, 29 countries are growing GM

of that sclerotic decision making in the EU happens because of
unanimity rules. Can we therefore take it that the Prime Minister has
called for more qualified majority voting? Conservative Back Benchers
are shaking their heads, but Ministers cannot tell us the answer,

the Prime Minister questioned whether we can justify an ever-larger
Commission, but the Commission gets larger because of EU enlargement
and the accession of more member states. If the Prime Minister does not
wish the Commission to become larger, the long-standing policy of
successive Governments for further European enlargement has presumably
been ditched. Alternatively, is the Prime Minister arguing that there
should be a limit on the number of commissioners and saying that there
might be future circumstances in which there is no British
commissioner? We do not know the answer to that question because,

is clear that instead of addressing the economic crisis that confronts
the whole of this continent, and the wrong, misguided austerity
economics that is creating tens of millions of unemployed people and
the immiseration of millions in many European countries, we in this
country are now going to have an obsession with the minutiae of a
probably unrealisable renegotiation about unrealisable repatriation
powers. We need Ministers to go to Brussels and argue, in all the
forums of the European Union, for different economic policies. In the
meantime, we need Ministers to bring in different domestic economic
policies to again achieve growth, prosperity and jobs in this

economic policies we are pursuing here are potentially leading, as we
now know, to a triple-dip recession. We have a massive trade imbalance
with the European Union, which is partly due to the failures of our
domestic policy, but is being compounded by the wrong economic policies
being pursued by the austerity programme within the eurozone. As a
result, the Government’s British economic
strategy—export-led growth to get us out of the situation we are
in, presumably capitalising on the benefits of the devaluation of the
pound that has been going on for some months—is not getting us
the growth we need, partly due to domestic reasons and partly due to
problems in the eurozone economy. There is a very good paper by Simon
Tilford from the Centre for European Reform—I do not have time
to quote it, but I recommend that hon. Members read it—about the
problems confronting our country partly because of the wrong policies
within the EU’s economies.</hs_Para>

Dromey</B> (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab):</Member> In the 1970s I was
chairman of the north-west London “Get Britain Out”
campaign. I remember chairing a rally addressed on the one hand by
local Labour MPs and Ken Gill, the general secretary of TASS—the
Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Section—and a leading
member of the Communist party on the party, and Enoch Powell on the
other. I believed that position in good faith and I worked hard for it.
I was disappointed by the outcome, but I soon came to recognise that I
was wrong, just as I came to recognise that continuing to fight
yesterday’s battles was wrong. We took a long time in the Labour
party to recognise that. Indeed, when Labour members first went into
the European Parliament, the Spanish socialists nicknamed them
“Los Japonistos”, after the soldiers who emerged from the
jungles in Guam 40 years after the war was over asking, “Is the
war continuing?”</hs_Para>

did I change my mind? I remember an excellent German-Jewish friend who
had lost his family in the camps saying to me, “Jack, I’m
not the greatest fan of the common market,” as it then was,
“but we’ve had a continent at peace for a generation,
unlike that which took my family from me.” I remember a very
honourable Macmillanite Conservative in the 1980s—in the days
when there were such people, before, in the immortal words of Julian
Critchley, the “garagistes” took over the Conservative
party—saying, “Jack, I’m proud of my country, but
we can only be strong in a modern, bi-polar world,” as it was
then, “if we are at the heart of the European Union, with its
great traditions of Christian democracy and social
democracy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:08:39"></hs_TimeCode>.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000696" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000696">The
reason I changed my mind was also, yes, the rolling forward of the
social dimension in the 1980s, when Jacques Delors—Frère
Jacques, as we came to call him—came to address the TUC.
However, it was also because of my experience in the real world of
work, dealing with hard-headed business people—enlightened in
their approach—who rightly argued that we needed a single market
with common standards, at the heart of which was a social dimension
that reflected a belief in the simple truth that how we treat workers
is crucial to the quality of the service they provide and what they
produce.</hs_Para>

the argument that I have just deployed, I remember the chairman of the

market, but 
<?notus-xml column=972?>that as a company and as a continent we could not succeed in the world
on the basis of a race to the bottom.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:10:03"></hs_TimeCode> brings me
to my first concern, which is the hidden agenda that lies behind the
Prime Minister’s argument. There was a tantalising glimpse of
that last week when, extraordinarily, he seemed to suggest that we
should return to the days when a junior doctor could work 100 hours a
week. Repatriation is the cry, but the reality behind that is rolling
back a generation of progress on workers’ rights and taking us
back to the 1980s, an era I remember well.</hs_Para>

me give the House an example, which relates to the acquired rights
directive. The directive was legislated on at European Union level in
1978, and introduced here, reluctantly, by a Conservative Government in
1982. However, that Government did not extend it to cover 6 million
public servants. What we saw was the most appalling Dutch auction,
involving cut-throat competition as workers were transferred and
suffered cuts to their pay, their holiday entitlement, their sickness
entitlement and, often, their pension arrangements as well. I remember
a particular example that I dealt with early on involving the
Moreton-in-Marsh fire service training college, where 130 women
caterers and housekeepers had seen dramatic cuts to their terms and
conditions of employment. The only humorous side to that otherwise sad
story was the fact that the managing director of the company
concerned—Grand Metropolitan catering—was none other than
a Mr Dick Turpin.</hs_Para>

things happened at that time. First, in 1991, I took the case of the
Eastbourne dustmen to the European Court of Justice, and we won. It was
ruled that the British Government had acted unlawfully in denying
protection on transfer from the public to the private sector. Secondly,
employers themselves began to speak out. I remember Martin
O’Halloran, the then chair of the CBI, saying that it was
madness—that employers did not want a market based on a race to
the bottom, and that they wanted a market in which we competed on
quality and productivity, characterised by fair treatment and fair
competition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:12:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

five years’ time, for exactly the reason that 82% of the cars
that we produce in this country, through our world-class success story
that is automotive, are exported—and half to the European Union.
Key to the future of the industry is inward investment, and key to
inward investment is continuing membership of the European Union. There
is already a chorus of concern from Ford and BMW, for example, about
the grave consequences of prolonged uncertainty, while the director
general of the Engineering Employers Federation has said that this is
the worst possible way to go about negotiations, as it will weaken any
negotiating leverage we need rather than strengthen it.</hs_Para>

going to do about the Council of Ministers? It needs to be more
transparent, and it needs to have more capacity. I think that we can
provide the answer to the democratic deficit in two ways. First, this
Parliament and the Parliaments of the other member states must become
more interactive, engaging in the kind of discussions that take place
in the Council. We need to hear more about the agenda, we need to hear
more about what is actually said and done, and we need to hear more
about how we as parliamentarians can influence all that through our own
national Parliaments. The second way in which that can be beneficial is
in challenging the effective supremacy of the Commission in ensuring
that treaties work as they should, which drives a hole into the
argument about the European Parliament’s position that I have
heard mentioned several times in the debate today.</hs_Para>

through the ones that I have mentioned. First, we need to act

which we should now be insisting. Secondly, we need to extend the
single market to energy—although not just to energy: I could

I want to talk about President Obama. It is true that he said we should
remain in the EU, but he is not the only American President to have
said that: every single one has since Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s.
It is a consistent message, therefore, and we should listen to it, but
the clear message we are getting from our electorate is this:
“Make a difference in Europe. Reform it where necessary. Make it
more flexible. Make it more competitive. Make it more useful to us, and
make it less intrusive.”

Reynolds</B> (Stalybridge and Hyde) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> The subject
of this debate belongs in the same broad historical category as some of
the great political causes the House has dealt with, including the
repeal of the corn laws and imperial preference. These issues are also
connected to the dry matters of tariffs and trade, but they, too, are
really about Britain’s role in the rest of the world. We all
have emotional views about what our country is and what it could be,
and where we sit in relation to our neighbours. If we look back to the
1970s, we see that the case for our going in was framed predominantly
in emotional, rather than rational, terms. It was about Europe coming
together, an end to continental war and Britain giving up its empire
but obtaining a role in Europe. Even the well-regarded Chancellor Roy
Jenkins framed the case in those terms, rather than by reference to
economic or trading
arguments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:26:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000736" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000736">Intriguingly,
however, the roles have now been reversed. The case for coming out is
now the emotional one; it is based on the notion that we can be free of
the shackles of an imaginary tyrannical European bureaucracy, even when
all the rational, objective arguments push any pragmatist to the view
that staying in the EU is both an advantage and a necessity. That
should serve as a lesson to all Members on both sides of the House who
are in favour of retaining our EU membership, because there is

should therefore be used to seeing the tension between rational,
objective economic arguments and an instinctive, emotional view
that people want to hold about the future role of their country in the
wider world. However, given the current state of the UK
economy and what we all see and hear in our constituencies on Fridays

squeezed living standards—the only points that should matter to
us are those rational, objective, economic arguments and, more than

me, the case for being in the EU is extremely clear. There are huge
economic advantages to being in a single European market. A single
market is not a free trade area; they are different things. A single
market requires the co-ordination of certain domestic policies to
ensure that that market is a level playing field. Although some
understandably feel that this constrains national sovereignty, we must
remember that we are now part of a global economy that already puts
huge constraints on national sovereignty.</hs_Para>

people were arguing for a siege economy today, it would be taken even
less seriously than previously, because, frankly, it would be
impossible. Moreover, being a member of the single market does not
inhibit our trading relationships with other countries; instead, it
allows us to negotiate trade deals as part of a powerful bloc of
nations and serves to attract investment into the UK from countries
that want to be inside the EU.</hs_Para>

Eurosceptic argument that we frequently hear—we have heard it a
lot today—is that we could be a Norway or a Switzerland: we
could have these benefits without being a full member. Both Norway and
Switzerland are wonderful countries, but neither is comparable to us in
terms of economy, status or role in the world today. What Eurosceptics
do not like to discuss is that those countries have to commit to
introducing almost every bit of European law but get a say in none of
it. That is perhaps okay for Norway, but how would we protect the City
of London and our competitive advantage in financial services if we did
not have a say in the formation of those laws? We might as well stand
at the airport and wave those jobs off to Frankfurt. Norway still has
to make a contribution to the EU budget—€1.8 billion over
this budget period. We should also remember that, when the EU was first

organisation: the European Free Trade Association. It failed.</hs_Para>

means that I personally want to join, or ever see, a federal Europe, or
even to join the euro. I judge these matters according to only one
thing: what is in our national interest? That brings us to the Prime
Minister’s speech and his attempt to reconcile what he knows to
be sane with the views of many of his Back Benchers. He clearly
recognises that adding to the turmoil in Europe by holding a referendum
in the UK right now would be extremely reckless. But he can surely see
that announcing a referendum to be held in five years’ time is
equally reckless, given that during that time we will live in limbo,
lose investment and have created further unnecessary

am not as defeatist as many Opposition Members have been. I was getting
concerned about the idea of a European banking regulator, which came
out of the blue last year as a new thing that Europe desperately needed
to correct problems in the eurozone. I was worried about how it might
affect our banking system, but Europe, as ever, managed to find a
reasonable fix—one well negotiated on our behalf by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer—in the double-majority mechanism.
Such a mechanism had not existed before, but it made sure that the UK
position was fundamentally safeguarded. So I am a great believer in the
fact that these things that I and other Conservative Members

solutions to problems if we enter the negotiation with a broad

concerned. The European Commission often asks for extra powers, and we
have recently received its work programme, which contains proposals to
harmonise and get rid of anomalies in the VAT system. In other words,
the plan is to get rid of the anomaly whereby we can charge less VAT on

more power to do that. We should retain the power in the UK to

their fears that they might be disadvantaged when we entered into the

Gentleman, but, to my surprise, the response of the EU on 1 January
last year was a quite dramatic intervention: in Spain and elsewhere,
immediate action was taken against suppliers who were not compliant, to
the extent of closing down hatcheries and egg producers. My regular
meetings with the British Egg Industry Council suggest that that has
not been nearly as worrisome to its members as they thought it might
be, and has, in fact, been to their advantage. The long-term advantage
in the sector lies in having not just a level playing field, but in
meeting the higher standards that consumers expect.

common agricultural policy is undergoing changes at the moment, but the
rural development pillar has been directly beneficial to many
hard-pressed rural communities throughout the UK by rewarding the
delivery of biodiversity and good environmental outcomes as well as
innovation and competitiveness in farming and food production, and
supporting areas such as Wales and Scotland where there are natural
environmental
constraints.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000777" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000777"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:45:52"></hs_TimeCode>Another

proudly about how many of our foodstuffs, produced in every part of the
UK, fall within one of those designations and because of that, have
value added and command a premium price. It is interesting that, just
within cheeses, we now have more than one speciality cheese for every
single day of the year. That is the result of the European approach of
recognising the very best in local and speciality foods. Examples
include Welsh lamb, Stilton cheese, Scotch beef, traditional farm fresh

seven or so member states affected. The UK specifically has

the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds) spoke about
this. Yes, if we were outside the EU, we could still negotiate access,
but there are difficulties with that. First, there is the time it would
take and the complexity of negotiating access for a range of different
products; and secondly, as farmers and the NFU tell me, we would have
to comply with the standards that were determined without our having
any input into making those rules. It would be like playing a game but
having no say in the rules—just being told what to do. That is
surely not to our advantage and it is the reason why the farming
community are adamant that they want to be in the EU, playing and
leading.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000780" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000780">CAP
reform is a continuous process. This week, the European Parliament
voted on a proposal that, although it has some good parts, is in many
respects extremely retrograde, not least re-coupling payments to
production rather than to added value through environmental gains and
so on. That links back to the old problem, albeit not on the same
scale, of wine lakes and butter mountains, and it is wrong headed. None
the less, I believe that our farmers want us to be in there, at the
front, arguing loudly as a progressive member of the EU. My one concern
in all this is that Government’s overall approach in the past
couple of years of shaking a big stick on every possible occasion, and
their present position that we will carry a bit of a threat here just
in case we need to use it, have an impact not only on the tone
of the negotiations but on their outcome. Having one of the leading

and to do that we need to regain the veto. We should not have
sacrificed 100 vetoes at Nice, Amsterdam and Lisbon. This Parliament
needs to be able to decide whether a new law goes forward or not;
otherwise we will find that in ever more areas—I am just
beginning to illustrate some of them—we are a fax or an e-mail
democracy. We receive the e-mails or the faxes from Brussels and this
Parliament has to put through the 
<?notus-xml column=985?>measure, whether we like it or not. That creates a tension within our
democracy. Successive Governments bring measures to this House and
recommend them to this House. They are very fundamental
measures, but they often sneak them through this House, or sneak them
through upstairs, because they fear they are unpalatable to us.
However, they know that there is nothing that the House of Commons can
do once the agreement has been made in Brussels—and very often
it is made without the wholehearted consent of the British Minister. In
the case of this Government, it may often be made against the wishes of
the British Minister, but this House is still expected to put through
these measures come what may.</hs_Para>

Eustice</B> (Camborne and Redruth) (Con):</Member> I start by saying
that the speech the Prime Minister gave last week was probably the most
important speech that a Prime Minister has given on Europe since we
joined 40 years ago, and the first time we have seen a Prime Minister
showing genuine leadership on the issue. There has been lots of
rhetoric from previous Prime Ministers about wanting to lead in Europe,
but all too often they have found themselves drifting along with an
agenda set by others. For the first time we have a Prime
Minister who does not necessarily want to make friends with
Europe, and who is challenging Europe’s failure and challenging
it to move in a new direction. Such an intervention is long overdue
because for many years there has been tension in the European Union
between those who wanted to integrate policy making more deeply within
Europe, and countries such as Britain who said we should
have a broader Europe and bring on board countries from eastern
Europe.</hs_Para>

decision to enlarge the European Union to include eastern Europe should
have been a triumph for British foreign policy and have led to a
situation in which the EU tried to do less but did a few things better.
Some powers should have started to return to national Governments, but
instead the relentless dogma of ever-closer union has continued. It is
high time we called time on that.</hs_Para>

analysis that Europe needs to change and reform, and that some powers
should return, but who have no confidence whatsoever in their ability
to deliver that—they will not even try; they are not prepared to
embark on the process. I heard the shadow Foreign Secretary agree with
the five principles, but he will not say whether he thinks there should
be a new treaty or intergovernmental conference, and he will not commit
to any kind of renegotiation. There is a kind of craven fear among
those who say they agree with our analysis but are completely unwilling

renegotiation and put it to the people. The whole point of a
renegotiation is that such things are developed in the negotiation.

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000814" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000814">Three
other aspects of the Prime Minister’s speech were important.
First, he was right that the core of the EU is not the euro, but the
single market. We are committed to the single market and want to expand
and extend it. Research last year by Open Europe concluded that the
current arrangement in the single market was better for Britain than
the alternatives. It is better because we need to be in the single
market for things such as financial services, and because we need to be
in the customs union to support our manufacturing, because of
complicated country-of-origin rules. For those reasons, we are
committed to, and want to expand, the single market. The euro is not
the core of the EU, as some would say. In fact, the euro is an optional
project. Britain and perhaps other countries will never join it, and
some member states trapped in it might yet choose to leave and
re-establish their own
currency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000815" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000815">The
second important point expanded by the Prime Minister is that we must
end the dogma of ever-closer union. It must now be possible for powers
to return to nation states. The reality is that the more competences
the EU has taken on, the less competent it has become. We must give the
EU the power to adapt and the power to let go of things when there is
no longer a rationale for deciding them at European level. Who is
really on the side of the EU? Is it those like me who say,
“Let’s make the EU more flexible and give it the ability
to adapt to new challenges in future,” or is it those who say,
“It’s all too difficult to change. Let’s just
leave it like it is”? Those of us who are arguing for change are
on the side of the
EU.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000816" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000816">The
third important aspect of the Prime Minister’s speech was the
distinction between willing co-operation between nation states and
national Governments, and the integration of policy. There is an
opportunity to roll 
<?notus-xml column=990?>back the jurisdiction of the European Court of
Justice in many areas. That has already been done on matters such as
justice and home affairs by countries such as Denmark. It co-operates
with directives and works with other countries in a spirit of
co-operation but does not accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ. We do
something similar on foreign affairs, and it works. We co-operate with
other European countries and work to have co-ordinated policies on
foreign affairs, but we do not have an integrated policy and we do not
make foreign affairs subject to
QMV.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000817" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000817">I
conclude by dwelling on whether change is possible. The big challenge
in the debate is answering those who say, “It’s all well
and good. We agree with you about what needs to be changed, but
it’s impossible. What will you do if they say no?” I am
more optimistic than many on that point, for a number of reasons.
First, the euro has created challenges that mean that the EU will
change anyway. I believe there will be growing demands for a new treaty
in the coming 12 months if Angela Merkel is re-elected later this year.
That demands a policy response from Britain. If other countries say
that they want to integrate more deeply and understand that Britain
will not follow them, we must at that point have a grown-up discussion
on what a new model for Europe looks
like.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000818" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000818">The
second thing to remember is that the differences between countries that
are out of the euro and those that are in it can be exaggerated. The
truth is that countries such as Germany, Holland and many others see
Britain as an ally in liberalising markets and opening up the single
market. They want us in the EU because they see us as an ally. The EU
needs us because we give it influence in the world. People often say
that Britain might be losing influence, but there is a two-way street,
because we give the EU
influence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000819" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000819">The
third thing to bear in mind is that other countries have problems with
aspects of EU policy. Germany and Sweden do not like measures such as
the data retention directive. Therefore, we should discuss which bits
they want to drop and which bits we want to
drop.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013066000820" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0003.htm#13013066000820">Finally,
the Prime Minister struck absolutely the right tone. He made it clear
that Britain wants to be in the EU, but that we want Europe to change.
He said that Britain will play its role as a genuine leader and
challenge Europe to face up to its failures and make that change. To
those who say that is impossible, I say that we should reject such
defeatism. People used to say that the euro was inevitable; it
was not. There is no such thing as historical
inevitability.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_30_PT_1/4933FF7BC1CA73866FFD39F98A49CF9B005D231B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="30 January 2013">Wednesday

in the EU. The title of today’s debate is
“Europe”. We are in Europe; we are part of the continent
of Europe. As a Welshman, I am proud of Wales being a part of the
United Kingdom. I do not go to the UK and I do not go to
Europe—I am in both and I want to remain in both. I believe that
the interests of my constituents are better served by our having a
strong voice in the United Kingdom in this Parliament, and in the
European Union. I trust our representatives to fight for our interests.
That is what the Prime Minister should be doing—talking not
about our going somewhere closer to the exit of Europe, but about going
to the centre of Europe and fighting for the interests of my
constituency.</hs_Para>

practical, social and economic policies, and we have had good policies
for Wales. Being a member of the European Union has been a net benefit
to Wales. It is estimated that £40 per person per year extra
comes into Wales from our membership of the European Union. We benefit
in many other ways. Social and economic regeneration has happened
through structural funds. Extra money has come from Europe, on top of
what the UK Government have given, for real, social and economic

built village halls and the structure of social cohesion of Wales and

a spirit of coalition fraternité, let me say that I found much
to welcome in the Prime Minister’s speech on Europe, although
one would not necessarily have known it from much of the media

freedom over many decades in Europe and emphasised the value of the
single market. He also emphasised the EU’s role in putting
Britain at the heart of negotiations on world trade—through free
trade agreements and so on—and therefore its value to British
jobs and British business. He also stressed its role in keeping Britain
at the top table on issues such as climate change.

Prime Minister also emphasised the importance of reform in Europe. I
agree with a great deal of what he said in his speech about that. I was
talking to consultants at Cheltenham general hospital only recently
about the working time directive and the need, perhaps, to reform some
aspects of it. We all want the EU budget reduced, in line with these
austere times, and there are regulations—from small businesses
to fisheries—that can be lightened or brought closer to national
decision making. We would all support that. In fact, the Prime Minister
made a very good case for British membership of the European Union and
the kind of reforms that can be achieved within a process of
negotiation and collaboration, positively engaging with our European
partners.</hs_Para>

the Prime Minister rather undermined that with his announcement of this
hypothetical in/out referendum, not so much by putting forward the
principle of a referendum, but by refusing to say which way he will ask
us to vote if such a referendum actually happens, which is quite a big
if. Let us look at Conservative policy over the past few years. In 2007
we had the “cast-iron guarantee” of a referendum on the
Lisbon treaty. A few years later, that was not so certain. Then, once
the Conservatives were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, we had
a clear and legislated-for agreement that there would be a referendum

Labour MPs—joined us in the Lobby that day. We have therefore
been very consistent in arguing for referendums at times of major
change. What I am highlighting is the lack of certainty in Conservative
policy, which has yet again changed in the last few weeks. I might make
rather more money than I generally do at the Cheltenham gold cup by
betting that within the next four years, before this hypothetical

up in the argument for this imagined wholesale renegotiation of the
British terms of membership. There is no reason why that should
succeed, because if we start unpicking all aspects of our relationship
with Europe, why would the French not start arguing to unpick
competition policy? Why would the Germans not start arguing for the
protection of their energy markets? Why would quite a lot of countries

problem is that the Prime Minister wants to renegotiate with Europe,
but he has no strategy and no thoughts on what he wants to renegotiate.
How can he 
<?notus-xml column=996?>renegotiate anything when there is confusion over
his own position? He has talked about the repatriation of powers since
he became Prime Minister, but he has yet to tell the House and the
country which powers he wants to repatriate. Many Government Members
have been challenged to give us some examples this afternoon, but they
have failed to do so.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:33:38"></hs_TimeCode>Does the Prime
Minister’s shopping list include the progressive policies of the
social chapter? Does it include the right to four weeks holiday for
British workers, the right to parental leave and extended maternity

regulations or collective redundancy provisions?</hs_Para>

is an obvious distinction between repatriation and repeal. The British
people deserve to know not just the list of powers the Prime Minister
wishes to repatriate but what the Government would do with those
repatriated powers. We have already seen the Beecroft report on
workers’ rights, which would take this country back to Victorian
times. Would the Government repatriate and repeal? Would they just
repatriate? Or would they even repatriate and improve? Those key

be able to trade. That is a critical point, but I think that the

would be remiss to talk of the EU in this Chamber without mentioning
Scotland. It will not surprise the House to hear that the Scottish

confusing at best. The Deputy First Minister wrote to the Foreign

it and that Scotland, after a successful independence vote, would
continue to be a constructive member of the EU. That was despite the

two and a half years, the Government have never said anything positive
about the EU. We know that the Prime Minister does not want a

Back in June last year, he posed the question whether he wanted to stop
the bus and get off, and he answered no. One thing is for sure: the
Prime Minister can do none of this while he is away from the EU
decision-making table and locked out of the room in a sulk. He should
be at the table, thumping his fists on it and using this
country’s considerable influence to make the patriotic case,
founded on the national interest, for a flexible Europe that can

Gentleman listens to what else I have to say, I hope that he will
accept that I will be campaigning to make sure that that does not
happen. I had rather hoped that the question of Britain’s
membership had been settled decisively back then—my view has not
changed—but I believe that the prospect of a national vote would
give our country an opportunity to have a serious national conversation
about Britain’s relations with the European Union. I welcome

of today is markedly different, and the EU of tomorrow will, I believe,
be even more so. In the Commission and, to some extent, in the European
Parliament, there are those who still see the EU as a centralising
project, but in national Parliaments—including this

is not Europe, and the people who work there have no monopoly on the
European vision. Schuman’s plan was fundamentally about
eliminating trouble, anxiety and distrust from a continent ravaged by
centuries of conflict. Today, our focus is not on keeping the peace,
but on consolidating prosperity. The treaty of Rome was signed in 1957
by just six countries with a combined population of 173 million. By the
time the Lisbon treaty came into force, more than half a century later,
the Union comprised 27 member states with a combined population of more
than half a billion. With Croatia, we are soon to number 28.
Enlargement, one of the EU’s greatest success stories, is set to

its membership has changed, the EU has embarked on a different path. If
we reflect on the way in which European institutions have evolved since
that original blueprint, if we look at the aspirations and stated aims
of EU member states—all of which want to protect
their identities and interests—and if we consider the actions
that member states have taken independently, across a wide spectrum of
policies, it is clear to us that there is no great craving for the

40 years of British membership, there is really no overarching

Commission’s budget is barely 1% of Europe’s GDP.
Countries retain sovereignty over many areas that might have been
expected to be transferred in a federal system. Member states have

state, even if they are supported by the vast majority of the

done. In 2005, France and the Netherlands rejected, by referendum, what

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:45:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ynys Môn (Albert Owen), I am fascinated by the
modern-day Conservative party’s obsession with Europe. We
only have to mention the word “Europe” to send
many Conservative Members into an act of communal or self-flagellation.
As my hon. Friend said, however, that has not always been the case. The
major changes in our relationship with Europe were introduced by
Conservative Governments. They took us into Europe, and it was Margaret
Thatcher who signed the Single European Act.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:49:30"></hs_TimeCode> Conservative
party holds to a little Englander narrative, which goes as follows:
Europe is a foreign place that is anti our culture and somehow does
things to poor old little Britain. Nothing could be further from the
truth. It is true that we are an island off the continent of Europe,
but we are part of Europe. For centuries, we spoke French, not English,
and we even speak Norman French at the Prorogation of each
Parliament. Our royal family has a proud German
history and 
<?notus-xml column=1000?>heritage, too. It is therefore plain wrong to argue
that Europe is somehow alien to our culture. It is part of our history,
and it is in our DNA, too, as the blood of people from Europe who have
settled here flows through our veins. All this also influences the
decisions we take: if we go down to the Members’ car park, we
can see the most fervent anti-Europeans driving French and German-made
cars.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) said what is
important is inward investment and access to the European market. I
completely agree. The EU is vital for jobs in my region of the
north-east, and also for our future prosperity.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:48:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ynys Môn made a point about structural funds,
too. They made a real difference when the last Conservative Government
ripped the heart out of the north-east economy. This is not only about
manufacturing, however; it is about access to financial markets, too,
and liberating the European telecommunications market, which cannot be
done from the

I respect that position—although I totally disagree with
it—but that is not what is before us. It is worse than that. We
will have five or more years of indecision because this Prime Minister
has put party advantage ahead of Britain’s national interest. We
will have five years of companies looking at Britain and
asking themselves, “Should we invest? Can we be sure Britain is
going<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:49:30"></hs_TimeCode> to be part
of Europe?” The Prime Minister will not even tell us what the
red lines in respect of Europe are going to be. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

Lincolnshire will be aware that many generations of immigrant workers

is important to remember that being part of, at the centre of, Europe
is in this country’s interest. On the idea that Europe is doing
things to us—that the Commission tells Britain what to
do—Conservative Members tend to forget the nature of the
decision-making process. What on earth do Cabinet Ministers and other
Ministers go to Council of Ministers meetings for, if not to influence
debate? Similarly, the last treaty actually changed the role of the
European Parliament. I have my criticisms of the way it operates, but
at least it increased the so-called democratic voice in decision-making
processes.</hs_Para>

to end up with a two-speed Europe? If we continue as we are, we
certainly will, because our voice will be ignored in Europe. There are
some changes that could be made. I am not one of those who argue for a

loud voice, speaking up for what is in Britain’s national
interest: the single market and the security that Europe offers this
country.</hs_Para>

changes to, for example, the eurozone, but I should remind the
Conservatives that we are not part of the single currency. Change will
happen, and we need to be part of a constructive, positive dialogue.
Standing at the sidelines stamping our feet, saying that we must get

Gummer</B> (Ipswich) (Con):</Member> What a refreshing change to be in
the Chamber today, having this interesting, broad and generous
discussion about the European Union, which is so different from many
such debates that I have watched remotely or participated in in my
short time here. The same is no doubt true for other Members. The mood
has changed, and the reason why is the Prime Minister’s speech
last week. The greatest service that his speech has done not only to
the country but to the European debate is that it has allowed us, at
last, to open up this debate properly. It has allowed the full spectrum
of belief and thinking—on both sides of the House—to find
its voice and come alive, and with a graciousness that we have not had
in such debates for many decades. That is a good thing, because this
debate is too important for us to allow it to become reconciled only
through rancour. We have to approach it afresh. The British public are
tired, frustrated and irritated with this discussion and we need to
have it in a new way that gets to the heart of the matter.</hs_Para>

was why I was so pleased with the way in which the Prime Minister
opened his speech last Wednesday. It began, so importantly, by dealing
with the historical context, which we have not discussed properly in
this Chamber for many years. When we have been discussing the minutiae
of European treaties, we have forgotten the reason for Europe, why this
country is a member of the European Union and why so many of its other
members care so deeply about the political consequences 
<?notus-xml column=1002?>of this great community, which has done so much,
with NATO, to forge a peace since the second world war. It has been the

not to forget that although we have found peace within the continent
during the past 60 years, the edges of our continent are as dangerous,
as vociferous and as potentially alive to crisis and trauma as they
have been at any point in the past five or six centuries. Furthermore,
we have to be alive to the fact that, as the Prime Minister said, our
relationship with the European Union is peculiarly British; a
golden thread runs from the very first engagement that we had in our
modern history—the Norman conquest—all the way through to
now, and it is peculiarly English. That has stamped its mark on the
relationship between Great Britain—and then the United
Kingdom—and Europe. Even in that prototype of European summitry
at the field of the cloth of gold, which the Minister will know of far
better than I do, the discussions between the delegations contained
many of the same tensions that we see now in European summitry and in
the discussions that he has to have on a weekly basis on our
behalf.</hs_Para>

of that is to say that other nations in the European Union do not have
their own peculiar, individual, unique relationships with other member
states; for the Finns, for the Spanish, for the Italians and for the
Germans these relationships are very special. So we are not in a unique
position in encountering a difficult or particularly interesting
relationship with our fellow member states; the relationship is made
different by the great ditch that lies between us, but we still have to
reconcile ourselves to the fact that other nation states also have
these peculiar interests.</hs_Para>

Prime Minister’s recognised not only that changing relationship
with the European Union, but the changing demos of the European Union.
We would do well not forget that the demos is changing in our own

the tone has changed as a result of his new beginning last

pessimism and between certainty and uncertainty. It is clear to me,
however, that the people on the Opposition Benches who would call
themselves optimists are so optimistic about the benefits of the
European Union that they do not want an open debate with the British
people in which they get to have their say. Those Opposition Members
complain that the uncertainty of the referendum period is damaging, but
will not give us any certainty about whether they support having a
referendum now or at any point in the future.</hs_Para>

debate today, and the debate that the Prime Minister has rightly
started, are about our bottom line. What do we want from the European
Union if we are to maintain our membership? What case will we put to
the British people in the referendum campaign based on what we have
renegotiated? Without certainty, without a bottom line and without the
referendum, there is a danger that the debate will carry on for ever.
Britain and other member states will grumble about the EU and what they
do and do not get out of it, but there will never be clarity about what
we want to get back, what we think is the best deal for Britain and
whether we should consider that our national interest is better served
by considering a future outside the EU.

negotiating position, they have to consider walking away from the table
if they cannot get what they want; otherwise they are never taken
seriously. That is the story of the Labour Government: they gave away
Britain’s opt-out on social policy and £7 billion of our
rebate and got nothing in return. Their rhetoric about Britain being at
the heart of Europe was exactly that: a rhetorical position, totally
meaningless. We got nothing out of Tony Blair’s positioning
himself at the centre of a grand European stage—nothing that

has been considerable discussion of the European social model and what
reforms we would want. We certainly see the case for nation states and
national Parliaments making decisions in that area. I believe that the
social model of Europe has to be reformed if Europe is to be

been expressed by a number of my right hon. and hon. Friends. It was
also expressed by Tony Blair in an interview in <I>Der Spiegel</I> this

policy,”

what you want and do not back it up with a referendum, you will not get
what you want. The reason countries such as Ireland could negotiate
after their people originally said no to the Lisbon treaty is that they
had a clear, definitive position as a country. The European Commission
had to deal with them because they had the power to bring down the
entire treaty; that was the strength they had in that negotiation. We

developing markets and we cannot ignore that. Neither can Europe ignore
the fact that one of the reasons for the debt crisis is that the

the eurozone countries will see closer co-ordinated integration as part
of the solution to the crisis in the eurozone, but it is clear that we
will never be part of that inner core. There has to be a view of what

with his party members’ conflicting views. The public understand
very well that this is really about political opportunism, and they
will be watching this debate carefully as it unfolds—or, in the
case of the Government, unravels. It is still not clear whether the
Prime Minister personally wants Britain to be in or out of the EU. It
is also not clear what that means for inward investment. Only this
week, I attended an event here at the House of Commons with members of
the financial services sector who gave a clear message that the current
situation is not good for their sector. I am afraid that selective
quoting by the Foreign Secretary hides a very genuine concern that

agricultural subsidies through the CAP, increasing Europe’s

are several reasons why the EU is going through a period of change, the
first of which is the move towards political union by eurozone
countries. When politicians considered entry to the eurozone, it
was obvious to many of us that political union among

<?notus-xml column=1012?>countries was inevitable. I did not want to be a part of that and was

support the Prime Minister’s speech, which has greatly changed
the narrative in the House and the country—I am not an Order
Paper-waving enthusiast, but a realistic pragmatist, and the speech was
hugely important to us. Before hon. Members make speeches in the
Chamber, it is as well that they look back at the last speech they made
on the subject. I spoke in the October 2011 debate, when a referendum
motion was before the House. I opposed the motion quite strongly, for

first reason was the need for clarity. In October 2011, I felt we were
discussing a referendum when there was no clarity on the options that
the public would be given. Some hon. Members spoke of a

Leadsom:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend makes a good point. Clearly,
as part of a newly negotiated relationship with Brussels, it will be
important for Britain to bring back significant powers. At the same
time, the EU is set to change itself. It is already changing
significantly, and changing in ways that already benefit Britain. Just
one example is the eurozone’s decision to create a single
regulator for eurozone financial institutions, and the recognition that
in doing so there was the potential for member states to caucus against
non-euro members. It has been agreed, at the request of Britain and
other non-euro member states, to have a double majority, so that
eurozone members only cannot exclude non-euro countries from having a
say in a vote. That is an important, game-changing precedent that
points the way to a future for the European Union. There is a group of
eurozone members that need to move towards a country called Europe
where they underwrite one another’s debts and move to a federal
united states of Europe. At the same time, there can be another very
strong group of non-euro member countries that can find a different
path. The Fresh Start project, which I was closely involved in
establishing 18 months ago, has recently recommended a number
of reforms. I hope that the Government will take close account of its
recommendations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T18:36:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

essential that Britain co-operates fully with the EU on matters of
crime and policing. I will come on to that, because it is one of the
recommendations in the Fresh Start manifesto that Britain repatriate
its competency in that area. In other words, Britain can envisage a
scenario where we co-operate fully with the EU, but do not necessarily
have to opt in to directives that cannot then be changed under
qualified majority voting and are subject to European Court of Justice
oversight. It is perfectly possible for Britain to repatriate crime and

is a recommendation to have an emergency brake for financial services

important at EU level, and for Britain it is a key contributor to the
Chancellor’s tax take. We need to defend it, but it is also

any member state to defend itself against unfavourable interventions.

Bacon:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In this
country, once the rules come into force on a given date—1
January 2013, in this instance—that should be it. There is a
huge difference between our approach to the law, what we do with it and
how we obey it, and the approach of many countries on the Continent,
where law and the making of law are more of an aspiration than a
statement of what is and how things should be. I do not want dwell on
that point too much, because it is outside the terms of the debate, but
I think that it highlights one of the fundamental differences between
us and many European countries, which makes the melding of our

developed have been able to achieve full compliance, while other

about why compliance has not been achieved. The reality is that it has
not been achieved because it was not in those countries’

compliance with the EU directive, but that directive does not meet the
standards on our statute book in this country. The EU directive
allows farmers in other member states to continue to keep
sows in stalls for, I think, the first 21 days, while they are being
served —or mated—for the future. Therefore, every other
farm in Europe is entitled to have some sow stalls on their farm for
that reason, but they are completely banned in our country, so even
European farmers who are in compliance with the regulation are not
necessarily keeping their pigs to the high standards we uphold in

however, is that, of the top 10 pigmeat-producing nations in the EU in
terms of production tonnage, only Romania and the UK are fully
compliant, and they are ninth and tenth respectively. The top eight
countries, by volume of meat produced, are non-compliant. They include
Germany, with 6 million tonnes; Spain, with 3.5 million tonnes; France,
with just under 2 million tonnes; and Poland, with 1.8
million tonnes. The vast majority of the big producers are not
compliant. In other words, the biggest pork producers are those who
have made the least effort to comply with the law and who have
benefited accordingly from lower costs. This is more than a
question of fairness or a matter of principle. Poor harvests last year
have resulted in very high feed costs. That is fine for wheat farmers,
but for pig farmers, who rely on buying feed, it is not fine at all,
and means that many farmers are under great financial
pressure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013076000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0004.htm#13013076000118">If
illegal farms either complied with the law, as they should, or stopped
producing pork altogether, that would tighten the supply chain and lift
pork prices, creating a much brighter future for those who have made
substantial investments in making sure the pork they produce is legal.
It now falls to the European Commission to work with member states to
enforce the protection of pigs directive. However, the
Commission’s attempts to enforce it are already going awry. An
inadvertent and unofficial derogation has already been granted to
Ireland and France, after the European Commission gave them an
extension to the deadline for applying for funding for pig farmers who
have yet to convert their pig houses. Ireland has until September 2013
to access the funds. In the case of France, a quarter of French pig
farmers remain
non-compliant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013076000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0004.htm#13013076000119">Together,
Ireland and France account for 2.25 million tonnes, or just over 10%,
of EU pork production. Interestingly, that is more than the total
combined 
<?notus-xml column=1024?>production of the 10 member states that are fully compliant, which
between them manage only 2.23 million tonnes, or 9.97%, of EU pork
production. Ideally, the money should be withheld until the French and
Irish farmers expecting these funds can prove that any illegal sow
houses have been empty since new year’s eve, although I
recognise that in practice that would be very difficult to
achieve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013076000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0004.htm#13013076000120">However,
there are three things the Government can do now that would make a real
difference to British pig farmers and help to stop illegal pigmeat
entering the UK. First, effective enforcement of the directive must
begin at home. The Government must ensure absolute clarity in their own
buying standards for pork and other pigmeat products. This affects
purchasing for schools, the NHS, the armed forces, local government
canteens and every other public sector body. By now, every tier of
government, from Whitehall to the town hall, should be making sure they
are not buying meat that has been produced illegally, and that they
know they are not. The Government need to make sure that people in the
public sector are aware of this
obligation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013076000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0004.htm#13013076000121">However,
it is not enough for Government buyers simply to rely on
suppliers’ assurances of compliance. The Government must show
leadership by making certain that all their suppliers operate a
traceable supply chain that procures pork and pigmeat from legally
compliant sources. The Minister will recall that at the pig industry
summit which I hosted in November, he undertook to write to Government
Departments reminding them of their obligations. I look forward to
receiving an update from him on this matter and hearing more about what
the Government are doing in this
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013076000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0004.htm#13013076000122">Secondly,
retailers and food service companies, having been shown leadership by
the Government in the way I suggest, should be strongly
encouraged to adopt full traceability, so that any pigmeat products
they sell are guaranteed to come from legal sources. Such companies
should then be expected to have fully transparent systems in place to
guarantee that to their customers. The need for full and open
traceability has been aptly demonstrated by the recent detection of
horse DNA in beefburgers. That discovery not only inspired the largest
accumulation of equine puns known to mankind, but illustrated the
importance of a fully transparent supply
chain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T19:15:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013076000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0004.htm#13013076000123">Tesco

need to be pressed for commitments to guarantee traceability that

what must be avoided at all costs is a further protracted period before
100% compliance across the EU is finally achieved. The European
Commission has a responsibility in that regard; it can and should be
demanding to see deliverable action plans from non-compliant countries.
In the meantime, we should stop illegal pork and pork products from
entering the country. Non-compliant nations must be pressed for
specific guarantees on when they intend to reach full compliance,
rather than some vague promise to be delivered by some indeterminate
date. To encourage them, we should refuse to allow illegally produced

states have had more than a decade to move towards full compliance with
the directive, so there are no excuses. We used to have to say that
British farmers faced unfair competition from imported meat that was

British pig farmers face unfair competition from imported meat produced
overseas using methods that are illegal overseas, too—we cannot
accept that. We must bear in mind what happened in the poultry
industry. It had a far greater number of regulations, agreements and
testing regimes than the pig industry to help enforce the directive on
the welfare of laying hens. Nevertheless, a year on from the original

British pig industry receives no subsidies—pig farmers live and

consumers, retailers, the Government and the whole public sector. But
right now what matters most is preventing British pig farmers from
being continually undercut by illegal pig products that should not be

UK’s pig farmers have had to put up with an unfair market for 13
years, and that is far too long. The law is now finally on

for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon) on securing this important debate. He
described me as a pig farmer, but I ought to say that that slightly
overstates the case. I had four pedigree Tamworth sows. I do not think

Friend the Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Sir James Paice) said,
although it does not level the playing field entirely, as European pig
producers, unlike UK producers, will still be allowed to keep sows in
close-confinement stalls for the first four weeks after service, it
means that when all member states achieve full compliance there will be
far greater parity for UK producers—provided that we have that
full compliance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T19:20:27"></hs_TimeCode>.

stall ban in 1999. I assure hon. Members that I recognise and share the
industry’s concern about non-compliance. We have been working
very closely with it over the last year and it is extremely frustrating

not a realistic option for eggs, however, and I fear it is not an
option for pork and pork products either, because of the legal and
financial implications of introducing such a ban and the practical
difficulties of enforcing it. The Commission has repeatedly made it

stringent traceability in place to ensure that they source pigmeat only
from compliant production systems in other member states. In October
last year, I met representatives of the whole pig supply chain and they
assured me that they will use their best endeavours to source from
compliant systems. There is clearly a significant reputational issue
here for individual companies and trade associations. I followed that
up by writing to the major pork product manufacturers to seek their
individual assurances on traceability, and I will have a further
meeting with the supply chain to take stock on 6
February<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T19:28:30"></hs_TimeCode>. Let me
make it absolutely clear: the major retailers in the UK have promised
me that they will not sell illegally produced pork products. In some
cases, that will be difficult to implement—I know
that—but I will hold them to that
promise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T19:28:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013076000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/debtext/130130-0004.htm#13013076000147">We

be fair to the Commission, it is equally adamant that it wants full
compliance from member states and it is prepared to back that up. We

heart, we are debating whether consumers can feel confident about the
meat they are buying and eating. People buying what they thought were
beefburgers from supermarkets, including Tesco, Lidl and Iceland, were

we have to ask whether the Food Standards Agency is still fit for
purpose. Let us not forget that it was the Irish authorities and not
our own that exposed the problem of horsemeat in beefburgers. Our
system has been fragmented by the Government as part of a drive to
deregulate. Labelling, food composition, nutrition and food safety used
to be dealt with by a single agency and are now handled by three: the
Department of Health, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs and the FSA. That fragmentation and additional bureaucracy make
it much more likely that problems will be missed.</hs_Para>

the British food industry are high, and it is vital that those
standards and that reputation are not undermined by the
Government’s actions. The FSA’s 
<?notus-xml column=252?>budget has been cut by £11 million over the past year alone,
reducing its capacity to detect contaminated food. At the same time,
the swingeing scale of Government cuts to local government has seen
funding for local trading standards services plummet by a third from
£213 million in 2011-12 to around £140 million this
year.</hs_Para>

our farmers. I am not certain about his logic regarding Government cuts
to local authorities and elsewhere. He is politicising what should be a

are serious questions about the role of the supermarkets in forcing
suppliers to cut corners to meet commercial demands. There are
reports—we will all have read them—of products being
bulked up with protein powders containing trace DNA from other animals,
with no way of tracing those products back to their origin. There are
further concerns about the processing of meat from different animals
through the same production equipment, leaving trace DNA behind despite
attempts at deep cleaning, as well as about meat from different sources
being commingled without any labelling to warn consumers about what
they are buying. The National Farmers Union has raised concerns about
that, warning 
<?notus-xml column=253?>that the drive towards “more for less” risks compromising
consumer health, the need for transparency and, ultimately, consumer
confidence.</hs_Para>

slaughtered in the UK for food, the past four years have seen an 84%
increase in the number of animals slaughtered, mostly for export. In
2012, 9,405 horses were slaughtered, but only 1.5% of those animals
were tested for phenylbutazone, or bute, as it is more commonly known.
That drug is commonly administered to race horses, but it can cause
cancer in humans and is banned from the human food chain. Of that small
sample, the FSA has confirmed that eight slaughtered horses tested
positive, potentially exposing fraud in the system. That risk of fraud
was made worse by the Government’s decision to scrap the
national equine database last August, which my hon. Friend the Member
for Middlesbrough (Andy McDonald) alluded to. That has made it more
difficult to trace which British horses are being slaughtered for meat
and whether the meat is fit for human consumption.</hs_Para>

with the hon. Gentleman to a degree, because in discussing a
cross-party issue he strayed slightly into party political issues,
blaming the Government and everything to do with them for an appalling
incident over Christmas, when horsemeat was found in supermarket
burgers. I am not certain that Government cuts to local authorities and
the other things that he listed can necessarily be directly blamed, and
I felt that that was an unfortunate part of the speech. Overall,
however, he made an extremely important point—that, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams) pointed
out, even the smallest traces of DNA in a burger could damage consumer

important, because among EU nations the UK is unique: it has the
highest proportion of food retail—and beverages—from
sales from shops and restaurants. That is very important, so trading
standards are critical. Even in the past month, trading standards in
the south-west found lamb kebabs, which everyone likes to get when it

Gray:</Member></B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman, and am
about to discuss trading standards, and how we can restore consumer
confidence. If consumers believe that what they buy is different from
what the packet says, they will stop buying it. That damages not only
dodgy products—and I think some supermarkets have been guilty,
under commercial pressure, of buying products at a lower price than
they might reasonably have done—but also first-class ones. I
agree with the hon. Member for Croydon North about the importance of
strong local trading standards, a strong Food Standards Agency, and
strong Government controls, to ensure that the highest possible
standards for food are maintained in supermarkets. That applies
particularly in the present case to meat, and particularly beef, in the
context of horse-contaminated products. I agree with the broad thrust
of the hon. Gentleman’s speech, and I look forward to hearing
from my hon. Friend the Minister how we can be certain to restore
consumer confidence.</hs_Para>

however, to touch on an aspect of the opening speech that I disagreed
with; the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Andy McDonald) also touched on
the same point in an intervention. The suggestion seemed to be that if
the system in the UK for the control of the killing of horses were
somehow better, incidents such as the recent one would be less likely.
The hon. Member for Croydon North mentioned the Government’s
recent abolition of the national equine database and the operation of
horse passports. I remember a debate in this very Chamber in 2005 when
my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr Cameron) argued
passionately that horse passports were a complete waste of time, and
committed himself to abolishing them when he came to power. I keep
reminding the Prime Minister of that, and he has not yet got round to
it, but I am confident that sooner or later he may go down that
track.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000035">The
idea behind the introduction of horse passports was that every medicine
administered to a horse would be stamped on the passport. In
particular, as the hon. Member for Croydon North mentioned, bute is a
common medicine—and not only among racehorses, as he mentioned;
often ordinary hacks will be given bute. That is or could be harmful to
human beings. It is important that those horses should not go into the
food chain. Abattoirs should know if horses have taken it, and prevent
that from happening. The idea was that every horse—there are
getting on for 2 million of them in the UK; we do not quite know the
number—should have a passport. Every time it went to the vet the
passport would be stamped, and when it appeared at the abattoir the
staff would say, “No, Mr Horse, you have had bute. You
can’t come in here. Please go away.”

the start, that was a ridiculously flawed principle. The basic flaw is
that although a horse owner such as me might be persuaded to buy a
horse passport on first getting the horse, it is difficult to remember
to cancel it when the horse dies. Already, roughly half of 750,000
horse passports in circulation in the UK today are for dead horses. The
document is entirely meaningless, and a great many
horses—particularly low-value ones, belonging to various groups
of people—have no passports at all. The system is blown wide
open. Decent, sensible, ordinary horse owners get round to buying them.
People who try, criminally, to get their horses into the human
consumption chain do not, so the system does not work.</hs_Para>

failure was compounded by the national equine database. I must pick up
the hon. Member for Croydon North on one point: of course the NED did
not cost the Government anything. It was the passport-issuing
authorities that paid for it. Abolishing it did not save any money; it
was abolished because it was not working. An enormous computer, with a
list of animals on it that die at the rate of 100,000 a year and are
born all over the place, without anyone knowing where they live, is a
worthless piece of bureaucracy. It cannot keep an accurate record of
where all the horses are. It did not work. It did not even begin to do
so, or come close to it. The Government sensibly realised that. I hope
that they will go further at some stage and abolish horse passports,
challenging the European Union in doing so, but that is another
debate.</hs_Para>

Davies:</Member></B> I have taken the same view of horse passports as
my hon. Friend, because I knew they would not work. Does he agree that
the issue is particularly relevant where there are many wild horses?
Because of the bureaucracy affecting passports and ownership, and fear
of in some way getting into trouble, the likelihood of their being got
rid of when they die is far greater. That is one reason why the whole
industry is not run properly. That is particularly relevant in places
such as north Wales, where there are huge numbers of wild
horses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Gray" PimsId="3540" UID="13013048000135" xid="234" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000135">Mr

fact of the matter is that the NED and horse passports cannot, by
definition, prevent horse medicines from getting into the human food
chain in the UK; neither can they prevent horsemeat from entering it.
They do not work, but there is a simple solution. Only about 7,500, or
perhaps 8,500, horses a year go to the one or two functioning UK
abattoirs that still take them, which is an incredibly small percentage
of the 100,000 or so horses that die each year. Horses are generally
shot by a vet, and either buried on a farm or given to packs of
foxhounds to consume. The latter is a common way of disposing of horse
carcases, with a very small number indeed of horses going to an
abattoir. All horses that do go to an abattoir are exported overseas on
the hook, as it were, for eating in Italy and
elsewhere.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000040">Many
purists who think that eating a horse is a disgusting idea, would say,
“Fine. Let us abolish the killing of horses in the UK. There is
a very small number, so let us just abolish the abattoirs.” That
would also abolish the need for horse passports, because if someone
could not take their horse to an abattoir they would not need a
passport to prove that it had not taken bute in the previous couple of
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000041">That
is a possible solution, but either way, I do not believe that the way
in which the horse passport regime, the NED and the UK abattoirs work
has anything to do with the scandal of horsemeat in burgers. That came
from elsewhere in the world, and no one is suggesting that UK abattoirs
were somehow feeding horsemeat into burgers in the supermarkets. Saying
that the horse passport system is somehow bad, that the NED
should  
<?notus-xml column=257?>not have been abolished or something about abattoirs in the UK has
nothing to do with what we are discussing, so I want to press the

matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000042">If
the Government have a primary duty to consumers, it must be to say to
them, first, “What you are buying in the supermarkets is what
you believe you are buying.” What it says on the tin must be
what they find inside the box, and if that is not the case there is a
slippage somewhere, whether with the Food Standards Agency, local
trading standards or elsewhere. Secondly, the Government must be able
to tell consumers that the product is of the highest possible quality.
Our farmers depend on the consumer relying on top-quality supermarket
products, and the moment the consumer—because they are Muslim or
do not like eating horses, or for another reason—begins to
believe that a product might somehow be contaminated, they will stop
buying it, and that has an extraordinarily bad knock-on effect on our
nation’s food
producers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000043">The

interesting point. At one end of the market, people are becoming very
conscious about what is in their meat—they are looking for
locally sourced, organic produce, perhaps cattle fed on grass, rather
than on grain, and so on—but at the other end of the market,
people who cannot afford to pay for such products are increasingly
going for the very cheap options, and we have no idea what they
actually contain. As we

not create an impression that, just because a product is cheaper, in
some way it is of poorer quality, because that is not the case. We need

Shannon:</Member></B> I accept that point. Cheaper does not always mean
that the quality is inferior, but—this is why we are having this
debate—we must underline where the labelling on the tin or the
package has not been correct. That is the point. We need councils or
the Government to oversee a system in which labels stating that a
product is sourced in Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom mean that
the product comes from Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom, not on a
lorry into an abattoir in the middle of England from across Europe

things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000064">We
must ensure that steps are taken to ensure that produce is clearly
marked with the country of origin, country of packaging and exactly
what the product is made of. As the hon. Gentleman says, that what it
says on the tin is what is in the tin, and that what it says on the
packet is what is in the packet. The best way to do that is by buying
locally. I know the price squeezes that large chains put on local
farmers make it hard to survive, which is why I have always supported
the idea of a supermarket ombudsman or regulator. Perhaps the Minister
could give us some indication of whether there is a role for the
ombudsman or regulator. I suspect everyone in the Chamber has pushed
for the groceries code adjudicator, for instance, and the Government
have committed to introducing that. Is there a role for the
adjudicator? If there is, perhaps that is how we can address the
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000065">The
price gap from field to plate is increasing, and as the price of fuel
increases the farmers once again feel the brunt. Too often,
supermarkets expect farmers to absorb the price increases, and, indeed,
too often supermarkets push for a price decrease, which means they will
not buy locally. Farmers in my area tell me that the supermarkets will
say, “Here is the price for this week,” even though it
costs the farmer more to produce their quality product. There has to be
a role for the adjudicator. My firm belief is that, had the meat been
locally sourced, there would not have been an issue. I support those
who call for an investigation into the way 
<?notus-xml column=261?>labels are written and for all things to be made clear, which is what
the hon. Member for Croydon North

we learned a lesson? I hope we have, and I hope we can improve. The
major supermarkets are saying that they have learned a lesson, and I
hope they have; consumers are saying that they have also learned a
lesson, and I hope they have, too. They are both committed to the
product. Our job is to ensure that the lesson learned translates into
action so that we do not find ourselves in the same position in five
years’ time. The next time someone has a burger containing
horsemeat, it should be because they are aware of what they are eating,
not because they went to the local supermarket and chose a cheaper

range of organisations and people across the country are looking to the
Government to ensure that confidence is re-established in food,

hon. Gentleman did a good job of breaking down some of the issues that
have been conflated by other people. The excellent work in the Irish
Republic to identify the matter has raised a number of issues, the
first of which is contamination. Some food manufacturers’
processes are not as good as they could be, and they use machinery that
has been used to make pork products to produce a beef burger without
cleaning the equipment well enough, so that some pork residue ends up
in the beef product. That can be of huge consequence to people whose
religion teaches that they should not eat pork, so it is of great
significance to
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000071">The
other issue occurs when large amounts of cheaper product are introduced
into another product in order to reduce the cost, and the product is
not described accurately on the label. That is food adulteration, and
it is as old as the food industry itself. When commodity prices are
high, people will always cast around for a cheaper alternative to put
into their products. There is no real problem with doing so, as long as
it is made clear to the whole supply chain so that people know what is
in the product. In this case, it was a complete deception, possibly by
the supplier of the meat, which it is suggested originally came from
Poland. The supplier had a duty to make that clear to the Irish who
bought it, and so on down the supply chain.</hs_Para>

Irranca-Davies:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is making a good and
intelligent contribution to this debate. I suggest that one thing that
has changed in how we source and identify our meat and trace
ingredients is the increasing globalisation of the meat market, both
inside and outside the EU, the Republic of Ireland and the UK. For that
reason, adulterated meat, which he says is a problem that is as old as
the hills, is of greater concern now, particularly when it can involve
imports from Argentina, North America or elsewhere into the EU market,
and possibly into the UK thereafter. We must be even more
stringent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013048000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000074"><B><Member ContinuationText="Roger Williams" PimsId="4622" UID="13013048000147" xid="638" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013048000147">Roger
Williams:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman, because he is aware of these
matters, will know that if meat or any other foodstuff is imported into
the European Union, it must come through a port and be inspected, but
if meat is transferred between European Union nations, it is expected
that each nation will have done the appropriate tests and is confident
that the product is as described and is safe. Safety is key.</hs_Para>

manufacturing, a lot of products are taken out and put in. One of the
simplest examples is bread. Some or all of the bran is removed from

wheat are a good thing, but we must ensure that other things added to
our food products maintain safety.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Croydon North (Steve Reed) on securing this
debate, which is of vital concern not only for food production but for
manufacturing and processing. It affects every constituency in the UK;
I doubt that there is a single one that does not have jobs related to
food manufacturing and processing. As the Minister will know, it is one
of the largest employment areas in the UK economy, but is often

Friend outlined in his contribution, this debate should focus on
restoring confidence after a scare within the industry and among
consumers, but in  
<?notus-xml column=263?>order to do so, we need complete and utter transparency. I agree with
the comments made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger
Williams); in the past couple of decades, we have become increasingly
rigorous in inspecting and testing meat, in terms of slaughter and
processing. However, we also need candour, not only about the successes
in the sector and in implementation across the EU but about potential
failings. If we do not do so—if we try to conceal issues that
might be of concern—we have learned nothing from previous scare
stories that have caused a run on consumer confidence and hit the
economy of the food processing sector. It is vital to be honest with
consumers, ourselves and industry in order to restore and maintain
confidence.</hs_Para>

uncomfortable, but before I begin, let me highlight, as I am sure the
Minister will do in his speech, the importance of the sector. The meat
processing and slaughter sector in the UK involves more than 
300 businesses and contributes more than £4 billion in revenue
and turnover. In the European Union, of which we are still a member
nation at the moment, the meat processing sector employs 48 million
people, and here in the UK it employs 1.25 million. It is economically
important, but consumer confidence is equally important. People need to
know that what they eat is what is described on the
package.</hs_Para>

There are technical issues that we need to consider and ask the

It will be interesting to hear the Minister’s comments about how

none of the animals slaughtered in 
<?notus-xml column=264?>which bute was identified were put into the human consumption chain
within the UK. It is, of course, illegal to put such animals into the
human food chain. However, five animals were identified later as having
been subsumed into the food chain in another country in the EU. In
light of comments made during this debate about integration and the
fact that food now does not necessarily go straight from farm to
fork—it could go through various stages of processing—it
is interesting to note that food produced in this country that
was tested and identified as containing bute, albeit with trace
elements, entered the human food chain somewhere in the EU. Whether in

Only one abattoir in the United Kingdom kills horses, and it kills
nothing apart from horses—it is a pure horse abattoir. In the
recent scandal, no one has suggested that something going wrong in the
British abattoir system was to blame. That meat could have come from
anywhere in the world; as he correctly pointed out, it could have been
internationally sourced. The notion that we should somehow undermine
the credibility of the British abattoir system because of apparent
cross-contamination seems entirely fallacious. A small number of horses
are killed in Britain, and there is no suggestion that the abattoir
that does it is guilty of the cross-contamination in the recent

out as much as possible about what happened. We need to take any
appropriate steps to deal with the situation, but we also need to look

our processors and our retailers doing a good job at maintaining high
levels of food standards in this country. That point was made by the

need to know that it is assured at every point, which is why I was
pleased with the immediate response of the big retailers. I welcome
Tesco’s further announcement today, which has been mentioned.
Sellers are required to know where their goods come from and that they
conform with their labels—that is their responsibility, in law
and morally, to the people who 
<?notus-xml column=268?>buy products. I think Tesco has suggested today that its supplier in the

do DNA testing, but we should not be misled in thinking that Tesco has
not always been vigilant previously. I supply animals to a
slaughterhouse in Merthyr from which Tesco sources a lot of its meat.
Tesco certainly examines the processes in that slaughterhouse, and
ensures that they are fit for purpose and that consumer safety is at
the top of the list for that organisation. I am sure that other

other retailers. Waitrose, for instance, wished to point out that its
contracts require its own-label burgers to be made on the first run in

products later in the day. Retailers take the matter terribly

made by the hon. Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Stephen Doughty)
about those whose religious dietary requirements may be affected, the

will expect is that those responsible for the current adulteration will
face the full weight of the law. People should not be let off the hook.
There has been an element of pointing the finger further and further
down the supply chain. If a processor in the Republic of Ireland or
elsewhere did not follow due diligence down the supply chain and used
an unauthorised supplier, I hope that they will be prosecuted—I
am interested in the Minister’s comments on this—by the
supermarkets and others because of vicarious liability for negligence
down the supply chain. Someone is responsible, and the finger should
not be pointed to the nth degree at someone in Poland if some
culpability lies within the supply chain in the

between prosecution and litigation. Civil litigation may
follow—I do not know—if there is prima facie evidence.
When I responded in the House to an urgent question, I said that it
seemed to me, without being in possession of all the facts in Ireland,
that there was a possibility of criminality. That is a matter for the
Irish authorities, and it would be absolutely wrong of me to assume any
responsibility or to encourage the Irish in one way or another in their
prosecution policy. However, they will no doubt consider whether fraud
has taken place, and trace the perpetrators, whether they 
<?notus-xml column=269?>are the supplier in Poland, as it seems if their tracing is correct, or
the people in Ireland who took receipt of the meat. That is for the
Irish to decide, and I cannot interfere in that process. I can only
express a view, which I think is shared by many people, that if

example, to use bulking material such as beef protein, and it is not
illegal to do so. The EU labelling regime changes to which the hon.
Member for Ogmore referred will require such material to be more
specifically labelled in future. I agree that it is a difficulty for
those who are trying to enforce compliance because it is obviously much
more difficult to identify the speciation of a brown powder than a rump
steak. The hon. Member for Croydon North points to a difficulty, and we
must be aware of it and consider what we can do about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013049000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013049000013">I
want to deal with some of the broad points that were raised. First, it
is simply not the case that the system has been fragmented and,
suddenly over the past two years, no one has known what anyone is
doing. There was a change in 2010, but the Food Standards Agency has
always been the key player in food safety and analysis, including
competition. It has always worked incredibly closely with trading
standards departments throughout the country which often do the testing
at local level. The Department of Health has always had parliamentary
responsibility for answering for the Food Standards Agency in response
to questions from hon. Members. None of that has
changed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013049000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013049000014">The
only change in 2010 was in labelling policy, which was returned from
the FSA to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
because we knew that there would be issues in the EU about
country-of-origin labelling and we wanted to have a clear handle on
that. Ministers in my Department were inevitably involved in those
negotiations. They were going to be advised by civil servants in the
FSA or the Department, and it seemed more sensible for them to work
with those in the Department. That was the change that was made in
2010, and it does not imply fragmentation of responsibility. There is
still a close working relationship between us and the FSA, and I do not
think anyone would seriously challenge that or the close working
between the FSA and trading standards
departments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013049000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013049000015">Secondly,
another charge was that the FSA’s overall budget has been
reduced. That is a matter for my colleagues in the Department of
Health, but let us be clear that that is not an operational reduction,
but a result of the merger with the Meat Hygiene Service, which has
produced economies of scale by restructuring support staff and
accommodation charges, and enabled 
<?notus-xml column=270?>us to save money. Saving money is a good thing if it can be done without
detriment to the service. We must be clear about
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_30_PT_1/B593504B0C3098CD0A8CB2F127AA796423DE4978" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="30 January 2013">Wednesday

there is a feeling that there are vastly fewer trading standards
officers around the country and that the service is denuded of
capacity. I accept that there are fewer trading standards officers, but
the scale of that reduction is nothing like what has been suggested.
Local authority returns suggest that on 31 March 2012, 2,709 people
were engaged in UK food law enforcement, which is a 2.3% reduction
since the previous year, and a 6.1% reduction since 2009-10. I am
concerned about that reduction and the priorities that local
authorities are choosing to make in what they do because food law
enforcement is a key part of their work. I would encourage them to
ensure that their priorities are the same as those of residents in
their area. However, the reduction in the level of testing is not huge
or swingeing.</hs_Para>

talk about the number of samples taken, but we should distinguish
between the number of samples and the number of tests done on them. We
are becoming more and more sophisticated in what we can provide. I will
give an indication of some of our work in the Department. One policy
area is the research that we commission every year into new methods of
testing for compliance of foodstuffs. We put £450,000 into that
each year.</hs_Para>

is by no means the only tool available for testing. Stable isotope
testing is being developed and is a valuable tool. Proteomics are a key
test which is more often used in ELISA—enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay—which gives similar findings of speciation
and origin to DNA, but at a lower cost. Metabolomics involves looking
at metabolites in food. All those tools are being used to ensure that
the service we provide is as effective as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013049000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013049000019">Let
us not run away with the idea that we have a supine, inefficient
service in this country that never catches anything, and the wonderful
Irish can do it, but we cannot. Some of the things that have been found
and dealt with over recent years include buffalo milk adulterated with
cow’s milk; fruit juice adulterated with sugar and water; maize
adulterated with rapeseed oil; the identification of basmati rice from
its origin; the speciation of meat and fish, making sure that no offal
and blood proteins are in meat products; the origins of beef;
traditional breeds—distinguishing between one breed and
another—the origin of fish, whether chicken has been previously
frozen; and production methods, so whether something is organic, as it
says it is on the packet. We test for all those things. We occasionally
find non-compliance and we deal with it, so let us get away from the
idea that somehow we are either complacent or have ineffective
protection in this country.</hs_Para>

Reed:</Member></B> I hear what the Minister says about the reduced
numbers of local authority food safety officers, but will he give us
the figure for the reduction in food safety tests carried out?
Unfortunately, I do not have the documentation here, but I believe that
in the freedom of information request obtained by the trade union,
Unison, there was a 30% reduction in tests, which would mean a
considerable increase in risk to consumers purchasing burgers or other
meat products, not only from supermarkets, but from the many other
outlets that operate in that area, and—I will leave it at
that.</hs_Para>

Heath:</Member></B> The distinction I was trying to make for the hon.
Gentleman—I accept that he has been given figures—is
between the number of samples and the number of tests. The samples have
gone down, and that is what I think he is quoting. In 2009-10, there
were 105,556 samples—and that is down—on the local
authority side, to 78,653 in 2010-11. That is the diminution that he
refers to, but the number of tests done on them has gone up to 92,181
in comparison. It is not quite as clear a picture as crude figures
sometimes suggest. As I say, I accept the fact that the number of
people working in local authorities has reduced, which is a
proper  cause for concern for me and others in central
Government. What I do not accept is that it is on the scale
suggested by some commentators, who are perhaps taking crude figures
and interpreting them in an inappropriate
way.</hs_Para>

to the success of testing in the meat processing and abattoir sectors,
but what is his view on the situation we have just come across
involving five horses that were tested and identified as having bute in

was too late to stop them potentially entering the food chain elsewhere
in the EU? Is that acceptable? What has gone wrong? They should not be
entering the human food chain at all.</hs_Para>

clear about phenylbutazone: it is a potentially harmful
substance—in fact, there is little evidence one way or another,
but we cannot say it is safe. That is why it is excluded from the food
chain and it is quite right that it should be. It is principally
excluded via the horse passport system. If the horse passport system is
being properly applied, it will be excluded at the point of the
abattoir. It should not enter the food chain and it should be simply
disposed of in other ways. It is not the only drug residue that is
occasionally tested for and that we need to be aware of. The Veterinary
Medicines Directorate checks for a string of residues that we would
also wish to exclude from the human food chain. The evidence from
sampling suggests that a small quantity of phenylbutazone is making its
way through, in some samples. That is concerning and it has to be
investigated, which is exactly what we are doing. The Food Standards
Agency is now looking at that in detail to see whether it can get a
clearer picture.</hs_Para>

problem with the fact that it takes a long time for the test results to
come through. I am afraid that I cannot explain why that is, but I am
advised that it takes about three weeks to get the results back. During
that time, it is entirely possible for food to be passed across the
English channel to French markets, where it could enter the food chain.
As soon as we have a positive confirmation, we advise the
French—or whoever it is—authorities in the same way that
they advise us. We have a wonderful network of agencies around Europe.
They are constantly in communication and advise one another, which is
why we knew about the Irish issue and why we would always notify the
French—to ensure that

for human consumption—the vast majority of which go abroad, as
the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, because there is no appetite for
horsemeat in this country, generally—to be kept in cold storage
over a period of time while tests are being conducted. That is an
option. What we have to do is be proportionate—we are required
by law to be proportionate about what we do, because there are costs
involved for exporters—and we can only do that if the evidence
shows that it is a proportionate action to take. We are collecting that
evidence at the moment and I will then take advice. If at any stage,
the chief medical officer or the Food Standards Agency advises me that
taking any action of that kind is necessary for the protection of human
health, I will take it. I have not received that advice at the

Heath:</Member></B> I am very happy to look at the operation of the
horse passport. However, the national equine database is a red herring.
It never provided any information on the food-chain status of
individual horses, and therefore, it really is not relevant. What is
relevant is that passports need to be robust. They need to have the
information, and people need to respect the fact that if they do not
put that information in, the passports cannot serve as the sort of
check and balance that we need. It is wrong to falsify a document such
as a passport. Its purpose is to protect to the public, but there is
evidence of occasions on which people have falsified them.</hs_Para>

understand why they set it up, because there are EU rules on the
matter. Each breed society can issue a passport, because they keep the
stud book and therefore, there is a proliferation. If we can take
action to ensure that there is no duplication, it would be a good
thing. Let us look at that, but again, I emphasise the point that if
people want to defraud the system, they might do so.

London and saying that it was time to generate growth in the north.

shall outline what is needed. We do not want local authorities to be
undermined; we want them to be a key partner of strong regional
government. The regional and local government structures should
complement each other and work together positively. This is about
transferring powers from Whitehall and outlining areas of policy on
which regional government could provide a real focus, with powers drawn
to the north, for the north. It is not about weakening Britain, but
about making it stronger, more democratic and economically successful.
We have only to look at post-war West Germany to see how successful
regional government has been in creating an economic and political
powerhouse. As long as England remains so centralised and
London-focused, the north’s economy will never reach its full
potential.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013049000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013049000046">The
recent key report by the Institute for Public Policy Research was as
timely as it was revealing. Yes, we can differ about its conclusions,
but the basis on which its findings were made cannot be ignored. I want
to avoid throwing figures at the Minister. We all know that
unemployment is worse in the north than in the south, that job
opportunities in the north are fewer and that public sector spending

IPPR report underlined how the economic potential of key towns and
cities across the north could be a powerhouse of economic growth in the
next 20 years, and how key powers need to be transferred to the region
by central Government. The levers of power urgently need releasing and
sending back to our regions so that areas such as Leeds, Liverpool,
Hull and Newcastle can have their potential tapped, economic
opportunities can be released and social changes can be met. It is time
for central Government to let go a little bit.</hs_Para>

was lukewarm at best. People can recognise a talking shop from a long
way off. I do not want a northern debating chamber that is full of hot

nothing is not an option. If we do not act, the north risks falling

that that might happen unless positive action is taken to address the
northern democratic deficit? People argue about having more forms of
government, but I do not propose that at all. Powers currently
exercised by Westminster and Whitehall would simply transfer to the

safeguards the interests of the south and developments in London, to
the north. The Government want to do it through local enterprise

government. Regional government is necessary to tackle the problems
common to the whole of the north, to put the north’s interests

the electorate in the north-east overwhelmingly rejected the proposal
for regional government, with about 78% voting no. A comment was made
about turnout, but it was almost 50%, so the vote was a clear comment
from the people in the area. Does she really believe that the views of
the people in the north-east have changed so much that they would now
welcome a regional government, of whatever form, with open arms? I am

There is a misapprehension that localism is about giving power to
councils. Understandably, some powers will go to councils, but localism
is about moving power to people in their communities, so that they have
control over those communities. It is respect for the traditions and

something that is led by the people in the community. Local enterprise
partnerships have such ability and opportunity because they are led by
the people in the communities, who understand their traditions and have

me touch on how this Government are devolving power to support that
process. The Localism Act, which I have mentioned, and the Local
Government Finance Act 2012 have devolved more power and greater
control over finances than ever before. For example, the general power
of competence turns previous assumptions completely on their heads. It
gives councils real power to get on and do things, and the room to take
action and innovate without seeking permission from the centre, as they
previously had to do. We have un-ring-fenced funding, given local
authorities greater control over their resources, and put in place
proposals to encourage local economic
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013049000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013049000082">We

the imbalance in our economy. We are already addressing that through

central Government and our cities. They are giving our great cities the
powers and tools that they need to drive economic growth in their
areas. For example, through those deals, we have supported cities with
a £75 million regeneration fund for Liverpool; an earn-back
proposal from Manchester that could be worth more than
£200 million; a new development deal in Newcastle
worth £60 million; and smaller new development deals in

to create 3,780 jobs; the Humber renewable energy super cluster, which
is creating 4,850 jobs; and the Sheffield city region enterprise zone,
which aims to create more than 8,400 additional jobs, with an
additional £400 million in economic output. We have also
invested more than £73 million for local enterprise partnerships

will strengthen their voice and influence, thus increasing their
ability to promote their area with businesses and other partners, and
to grow investment and deliver jobs for local people. We are

construct, which creates pointless discussion, bureaucracy and
inefficiency. Local residents have no confidence in and show no loyalty

failure. Our approach is already devolving power and driving growth. We
have opened the door to the significantly wider transfers of powers not
only to the north, but to the south, east and west—to our entire

this largely unreported problem is vast, costing some £3.5
billion a year and growing. Some 50% of the population will be
targeted, and nearly 7% will be duped by scam mail, which is carefully
crafted to maximise the potential of deceiving the victim. Once the
scam comes to light, the victim or, in many cases, the victim’s
family, experience a large range of emotions, including anger, shame
and upset. In some cases where the loss has been so big, they might
even have suicidal thoughts. Indeed, as we heard on the television

the potential to make people mentally ill, as it opens up a delusional
world that goes deeper than any other addiction or obsession. This
inability to get some victims to see the reality of their victimisation
and delusions has led some people to ask whether psychiatrists should
consider the existence of some form of psychological or mental health
condition that drives people to be repeated victims of scams. I
strongly suspect that the addictive and irrational behaviours from
which many of these victims suffer might be well known to
psychiatrists. Perhaps we should consider how existing powers under the
Mental Health Act 1983 could be used to empower families and those with
safeguarding responsibilities to intervene and save victims, such as
Mrs Smith’s father, from their own

permits the various organisations involved in detecting and prosecuting

derived from various Acts of Parliament, which creates a lack of
clarity in this area. Thirdly, there 
<?notus-xml column=285?>is an overly burdensome demand to protect mail in transmission, which
means postal workers often observe the scams happening, but are either
powerless, or believe themselves to be powerless, to intervene.
The result is that the fraudsters continue to profit
while the authorities are unable to do anything definitive for fear of
acting beyond their legal powers. In effect, no one knows what they can
do when a scam is detected, even though they know what they would do if
they
could.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000016">The

which organisation is best placed to detect scam marketing—Royal
Mail, which says that scam mail is easy to identify both before and
when the scam takes place. It wants to be able to pass on the details
of suspected victims to trading standards, but its staff feel duty
bound, even while observing the scams happening, to observe the Data
Protection Act 1998, the Postal Services Act 2000 and the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and not intervene and report the names

and therefore it does not do so. Consequently, there is complete
confusion 
<?notus-xml column=286?>about what powers Royal Mail has to report suspected scams
to the body that is best placed to investigate.
However, a Bill could be brought forward to introduce an amendment to
the Postal Services Act 2000 and to the Data Protection Act 1998, in

brings me to the third issue, which is enhanced powers of interception.
At the moment, in order to intercept and report scam mail, the Royal
Mail, the police or those officials seeking to investigate scams or
enforce existing legislation must secure a warrant from my right hon.
Friend the Home Secretary to intercept post in the course of its
transmission. To issue a warrant, my right hon. Friend the Home
Secretary would need to be satisfied that it was necessary for the
purposes of detecting serious crime, which would need substantial
proof. That is understandable given the need to protect privacy, data
and even human rights. However, the almost sacrosanct nature that post
in transmission enjoys is also a charter for the scammer to carry on
defrauding.</hs_Para>

legislative patchwork quilt, that burdensome approach is well
intentioned but it also works against consumer interests. Again, it
could be tackled by an Act of Parliament that gives new powers of
interception. However, enhancing powers of interception naturally
raises questions about protection of privacy and data. If interception
powers were to be introduced without the need for a warrant, there
would have to be appropriate safeguards against breaches of human
rights. Such powers would need to be controlled using the existing
authorisation process, but perhaps with the final power of decision
resting at a sufficiently high level to ensure that the tests of
necessity and proportionality are satisfied, without needing to trouble

those involved. In many cases, trading standards officers remain the
best first port of call. That is the current situation and in my

(George Hollingbery) agree that it is often the elderly who are
targeted and victimised by the scams? There are many different forms of
what I call snail mail marketing, and the scams get lost in the middle
of that. They are well hidden, and in my experience the elderly are
particular
vulnerable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000046"><B><Member ContinuationText="George Hollingbery" PimsId="5584" UID="13013057000159" xid="1104" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000159">George
Hollingbery:</Member></B> That is plainly the case. In my experience,
and my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire also made this
clear, it tends to be the older and less mentally robust who are
scammed and are subjected to repeat versions of the same thing. Their
names get on a list and they are targeted again and
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000047">The
estimated annual cost of scam mailings to the economy is some
£3.5 billion. The citizens advice bureau in Bishop’s
Waltham in my constituency has brought a number of such scams to my
attention, and one of them, involving missed delivery cards, caught my
eye. The scam is not of the same nature as one that says, “You
will send in a cheque,” or one that asks someone to send money
directly back. This one is allegedly from a well-known delivery
company, and it asks people to confirm that they want the delivery to
be remade by calling a particular number. On the card, rather than an
address from which to pick up the parcel, there is a telephone number.
It turns out to be a premium rate number of a telephone company in
Belize, which someone would be charged £315 for the pleasure of
calling. Many of the scams are so sophisticated that they are extremely
easy to fall for, especially for someone who does not get out or read
the newspapers often and is not aware that such things exist. That case
highlights one of the biggest challenges in stopping mail scams: the
majority originate abroad, and it is nigh on impossible to prosecute or
stop them as there is no UK-based business to have a go
at.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000048">There
is a great deal of work taking place. Hampshire county council has
concentrated on the matter, hence the involvement of my hon. Friend the
Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes). The council
has established a special trading standards  
<?notus-xml column=290?>safeguarding unit, which works closely with its partner agencies to help
protect vulnerable adults, provide flexible support to victims of fraud
and raise awareness through information designed to educate, support
and guard against further financial abuse. It has raised awareness
through working closely with the media and community groups, and by
drafting articles for newsletters, newspapers and generally circulated
public communications. Extra training has been given to all staff in
adult services and other agencies so that, for example, when staff
visit a home and are greeted with a mountain of post they can consider
whether the person there might be the victim of scam
mailing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000049">Working
in that way has enabled Hampshire county council and adult services to
identify several chronic scam victims. This is not something that only
Royal Mail or the Government can deal with; local authorities can have
a positive input. The council also works closely with a local business
that provides a mail and package forwarding service to consumers and
businesses outside the UK. The business raised concerns with trading
standards after large amounts of mail were returned to it undelivered.
With that help, more than 200 envelopes full of cash and cheques from
the US were discovered, which helped to end an American mailing scam.
Hampshire trading standards has a good working relationship with money
supply bureaux, and it highlights concerns about individuals who
regularly make overseas transfers to unknown individuals or
organisations. There is by no means a single point of contact or a
single solution; many different hands can get
involved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000050">I
absolutely believe that the Government take the matter seriously. The
Prime Minister answered a question during Prime Minister’s
Question Time from my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Southampton
North on, I think, 11 November, and he has announced a
series of changes designed to get to grips with the problem. The Office
of Fair Trading has invested £7.5 million to create
scambuster teams and run awareness campaigns, and the Government are
also in the process of creating a dedicated team within the National
Crime Agency, when it is established, aimed at tackling the problem.
The work is therefore ongoing, but I believe we have a responsibility
to look even more closely at the matter and consider whether there is
anything more that we can do to target the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000051">My
hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire has covered many of the
solutions that Hampshire county council would like employ, but let me
repeat them anyway. The council believes that we need additional
protections in law to help to safeguard potential victims, and my hon.
Friend the Member for Romsey and Southampton North introduced a private
Member’s Bill in January 2011, which unfortunately ran out of
time. For colleagues who have not seen that Bill, she argued that the
police, customs officers or the National Fraud Authority should be able
to intercept mail if they believe it is scam mail. The county council
also believes that Royal Mail should disclose the details of potential
scam victims to trading standards so that proper support can be offered
to financially abused and vulnerable
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000052">Further
questions arise: how do we stop scam mailing and not direct marketing?
Can the issue more effectively be tackled by changes made by Royal Mail
rather than  
<?notus-xml column=291?>the Government? Are there data protection issues that need to be
considered? Are changes in the law required? I wonder whether it is
possible to beef up the existing mail preference service, or whether
Royal Mail can improve its safeguards to address the problem better. A
moment or two ago, it occurred to be that it might be possible for
families and/or vulnerable adults to have some sort of opt-in system,
so that they give permission for their mail to be examined. That might
be one of the easiest ways forward, to have a permissive regime under
which potential scam victims can say, “I don’t mind my
mail being looked
at.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0001.htm#13013057000053">I
appreciate that this is a tough issue and one that is very difficult to
resolve, but I do have some questions for the Minister. Is there a lead
person in Government who is pulling together the key actions designed
to address the problem better? Is the Government’s view that it
is Royal Mail that needs to put a renewed emphasis on reducing the
problem, or is it essentially a Home Office issue? How do we stop the
problem falling between two stools in government? If there is not one
person with whom responsibility sits, we run the risk of the issue
being forgotten about and its dropping through the cracks in the
floor.</hs_Para>

appreciate that this is strictly outside the Minister’s
portfolio, but when the Prime Minister spoke to my hon. Friend the
Member for Romsey and Southampton North about the issue back in
November, he said that a team was being created at the National Crime
Agency to deal with it. Is the Minister able to update us on the plans
to create that dedicated team? I understand that it is not directly
within her portfolio, but if she has any news I would gratefully
receive it. What I do know for sure is that the message needs to go out
loud and clear that scamming vulnerable people for cash is deeply
cruel. There is more that we can and must do about it, and we must do
it
soon.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_30_PT_1/DEBFF1844405A7046EBAD548A24BD17DD55D8D49" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="30 January 2013">Wednesday

local police in Dyfed-Powys tell me that the type of scams they are

Citizens Advice conducted a survey asking what are the 10 most common
scams and frauds. Of the 558 people in Wales who were surveyed, the
biggest concern, identified by 62% of respondents, was switching: being
offered money-saving deals to switch energy or phone suppliers that
result in paying more money. Also high on the list, identified by 45%
of respondents, were bogus debt advice companies that claim to help
manage people’s debt, subject to fees, but once those fees are
paid, the debt advice is not forthcoming. The third highest, with 44%
of respondents, was—we have already heard a lot about
this—those elusive prizes: timeshares, wonderful cars and huge
amounts of cash. The local citizens advice bureau in Aberystwyth in my
Ceredigion constituency alerted me to the case of an elderly gentleman

is not immune from the scammers. In December last year a constituent of
mine, a prominent farmer and butcher, received a letter from the
“Office of Parliamentary Research” stating that it would
like to use the details of my constituent’s business in its
work, but, of course, it would cost him a fee. Suspecting from 
<?notus-xml column=293?>the outset that that was not what it seemed, my constituent got in
touch with my office. A member of my staff rang the
parliamentary switchboard and asked to be put through to the department
the letter claimed to have been sent from, which did not exist in the
same name. When the operator put my staff member through to the
department with the closest-sounding name and asked for the person who
had signed the letter, she was unsurprisingly told that no such person
worked there. When my staff member explained why she was calling, she
was advised that the call was not the first of its kind and the letter
had nothing to do with Parliament; it was a bogus request for money.
The letter was cleverly worded to get through the law, and, of course,
our advice was to steer well clear. I have had two or three similar
cases in my constituency, and I am sure people across the country have
been approached. The sad reality is that many may have complied with
the request for money, given the name on the

police have talked glowingly of Action Fraud, the national campaign in
which they have participated since December 2012. The scheme is run by
the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau in conjunction with City of
London police with the intention of gathering a range of cases from
across the country and collecting information on incidents and reports
into a central database. The information is collated and analysed
before being fed back to the police force in the area where the scam
may have originated. Since Dyfed-Powys police went live with the scheme
in December, they have received three such packages in only two months.
They tell me that they find that method helpful in dealing with
perpetrators. Last year, in Newtown in mid-Wales, five or six people
were arrested in connection with a scam involving the online purchase
of iPads and iPhones—payment was made, but the product never
arrived. The work at the centre to collect that information and feed it

one time, people could spot an STD—a subscriber trunk
dialling—code, and if they were a bit sad like me, they could
remember the places the codes were for. Now codes begin with 09 or 08

vulnerable see things that say, “Phone this number to claim your

holiday.” As has been said, they are suddenly through to a phone
number halfway round the world and they get a phone bill of

securing this Westminster Hall debate. She is a good campaigner in the

Members will remember the 2008 survey conducted by Age UK and Barclays,
which revealed that seven out of 10 older people in Britain—that
is roughly 7 million people—are targeted by scams every month,
either by telephone or letter. It is worth reflecting on what the
Office of Fair Trading survey said. The hon. Member for Meon Valley
(George Hollingbery) mentioned the £3.5 billion that is lost to
scams every year, which equates to £70 for every adult in the
UK. That is a massive amount, particularly considering family budgets.
The average detriment in a scam is well over £1,000—about
£1,200—which shows the scale of the problem.</hs_Para>

survey in 2010 found that around one in 11 —just over 4
million—people said that they had responded to a scam at some
time in their life, nearly a third of whom lost money. One in 25, or
about 2 million people, had responded to a scam in the previous 12
months. Around half of those scammed have lost more than £50 in
total, with 5% claiming to have lost more than £5,000. Three in
10 adults who responded to a scam received further correspondence from
the scammer, with more than half being asked to send money and more
than a third being asked to send personal information. Those statistics
are pretty stark. They show the sheer scale of the problem and the
effect it has across every
constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000080">Of
course, it is not a new practice. I thought I would reflect on the
issue in the way the hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob
Rees-Mogg) would and take us back to when we first find any information
on scamming. The first mail fraud dates back to 1660, when King Charles
II of England first issued orders 
<?notus-xml column=296?>regarding postal carriers. Some corrupt letter carriers had taken to
pocketing the money that was supposed to pay for the letter’s
transport and then delivering the letter anyway, because that was what
they were supposed to be doing. Mail scams are nothing new, and I hope
the Minister can give us some hope, 400 years later, that we have seen
the end of the mail scamming
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000081">In
the present day, as well as sending scam mail by post, scammers are
taking to new methods to target people young and old, including
phishing e-mails and scam adverts on social networking sites. I know
the debate is on scam mail, but it is worth reflecting that the
scammers are becoming more sophisticated. The hon. Member for South
Derbyshire asked us to look at mail in particular, but we need to
update the legislation on social networking and the internet. The work
that has been done by the Think Jessica campaign on that deserves great
tribute.</hs_Para>

is drawn in by a scam mail, they are often put on a “suckers
list”. We have seen some of those suckers lists when scammers
have been caught. The language used in scam mail is enticing, saying,
“You are a guaranteed winner”, “This is a
time-sensitive document”, or, “Reply immediately to
release your award”. Various other slogans and logos are also
used to entice people in for the first time. The scammers are looking
for the first indication that someone may be capable of being scammed.
They are not interested in the person who throws the message in the bin
or puts it in the junk e-mail box. They are interested in grabbing that
little bit of hope that they can take the scam forward.</hs_Para>

intervention, which emphasises part of the problem. I have experimented
with a few Sunday newspapers by scratching off all the cards to see if
I have ever not won. Given that the chances of winning the national

Sunday newspaper and win on every single premium-rate scratchcard. That

Labour was in government, we recognised that the consumer regime needed
to be more effective at stopping rogues, criminals and those who
deliberately set out to defraud consumers, especially the elderly and
vulnerable, through scam mailing. I am sure the Minister will respond
positively to the patchwork of legislation that the hon. Member for
South Derbyshire has laid out.</hs_Para>

government, Labour invested £7.5 million to create scambuster
teams across the UK. Those specialist trading standards teams work hard
with local police and others 
<?notus-xml column=297?>across local authority boundaries to come down hard on the worst
scammers. The cross-boundary aspect of those teams’ work is
absolutely essential, because trading standards teams generally find it
difficult to work across local authority boundaries. Since 2006, the
project has uncovered £55 million in fraud, saved consumers
£23 million, seized £16.5 million in criminal
assets and jailed 58 mail scammers for a total of 75 years. That is a
good record, but not good enough, and the massive increase in scams,
and the things that we have heard today, show that more is
needed.</hs_Para>

strengthened the powers of the Office of Fair Trading, and of trading
standards, with the implementation of the Consumer Protection from
Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Those regulations banned all types of
unfair selling and marketing methods, and, crucially, are enforceable
through both criminal and civil courts, to ensure that appropriate
action is taken against prolific scammers and to serve as a deterrent.
However, as we have heard, the regulations are not really serving as a
deterrent, given the stories that have emerged since this debate was
announced about people moving on to new scams when one is closed
down.</hs_Para>

Government’s commitment to further scambusters funding in
December 2010 was welcome, but teams in the south-eastern region, which
includes London and East Anglia, have been disbanded. Has the Minister
assessed the effect of that on the ability to tackle scams and scam
mailing? It would be interesting if she would explain whether
scambusters funding will continue.</hs_Para>

involved in scam mailing have never had it so good. The economic
backdrop of stagnant wages and rising prices has made consumers more
anxious to save every penny or earn more money. Sometimes, that has
resulted in an explosion of money-making scams and sharp practices
disguised as sources of help. In addition, we cannot deny that the
Government have squeezed funding on consumer protection, and
particularly trading standards, with an average 19% cut in overall
local authority funding from central Government. The Trading Standards
Institute has done an analysis of the aggregate amount of funding for
consumer protection through trading standards. The projections are
that from £250 million in 2010, the aggregate
throughout the country will fall to £140 million by 2014. That
significant drop gives scammers the opportunity to enter markets where
they may not have been before.</hs_Para>

important to consider the restructuring of the consumer landscape,
which the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) mentioned. The
consumer protection powers of Consumer Focus have been passed to
Citizens Advice, and there is a worry that that transfer to an
organisation of a different kind, with different philosophies and a
different set-up, might undermine some of the great work that Consumer
Focus did on the issue. The OFT operated an awareness campaign called
Scamnesty in partnership with 129 local authority trading standards
services. That was to increase consumer awareness of mass market scams
and provide consumers with practical advice on how to avoid being
scammed.</hs_Para>

is one of the most important things  that is needed as a result
of the debate. Yes, there are legislative and parliamentary responses,
but awareness  
<?notus-xml column=298?>is also needed of ways in which consumers can protect themselves in the
first place, and how they can recognise scam mailings or phishing
e-mails if they receive them. I received one such e-mail yesterday,
apparently from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, which said I
was due a tax rebate. I know that that is not true, but the temptation
to click on the link and get money back from the Chancellor of the
Exchequer was incredibly tempting. The fact that Departments are being
shadowed for the sending out of scam e-mails is a great worry,
particularly at a time of year when people are filling out tax returns
and may expect e-mails or correspondence from Departments, and
particularly HMRC. The amount was only £194.70, if anyone is
interested—but far better it should be in my pocket than the
Chancellor’s.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000093">It

is also worth reflecting on the constituency case raised by the hon.
Member for South Derbyshire about a gentleman who became addicted, and
how that issue might fit into legislative change. The data protection
issues, and requirement for the Home Secretary to obtain a warrant, are
valid only if the individual in receipt of the mail would not complain
that their rights were infringed. I wonder if in the hon. Lady’s
example the poor old gentleman would complain that he wanted to receive
the mailings—what he called his investments. They might be
costly, but perhaps he was willing to do it for
entertainment.</hs_Para>

highlighting the mailing preference service, which the hon. Member for
Meon Valley mentioned, by which constituents can have their details
removed from mailing lists to reduce the amount of addressed
advertising literature that they receive. The MPS does not cover
unaddressed mailings, of course and I suppose that the real problem
with it is that people who are willing to scam completely forget it
exists, so that all it does is remove legitimate people who want to
send mail. However, if someone is registered with the MPS and receives
mail that they think is a scam, their awareness may be
heightened.</hs_Para>

Mail door-to-door opt-out scheme includes unaddressed mail. Has the
Minister reflected on the matter, and will she embark on an awareness
campaign in conjunction with Royal Mail? The Foreign Secretary has just
said in the House that we do not spend money on advertising these days,
and he is probably right to say so, but I wonder whether there is any
way in which Royal Mail could help with the
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000097">I
want to touch briefly on the matter of e-mail scams. Surveys show that
73% of adults in the UK have received a scam e-mail in the past year. I
think probably everyone in the Chamber has received one in the past 
<?notus-xml column=299?>week—from people who want to send us bequests, or to tell us that
people have died, and so on. That is followed by scams via a letter, at
21%, and text messages at 12%. Social media sites appear to be emerging
as a new route for scammers, with 9% of adults having received an
approach in that way in the past year. It is not just older people who
are the targets, although I appreciate that they are the targets of the
physical mail. Young people, with the developments in smartphone
technology, and now that many of them have their own bank accounts, are
becoming susceptible to scams. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member
for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) will secure a debate on
that, because it would be
interesting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000098">I
have some information about phishing e-mails to Wonga customers, and
about how people are being sucked in, but it is probably best to leave
that for a debate about online phishing. Perhaps the Minister could
expand on what the Government are doing to make the public aware of the
problems, particularly when they relate to departments such as HMRC.
The hon. Member for High Peak raised the issue of such departments
being made to look as if they are sending information to constituents,
and what we could do to tackle that.</hs_Para>

that is posted, Royal Mail must deliver it. That is not its fault; it
is governed by law, and it must do so. I believe we all recognise the
importance of strong legislation of that kind, to give Royal Mail the
backing needed to deliver its mail door to door. However, could the
Government and consumer organisations do more, working with Royal Mail
and its union, the Communication Workers Union, and postal workers?
Perhaps, while there is an obligation to deliver mail, it would be
possible to pick up signs—increased loads, or telltale
envelopes—that someone on a particular round is at risk from
scam mail, and at the very least deliver an information leaflet, or
make the recipient aware. It might be very difficult for the House to
change the law on intervening, or intercepting mail, and that is
probably right, but there is nothing to prevent the Royal Mail or the
postman from putting an information leaflet on scam mailing through the
door if it is felt that such mailings are going to that
address.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000100">Once
scam mail has entered the UK postal system, Royal Mail has a legal
obligation to deliver it. However, there has been some criticism in
connection with Royal Mail’s “local look” service
offered by Spring Global Mail and Royal Mail, whereby letters from
abroad bear the Royal Mail postmark and have no trace of their overseas
origins. There are concerns about that giving credence to scam mail
entering the country. Will the Minister reflect on whether enough is
being done at Royal Mail to protect its brand, particularly in
connection with organisations such as Spring Global Mail, so that at

scam victims in the bin. The show’s reporter reads one letter

are mainly discussing postal scams, it is important to recognise that
scams operate in a range of different ways, and that the people
perpetrating such scams do not necessarily stick exclusively with one
particular avenue. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi
Onwurah) mentioned internet scams, which as e-mail users we are all
familiar with. Premium telephone line prize scams have also been a
great cause for concern, although the latter have at least decreased
slightly in number since the new guidance from the Independent

important to recognise, as the hon. Member for South Derbyshire did
when introducing this debate, that the vast majority of direct mail
delivered to our doors is legitimate advertising material. The industry
is important to the economy, generating about £16 billion in
sales each year, and is a linchpin of the postal service model in this
country. We would not want to jeopardise that industry, as it ensures
that we have a universal postal service and that we do not pay
prohibitively expensive prices when we go to post a letter. I will come
to preference services, as they are important, but the real villains of
this case are the fraudsters. Their goal is simple: to cheat as many
people as possible out of their money by making false
promises.</hs_Para>

is worth noting that we are all potential victims.
About 3.2 million people a year are victims of such scams, and the
losses incurred total about £3.5 billion. 
<?notus-xml column=301?>Various Members have stated that it is particularly an issue for the
vulnerable and elderly. We want to ensure that we protect such
individuals, but it is easy to fall into a slightly superior sense that
it could not happen  to us: “I am a very savvy consumer,
and this would never happen to me; it’s something that only
happens to vulnerable elderly people.” I was certainly surprised
to find when I looked at the research that the age group most likely to
fall victim to postal scams is not elderly people—over-65s make
up 13% of victims—but people between the ages of 35 and 44. More
than a quarter of scams affect people in that age group. It is worth
bearing that in mind.</hs_Para>

discussing scams that are often cleverly customised. Some involve the
prospect of a tax rebate, and are often sent around the time at which
tax deadlines approach. Some use information about individuals to
imitate interactions with banks of which they might be customers. That
is how the perpetrators of such horrible crimes try to dupe people out
of their money. It is true, however, that older victims tend to lose
more money—about £1,200 per scam, almost double other age
groups—so we must ensure that everyone is protected.</hs_Para>

interested in the different types of scam. The most common are bogus
holiday clubs, then high-risk investments, which are little more than
pyramid or chain-letter scams. Foreign lottery scams also lead to
£260 million in losses, whereas the figure for bogus holiday
clubs is about £1.17 billion. A range of different scams
exist.</hs_Para>

Member for Edinburgh South discussed awareness of the issue, which is
crucial. A variety of organisations, from the Office of Fair Trading to
the Trading Standards Institute and Citizens Advice, try to get the
message out so that people are aware of the problem. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) said and many Members in this
debate have repeated—it is a good mantra—if it sounds too
good to be true, it probably is. We must have a healthy scepticism
about things that come to us through the post, via e-mail, over the
telephone or by other methods, and ensure that people know what sort of
thing to watch out for.</hs_Para>

produced a helpful checklist of things to consider. Was the offer
unsolicited? Is it necessary to respond quickly? Why the rush? Is it
necessary to pay for a prize or free gift, or ring a premium rate
number that starts with 09? Are recipients being asked for any bank or
credit card details? Is the business reluctant to give its address or
contact details? Is the recipient being asked to keep it confidential
or secret? Those are all healthy questions to ask. It is not just parts
of Government, independent agencies or charities that have a role to
play in raising awareness; all of us as Members can do our bit in our
constituencies as well.</hs_Para>

awareness, enforcement is clearly a key part of the action that the
Government can take. In 2010, the National Fraud Authority produced a
comprehensive strategy to confront mass marketing fraud, which includes
postal scams and other types of fraud. The strategy  was set up
under the banner of Action Fraud, and the Metropolitan police and the
NFA have been working on it with a range of
partners—from local government to  
<?notus-xml column=302?>central Government bodies and stakeholder groups—to build a
cohesive response to tackling postal scams. That includes
engaging with Royal Mail and other postal operators
and mailing operations. Royal Mail is aware that the nature of the
service that it provides—universal access to all
users—makes it vulnerable to being used for scams. In
recognition of that, Royal Mail is working with the police and other
enforcement bodies to prevent scam mail from getting into the system at
the beginning of the process. I will return to that point
later.</hs_Para>

trigger is also important. If people suspect a scam, they should be
able to do something to trigger a response. That is why awareness will
always be important. The first step in stopping a
scam is knowing what a scam looks like, but it is not always
straightforward, as I have said. There is a range of advice on scams
and clear and practical guidance to consumers about what they can do,
and I will outline some of what is
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000115">If
someone thinks that they have been the victim of a scam or would like
to know how to advise a loved one who might be the victim of a scam,
the Citizens Advice consumer helpline is a good first port of call. It
is open during office hours on 0845 404 0506, and it gives consumers
clear, practical advice on what to do. Action Fraud is the place to go
to report the scams; its website is actionfraud.police.uk and its
telephone line is 0300 123 2040. The process is simple and quick. If
people are worried, they can go online or telephone and quickly make a
report, then the appropriate authority will be alerted so that it can
take action. It might not happen overnight, but action will be
pursued.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000116">Trading
standards can take action locally or it can refer matters to national

sanctions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000117">The
hon. Member for Edinburgh South mentioned Scambusters and what the
Government are doing. In respect of the consumer landscape changes, we
are giving trading standards greater responsibility for
consumer law enforcement, by transferring central Government funding to
co-ordinate enforcement activity from the OFT to the new National
Trading Standards Board. He rightly highlighted the success of
Scambusters, mentioning figures for what they had done in the six years
from 2006 to March 2012. It may be helpful for colleagues if I say
that, since 2012, that work has continued and is now being co-ordinated
more centrally as a result of that more national approach. The National
Trading Standards Board is now responsible for the Scambusters teams
and has matched previous funding levels, which is important recognition
of how vital we think this issue is, particularly in the context of
difficult economic circumstances. That central co-ordination will
continue in 2013. I hope that I have provided hon. Members with some
reassurance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000118">The

partnership, despite being in need of a new name,
co-ordinates nationally between trading standards and the
National Trading Standards Board and liaises over the border
into Scotland, with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities

stakeholder organisations. It is also heavily involved in other
activities, particularly in considering

caused.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000119">Various
ideas have been advanced in the debate about what could be done to
tackle these scams. It was either the hon. Member for Meon Valley
(George Hollingbery) or the hon. Member for High Peak (Andrew Bingham)
who suggested an opt-in system, whereby people could say,
“I’m worried about this. Can I opt in to extra
help?” There is merit in thinking about that idea, but it relies
on the individual recognising that there is a problem and wanting
support. The hon. Member for South Derbyshire discussed scenarios
involving vulnerable people who do not realise what is going on and
will not be open to such action. That said, it is worth setting out
what people can do if they are worried about this, and worth doing for
the many who have not, thankfully, been victims of a scam and do not
want to
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000120">The
hon. Member for Edinburgh South mentioned things that people can do. I
should like to elaborate on that. The Direct Marketing Association has
two different opt-out mechanisms. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the
mailing preference service, under which people can sign up to opt out
of addressed direct mail, but rightly made the point that that does not
include unaddressed direct mail. However, that association has a second
service, which is called “Your Choice”, through which
people can opt out of unaddressed direct mail. It has both services
because some people might be happy to receive one type but not the
other, so people have that option. Details of those opt-out schemes are
available at dma.org.uk. The Royal Mail opt-out, which the hon.
Gentleman mentioned, stops about a quarter of unaddressed direct mail
delivered by Royal Mail directly through its bulk mailing system,
although that does not apply to other items in the postal
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000121">If
people sign up to all three mechanisms, that will generally stop about
95% of direct mail. Of course, if people are freely breaking the law
and trying to scam innocent people out of money, they are probably not
going to be too bothered about following the rules of the mailing
preference service. However, the point was rightly made that, if much
less direct mail is coming in, it may be easier to spot something that
is fraudulent or a scam. These services can give people a little bit
more peace of mind. I recommend that individuals who would like an
opt-in mechanism take that
action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000122">There
is a desire in some quarters for legislation as a solution—the
hon. Member for Romsey and Southampton North has introduced a private
Member’s Bill, and  the hon. Member for South Derbyshire
mentioned legislation—which I understand. However, there are
significant drawbacks in reaching for such a solution. On the legal
point, amending the Postal Services Act 2000 would not create the
effect sought by the proponents of this approach, because the rules on
not intercepting the post are contained not just in that Act; they are
also in the Police Act 1997 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act 2000, both of which, for good reason, limit intercepts and set down
the process for which warrants are required. A simple amendment to the
Postal Services Act would not achieve the aim, and if those other Acts
were amended the unintended consequences would be
significant.

are consequences relating to privacy of individuals who want their mail
to be delivered without it being opened by somebody
else: I think that is the vast majority of people. I do not like to say
it would be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, because this is a
significant problem, but given the total number of items going through
the mail—60 million items a day through Royal Mail, for example,
making 21.9 billion a year—and even taking into account the 3
million people a year who are victims, trying to identify which items

are, however, things that Royal Mail can do, given the communication
channel in which it operates. Hon. Members have mentioned Royal Mail
employees feeling frustrated because they want to ensure that they can
help. That is often because the local posties will have a pleasant chat
and pass the time of day with people, or say hello to them, in
particular someone who is housebound or in doing during the day. They
are frequently the people who notice if someone has had a fall or been
ill, because the mail is piling up at the door, and many of them take a
real interest as upstanding members of the community. There is no
reason why they should not be part of the solution, and that is why
there is specific awareness among postal workers of such
issues—general awareness in the population is vital, but such
front-line workers have particular access to individuals, where things
are
happening.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000131">Such
awareness has already started to develop. The hon. Member for Edinburgh
South mentioned the lack of funds for advertising campaigns, which is
right, but 
<?notus-xml column=305?>there are other ways of communicating and getting information out there.
For example, Royal Mail has an employee magazine, in which the Think
Jessica campaign has been publicised, including contact details and its
aims. If postal workers are concerned about someone on their regular
round, they have a way of being able to pass on those complaints to
Action Fraud to ensure that the police and the authorities can deal
with the issues. That is
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000132">At
the other end—not the mail delivery end, but at the beginning,
trying to stop things before they get into the postal
system—Royal Mail is working alongside the police and the UK
Border Agency to identify some of the scam mailing houses. Royal Mail
has the ability to cancel contracts, and it has done so with particular
bulk mailing houses if they are found to have been used to facilitate
scams. Such action in the early stages is important, as is the role of
that trusted individual with access as a conduit for good
advice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013057000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013057000133">One
idea was that postal workers could have an information leaflet to give
out, which would be less intrusive than a power to open mail—I
have outlined some of the problems with that proposal. Royal Mail does
not leaflet at the moment, but I am happy to go away and take up the
idea with Royal Mail, to see if it is feasible and useful. In the
scenarios outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for South
Derbyshire—I can imagine the brandishing of the envelopes that
were pretty obvious—a leaflet could provide targeted and useful
information without being intrusive or invading privacy. With awareness
and enforcement, we can ensure that people understand the risks and can
clamp down hard on the people who are abusing the system and conning
innocent people out of money, causing a great deal of distress. That is

accept that my response is slightly disappointing for my hon. Friend,

sympathetic to the problem she has rightly outlined. The victims of
such scams are people who should not be conned out of their money. The
practice is unacceptable and, to use a word used earlier, cruel. I
disagree that we should deal with it by putting the onus on Royal Mail
front-line staff and giving them an extra responsibility to identify
things, then intercept and open the mail. Such an approach would be

general principle is that legislation is a last resort. Some good ideas
have been proposed in the debate today, and we can take those forward
to see whether they can have a further impact. Indeed, excellent work
is already going on, started through Scambusters under the previous
Government, continued under this Government, to ensure awareness and
that proper enforcement is followed up. Trading standards, Citizens
Advice, individual MPs, UKBA and the police all have an important role
to play in raising awareness, in improving enforcement and in putting a

consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000005">Before
I get further into the details of process, which are of course where
the devil sits, in an almost impenetrable fog of regulation, affordable
housing needs assessments, employment and migration forecasts,
judgments about housing demand and household social behaviour
forecasts—all of which are being made against a framework of
directives from the European Union overlaying national policy,
overlaying regional plans, which may or may not be valid subject to
potential judicial interpretations of EU law—let me highlight
the key fact that something is badly awry with the process. Simply put,
green fields in the green belt are being zoned for potential future
development. That has had its first public presentation in the further
amendments to the core strategy now being consulted on, and two sites
for 500 to 700 homes each have been identified in technical papers
supporting the consultation.</hs_Para>

as this wholly unexpected and unwelcome development has become public
and people have realised that their interests are absolutely engaged in
terms of local planning blight, the value of their property and the
quality of their environment, they have started to express concern in
debates in public meetings and on web pages. Greenfield development in
the green belt, against the wishes of the local planning authority and
its people, is surely a violation of two central tenets of our
Government’s policy of localism and protection of the green
belt. Set against what people rightly understand about our policy, what
is being contemplated seems scandalous. How have we got into this
position, and how can we get out of
it?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000007">Protection
of the environment and the centrality of planning policy in my
constituency have been plain to me ever since I first applied for the
Conservative nomination back in 1997. The constituency is wholly within
London’s metropolitan green belt and because of the ribbon
developments down the A23 and the A217 the green belt is at its
narrowest and most fragile. The villages to the north of the M25, which
bisects the constituency east to west, including Banstead,
Walton-on-the-Hill, Tadworth, Kingswood and Chipstead, have their own
character and charm. Their individuality has been sustained by green
belt protection and, before that, by the existence of substantial
tracts of common land, and the determined policy of the borough
council.</hs_Para>

M25 and the north downs area of high conservation value, the adjacent
towns of Reigate and Redhill complement each other in age, style,
history and planning policy. South of Reigate and Redhill are the
significant housing areas of Woodhatch, South Park, Earlswood and
Whitebushes, much of which was conceived as social housing development.
Without the protection of the green belt those areas would have
sprawled to envelop the villages of Salfords and Sidlow and form one
continuous development into Horley and on into Crawley. However, those
settlements enjoy abutting on to green fields, much of which make up
the floodplain of the river Mole, which is a significant plus of living
in those areas, which do not possess some of the architectural or
downland charm of other parts of the constituency. It is that asset and
the principle of preventing sprawl development that is now under
long-term threat in the proposed core strategy of Reigate and
Banstead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000009">It
is not the purpose of this speech to criticise the position of the
borough council or the inspectorate. In the end, they are the prisoners
of the national planning process and if things are going self-evidently
wrong in Reigate and Banstead, we must of course look to the Minister
to put things right. He is the policy supervisor of the planning
process, and I look forward to his response, both in reply to this
debate and on a more considered basis over the weeks to come, about how
to turn around the alarming environmental outlook for my
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000010">Having
tried to paint a picture of my constituency, let me go into some of the
detail. Reigate and Banstead borough has the largest population by
district in the county, and it is projected to grow by 18% by 2027,
mainly due to the large amount of development in recent years, which
has attracted young families and therefore the highest birth rate in
the county. It is far from being the largest borough. It is not as
though the borough, despite the green belt designation of much of it
and the entire Reigate constituency, has not done its bit in
contributing to national housing need. The annual housing target at 500
houses per year since 2006-07 has seen 3,689 housing completions in
that period, exceeding policy by more than 20%.</hs_Para>

infrastructure is under serious pressure. We are already short of two
primary schools and we will shortly require a new secondary school. The
local road network becomes paralysed as soon as there is trouble on the
M25, as it is already beyond capacity. This time last year, we were
panicking about future water supply, and today we are recovering from
the latest occasion on which the river Mole burst its banks on Sunday.
Development will only make flooding worse, not least because the major
development flowing from the 1994 borough development plan saw water
retention and run- off factors built into a
development of nearly 2,000 homes on the encouragingly named
Great Lake
farm.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000012">Taking
all factors into consideration, the proposed housing target for the
borough of 460 houses per year is unsustainable, and undermines the
green belt and the principles of localism. Frankly, it also undermines
any sensible national regional policy because enabling development in
the south-east further undermines the economic prospects of
England’s less prosperous regions. That number drives
everything, and takes us into the 
<?notus-xml column=308?>contentious area of defined housing need, which the Government set and
on which the inspectorate hangs its
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000013">What
is our objectively assessed housing need? It is not something that
local policy seems able to influence. It is a number, which in its
latest iteration, has been spat out of the 2008 strategic housing
market assessment. How that process was to be done was imposed by
central Government, and is so complex that local authorities cede it to
specialist consultants. That number, at 981 is nearly double the
requirement produced by the discredited regional south-east plan. It
includes market demand and a requirement to meet the needs of
migration, the sensitivities of which were again reflected at Prime
Minister’s questions
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000014">Reigate
and Banstead borough council is about to submit a third draft of the
core strategy to the Planning Inspectorate, the previous two drafts
having been withdrawn due to the planning inspectors’
non-acceptance of the plans on the grounds that, notwithstanding the
council’s assurances on site allocations, he did not consider
that they would meet the stipulated housing targets. Here, I would
enter an important concern about the process.</hs_Para>

sites have made up much of local provision over the past decade. That
is hardly surprising when nearly every property owner stands to make a
life-changing development gain for their family given local property
prices if they can secure unrestricted planning permission. The
inspector should be able, indeed required, to include that historical
pattern in his review of the council’s ability to meet its
housing target. The council, including all Conservative and Green
councillors, whom I have found equally committed to the defence of the
environment, has unanimously endorsed a housing target of 460 per
annum. That is significantly higher than councillors would wish, in
actuality, but on the strong advice of their officials, is the lowest
practical target they believe they have a chance of defending. The
council’s figure is taken from the south-east plan, which
remains in place due to the impact of EU regulation. I seem presciently
to have predicted in my maiden speech in June 1997 that that would
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000016">It
should be deeply ironic to any Conservative that the core of the
Conservative borough’s case is that to be allowed a strategy
that will give it a measure of local control, it must rely on a
regional plan, which Conservatives wish to abolish, but cannot because
of EU regulation that Conservatives oppose, to give it a housing target
that is unsustainable and inconsistent with any sensible balance of
environmental and economic policy, compared with one that would be
utterly catastrophic if consistent with central Government’s
2008 formulation of a strategic housing market assessment that could
hold sway
otherwise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000017">The
threat of a much larger number being imposed by inspectors at planning
appeals driven by developers, some of whom have already land-banked
parts of the green belt in the absence of an authorised local plan, is
forcing the council’s hand to contemplate future development it
would otherwise not want. Under that impossible pressure, the borough
council have had to issue for consultation a third draft core strategy,
which refers to green belt development by way of two large but
undefined urban extensions in the south of the borough, and holds out
the prospect of future development around the village of Salfords after
2027.</hs_Para>

your chairmanship, Mr Sheridan, and I apologise that you were not
informed that I was going to be replying to the debate. I congratulate
my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt) on securing this
debate on a matter of great importance, both to his constituents and to
the constituents of many other hon. Members around the country. He
referred to his prescience in his maiden speech, and I am sure it

other things.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend will understand, because of my role being a strange beast,
in that it is quasi-judicial, I will not be able to go into the details
of his constituency and how planning policy and the recommendation that
authorities produce a local plan affect it. I am not familiar with the
situation, and it would be wrong of me to prejudge any decisions, but I
hope that I can provide an explanation and even some reassurance about
what national policy demands of local authorities that are producing
local plans.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend will not take exception to my starting with what I think
are the fundamentals: what are planning and the planning process all
about? Any of us who have served as local councillors, whether on the
planning committee or having represented our wards in front of planning
committees, know that planning is an attempt to reconcile competing
demands and 
<?notus-xml column=310?>make difficult trade-offs on behalf of the people we represent. Very few
planning decisions are easy and no planning decisions are universally
popular, but we believe, as I know he does, that the people who are
best placed to make those difficult trade-offs are those who are
closest to the people such decisions affect.</hs_Para>

planning policy framework was the Government’s attempt to take a
blizzard of planning policy that we had inherited—not only from
the previous Government but from a series of Governments—and
clarify and simplify it, so that there were a relatively limited number
of national policy priorities that each locality needed to reconcile in
its own way. One of those policy priorities is housing need, and it is
probably on that priority that our performance, as a country, is most
disappointing over the longest period of time.</hs_Para>

years, we have failed to build enough houses to meet the housing need
of our population. My hon. Friend was absolutely right to single out
the previous Government’s failure to control the level of
immigration as a contributor to that need. As my right hon. Friend the
Prime Minister mentioned during Prime Minister’s questions
today, 2 million people in a decade moved to the UK. Of those, 1.7
million moved to England. Our population has grown largely because of
an immigration policy that none of us—I apologise, Mr Sheridan,
I do not mean to include you in this—supported. The Government
are now trying to bring that under control, but we have to accept that
those people now live here and have a right to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000027">Although
that is a big contributor to the housing need of the country, it is not
the only one. Something that we can all feel happier about is the fact
that people are living longer, and as a result, there is a natural
growth in the number of households. If people live into their 80s and
90s, while people are still being born, an increase in the number of
households will inevitably be created, with each household having an
entirely legitimate right to expect a home of their own.</hs_Para>

remains that the planning system that we inherited in 2010 had, for 30
or 40 years, failed to deliver the level of housing that we needed to
meet the growth in the number of households. What is extraordinary is
that it did not even meet the housing need between 2000 and 2010, when
we had a booming economy and the loosest credit conditions that anybody
had ever seen. In no year in that decade did we, as a country, build
enough houses to meet our need. That priority is important. It is
stated in the national planning policy framework and is one of the
Government policies that every local plan must meet, but, of course, it
is not the only one.</hs_Para>

Blunt:</Member></B> I would like to register a concern about the
definition of housing need. The danger is that it starts to look like
“predict and provide”. There are other ways in which
housing policy and household formation policy will adapt to how many
houses there are. I want to be careful about an approach that simply
says, “We must have this number of houses, because these things
are happening elsewhere.” The other things that are
happening—in terms of household formation, when children leave
home, and how rapidly or otherwise families break up—can change,
and they will change in the face of economic pressures, some of which
will come from housing shortage.</hs_Para>

Boles:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, but as I think
he would agree, although we should feel comfortable with some
adaptations, as he puts it, we should be profoundly uncomfortable with
others. An adaptation with which we were all comfortable—the
Government have therefore taken steps to facilitate it—is the
idea that redundant buildings, such as offices, should be easily
converted to housing, so that that can go some way to meeting that
housing need. Every office that we can convert into housing is a bit of
land that no longer needs to be built on to create new housing. I think
we would all agree with that kind of adaptation.</hs_Para>

adaptations are taking place in our country that no Conservative, and
probably no Member of Parliament, can feel entirely comfortable about.
The first is the number of working people in their 20s and 30s who
still have to live with their parents, or sometimes have to share a
room, because they cannot afford to get a place of their own. The
second is certain young families with young children, who have no
prospect of ever being able to afford a place of their own with a bit
of garden that the children can play in as they grow up. Neither the
hon. Gentleman nor I would be comfortable with such an adaptation,
which is clearly a response to the astonishingly high prices and lack
of affordability of housing.</hs_Para>

to dwell too long on that point, because that would imply that it is
the only policy priority of the Government, when it is not. It is
important for every local authority area to come up with a plan that
meets its fair share of the housing need. However, the national
planning policy framework, which was brought in under the auspices of
the Localism Act 2011, is very clear about the protection of the green
belt. That is of the utmost importance; its permanence and openness is
vital, and the NPPF is absolutely explicit about the importance of
preserving that.</hs_Para>

10 years, and the amount of building that has taken place on the green
belt is tiny. The number of times when and the number of places where
the green belt is encroached on is still, I am glad to say, very small.
It is very rare and is done as a result of a local authority going
through the process of a local plan and working out which bits of green
belt it is in the interests of the entire community to surrender for
some kind of development in order to balance the competing demands of
the

the green belt does not cover everywhere. It does cover, nevertheless,
a very substantial proportion of land. Interestingly, it covers more
land, as a percentage of the total, than all the land that is currently
developed in any way; 13% is in the green belt and only 8.9%, in the
whole of England, is built on or even used for gardens in any form of
development. The green belt is bigger than the total of all towns,
cities, villages and all other kinds of uses.</hs_Para>

absolutely the case that it is the function of the green belt, as the
green lung, to prevent cities from splurging into each other, which is
what has happened in the United States and in other countries. We
absolutely do not want that to happen in England. Nevertheless, the
green belt is a substantial proportion of land, and it has always been
the case that local authorities have, by their own choice, through
local consultation and the local plan process, sometimes varied it in
small ways in order to meet community
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000039">There

want to make it clear that they, too, find their place in the national
planning policy framework. I am referring to the broad idea of
sustainability on all levels. He is absolutely right that
infrastructure of all kinds needs to keep pace with the demands that
are placed on it, and it is incumbent on the local authority to make
those plans and not to encourage, welcome or accept development that is
not adequately supported by

kind of sustainability, although in a sense it is all one concept, is
environmental sustainability. My hon. Friend referred to the threat of
flooding, and it is of course clearly a national policy in the
framework that houses should not be built in areas of high flood risk

prevent floods from affecting those
houses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000041">I
would like to say something that I fear may be somewhat unsatisfying to
my hon. Friend. We as a Government cannot make the choices between
these different priorities. All we ask the inspectorate to do, and all
the inspectorate can do—I am grateful to my hon. Friend for
pointing out that the inspectorate should not be blamed for this,
because we make the policy and the inspectorate, like a judge, just
tries to interpret that policy—is to look and see whether it
believes that a local authority has adequately measured its housing
need, assessed the sustainability concerns, looked at all the different
policy requirements in the national planning policy framework and given
due weight to all of them in the difficult attempt to achieve a
resolution. I completely 
<?notus-xml column=313?>accept that in constituencies such as my hon. Friend’s, for local
authorities such as Reigate and Banstead, that difficult task is
probably more difficult than it is for almost any other local authority
in the

Blunt:</Member></B> I am extremely grateful for my hon. Friend’s
generosity in giving way again. When he spoke about green-belt
development—I want to bring him back to that—he used the
term “the community”, and I absolutely endorse that. The
local community may be able to see  a reason for developing on
the green belt, as Reigate and Banstead did, with my support and
everyone  else’s support, when it developed proper
access to  the Holmethorpe industrial estate and then created a
development of approximately 500 homes, now called Watercolour. That
was entirely supported. It involved access underneath the London to
Brighton railway line and it tidied up access to an important
industrial estate in Redhill. That was a very good example of the
community driving
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000043">What
the Minister has not said, though—I want to bring him back to
this—is that green belt is a national policy. We are dealing
with the consequences of two national requirements. One is the housing
numbers, and I would challenge how those numbers are acquired. I would
also challenge other points. If children have to leave home slightly
later because we are protecting the environment in our country and see
that as a priority, so be it. If we make this country a less attractive
place for immigration because there is a housing shortage, so be it. We
protect the environment for our children and successive generations.
The Minister and I may disagree on that, but that is a perfectly proper
debate to have. But on this issue, the green belt is a national policy
to protect cities from expanding ever outwards. Reigate and Banstead is
now dealing with the contradiction between the two. I just want him to
give an indication that it is fine for the community to seek
development in the green belt, but not fine if it is done otherwise, in
which case there will always be questions about why it is
happening.</hs_Para>

compelled to do so. There is no obligation on them. No councillor will
go to prison if they do not produce a local plan. However, we believe
that even when the process of producing that local plan requires them
to take intensely difficult decisions, some of which may not be very
popular with local people, that is nevertheless a better position for
them and their community to be in than to have no local plan at all. If
there is no local plan, all applications will be speculative in a

remind colleagues that this is not a marginal issue. There are about
700,000 disabled children in England. One in 15 families with dependent
children has at least one disabled child and more than one fifth of
children—about 1.7 million—are said to have special
educational needs. Far too many of those families feel close to crisis
point. I know of no MP whose casework file does not include countless
calls for help from parents of disabled children and children with SEN.
Parents are forced to fight their way over seemingly endless
bureaucratic hurdles to get the support they desperately need for their
children. Parents come to me, and have done for many years, exhausted
and demoralised, unable to understand why it is such a battle even to
get their children’s needs recognised, let alone be given
adequate support.</hs_Para>

in 10 parents of disabled children say that they cannot get the
services they and their child need in their local area. A measly one in
10 parents told Scope that the process of getting local services was
simple. Families with disabled children and children with SEN want to
use the services that many families simply take for granted: child
care, so that parents can work; short breaks, which enable families to
rest and a disabled child to enjoy a leisure activity; therapeutic
services, to support development such as speech and language; and, of

average more than 4,300 miles a year —84 miles a

about Autism is pressing for the right to appeal to be included in the
proposed Bill, but I want to state that it is important for services to
be right in the first place. A problem with the current system is that
the right to appeal in the tribunal process is exactly one of
the reasons why parents find the system so difficult. At the
moment, I do not think that services are meeting the needs of parents
when the first offer is made to them in relation to their children. The
constant obstacles and hurdles that parents have to go over to get
where they need to be is the most depressing part of the SEN
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000074">Is
it any wonder that people are so lacking in faith about what the Bill
contains, given that a former Minister has openly stated that children
and families policy is simply “not a priority” for the
Secretary of State or the Department for Education? Unsurprisingly, the
disability sector is worried that insufficient attention is being paid
to a proposed Bill, the title of which comprises the words
“children and families”. This concern is increasingly
turning towards the development of the local offer, as is illustrated
by the lack of detail and clarity in the Bill about that. Will the
Minister confirm that the development of the local offer is being
sufficiently prioritised by his
Department?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000075">That
relates to the point that I previously made. Services must work really
hard to ensure that they get the local offer right first
time—when parents need to put support in place for their
children. We do not want parents to have to battle against inadequate
offers that may be made to them by local services. If the local offer
is not of a high quality, families will continue to have to battle to
get the services they need and the Government will have failed in their
ambition for the proposed
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000076">There
are widespread calls for the local offer to be strengthened. For
example, Scope has called for a “provide local principle”
to be introduced to place a clear duty on local authorities to ensure
that local services—schools, 
<?notus-xml column=319?>playgroups, children’s centres and leisure centres—are
inclusive and accessible for families with disabled children and
children with SEN. That would ensure that where those services do not
already exist, there is a duty on local agencies to commission and
guarantee the delivery of them. Many feel that it is only through
bringing about a cultural change in local authorities, with local
councils and service providers thinking differently about the services
they commission and run, that a step change in provision can be
initiated. Such a cultural change is needed now more than
ever.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000077">I
have already referred to the strongly worded pre-legislative scrutiny
report from the Select Committee. Colleagues on the Committee have
recommended that the Government strengthen the local offer through the
introduction of minimum standards or a national framework, which I
strongly support. Does the Minister have any plans to implement such a
national framework or minimum standards? A commitment from him that the
Bill will include such proposals would go a long way to alleviate the
many concerns held by families with disabled children and by the
organisations that represent them, as well as by many local
authorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000078">There
is no doubt that local authorities face immense financial constraints,
which means that many services for the disabled are being cut. That is
particularly being done through tightening eligibility criteria, which
means that people with lower-level needs are losing support. It is
therefore imperative that the local offer meets the needs of children
with less complex needs—that was pointed out by my hon. Friend
the Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)—notably, the 1.3
million who have SEN, but are not eligible for a statement. The needs
of those children cannot merely be met by, as the Minister has
stated,</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13013065000101" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000101">“improving

of those children currently receive support from the school action and
school action plus programmes. The Government have announced that those
programmes will be scrapped, which has created huge fear and
uncertainty among parents, who simply do not know what support will be
available for their children. The Education Committee highlighted that
as a key concern. Will the Minister clarify exactly what support will
be available for the 1.3 million pupils with SEN who do not have a

the Minister gave oral evidence to the Education Committee, he stated
the importance of ensuring that there is a strong local accountability
mechanism for the local offer. That is extremely important for families
with disabled children, and will be crucial to the success of the local
offer. With plans to replace the school action and school action plus
programmes with a single school-based category, there is an increased
need for a strong local offer, as such children will be reliant on the
universal services outlined in the offer. It is therefore 
<?notus-xml column=320?>crucial that families are able to hold local authorities  to
account for the delivery of the services described in the
offer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000082">Ministerial
responses affirming that the introduction of a local offer will
“inevitably...prompt discussion locally” offer alarmingly
little reassurance for families. Indeed, in the proposed Bill, the
Government are relying on parents to create accountability for services
within the local offer, which they could well do without. At the
moment, parents already have to battle and struggle—and become
demoralised—to get things right for their children. We do not
want to replace one system with another that puts in place a different
set of obstacles and hurdles. Parents will be forced to go from
individual service to individual service to complain about inadequate
local provision, or they will themselves have to examine local offers
from neighbouring authorities to identify services that are missing in
their area. That is not acceptable: it might lead to a deterioration in
standards, and will not provide adequate
accountability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000083">I

weight and deserve a full response. Let me deal with the specific
points that she raised at the outset. In relation to the local offer
and where it will sit in the future provision of services for children
with special educational needs and disability, clearly the purpose of
the local offer is to have, for the first time, a single source of
information, which is transparent and which sets out all the services
in the local area and beyond. Clearly, there are not provisions for
some low-instance conditions in every local area, but it is important
that parents and young 
<?notus-xml column=321?>people know where they can access them if they fall outside their local
authority area. Parents need to know how to access all the services in
their local area and what support is available to enable them to do
that. Where the support is not provided, parents need to know how they
can redress that.</hs_Para>

of the Scope campaign has been constructive. It has supported many
elements of the Bill that we, hopefully, will be introducing shortly.
To allay some of its concerns over the veracity of the local offer and
over how parents and young people will be able to review the services
that are on offer to ensure that they match the need within the local
area, it needs to be involved in the consultative stage of the local
offer; I will come on to that in relation to the point that the hon.
Lady raised about the framework and where it will sit as a national
model. I do not see the local offer as a static document. It is
important that it is an evolving piece of information and guidance for
local people who have the opportunity to review, monitor and influence
it to ensure that it reflects everything that is required by all young
people with a special educational need or disability within the local
authority area. I want to have local people as involved as possible in
the whole process, and that is something that I hope to take forward in
the Bill, which will deal with many of the issues that Scope has
raised.</hs_Para>

local offer look like? What we have found from the 20 pathfinders
across 31 local authorities is that close involvement of parents and
young people in the development of the local offer, through the parent
carer forums funded by the Department, is a much more powerful way of
ensuring that the services that local authorities will provide match
the local need. To drive up national consistency, the code of practice,
which is not in primary legislation, will set out a common framework
that shows what should be in the local offer. We do not want it to
require local authorities to provide only what is in that framework; it
must not be a race to the bottom. It will set some parameters so that
both local authorities and other agencies and services know their
responsibilities and their duty to co-operate and to provide
information for the local offer. Parents and young people need an
explicit assurance that they will have that information available to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013065000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000089"><B><Member ContinuationText="John McDonnell" PimsId="1799" UID="13013065000136" xid="379" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/halltext/130130h0002.htm#13013065000136">John

that we share. As is illustrated in the Green Paper, the redrafted Bill
following the Select Committee’s pre-legislative scrutiny, and
the subsequent regulations in the code of practice, the whole purpose
behind many of these reforms is to put parents and young people at the
heart of the whole process—before the assessment and through the
assessment, the delivery of service and any redress that follows. That
can be done on an individual basis and also with the help of
professionals. It can also be done through existing groups
such as parent carer forums, which can be a powerful voice for parents

strengthen the role of young people in the system, which is hugely
important. We will move to a single system for those aged nought to 25
with a more co-ordinated assessment and joint commissioning, and
increase the opportunities for young people over the current age
requirement to take their own case to tribunal where their request for
an assessment has been refused. We will also pilot a scheme for
children to take forward an appeal if they feel that they have not been
provided with everything that they require. That is a huge advance in
ensuring that this system moves away from the huge barriers which the
hon. Lady rightly referred to in her speech. Too many parents are still
finding obstacles in their way, too much duplication of information and
that they are having to retell their story again and again. We need to
get away from that and have a system that has parents and young people
at its heart from the start, rather than when it is too late and when

present, the legislation determining excessiveness requires a
comparison to be made between the relevant basic amount of council tax
for the year in question and the year immediately preceding that year.
The relevant basic amount is the band D council tax adjusted to exclude
levies. A consequence of this is that some authorities are seeking to
increase their overall council tax bills by a substantial amount
through levy increases without being accountable to their local
residents and having to hold a
referendum.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13013055000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/wmstext/130130m0001.htm#13013055000052">Such
levy increases often stem from poor policy decisions by the unelected
bodies. For example, in Manchester city council, their proposals for
higher council tax this year are driven, in part, by a badly drafted,
long-term PFI agreement signed by the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal
Authority, pushing up the waste levy on council tax due to the cost of
rubbish disposal being well over the current market
rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13013055000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/wmstext/130130m0001.htm#13013055000053">Another
consequence is that a referendum principle based on the relevant basic
amount affects the amount a local authority can raise through council
tax in cash terms, which can be to the authority’s detriment if
its council tax requirement includes a large proportion of levies.
Metropolitan authorities have made representations expressing their
concern and requested that the calculation of excessiveness should be
based on the basic amount of council tax, rather than the relevant
basic
amount.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13013055000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/wmstext/130130m0001.htm#13013055000054">The
Government therefore intend to bring forward legislative proposals to
ensure that levying bodies are accountable to the public. The future
determination of excessiveness will be based upon the basic amount
of council tax (i.e. the actual band D amount). This will
bring all revenue raised through council tax—including
levies—within the scope of the legislation. Council tax payers
will want to see this change which will ensure that unelected levying
bodies do not have a disproportionate effect on council tax levels. As
now, we intend that the referendum principles should be determined on
an annual basis to reflect prevailing circumstances and should be
subject to the approval of the House of
Commons.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13013055000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/wmstext/130130m0001.htm#13013055000055">Local
authorities should be on notice that we will pay close attention to
increases in their basic amount of council tax in 2013-14 and we are
prepared to take action in response to any large increases. Authorities
should have no doubt that we will consider setting principles in future
years which are specific to authorities that increase their basic
amount of council tax in 2013-14 by more than 2% without having sought
the approval of the local electorate in a
referendum.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13013055000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/wmstext/130130m0001.htm#13013055000056">These

issue of choosing our police leaders is of the highest importance to
the future of the police. This consultation addresses the
implementation of Tom Winsor’s recommendations for a fast-track
inspector scheme, recruitment directly to the rank of superintendent,
and amending eligibility for chief constable rank to include service in
a chief officer equivalent role overseas in a common law jurisdiction.
The fast track to inspector scheme will attract the brightest with the
most potential to go on to become leaders. Direct entry at senior ranks
will make sure that there is access to the best pool of talent, those
who have proven leadership and business skills and who can bring with
them fresh thinking from other

it is clear that, following our tightening of other migration routes,
the entrepreneur route is now being targeted by applicants seeking to
abuse the immigration rules. There is strong evidence that funds to
prove eligibility are being recycled among different applicants and
that artificial businesses are being created. We need to tighten the
current rules to allow for a meaningful assessment of the credibility
of an applicant for this
route.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13013055000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/wmstext/130130m0001.htm#13013055000104">I
am therefore acting promptly to tackle this abuse, without damaging the
legitimate applicants who are important to our economic growth. I am
introducing a “genuine entrepreneur” test which will give
UK Border Agency caseworkers the ability to test the credibility of
suspicious applicants. I am also making a further change to require the
necessary minimum funds to be held, or invested in the business, on an
ongoing basis rather than solely at the time of the application. This
will apply to those already in the UK and those who apply to come here
under the entrepreneur
route.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13013055000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/wmstext/130130m0001.htm#13013055000105">I
emphasise that these are technical but important changes to improve the
effectiveness of the current rules. Those seeking to abuse the
immigration system will always seek new methods to do so. We are
vigilant and will take swift action where we see evidence of abuse. At

encourage them to invest in the UK where they will be made
welcome.</hs_Para><hs_6bDepartment UID="13013055000007" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/wmstext/130130m0001.htm#13013055000007"><DepartmentName xid="27">Transport</DepartmentName></hs_6bDepartment><hs_8Statement UID="13013055000017" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/wmstext/130130m0001.htm#13013055000017">Cycling

Ministry of Defence's (MOD) intention is to deliver the Astute and
Successor submarine programmes in a manner that ensures the long-term
sustainability of the UK submarine industry. The MOD is working with
its three principal industrial partners within the Submarine Enterprise
(BAE Systems Maritime—Submarines, Babcock Marine and
Rolls-Royce) to develop an efficient, coherent and sustainable
submarine programme, which will provide a seamless transition between
the Astute and Successor submarine
programmes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013074000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/text/130130w0001.htm#13013074000143">How
best to transition from the peak workload resulting from the Queen
Elizabeth Class (QEC) Aircraft Carrier build programme to the more
sustainable drumbeat of the Type 26 Global Combat Ship (T26 GCS) build
programme is challenging. The MOD is engaged in detailed discussions
with BAE Systems Maritime—Naval Ships, the MOD's industrial
partner for designated complex warship design, build and elements of
support work under the terms of business agreement signed in 2009, to
address any potential workload gap between the drawdown of the QEC
programme and the start of build work on the planned T26 GCS once the
design has been matured and the Main Gate approved. These discussions
are exploring a number of options about how best to deliver the future
shipbuilding programme at the lowest cost to the defence enterprise,
and in a way that sustains key
skills.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_30_PT_1/31892D58F01C765B38A0DCA480D91120065E2E4D" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="30 January 2013">Wednesday

suggest there is technical potential for up to 16 GW of fossil fuel
fired CHP in the UK by 2020. However, only a proportion of this is
economically viable. Projections suggest a growth in fossil fuel CHP
capacity from 7.4 GW currently to 8.9 GW by 2020. Projected growth in
CHP capacity is sensitive to investment hurdle rates and to the
“spark spread” (the difference between the cost of gas
and electricity prices). Our evidence suggests that CHP projects face
higher hurdle rates than power-only projects. If CHP hurdle rates were
the same as those for power-only projects, the maximum capacity that
might be brought forward according to our modelling is 12.3 GW. This
compares with current total CCGT capacity (including existing CCGT CHP)
of 32 GW.</hs_Para>

response for Syria. Following the Secretary of State's announcement at
the UN high level pledging conference in Kuwait, we are now providing
£139.5 million in humanitarian aid. With the
£21 million announced on 26 January 2013 during the Secretary of
State's visit to Jordan, this means the UK has now more than doubled
its funding for Syria in under a week to respond to rapidly escalating
needs. This is going to support those affected by the crisis across the
region, including displaced persons in Syria. In Syria, our funding has
already provided shelter and relief supplies such as blankets and warm
clothing for over 30,000 people in opposition held and contested areas
to help them cope with the cold winter months. The UK is also providing
food for over 120,000 people per
month.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013079000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/text/130130w0002.htm#13013079000042">While
aid is reaching displaced persons in Syria, it is not enough. Much more
funding is needed to ensure that Syrian people receive the support that
they need. The UK lobbied the international community widely ahead of
the Kuwait conference to ensure that other countries also stepped up.
Greater security and access for humanitarian agencies is also needed.

wider discussions that bring in all the Governments in the region. In
this regard, the UK supports the early signing of a Peace and Security
Framework for the Great Lakes Region. This is an important step in
building sustainable peace and prosperity in eastern DRC. We encourage
all stakeholders to address the underlying causes of conflict and
remain convinced that an international oversight mechanism, as provided

to trade and access its foreign currency reserves. They are therefore
having a significant impact on the Iranian economy, and the regime's

significantly to the pressure on Iran to negotiate seriously with the

export control system, whereby all applications are assessed on a case
by case basis, against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export
Licensing Criteria. The criteria make clear our commitment to assess
the risk of exports being used for internal repression or to provoke or
prolong armed conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or conflict in
the country of final destination. We apply these criteria rigorously,
including with respect to
Israel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013082000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/text/130130w0002.htm#13013082000079">Accordingly,
all licence assessments take into consideration, inter alia, the remit
of the end user and the specification of the final platform. In cases
where the proposed transfer is destined for a military end user we are
particularly mindful to understand how equipment has been used during
previous security operations and how it might be used in the future.
Staff are continuously monitoring the situation on the ground in Israel
to maximize our understanding of that situation—for example,
most recently during Operation Cloud Pillar—so that this can
inform our ongoing assessment of risk. We refuse licences for any arms
exports to Israel which we assess would be inconsistent with the
criteria or other relevant commitments.</hs_Para>

January, the Department used to produce a printed magazine (Link), but
this ceased nearly two years ago. We only hold one master copy on file,
which has been placed in the Library. The new version of the magazine,
DHLife, launched back in December, is electronic. It is hosted on our
intranet and contains links to other pages on our intranet which would
mean that while we could share the link, access would not be possible

Heath:</Member></B> Council Regulation (EC) 1/2005, Article 10 relates
to the requirements for transporter authorisation. Before a transporter
can become authorised as a transporter of animals in Great Britain, the
Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) will check
that the applicant or their representatives have no record of serious
infringements of Community and/or national legislation on the
protection of animals, in the preceding three years. This provision
does not apply where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of
AHVLA that they have taken all necessary measures to avoid further
infringements. Where a transporter applies for an authorisation in
another member state, it is the responsibility of the Competent
Authority in that member state to carry out the necessary checks on the
history of the transporter as part of their authorisation process.
AHVLA has no power to withdraw an authorisation issued in another
member state under Article
10.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13013085000035" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/text/130130w0003.htm#13013085000035">Organic

disease and as such reporting of cases is voluntary. Through enhanced
surveillance and DEFRA-funded testing we have determined that SBV is
now present in all rural counties of England. DEFRA officials are in
regular liaison with industry, especially at the Animal Health
Veterinary Laboratory Agency (AHVLA) investigation centres and through
their scanning surveillance Species Expert Groups. As the new season of
lambing gets under way we continue to share information on SBV with
vets and farmers on the impact it is having. Final results from a
voluntary online SBV survey for sheep farmers carried out after lambing
in 2012 will be available shortly. In addition AHVLA are working with
industry, including the National Sheep Association and the NFU, to
support information gathering on SBV that will continue to improve our
understanding of the impact without being unduly onerous on individual
farmers.</hs_Para>

young person has been in work continuously for 26 weeks. Following the
collection and quality assurance of this data, I expect the first set
of Official Statistics on the wage incentive to be available 
<?notus-xml column=857?>in the early part of 2013. The Department is working to guidelines set
by the UK Statistics Authority to ensure we publish statistics that
meet high quality standards at the earliest

of new provision to help young people into employment such as work

the survey is too small to allow information to be published below
national level, so comparisons of the number of unemployed people per

is important to note that local level comparisons of the number of
people unemployed and the number of unfilled vacancies need to be
interpreted carefully. Using a snapshot of vacancies at a point in time
misses the dynamism of the labour market and the regular turnover of
new vacancies being notified as existing opportunities are filled. Such
snapshots also typically miss the jobs 
<?notus-xml column=860?>that people can access in the wider labour market: for example, those
outside the local constituency and those notified through other

are affected by a change that the DWP is making when the claimant has
had no changes in circumstance. However, it is appropriate to end this
protection when the circumstances underlying an award are no longer
recognisable as those on which the legacy calculation was made.

Hoban:</Member></B> Since June 2011 the number of people claiming
jobseeker's allowance for more than a year has risen from 140 to 170 in
Woking and from 1,605 to 2,310 in Surrey. Comparisons over this period
are distorted by changes in the way people on government programmes are
treated in the statistics. Under previous programmes the number of
long-term JSA claimants was held down by requiring those reaching
certain durations to move into a temporary job or take up support
funded by a training allowance. This caused a break in the JSA claim
and those who later returned to benefit were treated as a new claim
with zero starting duration. People joining the Work programme do not
have their claim broken artificially in this way, continuing to receive
JSA until they move into a regular job. This has led to a rise in the
number of JSA claims with a continuous duration of more than a year,
but means the figures now give a more accurate reflection of the true
level of long-term benefit
receipt.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_30_PT_1/1814BBF9794FE66214F4CAF536E393DBD0D128F3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="30 January 2013">Wednesday

Code”), as set out in schedule 2 to the Telecommunications Act
1984, as amended by the Communications Act 2003, gives communications
network operators special rights to assist with the installation of
their networks. It enables them to construct infrastructure on public
land (streets), and to take rights over private land. Operators with
rights under the Code also benefit from certain Permitted Development
Rights under Town and Country Planning
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013090000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130130/text/130130w0003.htm#13013090000040">The
relevant secondary legislation related to the Code is the Electronic
Communications Code (Conditions and Restrictions) Regulations 2003.
Complementary to this is Part 24 of the Town and Country Planning

</I>DCMS has no immediate plans to carry out an assessment of the
economic contribution of heritage sites in each region of the UK.
However, the Annual Business Survey estimates that historic sites
contributed £162 million to economy in GVA terms in 2011; but
this does not take account of the wider impacts that heritage has on
the economy. For example, the Heritage Lottery Fund and Visit Britain
have estimated that UK heritage tourism directly accounts for
£4.3 billion of GDP and creates employment for 113,000 people.
While these estimates are not broken down on a regional level, English
Heritage publish yearly regional “Heritage Counts”
