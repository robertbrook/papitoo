response can be divided quite neatly into two parts. First, in the
short term, humanitarian access, co-ordination and security must be
improved for the Rohingya people in Rakhine. I have seen that for
myself and I am satisfied that that is happening. Secondly, in the
longer term, those responsible for the violence must be held publicly
to account for what they have done. Ultimately, the Burmese have to
deal with the issue of citizenship, and that matter is being reviewed
at the moment. The Bangladeshis need to play a better part in helping
out those Rohingya who are on that side of the

will accept. The country is coming out of a period of military rule. We
believe that the President has embarked on the right journey, although
he could move more quickly to deliver some of the reforms. The solution
to 10 out of the 11 outbreaks of violence has been a ceasefire, but we
have not yet seen that happen in 
<?notus-xml column=151?>Kachin state. This Government are helping out, through the Department
for International Development, by being the largest bilateral donor of
aid. We have also had many exchanges involving Burmese parliamentarians
coming here to Westminster. The more engagement that British
parliamentarians have with the Burmese authorities to show them how we
do things here, the better. Perhaps that might include you, Mr Speaker,

statement about the situation in Kachin. We welcome what the President
said about Kachin when he reiterated the Burmese Government’s
stated commitment to a nationwide ceasefire and to peace building,
although we do not recognise one or two other things he has said. It is
important that there is a ceasefire in Kachin state and that the
military in the area adheres to what the President is saying. It is

Burmese military is brought under control, the peace process in Burma
and the journey on which the President has embarked will be under
serious question. We are anxious to help with what is going on in
Kachin: we have increased our humanitarian aid, which now totals
£3.5 million—as far as I am aware, the biggest donation
in that area from any country. We are also one of the three bilateral

major donors in Burma and is working closely with the Government to
move from the ceasefire arrangements to political dialogue with all of
Burma’s ethnic

access to any health care, whereas some 57% now have access to it

important for that progress to continue. To that extent, the Tokyo
mutual accountability framework agreed by a number of nations sets some
indicators for Afghanistan in return for future financial support
post-2015. Support for women, including measures such as the Act on the
elimination of violence against women, is a key part of that and we

increasing part in political participation. Some 25% of members of
Parliament in Afghanistan are women, and there are nine women members
on the High Peace Council. Access to education remains key for the
future. Some 2.3 million girls are now in education in Afghanistan
compared with hardly any when the Taliban were in control. To ensure

their role will be providing domestic security to ensure that the

These non-governmental organisations and human rights defenders, with

people can be identified and protected. It is the intention of the

stamp out violence of any sort against women, wherever it takes place.
Unfortunately, there is too much violence against women even in our own
country. The Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my
hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone),
is taking forward an international campaign to end violence against
women, and will represent the UK at the UN Commission on the Status of
Women, which will focus on the elimination and prevention of all forms
of violence against women and girls. I would also say to

in Bihar, to help 60,000 more girls to stay in secondary school and
give 3 million more women access to wider choices in family planning,

Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr Mark Francois):</Member></B>
As the House will be aware, the Government announced the process and
outline timetable for the armed forces redundancy programme on 1 March
2011—the need for the programme being born out of the strategic
defence and security review and subsequent activity to balance the
books in the Ministry of Defence. Although in an ideal world we would
not need to run a redundancy programme, the Ministry of
Defence—like all areas of Government—must live within its
means.</hs_Para>

announcement
represents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T12:36:42"></hs_TimeCode> the
start of the third tranche of that programme and affects only Army
personnel. Announcements about who has been selected will be made on 18
June 2013. Applicants will be given six months’ notice, and
non-applicants 12 months’ notice, before they leave the service.
Although we need to make up to 5,300 Army personnel redundant, the
programme will not adversely affect operations in Afghanistan. As with
previous tranches there are a number of important exclusions from the
programme. Critically, those preparing for, deployed on or recovering
from operations on 18 June will be exempt from this tranche.
Similarly, personnel who are below the necessary medical standard for
continued service will be ineligible for redundancy and will be
handled, if necessary, through the standard medical process already in
place.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012239000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0001.htm#13012239000200"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T12:37:44"></hs_TimeCode>The
House will wish to note that because of the draw-down in Afghanistan
already announced, a final decision on those who will deploy there in
autumn this year will not be made until April 2013. As a result, the
final decision on personnel who are excluded as a result of the
“preparing for operations” category will not be made
until then<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T12:38:07"></hs_TimeCode>. We
expect at that stage that there will be a further tranche of
redundancies in 2014. That is likely to affect Army personnel and a
small number of medical and dental officers from the Royal Navy and
Royal Air Force.</hs_Para>

the process, the Army will seek to maximise the number of applicants
for redundancy. At the same time, we have cut back on recruiting as far
as is safe to do so, but as the House will recognise, the services
recruit from the bottom up, and therefore a steady inflow of Army
recruits will continue to be
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T12:38:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012239000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0001.htm#13012239000202">It
is worth highlighting that the majority of those leaving the services
as a result of tranches 1 and 2 have already enjoyed success in moving
to civilian jobs. All those being made redundant, whether applicants or
non-applicants, will enjoy the benefits of the career transition
programme. The CTP includes career transition workshops, up to 35 days
of paid resettlement, and training and financial support for education
and training for up to 10 years after leaving. The programme has
historically proved successful in assisting service leavers to find
work outside the armed forces, and 93% of those who look for work via
the CTP are in full-time employment within six months of leaving the
services, rising to 97% after 12 months. To that
end, 91% of tranche 1 applicants—more 
<?notus-xml column=172?>than 1,500 in total—have already found employment. That is
testament to, and a reflection of, the training and quality that we, as
a nation, continue to find in our service

gaps in the regular Army capability are to be filled by a doubling of

employer awareness events. Will the Minister therefore confirm how the
Territorial Army has performed against its 2012 recruitment target,

important matter. I will try 
<?notus-xml column=173?>to respect that spirit, but I cannot escape from pointing out that,
although I hear what he says, the reason we are having to conduct a
redundancy programme is, ultimately, the size of the defence deficit
that this Government inherited. The scale of downsizing required in the
Army is a consequence of that. Nothing he can say today can hide
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012239000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0001.htm#13012239000211">That

questions in turn—he asked quite a lot. He asked me to define
the size of the pool in tranche 3. The pool is up to 5,300 personnel;
it will be limited in tranche 3 to personnel drawn from the Army. It
might not reach 5,300. That, in a sense, is the upper

applicants for redundancy. Again from memory, in tranche 2, just over

With regard to recruitment offices, the armed forces, like many other
organisations, have had to be aware of the way in which the world has
changed. Many people who apply to join the armed forces now do so
initially online, rather than walking into a recruiting office in the
traditional way. Nevertheless, a number of people still use recruiting
offices, so we have rearranged the profile of our offices around the
country to try to adjust to life in the 21st century. My hon. Friend
also asked about people in the regular armed forces who might be made
redundant. Of course, one opportunity would be for them to rejoin as a

senior posts in the Ministry of Defence. We have already
reduced the rank, as it were, of some appointments, so it would be
unfair to say that senior officers are being completely excluded from
changes in the structure of our armed forces. They are not. We are
mindful of trying to deliver this in as balanced a way as possible. I
hope that, if nothing else, I have managed to convince the House that
we have thought about this matter. While this is a very difficult

Bill aims to correct a fundamental flaw that exists in our criminal
justice system. It is currently the case that the defence is able to
appeal as of right against any sentence imposed at the magistrates or
youth courts, and it may also appeal through leave of a judge against
any sentence imposed in the Crown courts. Yet the prosecution has no
ability whatsoever to appeal against a sentence imposed at the

This is the case no matter how insufficient the
sentence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012239000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0001.htm#13012239000291">It
is simply wrong for the defence to be able to appeal a sentence if it
is too harsh, but not the prosecution if it is too lenient. I do not
seek to reduce or change the rights of the defence to appeal. It is
right that it can appeal against sentences that are manifestly wrong,
but what is right for one side is surely right for the other. I have
worked in the criminal justice system for over 20 years. I
do not seek to lay blame at the door of the magistracy or judiciary. My
quarrel is with the system in which we in this House ask them to
operate. We must have a criminal justice system where the scales of
justice balance, not one where—in the case of sentencing, at
least—the offender is favoured over the victim of
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T13:19:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T13:19:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012239000292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0001.htm#13012239000292">I
have met both the Justice Secretary and the Attorney-General to discuss
this issue, and had very positive meetings with them. Through you, Mr
Speaker, I thank them for the time they gave me. I concede that the
Bill involves a cost element and that an extra burden would be placed
on the Attorney-General’s office, but that burden would be fully
justified in the minds of the public, who are tired of feeling that the
system favours not the law-keeper but only the
law-breaker.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012239000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0001.htm#13012239000293">Let
me explain why I believe that the Bill is necessary. If, for instance,
someone burgles a person’s home, violates his very household, is
caught by the police, and is given less than a slap on the wrist, the
public rightly look to the system and the House to provide a solution,
but currently there is none. That burglar can be let off without the
possibility of appeal from the prosecution, but if the court sentence
goes too high the defence can appeal, and that is simply not right. We
should ensure that courts never feel that they can be as lenient as
they like without consequences but cannot sentence too robustly, which
is the danger under the current
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012239000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0001.htm#13012239000294">Let
me give the House an even more frightening example. Let us suppose that
the burglar whom I mentioned ransacked an occupied home at night, drove
away in the owner’s car in a careless manner and killed someone
by his careless driving, maliciously wounded a police officer when
apprehended, caused an affray, in the process of his arrest was found
to be in possession of a knife, drugs and child pornography, and later
intimidated the witnesses to the offence. There is nothing, absolutely
nothing, that the prosecution could do if he were let off with, say, a
£50 fine.</hs_Para>

is simply not right. The law needs to change to amend a ludicrous and,
indeed, dangerous situation that makes me wonder why we have our
current system. Why is there such an obvious imbalance in the judicial
process? Surely no one believes that our courts are incapable of making
a mistake. Courts do make mistakes, and we therefore need a mechanism
to right the wrongs that will inevitably occur in any judicial
system.</hs_Para>

younger people to have confidence in our judicial system. The fact that
only the defence can appeal against a sentence imposed in the youth
court creates a huge danger that young people, as victims of crime,
will feel that the system simply does not care about them. The youth
court deals with some extremely serious cases, including cases
involving the offence of rape. Great efforts have been made in the
House of Commons and the other place, by the police, and by the wider
public to encourage rape victims to report the crimes in question. How
does that square with the fact that the prosecution cannot appeal
against an unduly lenient sentence imposed on a rapist in the youth
court, while the rapist can appeal if the court has been too
tough on him? How does that encourage more rape victims to come
forward? The simple fact is that it does not.</hs_Para>

gaping hole in our criminal justice system when it comes to sentencing;
a hole that has been overlooked, ignored or pushed aside for far too
long. It is time that we allowed the prosecution to have the same
access to sentencing appeals as the defence. It is time that we adopted
a common-sense approach to sentencing that is balanced and fair and
treats both sides equally. I hope that the House will give the Bill a
Second Reading, so that victims of crime can be put back at the heart
of our criminal justice
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012239000298" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0001.htm#13012239000298"><I>Question

Government tabled the motion in order to provide two days of discussion
of the Bill in the House of Commons. It is a very short Bill, with just
five clauses and one schedule, and it has been tightly drafted to give
effect to the agreement by Commonwealth realm Heads of Government to
change the rules governing succession to the Crown. It will remove the
male bias in the line of succession and the bar on the heir to the
throne from marrying a Catholic, and replace the Royal Marriages Act
1772 with provisions that are suitable for the present day. I am
confident that all Members will agree that those are laudable aims.
They have been public since the Perth announcement in 2011, and I am
very pleased that they have cross-party support. Having secured the
full agreement of all realms to the text of the Bill,

Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council, because he has
managed, in his role and in the coalition, to put into effect what
Palmerston promised: that the Government would eventually run out of
matters on which to legislate. It is not as if we have an enormously
packed legislative programme waiting for this House to turn its mind to
and to pass. We spend hours debating the taxation of lorries and other
such matters, which get a full day allocated for Second Reading,
whereas the succession to the Crown is to be dealt with in a truncated
Second Reading debate, a brief Committee stage, and then one day for
the remaining stages. That seems to me to be an insult to the nation,

Gentleman. We need time to consider constitutional issues properly,
because they have complex knock-on effects and their phraseology is
crucial to how the Crown might pass in future. If mistakes are made
now, we could discover that we end up with consequences that we do not
want, or indeed—this comes back to my amendments to this
allocation of time motion—that we are not able to consider
matters that are very pertinent to parts of the Bill because the
phrasing is too narrow and things have been done within a time limit
that makes it very hard to extend into these issues.</hs_Para>

would like us to also be able to amend the legislation so that a child
of such a marriage that the law would allow could be a Catholic, but to
protect the position of the Church of England, which obviously cannot
be led by a non-member of that Church, so that under the Regency Act
1937 a regent would be appointed to take on the role of Supreme
Governor of the Church of 
<?notus-xml column=191?>England and to hold the title “Defender of the

believe that we need to get on with this, partly because of the happy
royal event that will take place some time in July, and also because I
introduced my ten-minute rule Bill on the subject on 18 January 2011,
following a number of right hon. and hon. Members who in preceding
centuries have produced ten-minute rule Bills—if such a device
existed before the last century—to try to do exactly the same
thing: to modernise the monarchy and provide for equality. I think the
previous Member to do that was the former Member for Oxford West and
Abingdon, before he lost his seat. Such legislation has a long history
and the Government are right to fast-track the Bill and provide, in my

first argument for getting on with this is the royal event that will
take place shortly. Of course, the Commonwealth agreed the measure on
28 October 2011 and, as the Prime Minister has said, it is

example, was not just a matter between Parliament and the Crown; it
involved the people of the country, too. The process of producing this
Bill offers us no clarity about how to involve the people of this
country in potentially important constitutional changes. I accept that
that is not necessary in this case, but there would be circumstances in
which a threshold might be met. If we changed documents that, when
drafted, said that they could not be changed, that would require assent
from the population. That has been accepted in relation to changes to
our relationship and settlement with the
EU<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T13:46:15"></hs_TimeCode>. Perhaps we

extraordinary coalition of opinion behind the view that more time

member of the royal family, although we cannot draw on his name in
support of it. We find ourselves in that position because we have
opened Pandora’s box. Long-established opinion was that we
should not touch the Act of Settlement at all—it was part of the
settled constitution of the land; many people, including Catholics,
were opposed to any change; and even though others regarded the gender
bias as a outrage, they did not want to open the succession to the
throne to further debate—but as we are having the debate now,
and as we have these debates only once every 300 years, it is worth
suggesting some reforms appropriate for future centuries.</hs_Para>

was told as a child that they had blue blood in their veins, but I
think we can now regard royalty as being as good and virtuous, or as
frail and fragile, as the rest of us. We are unanimous in paying
tribute to Her Majesty, who has had a faultless reign in which she has
made no attempt to meddle in politics, but if we look back at history,
that has not always been the case. We have had plenty of monarchs who
were mad, bad or sad—some all three—and we cannot say

great concern in the top echelons of the Tory party about the fact that
Mrs Thatcher wanted to call a general election. Parliament could not
stop her; the Conservative party could not stop her; the Cabinet could

rise to speak on the timetable motion because there is a feeling in the

If there is any kind of legislation that should be hammered out and
discussed in full on the Floor of the House, it is on matters relating
to our constitution. We are the custodians of the constitution. That
constitution either expresses the freedoms we believe in or it lets us
down, depending on our point of view and the state we have reached. It
would be a great day if the Deputy Prime Minister, a former lover of
freedom and of an independent Parliament, rose from the Front Bench and
said, “I hear what you say. We will give you the freedom to

ending of gender discrimination, but does the Minister not agree that
the Bill, rather than getting rid of a religious discrimination,
actually reinforces it by excluding people from other

Conservative, I do not talk here for political correctness; I talk here
for religious equality and freedom. I think it is important that the
Bill will end a long-standing piece of unique discrimination. The
current provisions are uniquely anti-Catholic because they bar the heir
from marrying a papist or a member of the Roman Catholic
faith—whatever term one wishes to use—but I think that
much of that terminology is the product of a different age, when the
kingdom was threatened by 
<?notus-xml column=203?>expansionist Catholic realms elsewhere. However, those provisions do not
apply to anybody else. They do not apply to atheists, Muslims, Jews,
people of no religion or any combination of religions. I believe in the
freedom that the Bill will open up by removing that unique piece of
discrimination. The changes also do not affect in any way the place of
the established Church of
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012239000396" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0002.htm#13012239000396"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Gerald Howarth" PimsId="1032" UID="13012239000858" xid="291" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0002.htm#13012239000858"><B>Sir

sisters will no longer be overtaken by their younger brothers.

that applies to Catholics and only Catholics—no other faith.

that the male heir to the throne has the title of Duchy of Cornwall

just prior to the announcement of the royal pregnancy. However, that
approval was still subject, was it not, to parliamentary endorsement in
each of those countries? Therefore, will the Bill come into effect only
once the relevant legislation has been enacted in all those countries?

to come into force in all the realms. Interestingly, two of the realms,
Jamaica and Papua New Guinea, do not, for their own reasons, need to go
through the full legislative process. That is partly why we are so keen
to keep the precision of the terms of the Bill and the narrowness of
its scope, such that it can be easily adopted and digested under all
the different parliamentary and legislative conventions that exist in
the 16 Commonwealth realms. We now have a very short Bill of five
clauses and a schedule. I urge the House to bear it in mind that, as I
have explained, the Bill must be kept narrow in order to be adopted

leapfrog eldest daughters and are handed down to younger sons, or can
be lost entirely when there is no male heir. Personally, I am
sympathetic to that reform and can see why this seems like the natural
time to do it, but, for purely practical reasons, it cannot and will
not be done in this Bill. Nor can we can use the Bill to mop up any
other constitutional odds and ends. Put simply, it cannot be broadened

governor of the Church of England, which would, in turn, lead to the

followed that logic, however, we should be introducing bans on marriage

that under the current provisions, even if we did not proceed with the

yet decide, not least because they would be acutely aware of their
place and duty in the line of succession to the throne, that their
children, if they have any, were to be brought up in the Anglican
faith. That is an assumption that acts as a bedrock underneath the
status quo. We are only extrapolating that by adding the Catholic faith

the basis of somebody marrying a Roman Catholic? There is no provision

two points are at the heart of the Bill. As the Deputy Prime Minister
explained, marrying a Roman Catholic will no longer prevent a person
from becoming or remaining monarch, and the Bill will end
discrimination in determining succession so that a younger son cannot
have precedence over an elder daughter in the line of succession to the
throne<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:51:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0002.htm#13012253000087">With
regard to the first issue, it is surely right that the current
exclusion of individuals who marry Catholics be brought to an end,
especially as no other discrimination of that kind is on the statute
book. The prohibition dates back to the Glorious Revolution, the
1688-89 Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement 1700. Whatever the
contemporary justification for those measures, in this day and age
there can be no justification for maintaining the restriction on the
religion of the spouse of a person in the line of succession. Such an
anachronism is an injustice and ought to have no place in a modern
country with a constitutional
monarchy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:52:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0002.htm#13012253000088">We
are equally committed to ending the male primogeniture rule. It cannot
be justified that individuals are discriminated against because of
their gender, and that basic principle of equality is firmly
established in most recent legislation. Modifying the succession rule
will bring the British monarchy into a position similar to that of most
other European monarchies—I hope that Members will consider that
to be an argument in favour of the change. Hon. Members will note that
gender equality in succession laws was achieved in Sweden in 1980, the
Netherlands in 1983 and Norway and Belgium in the early 1990s. It was
introduced in Denmark in 2006 and is anticipated before too long in
Spain. The change is in tune with enlightened attitudes in many other
European countries as well as here in the United

origins of the current stipulation are in ancient common law, whereby
the monarch has a duty and right of care relating to the upbringing of
his or her close relatives. However, that was taken significantly
further by the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Although that statute was
promoted by George III’s antagonism towards the marriage of his
two brothers to women whom he saw as unacceptable, it was drafted in
such a way that it went much further than was necessary to respond to
his immediate concerns. Indeed, the ramifications of that law mean that
today literally hundreds of individuals are obliged to go through a
formal legal process involving the monarch and the Privy Council to
have their marriages approved. The Bill introduces a change so that any
future prohibitions are of eligibility to the line of succession rather
than of the

There are two possible options for the Duchy of Cornwall. One is that

revenue is passed on to a female heir. The second is that, as the hon.

Edward II did not invest his eldest son, the future Edward III, with
the title, but investiture later became custom and practice. The
position confers no automatic rights or responsibilities, but it
follows that if there is to

David:</Member></B> My reading of history is that when Llywelyn was
defeated by Edward I, a promise was indeed made. The King of England at
that time could not, of course, speak Welsh, but he could not speak
English either. He spoke Norman French. It is important to make that
point when considering such issues because it is easy for some people
to translate modern ideas of nationality into mediaeval situations. It
is important that the historical reality of the United Kingdom is
recognised, and there is a specific niche for Wales with regard to the
Prince of Wales, and hopefully, in future, for the Princess of Wales.
If it were appropriate to have a Princess of Wales I hope that people
in Wales would welcome such a development, and I ask the Minister
whether she would welcome such a move.</hs_Para>

am afraid that the genesis of the Bill is the “good
wheeze” school of government. The doctrine is much in fashion,
but it does not receive nearly rigorous or formidable enough scrutiny
from the House. Although the proposals were a long time in gestation,
they are not easy to construe, their consequences are not clear, and
they have not become in any way current in normal public understanding,
which they should have done, because the Bill touches on British
history and tradition but 
<?notus-xml column=221?>succumbs to the passing enthusiasms of the 21st century. Above all, the
proposals interfere with statutes that have slept for more than 300
years, and a common law rule of far greater antiquity. So seriously
were these matters taken at the Commonwealth Heads of Government
conference that Ms Gillard was reported to have said to our Prime
Minister on the day the measure was agreed, “Cheer up, Dave.

Parliament is more than usually obliged to seek from the Government a
clear understanding of what is involved, because we touch today on
customs and traditions that go back far beyond the great parliamentary
conflicts of the 17th century and change a system that has stood this
extraordinary country in great good stead down the generations. For
more than 1,000 years, except for the 11 years of the Cromwellian
interregnum, England has never been without a sovereign. For 1,000
years, the Crown has been the key to our nationhood and has served to
implant down the generations the habit of feeling and acting together
in national matters. The Crown has proved to be a most effective means
for preserving and strengthening the country’s cohesion and
stability. It is and always has been the unifying principle that unites
the national
family.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0002.htm#13012253000124">When
an English sovereign succeeds to the throne, they inherit 1,000 years

be treated lightly, nor ones to be trifled with, and, not surprisingly,
there has therefore been some confusion about what the Bill is and is
not about. The Government, as always, but particularly when dealing
with sometimes ill-thought-out constitutional matters, must be aware of
the unwanted, unintended consequences that often flow from tinkering
with such legislation. They could damage the crucial relationship
between Church and state as well as peerage law, and possibly interfere

are the position, when we look to the next Head of State, of being
infantilised by our own Ministers. We are told that certain letters

of the next monarch. Well, if they do, we should hear about that. If
there is a doubt in those letters, why on earth can we not, as the
elected representatives of the people, have those letters published?
Yet the Government recently decided, in spite 
<?notus-xml column=224?>of a court ruling and a freedom of information ruling, that those
letters from the heir to the throne should remain absolutely secret,
because if we saw them we might decide that perhaps he is not the right

us to consider a Bill that would allow the country to decide who will
have the vital role of Head of State, looking at the situation in about
20 years’ time, when all sorts of factors will be in play.

Members of the House of Commons, I think, I will support the Bill, but
I believe we have to bear in mind the points that have been made. On
religious grounds, the Bill strengthens the prejudice of the past by
not allowing all citizens the chance to become monarch. An amendment
was tabled to try to future-proof the measure, saying that in the
future there might be an inheritor to the throne who decides on a
same-sex marriage. What would the situation be then? Would the progeny
of that marriage, either by adoption or artificial insemination, be

Bill is making history in provisions that I believe are long overdue. I
will speak more specifically to clause 1. In 2002, just after I
finished working in the royal household, I published an article saying
that the Queen Mother’s death would be a catalyst of change in
the monarchy and the nation. I remember the time when people lined the
streets, others queued for hours at the lying in state in Westminster
Hall, many signed books of condolence and millions watched the service.
Those were simple signs of deep respect, love and admiration for
someone who had touched their lives. Why? The Queen Mother stood for
history, service and duty; she embodied a century of experiences,
inventions and discoveries, times of war and times of peace. It showed
that the British people care deeply about their past, and about history
and tradition. Now, 11 years later, we are considering this important
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0002.htm#13012253000147"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:28:02"></hs_TimeCode>Why

public support that her majesty still has in this country and
elsewhere. More than 15 million people in the United Kingdom
watched the celebrations on their television screens and the jubilee
was thought to have brought more than £1 billion to the economy.

right of succession passes to the sovereign’s eldest child,
irrespective of gender. I believe it is now time for change in this

all agree that, while human understanding has progressed over the past

legal perspective that that would leave Scotland the successor state,

was the Scottish reaction to the Act of Settlement of 1701 that led to

benefit of the House, the Scottish National party can allay
the fears created by the Act of Settlement: the monarchy will continue
to be shared with Scotland and England, and the need for the Acts of
1706 in England and 1707 in Scotland will disappear. We can therefore
proceed to independence and dissolve the two Unions. I am sure that I

aside, the Bill is surely flawed. Many people have described how flawed
it is. It is only a halfway house —a real
dog’s breakfast of broken biscuits. It deals with succession and
partially with freedom of religion, but it leaves the question of full
freedom of religion untouched. It also leaves with the monarch the
bizarre, arcane requirement for marital approval of six people in the
line of succession. Some cultures have an adaptation of that
requirement in the form of arranged marriages, but here in Westminster,
we are institutionalising
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000175">The
Bill affects other realms as well, and I wonder if they will progress
further than this Parliament and deal with this issue more fully,
rather than having a half-way house, waiting for Westminster to catch
up—as it inevitably will some day. They are free and
independent, and by doing so they will save themselves an immense
amount of time and hassle in the future, but they will also signal
their fairness and egalitarianism to the wider world. Indeed, in
Australia, republican zest seems to appear from time to
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:40:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000176">It
should be noted that in 1999, the Scottish Parliament pushed for a
motion for the removal of any discrimination linked to the monarchy and
the repeal of the Act of Settlement. So progressive opinion—at
least in Scotland—is 14 years old before this issue has come to
Westminster. While there may be a lot of huff and puff here at
Westminster about allowing the monarchy to be Catholic, practically, I
do not think it really matters. I do not think that the current or
future royals are likely to convert to Catholicism, any more than would
the King of Norway or the Queen of Denmark. The fact that a Parliament
has gone to such lengths to discriminate against a certain faith group
is surely odd in an international context. No doubt it will be ripe for
lampooning, perhaps on Jon Stewart’s “Daily Show”
on CNN because it is a step back and truly bizarre. I am sure that
history will judge it as bizarre, especially when we think that such
contrary views existed in the Scottish Parliament 14 years
ago. I am not sure whether bans on Catholics exist in Denmark and
Norway—if they are so allergic to the idea—or whether
bans against Protestants exist in Spain. Surely there is enough smeddum
and sense in those societies to remove such proscriptions.</hs_Para>

I hope that other monarchies do not hold the power over their
relatives’ choice of spouse—a power that is
rightly alien to their subjects when it comes to their nearest and
dearest. When Scotland becomes independent in the next few years, we
will certainly retain the monarch, as Canada, New Zealand and Australia
have done, but we shall remove such infantile restrictions as we see
here today. We will wait until the keystone Parliament—in a way
Westminster will always be that mainly due to the residency of the
monarch in close proximity to it—catches up. In the meantime, we

over royal successions, and in England we owe the birth of our
political party system to a debate on succession. The Tory and Whig
parties, which dominated the politics of the 18th century, were forged
in the fire of the exclusion crisis of 1681, some aspects and
implications of which have already been touched on today. As I alluded
to in my maiden speech, I believe that our monarchy is one of this
country’s great constitutional treasures. Its terms are not to
be changed lightly and its history, stretching back over 1,000 years
beyond 1066 to King Alfred and the Saxon kings, is something of which
we are constantly reminded in this extraordinary

through the long history of England and of the United Kingdom we have
been blessed with some magnificent examples of female leadership in our

has tended to be the case throughout world history that the queens who

Maria Theresa of Austria or Catherine the Great of Russia made a

England, the reign of the first Elizabeth was a period of trial and

defeat of the Armada and the beginnings of England’s global
influence. The reign of Anne saw the great victories of Marlborough,
the establishment of the Protestant succession, and the famous bounty
that endowed so many beautiful churches built by Wren across the city
of London. The reign of Queen Victoria saw the apogee of
Britain’s power and influence, the universal male franchise, and
the construction of the very building in which we stand today—a

perhaps more than any of those, it is our monarch today who enables us

Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth beautifully illustrated
the importance of her role and influence here at home. Our Queen, who
celebrated her diamond jubilee so successfully last year—when,
indeed, she visited Worcester, her “faithful
city”—has played a particularly vital role in building
and holding together a Commonwealth of 
<?notus-xml column=230?>nations, which form an unbelievably valuable network for the United
Kingdom in the 21st century. She has calmly presided over dramatic
changes that saw the constitutions of other countries overturned, and
has provided a thread of continuity through one of the most dynamic and
fast-moving periods in world history. Her wisdom and experience have
proved equal or superior to those of any imaginable man placed in the
same role, and the great charm with which she has conducted her reign

many other peoples around the world—to our

and a half centuries ago, my constituency of Worcester was the scene of
the bloody battles that began and ended the English civil war. People
who laid down their lives on both sides of those battles would view
today’s proceedings with some approval. On one hand, the tens of
thousands who fought for Parliament would see a Parliament infinitely
more democratic than the one of their day, with the ability to rule on
the royal succession and to engage in free debate on the matter. On the
other hand, those who fought for Church and King—the
“faithful city”, and its faithful citizens—would
see the beginnings of another chapter in our monarchy, for which so
many fought and died. As Member of Parliament for the “faithful

wholeheartedly support one of the main principles of the Bill, namely
the change in the male preference primogeniture rules that have come to
us through common law. We have taken far too long to resolve the issue.
Other countries with constitutional monarchies got on with it much
earlier: Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands all dealt with it in the
1980s. Indeed, it was much more difficult for Sweden, because at the
time the heir to the throne was a boy, Carl Philip, who was ousted from
his hereditary status by his older sister Victoria. Sweden took a more
courageous decision and we have been rather slow, perhaps
because we have felt so confident about our current monarch. So I
support the change in the Bill but I do have some worries.

more worrying concern is that when we pull out one of the threads of
the constitution, there is a danger of unravelling the whole
jumper—if the jumper is indeed made out of threads. I worry
because the religion of the monarch in this country depends on a suite
of legislation. The Coronation Oath Act 1688 makes it clear in
precisely what words the monarch shall accept the throne and what oath
they shall make at their coronation. That was reformed in the 20th
century and, in fact, Her Majesty the Queen did not use the prescribed
oath, as laid down in legislation. We need to address that issue; in
the past Parliament has decided what the oath should be, not the

Bryant:</Member></B> I have always been in favour of a written
constitution, but that is not what we are debating. The important job
of work that we have to do when we write elements of our constitution
into statute is to make sure that they meet any possible eventualities
that could come down the road, because we can never imagine precisely
what is going to happen. In 1936, we had a crisis because there were no
means by which the monarch could abdicate, so we had the odd situation
where the monarch announced his abdication and the next day legislation
had to be got through the House. As was said earlier, that took only 10
minutes, but none the less we had to make legislation on the
hoof.</hs_Para>

Roman Catholic in a Catholic church—the Minister said that Her
Majesty has been to a Roman Catholic church—it is difficult to
see how that person is not then reconciled to the See of Rome. I hope
that the Church of England will be reconciled to the See of Rome. The
advances we have seen in ecumenism over the years do not just mean that
we have rejected the ludicrous prejudice that there was about
Catholicism and the belief that somehow or other a Catholic could not
be a patriot. We need to go further, and I hope that in the ecumene of
all the Churches there will be reconciliation one day. I know that that
is the view of the most recent Archbishop of Canterbury and I suspect
it is the view of the current one, so it would seem odd if it were not
then the view of the monarch. I want to start asking whether we do not
need to change all the provisions in relation to the religion of the
monarch. As an Anglican, I would have no fear of a Roman Catholic who

but it was a phenomenal failure as a piece of legislation because in
1785 the Prince of Wales, George III’s son, married Maria
Fitzherbert, who was not only a Roman Catholic but the aunt of a
cardinal and who was twice widowed. The King was furious and refused to
give consent; the marriage was consequently declared null and void,
although even at the moment of his death the former Prince of Wales
insisted on having the portrait of Maria Fitzherbert around his neck.

related to whether someone was a commoner, an actress or illegitimate,
and I do not think that any of those issues would concern the British
people today. In other countries that still have a similar provision it
is not the decision of the monarch—it is the decision of
Parliament. Indeed, in the Netherlands, it was decided that one person
would be excluded from the succession because of their marriage.

all.</hs_Para>

Ministers to advise the monarch on whether to refuse consent.
Otherwise, someone who was No. 7 will suddenly become No. 6, or someone

am pleased to be able to speak in the debate, because the intention of
the Bill is laudable and sensible, as it will update the rules on the
succession to the Crown so that they are in keeping with the modern
values of our people. A monarch must reign with consent: that is the
case now, and it must be the case in future. The Bill removes
unnecessary discrimination, and it tidies up what we might call the
sinuous tentacles of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which is welcome.
However, I should like to make a couple of points about the
Bill’s provisions, which I hope my hon. Friend the Minister, in
the absence of the Deputy Prime Minister, will be able to address so
that I do not have to make them again in Committee.</hs_Para>

that positive spirit, I shall address the question of retrospection in
clause 2. I am instinctively against retrospective legislation, no
matter how good the intent 
<?notus-xml column=235?>might be. Clause 2 attempts to restore to the line of succession those
people who have married Catholics down the years. I quite accept that
we should remove the disqualification bar preventing people who have
married Catholics from succeeding to the Crown, but in making those
changes—the Earl of St Andrews, for example, and Prince Michael
of Kent will be restored to the line of succession—we are
changing the order of succession. Those further away than the Earl and
Prince Michael are pushed further from the line of succession by the
changes. If we are prepared to make changes to the order of succession
by dint of restoring Catholics to that order, is it not right that we
make clause 1 retrospective, so that female heirs of the Queen move up
the order of succession? Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, is the only
living person who would be affected, together with her heirs, so it
would not be a massive change to the order of succession, but it would
be a logical change and one in keeping with the retrospective nature of
part of the

the Member for North East Somerset may prove to be a dead Act in any

is a narrow number. Why not simply say that the heirs of Queen
Elizabeth II should have to ask consent of the monarch? That would be a
nod towards the present Act, which recognises George II as the fount of
all consent, as it were. It would honour Her Majesty in her diamond
jubilee year. It would regularise the situation and give that sort of
control to future monarchs. The Minister might be about to say that it
would mean that in 200 or 300 years there could be hundreds or
thousands of people to whom the monarch would have to give consent, but

that a younger brother will no longer be preferred to an older sister

step on the long and tortuous trek to greater equality of opportunity
between men and women in our society. It is a reminder that, in
modernising the centuries of tradition, custom and practice that we

aspects of our lives and our society in order to develop a society that

Catholic without losing the right to succeed to the throne, because
that removes a particular religious prejudice. As has been pointed out,
marriage to people of other faiths does not disqualify someone 
<?notus-xml column=237?>from succeeding to the throne. However, the clause raises a question
about the religion of any children of that marriage. Whatever religion
they are brought up in, and regardless of whether they have any deeply
held religious beliefs, they have to become a member of the Church of
England in order to remain in line to the throne. Is that a reasonable
requirement? Does it not mean that people will simply pay lip service
to religion? Is it reasonable for the monarch, our Head of State, to be
obliged to be a defender of the faith and to have a specific role in
the Church of England? We would not have to worry about whether
potential heirs to the throne were brought up in any particular faith,
or indeed no faith, if we did not expect the monarch to be an adherent
of one particular faith.</hs_Para>

and the Roman Catholic Church, we have a non-conformist tradition that
is hundreds of years old. We have people of many other faiths and many
people who do not have a faith at all. The Church of England is not the
established Church of the whole United Kingdom. In response to the rise

which will continue to prevent anyone of any other faith or none from

someone’s faith. If someone has a faith, they have a faith, and
if they do not, they do not, but if someone is expected to take on the
role of monarch, we are putting them in a situation in which they will

started small businesses in Erewash and a number of women serving and

continue to perpetuate discrimination, we have to recognise that that
discrimination has worked consistently to date.

Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames) that we should tread very
cautiously and avoid rushing headlong towards the implementation of

say for the record that I agree with the provision to change the rules

However, we have not sought public support for this change to our
constitution, and the Government should make provision for wider
consultation before they implement it. We ought to be 
<?notus-xml column=240?>forward-looking and recognise that making such a change now has the

2(1) opens up a royal Pandora’s box. We should be minimising
points of potential crisis, not creating the certainty that there will
be a crisis. That is why so many amendments were tabled on this
specific matter. While I welcome the points raised and reiterated by
the Minister about what the Bill does and does not do, I believe it
would be reasonable to insert in it a provision that ensures that the
offspring of the monarch—our future monarch, the heir to the
throne—will be brought up in the communion of the Anglican
Church. I think that would keep a lot of sleeping dogs at
rest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000257">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:29:17"></hs_TimeCode>

not change the rule that the monarch must not be a Roman Catholic. If
that is the case, they will make satisfactory provision for that in
legislation which could alter that settled position. Clarity here would
be a welcome addition to the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:24:30"></hs_TimeCode>. However, I
have listened carefully to the Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister,
who said that that was outside the scope of this Bill. I accept that
point and will reflect on it when and if we come to a Division

such a provision, the Bill could create a set of circumstances wherein
a future heir will have to make a choice between faith and throne. To
create a situation in which a person has to choose whether to discard a
closely held faith for position is simply unjust. We need to ensure
that we do not create the conditions for such a crisis. The Bill
suggests that faith in this day and age is a disposable commodity,
which is pure secularism. We should avoid that and make the matter
clear in the

the Act of Succession remains unchanged by the Bill, the Government
have a duty to ensure that the Bill does not create confusion at a

to leave the matter alone or to insert a clause that makes it clear
that the future Defender of the Faith will be brought up in the
Anglican faith, irrespective of the religious faith of one of their
parents. Otherwise, the Government should be honest and consider
introducing legislation that disestablishes the Church. That is a
matter for another day, but one that I hope this Government will not
pursue, because it would be a retrograde

be a canon lawyer, there are certainly things that we need to explore
along those lines. It is somewhat ironic that the two Ministers leading
the Bill through the House are both self-proclaimed atheists. I suppose

that point. However, Henry IV’s first act on the throne was to
pass the charter of duchy liberties, in which he asserted that the
duchy was his possession, separate from those of the sovereign and the
Crown. That was confirmed by Henry VII in 1485, and for the benefit of
officials and Whitehall it is important to note that there has since
been no fresh settlement. Perhaps the clarity we are looking for is

daughter as sovereign, who will take precedent over a younger son.
Perhaps that is where the problem lies. If a monarch has two children,
the eldest a daughter and the youngest a son, the Bill empowers the
eldest to become the next sovereign. It makes no mention of the Duchy
of Lancaster or the title of Duke of Lancaster, separate from the
Crown, and nor does it mention what will happen to the assets. Without
clarity, the Bill might mean that we have today stripped Her Majesty
the Queen of £300 million-worth of assets from her

the Member for Wyre and Preston North (Mr Wallace) about the issues

That leads on, as I intervened on him to say, to the question of the
Dukedom of Normandy, under which the Crown holds the Channel Islands.
Have the Channel Islands been involved in these discussions? They are
not mentioned in the list of realms otherwise. Have they brought
forward proposals 
<?notus-xml column=248?>to change their feudal overlord—the role that the Duke of

is widespread agreement that the Crown should be able to pass through
the male and the female lines. It is accepted by many people
that—by the virtue of a succession of Acts of Parliament,
actually—we have had the good fortune to have a most remarkable
selection of Queens as our sovereign. However, it is also worth bearing
in mind—there is only a tiny little note on page 5 of the
Library research paper to contradict this—that there is, in the
ordinary common-law of England, no primogeniture among women. There is
a note from a legal textbook which claims that the Crown is different,
but I want to know whether that is actually true, because when we look
at the succession of female sovereigns, we see that almost all have
succeeded by Act of Parliament. Mary I took precedence over Elizabeth I
by virtue of Henry VIII’s Third Succession Act of 1543. The Bill
of Rights gave Queen Mary precedence over Queen Anne. The Act of
Settlement gave the Electress Sophia precedence over her elder sister,
Louise, who, in spite of being alive at the time, was ignored
altogether in the succession. Victoria was the only claimant. The
succession of our own Queen is the only instance in which there has
been female primogeniture. At every other time, the succession has been
established by law. I do not understand why the Bill does not clarify
that
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000321" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000321"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:55:10"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Wayne David" PimsId="2854" UID="13012253000799" xid="156" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000799">Wayne

extraordinarily well. This is the time, while we are legislating on the
issue, to clarify the order of precedence among sisters. Otherwise,
there is a risk that clause 1 will simply provide that the children of
the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would be co-heirs to the Crown.

whether Princess Margaret could have claimed the throne in 1952 is an
interesting one. Surely the best time to settle this once and for all

primogeniture has the same effect as male primogeniture, and that the

that detail ignored in the Bill? It seems to me that the main reasons

how dukedoms will pass. Will they pass as ordinary titles, or are they

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> I agree with my right hon. Friend. It would be
perfectly reasonable to leave the law of the land as it is, or to make
provision for a regency, which would address the problem. Under the
Regency Act 1937, the regent would be required to be a Protestant and
would therefore be able to carry out the functions of supreme governor
of the Church of England for a period when the Crown was being held by
a
Catholic.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000329">Again,
however, there are issues with the detail. I raised with the Minister
the issue of Counsellors of State. Who is eligible to be a Counsellor
of State is set out in the Regency Act 1937. It is usually the closest
members of the sovereign’s family, including people who are not
of the blood royal, so this includes the late Queen Elizabeth, the
Queen mother and the Duke of Edinburgh: they both were or are eligible
to be Counsellors of State. Once a Catholic is allowed to marry an heir
to the throne, it is perfectly possible for the two Counsellors of
State—they always act in pairs—to be Catholics. During a
brief incapacity of the Crown or during the Crown’s absence
abroad, appointments in the Church of England would have to be made by
Roman Catholics, which is a felony under the Catholic Emancipation
Act 1829. It seems to me that Her Majesty’s
Government are simply not aware of the detail of our constitutional
settlement, and have pushed this clause through without considering the
detailed ramifications.</hs_Para>

bit of the Bill for which I have the most sympathy is the clause
abolishing the Royal Marriages Act 1772. I intervened earlier to cite a
quotation from it that makes it the most nonsensical Act on the statute
book since the marriage of Princess Alexandra, as she then was, to the
then Prince of Wales. Princess Alexandra and her descendants were
exempt under the section I read out earlier to the effect that royal
princesses who married foreigners and their heirs were exempted from
the Act. The marriage of Princess Louisa, the daughter of
George II, 
<?notus-xml column=250?>exempted her line, and through Princess Alexandra our
current Queen and all the members of her family are exempted. This Act
of Parliament has only affected people for whom it did not really
matter who they married and it has not affected the people for whom it

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:02:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher) said, the ability to get
an exclusion from Parliament at the age of 25 has been removed, so more
onerous legislation has resulted, taking people out of the line of
succession rather than simply invalidating the marriage. Provisions
have been put in place that are harsher than those of an Act that was

doing it. There is nothing so silly as cannot be done by them jointly.
That, I am afraid, is what we find with this Bill. Let us hope that
when we come to Report—or more likely, perhaps, in the other
place—the technicalities and the detail can be gone through, so
that we do not find that the Duke of Lancaster ends up being one person
and the sovereign another; so that we do not find that the Church of
England is accidentally being run for a week by a couple of papists who
happen to be Counsellors of State; so that we do not find that an
onerous charge is put on royal marriages so that the royals cannot
marry when they want—or, indeed, so that the more junior members
of the royal family cannot marry at all because if they are not subject
to the Royal Marriages Act 1772, they are excluded from ordinary
marriage legislation, so how are they going to get married? I really
think that it is time to have a look at the

Rogerson</B> (North Cornwall) (LD):</Member> Like several other
Members, I had not planned to speak on Second Reading, but then I
thought about some of the issues involving the Duchy of Cornwall.
Others have referred to the Duchy of Lancaster and, indeed, to the
Duchy of Normandy, which I had not considered but which I believe has a
separate status, in that it was not created by a monarch but was held
by previous monarchs prior to their accession to the throne of England.
I was interested when the hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob
Rees-Mogg) tempted the usual channels to consider creating a new
calendar for the country, as Napoleon did during one of his tenures,
but I shall not pursue that issue.</hs_Para>

Members for Caerphilly (Wayne David) and for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr
MacNeil) were proud of the Celtic identity of at least two of the
houses that have ruled over England and, in one case, Scotland. We have
of course been a multicultural nation: Norman French, Welsh, Scots, and
people of German descent have reigned over us successively. Perhaps at
some time in the future there will be a dynastic war, following which
an Anglo-Saxon will reclaim the throne on which Harold last
sat.</hs_Para>

interested in the religious dimension, which other Members have already
explored. On Sunday, after attending mass as a Roman Catholic, I moved
to the other side of Bodmin to attend the Anglican christening of my
niece. A warm welcome was extended to all of us by the rector of the
church of St Petroc, who was keen to inform us that the Norman font had
been moved, that it was one of the oldest parts of the church, and that
it had escaped the damage done by that great vandal King Henry VIII. I
wondered which of the Churches I was delighting in at that point, as
the rector seemed so eager to draw attention to something with which I
might have been a little more in
agreement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000337">In
principle, I am very happy with the proposal in the Bill to update the
rules of succession in line with changes in society so that an eldest
female child can inherit the throne. The hon. Member for Caerphilly
listed countries that had got there before us. If Hanover had got there
before us in the 1830s, the history of western Europe might have been
different. Had the kingdom of Hanover still been united with the United
Kingdom, it might have had all kinds of influences when it came to the
unification of
Germany.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000338">As
one who represents a Cornish constituency, however, I am keen to
explore issues relating to the Duchy of Cornwall. The hon. Member for
Wyre and Preston North (Mr Wallace), who spoke about the Duchy of
Lancaster, said that it was his understanding that the Duchy of
Cornwall was recreated whenever there was a male heir, but that is not
my understanding. My understanding is that it does not disappear and
revert to the Crown in its entirety, but is held by the Crown pending
the arrival of a future male heir to the throne. The institution of the
Duchy is a continuous organisation, which has been keen to assert its
rights on a number of occasions throughout history: its right to the
foreshore, for instance, and its right to bona vacantia in
Cornwall.</hs_Para>

Member for Wyre and Preston North spoke of the property that is owned.
I am not as familiar with the Duchy of Lancaster as he is, but I think
that there is a distinction between the rights to property that the
Duchy of Cornwall, for example, owns elsewhere in the country as a
private estate, and the rights that it has in terms of the territory of
Cornwall, which are far deeper. Perhaps at some point I could discuss
the issue with the Minister, or, indeed, with my right hon. Friend the
Deputy Prime
Minister.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000340">Those
involved in the tin mining industry in Cornwall had their own
Parliament, the Stannary Parliament. It was dissolved in 1753, which is
not an incredibly long time ago in constitutional terms. The question
of who becomes the Duke of Cornwall is not just financial; it is far
more important than that, because it also involves a constitutional
issue. The Bill makes it more likely that 
<?notus-xml column=252?>there will be periods without a Duke of Cornwall when the heir to the
throne is female. I hope that the Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister
will agree to meet me to discuss some of these issues and that prior to
such a meeting they might allow me to have access to the translation of
the charters that established the Duchy of Cornwall. They might have
those to hand and that would allow us to have an interesting
exploration into what might be done to deal with these issues as they
pertain to the Duchy of Cornwall.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax) that my mother wrote
a book called “A Plain Man’s Guide to the Glorious
Revolution, 1688”. It was on sale in this place and it sold many
copies. The point my mother always made was about how Catholicism was
seen in the 17th century. People were not prejudiced against it; they
feared it, because it was seen as owing allegiance beyond these
islands. That was why Catholicism represented a threat; it is rather
like how some of us see the European Union today or how some of us saw
communism in the latter part of the 20th century. To measure the
Catholicism of those times against our views today is a mistake; we
should put it in its historical context. I salute my hon. Friend and

somebody of any other faith. That is possible today and the Bill should
not raise further fears. We should be able to accept, debate and deal

want to start with the implications for the established Church of the
changes we have discussed today. I reassure all hon. Members that the
changes proposed in the Bill are limited to removing the bar on
marriage to a Roman Catholic. I think all Members know that. The Bill
does not allow a Roman Catholic to accede to the throne and in no way
touches the basis of the established Church. Indeed, the Church of
England has made that clear in its own words. I have already quoted the
words in the other place of the Bishop of Blackburn, which are helpful
to our debate.</hs_Para>

Members raised the possibility of an heir entering into a mixed
Anglican and Catholic marriage and discussed what would happen under

constitutional crisis, and I want to reassure them. There is an example
of that in the royal family in Lord Frederick and Lady Gabriella
Windsor, the son and daughter of Prince Michael of Kent. He married a
Catholic, but the children have been brought up in the Anglican

for the edification of our colleagues, but I do not see how that
detracts from the main point that it has been possible to take a
pragmatic view of how the modern monarchy must function. We have
already spoken about the relevant guidance, which suggests that one
should do one’s best to have the children raised as Catholics
but that there could be just and reasonable cause for not doing so. The
protection of the place of the established Church is a rather large
cause and some colleagues mentioned that.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:16:07"></hs_TimeCode>The Church of
England, as I have said, has made it clear that the requirement to join
communion with the Church of England is not

right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Sussex asked whether the
legislation would make it more likely that we will have a Catholic
monarch. No, it does not. It makes it more likely that the heir to the
throne may marry a Catholic—that is what the legislation
does—but the bar remains on the sovereign being a Roman
Catholic. There is no more need for a constitutional crisis now than
there was before, as I said to

should like to deal with the point that has been raised a couple of
times about, shall we say, the human misery of having to choose between
one’s faith and the throne. Let us not forget that there is a
particular piece of misery already available under the existing
constitutional arrangements, which is not being able to marry the
person you love. It is important to note that that is already available
to anyone who wishes that particular form of difficulty. It is evident
to everyone in the country that the huge public popularity of the
wedding of certain members of the family in recent years shows that
members of a modern monarchy do and can marry for love, and we ought to
consider that as we discuss the tensions that that family may
feel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:22:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

something that is touched on in amendments which have not been

succession. We are confident that it is clear, having regard to the
succession to the Crown in 1952, that when a monarch dies the eldest
daughter, if there are two, would succeed. We believe that there is no
need to make statutory provision to address that. I am grateful for the
points that my hon. Friend made about the Counsellors of State, who are
the spouse of the monarch and the next four individuals in the line of
succession, except where they are disqualified by virtue of being Roman
Catholic. I thank my hon. Friend for the breadth of ground covered by
his other points; we may have a chance to return to that.</hs_Para>

to retrospective measures,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:23:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher) suggested that clause 2
ought not to apply retrospectively. We are dealing with the need to
respect realistic changes to the legitimate expectations of those
closest to the throne, so there are differences in what clauses 1 and 2
do. We may come on to that in Committee.

that it may well be in the public interest that consent should be given
for the marriage of someone who may become our Head of State. Other

that it is important that the line of succession should be clear and in
no doubt. I think that legislation relating to the succession to the
Crown needs to be unambiguous and not allow potential risks to come in
because of a mistake in the drafting. We want to know who our sovereign
will be, to whom we owe loyalty and all such things, and that might not
be possible if we do not know the line of succession.</hs_Para>

is also worth bearing in mind that the succession can leap about. We

2 provides for a major change to the laws of succession to the Crown

removes the bar on anyone who marries a Roman Catholic from becoming
monarch; that is the purpose of subsection (1). Subsection
(2) applies the change retrospectively to anyone who is currently in
the line of succession. That means that people who have lost their
place in the line of succession because of their marriage to a Roman
Catholic will regain their place. Further to the point made by my hon.

England, because there are no changes to the part of the Act of
Settlement that requires the monarch to be a Protestant. I note the
interest of some in the Chamber in that point and I re-emphasise it
here in Committee. All the clause will do is remove a specifically
anti-Catholic provision that bars a person from succeeding to the Crown
or possessing it if they are married to a Catholic. As I said, it is
worth remembering that there is no bar on the heir to the throne
marrying anybody
else.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000411"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Bryant" PimsId="2350" UID="13012253000834" xid="76" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000834">Chris
Bryant:</Member></B> I want to clarify the point that I have asked
about twice and that no Minister has replied to. Clause 2 says that
someone who marries a Roman Catholic can succeed to the Crown, but
clause 3 allows the monarch to remove somebody from the succession by
refusing to consent to their marriage. As no reason has to be given why
consent is not provided, it could be because the person is Roman
Catholic, could it
not?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000412" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000412"><B><Member ContinuationText="Miss Chloe Smith" PimsId="5443" UID="13012253000835" xid="935" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000835">Miss

question again because there was unfortunately little time to answer it
in detail when winding up the Second Reading debate.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:44:12"></hs_TimeCode> might be
worth looking back at some precedents. The point about whether, under
clause 3, the monarch would be advised by Ministers was also raised on
Second Reading. I hope you will forgive me, Mr Bone, if I deal a little
with clause 3 in this debate.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:35:00"></hs_TimeCode> 1967, when
there was a question about the marriage—in that case, marriage
following a divorce—of a member of the royal family, the then
Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, devised a formula that ran along these
lines: “The Cabinet has advised the Queen to give her consent
and Her Majesty has signified her intention to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:40:20"></hs_TimeCode>.” That
provides an insight into how such advice to the monarch might operate.
We have had many debates, connected to this topic and more widely in
the media, about advice to and from the monarch and the publication of
such correspondence, and I will not stray on to that territory now.
However, it should be perfectly reasonable and practical to imagine
that there would be such advice to the
monarch<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:40:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0003.htm#13012253000413">The
hon. Gentleman asks specifically whether that would include withholding
consent to marriage because the person is a Catholic. I will not answer
that today because, for a range of reasons, there should be space
within such advice with regard to consent. As I explained at the end of
Second Reading, it is not unreasonable to have the notion of consent to
marriage. After all, we are dealing with those who may become Head of
State in due course, so there is a matter of public interest. I hope
that that begins to provide an answer to the hon.

discrimination from law. That is clearly what it does—up to a
point. It removes a blatant bit of sectarian discrimination that would
prevent somebody remaining in the line of succession if they married a
Roman Catholic. However, as we have heard, it still requires us all to
subscribe to the notion that the Crown must remain Protestant and that
somebody can only be head of state in the United Kingdom on the basis

current debate, the sovereign’s religion does change when they
cross a border. The Church with which they are deemed to be in
communion changes when the sovereign crosses the border from the Church
of England to the Church of Scotland, not the Episcopal Church in
Scotland. That is just from listening to this debate. We are getting

right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)
made the point that the two Churches are coming together, and that
Christian Churches generally are doing so. That is imperative,
particularly given the rise of Islamic fundamentalism not just around
the world, but in our country. The issue of succession and
religion—which is what clause 2 is all about—is very
significant. I welcome the fact that the Minister has put it on the
record that section 3 of the Act of Settlement 1700 will remain firmly
part of the law of this land. While an heir to the throne may be
entitled to marry a Catholic, no one who is not in communion with the
Church of England shall be sovereign of this country. It is important
that that is stated, and I am grateful to the Minister. The reason I
was prepared to support
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:05:36"></hs_TimeCode> additional
confirmation of that by the hon. Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley)
was that one is so aware of the zeal with which the present
Administration prosecutes its enthusiasm for modernisation that one
does not want this to be subject to any form of modernisation. It is
imperative that that is clear, and it has been made clear.</hs_Para>

will repeat the point I made on Second Reading as I had to make it in a
rather curtailed style. If the heir to the throne were to marry a
Catholic, the Catholic ordinances had not changed and the children were
to be brought up in the Catholic faith—the point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:06:27"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed—those children would face a
decision on whether to be loyal to the Catholic faith or to renounce
it, and subscribe to being in communion with the Church of England.
Therefore, clause 2 does have consequences, and this is not a question
of semantics between the Church of England and the Catholic
Church.</hs_Para>

many children in our schools are taught that. If we put our hands in
our pockets and look at our coins, we see the two letters
“FD”, which stand for fidei defensor: defender of the

Congregationalist, Church of England, Baptist or whatever, have a huge

Sorry, I meant that I added my assent to everybody else’s. I
want clause 2 to remain in the Bill, but it points to the
issue—to which hon. Members have referred—of the bringing
up of children. Baptism was referred to earlier. At what point does one
decide that somebody has been in communion with or reconciled to the
See or the Church of Rome? Somebody suggested the point of baptism, but
I do not think that that is categorical. As I tried to suggest earlier,
baptism is not Catholic or Anglican—it is Christian. However,
many children growing up in a Catholic family or being brought up by
Catholic parents will be expected to take their first communion when
they are quite young. I would have thought that, at that point, they
were in communion with

is all about the resurrection, but I do not think that statute law is.
If a child of a marriage were christened and brought up a Catholic,
that child would be deemed “naturally dead” under the Act
of Settlement in relation to succession to the Crown. That is why the
clause is, I think, so complex, without any further amendment. My view
is that it would be better to leave well alone. I am in entire

Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) thought that that would
not do at all, and that having our succession subject to the papacy
would create difficulties of its own. I see the validity of that point.
My concern is that by introducing clause 2, we will be passing into law
something that brings our law into direct contradiction of the
requirements of the Catholic faith. That is what brings us back to the
whole offensiveness of the language of the Act of the

I say, I would be happy to see no change at all. The way a country
builds up and the way its monarchy develops is lost in the mists of
time. To whom that monarchy goes is another issue. We have had
discussions about whether the monarchy goes through a strict
genealogical line. It does not. By the time of the reign of George V,
there were 1,000 people closer to Charles I in the succession than his
late Imperial Majesty. It is not something that has been taken back, as
we look at Asser’s “Life of Alfred”, to Adam and
Eve. Asser’s “Life of Alfred” begins with his
genealogy going back to Adam and Eve, but that is not true. Our
monarchy is, in fact, established by statute—initially by
ancient statute from which it has then developed.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:22:04"></hs_TimeCode> difficulty
is that when we start changing part of the statute and allow one thing

point I have been making at great length all afternoon.
In making that point, I would like to thank the Minister for
her patient answers to my almost interminable questions. She
has done that with great grace and thoughtfulness, for which I am
deeply appreciative, but I am still in disagreement. I think this
clause would be better left out of the Bill. If we are going to make a
change, it needs to be thoroughgoing; otherwise, we simply
reinforce the offence of the Act of Settlement and the wording of the
Bill of Rights. We need to live, however, with our great and
noble history, which is part of what we have grown up with,
part of being a subject of the Queen, and part of being a
person of the United Kingdom, to put it that way. My preference is for
the clause to be removed, but if it is to be included, it should be
part of a thoroughgoing reform that allows a Catholic to succeed, but
protects the Supreme Governor of the Church of
England.</hs_Para>

marriage, so will the Minister clarify that it would not present an

loving relationship, so that couples of either type would have an equal
choice between the rite of marriage and civil partnership. That equal
marriage legislation might be amended so that civil partnerships could
end up being available to people of different sexes, and therefore
children would issue from those, too. So again the question arises: why

getting rid of the 1772 Act, which seems a ludicrous piece of
legislation that has always been ineffectual. It has encouraged
monarchs to be capricious in granting or not granting consent and it
was introduced as a capricious piece of legislation. My problem is with
clause 3, which is meant to replace it. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:37:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

such permission is necessary for a civil partnership. I presume that
all six members could form a civil partnership and succeed to the
throne without that being an issue, but if the Government’s
same-sex marriage proposals were introduced, they would then have to
make a request and have consent granted. I simply do not understand,
and I am afraid the Minister has made it far worse for me this
afternoon than it was before. Her suggestion that some convenience will
be drawn up between Ministers who might or might not be advising means
that there will be no clarity for Parliament.</hs_Para>

instance, a potential future heir to the throne might be denied consent
to marry by the monarch deliberately because they wanted to exclude
them from the succession, and for no other reason. The Bill makes no
provision to state that that would be inappropriate. I say that that
might happen in the future, because that is  
<?notus-xml column=276?>precisely what George III tried to do to George IV through the 1772 Act.
If the clause is carried into legislation, the monarch will be able,
entirely of their own volition and without any guidance from
Parliament, to decide who should be excluded from the succession. The
only thing that might militate against that would be if somebody got
married before they became one of the six or before the monarch took

the caprice of God, as it were, whereas in two of the three countries

For the Crown and the Crown’s Ministers to reserve to themselves
the decision as to who should be barred from the succession flies in
the face of the history of this country, as the succession is a matter
that has always been decided by the whole of Parliament—both
Houses of Parliament—through statute law. That is why I am

Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) that it may

can see the virtue of both arguments, but what weighs in the balance is
the question of whether clause 2(1) is an absolute
improvement or whether it may be overturned by a Crown decision under
clause 3(1) acting under the prerogative on Ministers’ advice,
which could still lead to someone being excluded as a result of
marrying

comments on clause stand part, as well as to respond to hon.
Members’ questions. As has been made particularly clear, clause
3 repeals the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and replaces it with provisions
that we believe are more suitable for the modern context. The original
1772 provision probably affects hundreds of people. We do not think
that such a sweeping provision is practical or serves a useful purpose
today. Indeed, if we want to dwell on Cabinet history,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:50:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

obscure and unsatisfactory, might note that this was raised by the

1960.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000551" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0004.htm#13012253000551"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:50:16"></hs_TimeCode>Clause
3 seeks to ensure that the sovereign’s consent is obtained
before the first six people in the line of succession can marry.
Various hon. Members have asked why the number is six. I want to answer
that question with reference to the reasonable reach of changes, which
I referred to earlier. There is a question about unreasonably changing
the legitimate expectations of those closest to the throne, and I think
that we ought to take a cautious approach in such an area. The
Government believe that the consent of the monarch for the marriages of
the first six people in the line of succession provides a measure of
reasonable proximity. Indeed, since the 1772 Act was
enacted, the throne has never passed to anybody who was more than six
steps away in the line of succession. Therefore, subsection (1) limits
the requirement to seek the monarch’s consent to the first six

regard to clause 2(1) in advising the Crown on use of the prerogative.

of George IV. Either of those approaches could lead to an identical
ballooning of the problem that we have seen under the Royal Marriages
Act. It is obvious that the situation would only get worse with time as
more and more descendants came into existence. A sensible approach is
to replace the unworkable provisions of the Royal Marriages Act with a
measure that is limited, pragmatic, and, as the Bill suggests, subject
to procedures including the Great Seal and Order in
Council.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012253000578" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0004.htm#13012253000578">Finally,

able to give me an answer as to when he thought that process might be
complete. Although I understand that he confirmed that this Bill will
not be enacted until the other 15 realms have enacted their provisions,
will my hon. Friend the Minister expand on and enlighten the House

chairman of two all-party two groups: the Saudi Arabia all-party group,

Saudi King himself admonished me saying that the lack of British
exports to that country was regrettable. He said that all our European

I was the first British Member of Parliament ever to go to Mauritania

there. We are good at exporting to countries that speak English, but
the French-speaking part of the world is almost a vortex for British
interests, particularly commercial interests. If this week has shown
anything, given the problems in Algeria and Mali, it is that it is
essential that we engage with those strategically important countries
of north Africa, primarily by assisting our own companies to interact
with those countries, and help them with exports,

in, for example, the west midlands, and what they can do. Like a
telephone switchboard operator, they could then marry up each company
in the west midlands to each opportunity identified in the UAE. I know

Indonesia, and encouraging other hon. Members with companies that could

Minister for all his efforts. In my view, there has been a radical
shift over the last two and a half years. The Prime Minister has said
that he wants our embassies to be shop windows for British businesses.
To a degree, I can see a vast improvement in our embassies. A lot of
that is a tribute to my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues who
have ensured that all the people at our embassies, from the ambassadors
downwards, are focused on supporting small and medium-sized companies
to export overseas to the middle east and north Africa, but too many of
these opportunities are the really big ones. We need a massively
increased focus, drilling down in every MENA country to the smallest of
opportunities, no matter how small. We also need the sharing of
information between all British companies. We are very bad at
exchanging information with one another in this country compared with
our European Union counterparts.</hs_Para>

the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) on securing
this important debate and putting on record his dedication not just to
his constituency, but to driving the UK’s recovery by
rebalancing the economy, based on export-driven recovery. He was
absolutely right to highlight at the beginning of his speech the
importance of the progress made since May 2010, with the refocusing of
the Foreign Office on the prosperity agenda and the refocusing of the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on the strategy of
pursuing an export-led recovery.</hs_Para>

Friend was also right to highlight some of the progress made in
exporting expertise, particularly in responding to our
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:33:07"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Friend the
Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) about its importance in the
education sector, and also in discussing other key areas.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:24:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham was right to point out that the UK
is highly regarded elsewhere in the world, not just in traditional
Anglophone countries, but in the French-speaking world, in which I
travel quite extensively given my additional and other responsibilities
in Africa. He was also right to imply that more needs to be done. We
certainly should not rest on our laurels, but ensure that we are
maximising the opportunities for UK businesses elsewhere in the
world.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012261000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0004.htm#13012261000070"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:33:47"></hs_TimeCode>The
support provided to businesses by UKTI has created significant economic
benefits since May 2010. Indeed, some £45.6 billion-worth of
total additional 
<?notus-xml column=290?>sales have resulted from UKTI assistance. In 2011-12, UKTI support
helped firms to create 36,400 jobs and secure a further 68,500 jobs.
The role of UKTI is not just to maximise exports, for both large
companies and SMEs in the UK, but to persuade foreign companies to
invest here in the UK too. In that regard, the UK has benefited from
1,406 inward investment projects in 2011-12 in which UKTI has been
involved, which have helped to create or safeguard more than 112,000
jobs in the UK. It is therefore fair to say that UKTI is making a
significant contribution to driving the UK’s economic
recovery.</hs_Para>

want to say a little about the background—the
architecture—against which UKTI operates. In early 2011, the
Government published the White Paper “Trade and Investment for
Growth”, which outlined our commitment to an open trading system
and to removing barriers and supporting UK firms that wished to export.
The Government’s “Plan for Growth”, which was
published at the time of the 2011 Budget, linked the policy objectives
for greater global trade to our economic aim of providing a climate
that would help businesses to grow and prosper. The key objective was
to encourage investment in exports as a route to a more balanced
economy.</hs_Para>

of the issues that my hon. Friend has raised are particularly
pertinent. It might help his constituents and others who are unaware of
the opportunities that UKTI offers to know that those opportunities are
posted on the UKTI website, and that companies can sign up to alerts
for any opportunities that might be relevant to them. I would certainly
be happy to provide him with details of how to access that information,
which he can pass on to the relevant businesses in his
constituency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:36:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012261000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0004.htm#13012261000073">My
hon. Friend also raised the important issue of the Prime
Minister’s appointment of trade ambassadors. I can give him an
assurance that all the trade ambassadors—not just
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:36:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)—are very
significantly engaged in the countries for which they are responsible.
Many of them have already made visits, and many are
planning—with the missions on the ground as well as with the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills—to lead trade
delegations to those countries.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012261000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0004.htm#13012261000074"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:36:46"></hs_TimeCode>It
is also important to put on record that the Government are seeking a
transformation of the UK’s export and inward investment
performance—so much so that, in November 2011, the Prime
Minister and the relevant Minister, the excellent Lord Green, launched
the national export challenge, to encourage more SMEs to export. As my
hon. Friend rightly pointed out, in some markets, the UK is below the
EU average percentage of exporting SMEs. We want to see it achieve at
least that level, if not higher. To that end, the Prime Minister has
set the extremely ambitious target of getting another 100,000 companies
exporting by 2020 and doubling UK exports to £1
trillion<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012261000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/debtext/130122-0004.htm#13012261000075">However,
UKTI cannot deliver the Government’s ambition to transform the
UK’s export and inward investment performance alone. It is
working in close co-operation with the rest of Government and
particularly with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Outreach with business
intermediaries such as banks, lawyers and accountants is also playing a
major role. We aim to access their client bases to help businesses to
expand into key markets.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend also raised the important subject of marketing. He will
understand the very challenging—to put it
politely—macro-economic situation that we inherited, and it was
absolutely right that when we came into office, we looked at every
aspect of Government expenditure to ensure that UK taxpayers’
money was being spent properly and that we could make a significant
inroad into the huge deficit that we inherited. That does not mean,
however, that we have been unable to persuade the Cabinet Office, which
is the responsible Department, to put in place marketing budgets when
and where appropriate. Perhaps the best example is the
“Great” campaign, which was linked to the Olympics and to
our Olympic legacy. I can inform the House that that campaign has had a
significant positive impact, persuading businesses based abroad to
invest here and enabling our missions abroad to persuade UK companies
to invest elsewhere in the world.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:39:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James) who has played such a
significant role in engaging and encouraging MPs across the House to
hold such meetings in their constituencies. If Members either here this

is not all. Last August, the Government announced additional support to
help UK businesses. There will be more money available for SMEs to
attend trade shows abroad, and I very much hope that the constituents
of my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:24:54"></hs_TimeCode> access this
funding. There will also be increased support available for travel on
overseas missions. Substantial discounts will be available and will be
offered through the Overseas Market Introduction Service, which
provides targeted research to help businesses find those first

package of support will play an important role in helping realise the
Government’s ambitions, by building up the capacity and
capability of the British Chambers of Commerce overseas, where we lag
behind competitors such as the Germans. Lord Green has made this a
personal crusade, and I am 100% supportive of the direction of travel.
It is focused initially on 20 pilot chambers in key export markets.
Once again, I very much hope that my hon. Friend’s constituents

the number of international trade advisers in the English regions is a
key part of how the money will be spent, offering additional funds to
SMEs with high-growth potential, enabling more companies successfully
to export. I can inform my hon. Friend that some of these advisers are
private sector employees, who are performance-related
rewarded—exactly the agenda he talked about—and I think
that is exactly the right direction in which to go. We hope that this
additional funding will double the number of companies given financial
support towards the cost of exhibiting at their first overseas trade
shows; and double the support for private sector-led project teams
campaigning for UK success, by enhancing inward investment support in
growth markets, such as the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Russia. I hope that
some of that inward investment will end up in my hon. Friend’s
constituency. This is also about positioning the UK as the leading
location of choice for European headquarters and elite global
enterprises, building on the success of Tech City and developing
further inward investment campaigns as well as building on the Olympic

the importance—not only to local people but to London as a

the effective closing of maternity and A and E services at Lewisham
hospital will hit like a tidal wave at King’s College hospital,
because of the numbers of people involved. The health service estimate
is that the number of people at King’s College A and E will
increase by 45%. The staff at King’s College A and E do a very
good job, but they will not be able to cope with a 45% increase in
patients. The additional emergency admissions from that increased
number of people at A and E will create such a strain on in-patient
beds that the proposal is that in-patients—non-emergency
admissions—will have to be shipped off to Farnborough hospital,

are these proposals unfair? The closure of Lewisham’s A and E
department and its maternity department has been recommended to the
Secretary of State for Health by the special administrator to the South
London Healthcare NHS Trust. In July last year, the special
administrator was appointed to the trust, which is made up of the three
hospitals to the east and south of Lewisham—Woolwich, Sidcup and
Farnborough hospitals. The administrator’s job was to find a way
to balance the trust’s books. It was the first time that a
special administrator had ever been appointed in the NHS, and the first
time that the unsustainable providers regime—that is, the
process for sorting out failing hospital trusts—has been used
anywhere in the country.</hs_Para>

because Lewisham hospital is next to the South London Healthcare NHS

currently go to the A and E. In his final report, that was revised down
to 50%. Based on an analysis of their case load, doctors at Lewisham
suggest that the figure would be closer to 30%, so who is right?
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T09:44:47"></hs_TimeCode>GPs in Lewisham,

the number of people who would go to an urgent care centre at Lewisham

With high numbers of teenage pregnancies and a higher than average
proportion of older mums in places such as Lewisham that is doubly
important. The proposal for a midwife-led birthing unit at Lewisham is
not a genuine option for any woman who wants to give birth safe in the
knowledge that she would have back-up obstetric support if it were
needed. I am told that that would not be an option for first-time mums.

to where, and to what extent, capacity will be enhanced at other

Lewisham. The proposals before the Secretary of State assume a
relatively even redistribution of women from Lewisham to King’s,
the Queen Elizabeth hospital Woolwich and the Princess Royal university
hospital in Farnborough. However, historically, when Lewisham women
have not given birth at Lewisham, their main hospitals of choice have
clearly been King’s and St Thomas’s. If more women go to
those hospitals, projected births there could exceed 8,000 a year.
Those would be really big maternity departments, potentially requiring
a double rota of staff and consultants to deal with them. The cost of a
double rota in maternity units at King’s and St

metaphorical tin with respect to the recommendations of the trust

problems of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust and put the health
economy in south-east London on a stable footing. I do not think the
proposals before us do that. It will be necessary to spend £195
million on a one-off basis to make changes at hospitals in south
London, to deal with the displaced demand for A and E and maternity
care that will result from the closure of services at Lewisham. It is
not clear to me where that money is coming from: which Department of

borrowed to make the improvements. That is a bit like someone taking

in health service matters, including reconfiguration. I have the scars
of the battle to keep Guy’s hospital open, which we managed to

But I have a more direct interest: my constituents on the eastern edge

King’s or to Guy’s and St Thomas’s. Of my
remaining constituents who use hospital services, some go to the Royal
London hospital across the river, but most go either to Guy’s
and St Tommy’s or to King’s, and the report makes it

King’s, if the proposals go

legislation initiated by the previous Government and passed by the
previous Parliament anticipated problems in a part of the NHS. Although
Labour understood that need, the legislation has not needed to be
implemented until now. The legislation has been implemented—to
be honest, those of us in other parts of south-east London knew
this—because there was a history of bad financial management in
the outer south-east London boroughs and in South London Healthcare NHS
Trust. We know that to our cost because, twice to my certain knowledge,
the health budgets further in—in our parts of south-east
London—had to be top-sliced to fund other bits of London, even
though they are more affluent and we are less affluent, because of poor
management elsewhere. There was better management both in my borough
and in
Lewisham<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T10:02:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), who was Secretary of State
when the Health Act 2009 was passed, has made it clear that there was
never any intention to use the legislation to address major
reconfigurations. The legislation was meant to address a financial
problem in a specific trust and not to encompass other trusts. Does

Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes) agree that we
need to consider the NHS London-wide? That is where we must find
solutions to the financial problems of one trust, quite differently
from this particular case. The trust special administrator clearly

Lady, who is my neighbour, raises an important issue. With the help of
the Library, I have carefully examined the whole debate on the passage
of the legislation, and that issue was not addressed. If she looks back
at the debates and the notes on the National Health Service Act 2006,
they are silent on whether a trust special administrator could or could
not make recommendations that go beyond a trust. That may not have been

supportive—GPs elsewhere in London might be found but they

to be that if we are handing NHS decisions from the top to the doctors,
we must do things that the doctors agree are the right decisions. So

taken advice from someone who has been involved over the years at
Lewisham hospital and in NHS management, and the history of financial
poor management in the South London Healthcare NHS Trust stretches back
over 10 years. The advice I have received is that poor management
should have been gripped seven or eight years ago, but the problems
escalated. We are in our present position because of a legacy of poor
decisions made over effectively a decade. Things might have been
rescued by the Government at the beginning of this Parliament, but they
clearly were not and we are left in our present

is an alternative approach, which I commend to the Secretary of State.
I hope he understands the benefit of going down the alternative route,
rather than following the trust special administrator’s
recommendations. The alternative, which we explored at our meeting and
which I do not believe was adequately answered by the trust special
administrator or his colleagues, is that five of the six
recommendations—excluding recommendation 5 on the site
configuration—leave open the option of amalgamating NHS
management between Lewisham and Greenwich. NHS management could then be
allowed to work out the best configuration of services across the two
boroughs in consultation with, and with the confidence of, the local
authorities in question, which now have direct responsibility through
health and wellbeing boards under the Health and Social Care Act 2012,
and in conjunction with GPs to seek GP commissioning endorsement and
support. I hope there would be much more public support than for the
present proposal, as is
understandable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012237000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0001.htm#13012237000077">I

position if recommendation 5 were not to be followed, compared with a
financial gap of £75.6 million if the recommendations
were followed. There are knock-on effects, but we seem to be talking
about a sufficiently small amount of money, with little risk of any
other financially adverse impact, and if people are motivated to reach
a conclusion quickly, that must be a much more satisfactory way of
proceeding and much more in line with the four tests set

Lady says, but even more important is returning the decision to the
people in the health service who are now meant to be leading
it—the GP commissioners and others. That is what all of us, in
different ways, believe needs to be done. She made an argument for the
issue being London-wide, and that of course is the context, but the
practicalities of travel and transport, whether buses, cabs, cars and
trains, are such that south-east London works as a segment for health
service use in a way that does not really cross over into other parts
of London, other than to King’s. The only knock-on bits are the
small amount of crossover to the London hospitals for specialist
reasons, and some to King’s because it is so
near—technically, it is south-east London, but it is in
Lambeth<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012237000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0001.htm#13012237000080">Secondly,
the precedent would be a bad one to set for those parts of the NHS that
have been financially well managed, compared with parts that have been
badly managed. Lewisham has been relatively well managed, being very
nearly in balance. We rely on trusts to do their job locally and on
people to manage local trusts, so we have to support those who do that

on, and not only physically. It has become a university teaching

local issue in all the 40-plus years that I have been involved in
public life in Lewisham, even more than the madcap scheme of the
Department for Transport under the now Lord Parkinson to further the
south circular assessment study. That scheme had recommended widening
the south circular to six lanes throughout, with eight lanes in some

some of the claims are lunatic, and in pursuit of so little—but
the sense of injustice, the unfairness of the scheme. Lewisham

quality and patient experience. It has been rated in the top 40
hospitals nationally by CHKS—for clinical effectiveness, patient
safety and so on—and has a strong record in achieving national
and local performance targets. It is operationally lean, the reference
costs index making it the most efficient trust in south-east London,
delivering financial surpluses in each of the past six

most Millwall football fans sing it as a joke, but Mr Kershaw clearly
believes it. He has succeeded in antagonising and alienating not just
the medical community, but everyone in south-east London, because the
whole scheme is a shambles. He said that no one came forward with a
viable alternative to his plan, which is why the final report is as it
is. I can tell him that if they had £5.2 million and rising and
the services of McKinsey, Deloitte, Ipsos MORI and other consultants,
year 6 at Dalmain road primary school could have come up with a better

hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham East (Heidi  
<?notus-xml column=16?>Alexander) on securing this important debate. I want to start by
defending South London Healthcare NHS Trust. Its financial difficulties
are enormous and there is no disguising that, so people have tended to
roll up its performance into something that is failing on all fronts,
but that is clearly not the case.</hs_Para>

hospitals—Bromley hospital, Princess Royal University hospital,
Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich and Queen Mary’s hospital
at Sidcup—were merged approximately four years ago into one
healthcare trust, there were serious difficulties with clinical
performance, but very quickly the trust improved its performance
significantly, and so much so that it was one of the best performing on
many indicators. That is why it was so sad that when the trust was put
into administration, unattributable sources in the Department of Health
put out rumours that that was about not just financial mismanagement,
but the fact that standards of care were failing. That was completely
and utterly untrue.</hs_Para>

several years, and I am on my fifth chief executive at my local
hospital. All have gone through the same scenario as Mr Kershaw, and
all have given me assurances about the areas—I will not go into
them because I do not have enough time—where financial
performance needed to improve and efficiencies needed to be made.
Always, they made the point about the need to treat people close to
where they live in the community and reduce pressure on acute
services.</hs_Para>

that point, and all have needed to improve clinical performance. Just
over a year ago, the South London Healthcare NHS Trust had only one
case of blood-borne MRSA, which was the best performance in the
country. The improvement in the quality of care under the new trust was
significant indeed. Waiting times in A and E improved, and
Dr Foster reported on a significant and consistent
improvement in the standardised mortality ratios over a couple of
years. On those performance indicators, it outperformed Lewisham
hospital.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012237000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0001.htm#13012237000107">When
the decision was made to put the trust into administration, its
performance on quality of care for local patients was improving. Anyone
who was concerned about care for local patients would have worked
through the financial difficulties with the trust. It was a big ask in
that short period to improve clinical performance as it did, to merge
the hospitals as it did, and to improve financial performance as it was
required to do. It was always a big ask, and I think it was impossible.
That should have been recognised, and the Government should have worked
with that hospital trust to work through those difficulties.</hs_Para>

all know that PFI has not caused this problem, but it has added to it.
PFI accounts for roughly a third of the deficit, which is not to be
ignored, but one issue that has come to light recently, in relation to
PFI in general—not just in relation to South London Healthcare
NHS Trust—is the effect that the manipulation of LIBOR has had
on the rates that hospital trusts have had to pay, in terms of
interest, as a consequence. I do not expect the Minister to have an
answer to this question, but will she go away and consider what the
cost implications of LIBOR manipulation have been for every PFI in the
NHS? Are the Government considering taking legal action to retrieve any
of that money, as is being considered in the USA?</hs_Para>

hospital is excellent. Working within its budget, it has a good
reputation and serves the local community, which includes people from
my constituency. I really am against the idea of its role being
changed. The idea that it becomes an urgent care centre is fine. When I
asked the special administrator about that, he suggested to me that it
was not much of a change, and the only real change was that people
would not be admitted into the general hospital. That is not quite as I
understood it. Now we do not have the specialist back-up, and there
will be a big reduction in people being seen locally. Lewisham requires
a hospital, and it should keep its hospital.</hs_Para>

thinking of the elderly, as it is very difficult for them to
achieve what they want and get to a hospital—say, if they are
sent somewhere other than Lewisham, when they live in Lewisham. I am
very concerned about the idea that we can do away with maternity
services in Lewisham. Some 4,000 babies is a heck of a lot of babies to
cart off somewhere else, as I mentioned in an earlier
intervention.</hs_Para>

the challenges facing South London Healthcare NHS Trust are complex and
of long standing. As we have heard, the proposals to close the A and E

assist a neighbouring hospital trust to find its way out of significant
debt problems. It is a highly controversial procedure, to say the
least, because Lewisham hospital, as we have heard, is well respected

Nevertheless, what has happened sets a worrying precedent whereby the
normal processes of public consultation are short-circuited and
back-door reconfigurations of hospital services could be pushed
through. This is a worrying situation, as it takes the NHS over a very
dangerous line and is potentially the first back-door reconfiguration
in that manner. If it is allowed to go ahead in that way, it could mean
that any hospital services could be changed for purely financial
reasons, which has never been the case in the past. We need to ask
where the clinical case for change is in these
proposals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012237000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0001.htm#13012237000137">The
2009 Act clearly says that administrators must make recommendations
relating to the trust that is failing. That has not happened in this
case. Reconfigurations need to be based on solid clinical evidence that
they will save lives. Where there is a clear clinical case, I think
that that is right, and we should look carefully at changes before
deciding whether we should oppose them. However, the TSA’s

your chairmanship, Dr McCrea. I congratulate
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T10:49:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander) on securing this debate. I have
about 10 minutes to respond to all the points. In the normal terms of
any debate, there is an airing of conflicting views, different ideas
and different points of views, but today there has been no such
disagreement; we have had an outbreak of complete agreement among all
the speakers and all those who have intervened.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T10:50:33"></hs_TimeCode>Everyone who has
spoken this morning has done so with great passion and sometimes with
ferocity in defence of the maternity unit and the  A and E

What is most important is that the right decision is made after careful
consideration. I am pleased that the Secretary of State was true to his
word and had a meeting with Members who are rightly concerned about the
future of Lewisham hospital on 14 January. I know that it was
effectively a listening exercise, because he could not express an

for Lewisham East. Let us be absolutely clear about it. South London
Healthcare NHS Trust has six PFI schemes. It is not as simple as
putting all the blame on the PFI schemes, as some Members have
suggested. The two largest schemes are at the Princess Royal university
hospital in Bromley with a £30 million PFI scheme, and at Queen
Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich with a PFI scheme of
£29.1 million. The PFIs were signed off in 1998, but
they certainly do not help the situation.</hs_Para>

has a £65 million deficit, the largest in the country, so doing
nothing is not an option. No Government of whatever political colour
would stand by and see the haemorrhaging of £1 million a week.
When hon. Members gather again on Saturday for their protest, I hope
that they make it absolutely clear to all the good people who attend to
support their local hospital that that is the real financial situation.

her sight over a period of time. Initially, she continued to work and
even went to college. She used to take the local bus service, but she
found that impossible as she was reliant on drivers seeing her white

but apparently she is not blind enough to qualify for higher rate
mobility, although she uses a long cane and frequently falls over.

severe sight loss, there is no such thing as a “familiar”
journey. Let me quote him:</hs_Para>
<hs_brev UID="13012238000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0001.htm#13012238000072"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T11:05:32"></hs_TimeCode>“What
is a familiar route? For me there is no such thing as a familiar route.
For me, “familiar” is based totally on sound and feel.
These constantly change. No route is the same two days running -
disruptions are caused by wind, rain, people and traffic and I cannot
use sight to check that it is safe or to update my knowledge of the
changing environment en-route. Feel, via a long cane, is disrupted by
ice, snow, leaves and standing water which disguise important
orientation points like kerbs and tactile paving. “Bin
day” turns pavements into dangerous, practically impenetrable
obstacle courses with heavy randomly placed bins. Despite Highway Code
regulations, cars are often parked with impunity well onto the
pavement, vans leave ramps down and rear doors flung wide open. These
obstacles are silent, invisible to me. With no sight, no auditory
warnings, I regularly walk straight into these and have the scars to
prove it. There is a limit to the amount of adapting one can do! I am
vulnerable when asking strangers for direction. They may be ignorant or
undesirable. I have never successfully, independently accessed a
supermarket because the act of moving around brings me into contact
with all manner of objects and people which are in close proximity.
I’m not aware until I have 
<?notus-xml column=27?>actually hit them. This is neither appropriate nor socially acceptable
behaviour and causes me great anxiety. Trying to travel on a bus or a
train throws up the challenge of accessing transport information and
bus stops, finding the right bus, recognising stops, finding a space to
sit or a person to ask. A talking mobile phone is indispensible but
very

very kindly took me on the “familiar” route from his
house to the main road, which was an absolute education for me. Because
he needed to access different surfaces to understand where he was on
the route, he was unable to take the shortest route and in fact some of
the places that he ended up walking were, for me, far more dangerous
than the straightforward route; however, he needed to access different
surfaces. In order to cross a piece of land diagonally, he had to
ensure a piece of wall was in the middle of his back at just the right
angle so that he would end up at the right position for the next stage
of the journey. A walk that would take an able, sighted person 10
minutes took him about half an

purpose and sometimes unfairness in the awards that are given, which

cutting is as much about politics as about economics. Of course, the
economics have to work too, but here is a statistic that should worry
us: the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
have shown that almost all the growth in household income since 2001
was wiped out by the financial crisis. At kitchen tables up and down
Britain, it feels as though the last decade of growth simply did not
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:30:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012245000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0001.htm#13012245000005">It
is hard for any Government to tackle that situation. Why? Partly
because we—I am talking about the Conservative-led
coalition—have allowed our political opponents to caricature tax

society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:31:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Now,
more than ever, we have to show that tax cutting is a moral creed that
is about lifting workers on low incomes out of poverty and creating
jobs for the
unemployed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:31:15"></hs_TimeCode>.

take him back to the point that he was making about tax credits
supposedly allowing employers to pay lower wages. Presumably the basis
for that argument is that tax credits raise the take-home pay for the
worker at no cost to the employer. However, why does he not employ the
same argument to the tax reduction that he is advocating, which again
will raise the take-home pay of workers? In a properly competitive

people on the right, especially in the think-tank world, oppose the 10p

flat tax would be deeply regressive and it would be hard to defend as
fair. While that remains true, a flat tax is unlikely to
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012245000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0001.htm#13012245000018">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:36:39"></hs_TimeCode>

is politically impossible. Where I agree with people on the right, and
with thoughtful commentators such as Ryan Bourne from the Centre for

As I said before, I agree fundamentally with the minimum wage; it is a

First, how do we set it? I believe that it puts enormous burdens on
smaller businesses; the big multinationals will be able to deal with
it. I do not want it to act as a disincentive to employment, and I
believe that the burden of responsibility for the living wage should

hope is that once the threshold reaches £10,000, we will
consider bringing back the 10p rate for the lower-paid. Some Liberal

further, to something like £12,500 a year. I absolutely agree
the coalition should  
<?notus-xml column=37?>fulfil its £10,000 commitment, but it would be unwise to raise
the personal allowance even further. Everyone should feel that they
have a stake in the state, and they should have some stake in the tax

fear is that the Liberal Democrats want to pay for their policy, which
will cost £14 billion if applied to everyone, by dragging even
more workers into the 40p band. That is what has happened historically.

paying a marginal rate of 40p, and that will include police officers,

in the interim; otherwise, people will go straight from their tax-free
allowance to being taxed on any income above that. Does he agree that,

people with £232 tax rise. Why should the Government not set
themselves the goal of reversing that unpopular decision? There is a
strong case for doing so. As I said, tax credits are flawed; small
firms cannot afford the living wage; a flat tax is not going to happen

mean that most basic and higher-rate taxpayers will pay £47 less

a further £235, so the total increase next year will be

year will be a critical one for a great many industries, in my opinion
and the opinion of many others more expert than I am. I know of more
than one business in my town that has downgraded from two shops to one,
but which has kept the same staffing levels in the hope of reducing
overheads and not having to make staff redundant. For the owner, the
most important thing is not to make staff redundant—not to send
people to the unemployment queue. He cares about his staff and does not
want them to be out of work. However, he has children to feed, as they
do, and if we asked him to pay his eight staff more wages, he could
not. He would either have to lay some off, or close altogether.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:50:51"></hs_TimeCode> know that that
story is being replicated throughout the UK, as even businesses that

must congratulate the coalition Government on the significant increase
in the personal allowance. It has meant a huge cost to the Government,
but it is the correct decision and it highlights the coalition’s
strong belief that the best way to help people is to allow them to keep
more of the money they earn. That is the big difference between the
coalition and the Labour Opposition, who believe that the best way to
help the poorest in society is to take money from them and give some of
it back, depending on their circumstances. I strongly believe that we
should try to ensure that people keep as much of the money they earn as
possible. However,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:52:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harlow made another important point: I support the
aspiration of a £10,000 personal allowance, but we must ensure
at some point that people understand that they must contribute to
society.</hs_Para>

welcome the movement in the personal allowance, which means, for
example, that the husband and wife who run a small business as owners
of a small guest house in my constituency can earn £20,000 from
it without paying tax. That is an incentive for them to work and make a
success of the business; but it is important that people understand
that there is a point where they must contribute towards what the state
provides. It is all very well to ask and demand more from the
Government, but there is an understanding, which includes everyone, of
a need to contribute. That is why it is important to focus our
attention, once the £10,000 personal allowance is secured, on
continuing to support the lowest paid, but in a possibly more
cost-effective manner. Let us be honest: a 10p tax rate would cost half
the amount of an increase in the personal allowance. There would be an
impact on more
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:53:50"></hs_TimeCode>. We

help the poorest paid but also emphasise the need for everyone who

have nothing but sympathy with the Minister on the issues that the
Treasury faces. The previous Government left them with a terrible
situation—and I am not talking just about the financial deficit.
The complication beyond recognition of the tax system is frankly
shameful. In a recent article Philip Booth included a table that
highlighted the fact that the marginal tax and benefit withdrawal rates
are now out of tune. That results in a situation 
<?notus-xml column=41?>where someone earning between £8,000 and £38,000 is
paying, between benefit withdrawal, tax payments and national insurance
payments—if that person has a family of three children—a
73% marginal tax rate. That then falls to 42%; then it goes up again if
people earn more than £100,000, because of the personal
allowance withdrawal. Then it goes down again. The progressive tax
system, which everyone in this country believed in, has been completely
distorted by a process in which benefits, personal allowances and so
forth have been withdrawn in response to a financial crisis. That has
left a distorted tax system that goes against something the coalition
is strongly in favour of—the aspiration to support people who
want to support themselves. It is difficult to see how a tax system
that now has so many distortions is doing the job it is meant to do, of
supporting such people.</hs_Para>

Treasury faces a huge job in dealing with the deficit, but in due
course it will need to think carefully about how to make the tax system
fairer, with a progressive element rather than the present slightly
distorting effect. There are opportunities to change it. Universal
credit will deal with many anomalies at the lower end of the income
spectrum, but we must recognise our responsibility to see the tax
system for what it is—a failing system whose distortions run
counter to the work ethic. The counter-productive element of the tax
system is reflected in the fall in the 40% tax rate threshold. The fact
that it will hit people on an income of £34,000 from April is
counterbalanced by an increase in the personal allowance, but we must
be aware that people in fairly modest positions in society are now
being expected to pay a higher rate of tax, something that previous
generations would not have anticipated. We have a responsibility to
deal with that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T14:56:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Northern Ireland situation has been discussed, and it is similar to
that in Wales. We need to congratulate the Government on the fact that
the tax payments of a person on the minimum wage, for example, have
been halved as a result of changes to the personal allowance. There is
a question whether it is justifiable to call something a minimum wage
while still expecting someone to pay tax on it. However, I want to
sound a note of caution about the living wage. I support the
aspiration, but I question the affordability of it. I specifically
question the fact that local authorities in Wales are saying they will
pay all their staff a living wage. Is that a reasonable way to deal
with the issue? In effect, it is using money raised in taxes from
people who are often not particularly well paid to provide a benefit
for people in the public sector, who may have better benefits than
other workers. I question that: by bringing in a living wage for some
workers, the public sector in some local authorities reinforces the
view that people who work for the public sector somehow deserve better
pay than those who work in the private sector. I am hugely concerned
about it.</hs_Para>

is a saying in Welsh, which I hope that you will allow me use, Mr
Robertson: “Hael yw Hywel ar bwrs y wlad,” which means it
is very easy to be generous with other people’s money. When I
hear of local authorities in Wales that are thinking about taking that
course, I ask them to reflect on where the money comes from in the
first instance; because 75% to 80% of local government 
<?notus-xml column=42?>expenditure in Wales is from general taxation, so lower paid workers in
other parts of the economy will be contributing to enabling councillors
to feel good about themselves. The aspiration should be for people on
comparatively low pay not to have to pay significant amounts of tax.
Therefore the increase in the personal allowance, coupled with the 10p
tax rate, would make a huge difference.</hs_Para>

support the aspirations behind the debate today, but we must consider
the issues in the context of the complexity of the tax system, and the
challenges to the Government in dealing with the deficit. However, a
challenge that is equally crucial is to set out plans to introduce a
10p tax rate and deal with a tax system that is no longer progressive
in the way it collects taxes from families. That may be something for a
second term, but I am confident that there will be one. I am sure that
after 2015 a Conservative Government will be able to deal with the
anomalies and ensure that the tax system is fair to all—whether
those at the lower end of the tax spectrum or a family earning perhaps

resorts are heavily reliant on part-time, often seasonal work. In some

income. The Conservative party has traditionally been the low-tax

in a minimum wage, and yet the Government of the day helped themselves
to significant amounts of tax from that minimum wage. In other words,
small businesses in constituencies such as mine felt that they were
being forced to pay higher levels of wages in order for the Government
to be able to help themselves to tax. Surely this Government, by

is backing the living wage campaign, which is a perfect example of how
we can deliver a one-nation economy in which everyone has a stake, and
prosperity is fairly shared. That is why Labour councils are delivering
a living wage throughout the country, despite straitened economic
circumstances for many and in the face of swingeing Government cuts. We
believe in doing the right thing for low-paid employees. Those local

that I have read on the overall impact of the tax changes that the
Government have pushed through. The hon. Member raised the important
point about the best approach. I am sure that he is aware that the
analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Resolution
Foundation suggested that introducing a living wage could lead to a net
gain to the Treasury of more than £2 billion a year when the
costs of paying it throughout the public sector are set against reduced
benefit and tax credit payments, and higher income tax and national
insurance receipts.</hs_Para>

the living wage campaign takes hold, wins the arguments and wins over
more and more companies, including those throughout the supply chain
and smaller companies, it will improve the economy as a whole, and help
to put more money in people’s pockets to spend in the local
economy. That is vital when so many high streets and local companies
are struggling. We have seen many worrying examples of high street
shops closing. That compares with the suggestion of the hon. Member for
Harlow to reintroduce the 10p tax band, which the Library estimates
would cost around £6 billion a year. The cost of the hon.
Gentleman’s approach is indeed high, particularly when set
against the gains made to the Treasury from its
ill-thought-through  cut in support for low-paid families that
was voted through last

hon. Gentleman has set out his suggested approach for supporting
low-paid workers. The Government’s approach needs a little more
inspection at this stage. Last night, the striver’s tax was
voted through, and according to the IFS, 7 million working households
will lose an average of £165 per year. Indeed, its calculations
show that the impact of the changes announced in the autumn statement
between now and April 2015 will be to reduce the real-terms income of a
one-earner working family by £534 on average by 2015-16. We know
that a further 200.000 children will be pushed into poverty as a result
of the uprating measures that were voted through last night.</hs_Para>

what the Chancellor may like to believe and some of the rhetoric from
hon. Members on the Government Benches, it will not be so-called
shirkers who suffer the impact of the changes. The Children’s
Society has calculated that up to 40,000 soldiers, 300,000
nurses and 150,000 primary and nursery school teachers will lose out as
a result of the 1% uprating decision. I have mentioned the impact of
the mummy tax on women. The Government are not content that two thirds
of those affected by the 1% uprating of benefits and tax credits will
be women; they want to impose an effective tax cut of £180 on
working women through their real-terms cut in statutory maternity
pay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012245000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012245000108">Those

that they are being asked to pay the price of the Government’s
economic failure when they are already struggling to get by, and

rudimentary understanding of economics will appreciate, the main way
that wealthy people accumulate wealth is through wealth creation,
rather than income, which is always variable. If we look at capital

measure was implemented from April 1999, with taxpayers paying only 10p
in the pound on their first £1,500 of taxable income. The
rationale was to put work first and to ease the poverty trap, whereby
people on low pay were discouraged from climbing the earnings ladder
due to high marginal deduction rates. The 10p rate remained
in place until the announcement in the 2007 Budget, which was the last
to be delivered by the right hon. Gentleman. Those of us who were there
will remember that the intention behind the abolition was pretty clear.
It was a theatrical coup to conclude the last Budget by that Chancellor
with a reduction in the main rate of income tax from 22% to 20%. Other
measures were taken with regard to the indexation of personal
allowances for those aged 65 and above and the retention of the 10%
rate for savings income, but what was clear was that great, theatrical
moment just before the then Leader of the Opposition stood up, not able
to see all the details, and there was this surprise tax cut. Of course,
questions then started to be asked about how that was to be funded in
what was a fiscally neutral set of tax
measures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:29:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012245000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012245000125">At
the time, it became clear, once we saw the Red Book, that the
Government estimated that the removal of the starting rate of income
tax would yield the Exchequer an additional £7.3 billion in
2008-09, so where would the extra cash come from? It was a little
difficult to get all the answers at the time. The Budget book at the
time set out a list of all the people who would be winning from the
changes, and the Budget statement said that four out of five households
would either gain or remain in the same position as a result of the
Budget measures, but we did not get much detail on the one out of five
households that would
lose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:40:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012245000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012245000126">The
IFS confirmed that 5.3 million households would lose. A senior Treasury
official, giving evidence to the Treasury Committee—I should

very next day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer came along to answer
questions on the Budget. He was asked five times by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Michael Fallon) about the 5.3 million
households that were going to lose out, and five times he refused to
confirm that number. There is a lesson to be learned from that whole
episode. We should be more transparent about the impact of policy

will set out a case about the way in which the Government have taken
substantial steps with regard to the personal allowance to help
low-paid workers. We have done that at a time when we inherited an
enormous deficit, and we have had to make difficult decisions about how
we reduce that deficit. We have been clear in the distributional
analysis of where the contributions are coming from. The facts are very
clear. The top 20% of earners are making the biggest contributions, not
just in cash terms but in relative terms, to reducing the
deficit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:42:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012245000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012245000130">Let
me return to the people who lost out from the abolition of the 10p rate
of income tax. People under the age of 65 with non-savings income
between £5,435 and £19,355 would have paid more, because
they lost more from the abolition of the 10% rate than they gained from
the cut in the basic rate. It is worth reminding ourselves that a
Labour Government took that measure and that those low-paid workers
would have paid more tax. The loss was greatest, at £232 a year,
for someone earning £7,755—the top of where the 10% band
would have been. Those most affected by the abolition of the 10p rate
appear to have been those below the age of 65 with an income under
£18,500 who were in childless households. The effect was
greatest on those households where no individual was above the age of
60, because the household would not then benefit from the higher winter

us now consider what we have done in this difficult financial
situation. We should remember that 2007 was still the age of apparent
plenty; we have been in a much more difficult situation. Rather than
reintroducing the 10% rate of tax, we have taken steps by increasing
the personal allowance; we have taken real steps towards making the
first £10,000 of income free from tax. I am grateful to a number
of hon. Members for supporting that policy this afternoon. Since 2011,
we have announced successive increases in the personal allowance,
totalling £2,965. That includes a £1,100 increase
announced  in the 2012 Budget and a further £235
announced in  the autumn statement last month. Following those
announcements, the personal allowance rises by £1,335—the
largest cash increase in history—to £9,440 from April
2013. Taken together, those changes will benefit 25 million
individuals and provide a real-terms gain of £443 to most basic
rate taxpayers in 2013-14. More than 2.2 million individuals
with low incomes will have been taken out of income tax

shall give some more examples of how the changes work. Let us take the
context of the national minimum wage.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:45:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Carlisle (John Stevenson) referred to the personal
allowance matching the national minimum wage for full-time employees,
but let us examine what has happened to a person on the national
minimum wage in full-time employment. In 2010-11, someone earning the
national minimum wage would have had earnings of £10,979 and
paid income tax of £901. In 2013-14, someone earning the
national minimum wage will have estimated earnings of £11,691
and pay estimated income tax of £450. In other words, their bill
will be halved. Another way to look at it is 
<?notus-xml column=54?>that, in 2010-11, such a person would have been able to work only 22
hours a week tax free; they can now work 29 hours a week before
starting to pay income
tax.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012245000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012245000133">Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>
way to look at the situation is by comparing the approach that we have
taken in increasing the personal allowance with the approach that the
previous Government took in doubling the 10p rate of income tax. I
talked about those who earn £7,755 a year and lost the
most—£232 a year—as a consequence of the doubling
of the 10p rate in 2008-09. In that year, an individual would have paid
£344 in income tax. Under the present Government, in 2012-13,
such an individual, with income adjusted for inflation to £8,299
a year, will pay about £39 in income tax—not £344
but £39 in tax, which is a saving of £305. In 2013-14,
again with income adjusted for inflation, such an individual will pay
no income tax at all. That is a contrast that I am very happy to
highlight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:47:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012245000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012245000134"><B><Member ContinuationText="Catherine McKinnell" PimsId="5703" UID="13012245000218" xid="1212" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012245000218">Catherine

approach, and the debate on that will continue. As he would expect, I
will not make any commitments on the matter. Clearly, there is a
substantial fiscal cost in reintroducing a 10p rate of income tax.
However, the Government’s values are clear. The overall cost of
the personal allowance by the end of this Parliament will be around
£9.5 billion a year as a consequence of the measures that we
have taken. Clearly, where we can, we have been prepared to take
substantial steps, at quite significant cost, to reduce the income tax
bill for those on low earnings. That is something of which we should be

the Member for Cleethorpes quoted the Forsyth Commission, which looked

are on quite low wages to be contributing income tax. I appreciate the
arguments that everyone should make a contribution, and I do not in any
way dismiss them, but when we are asking people earning such relatively
low amounts to pay income tax, there are the significant questions of
work incentives and simplification. The Government must bear those in
mind when considering whether to reintroduce the 10p rate. There is a
debate to be had on both sides. There are pros and cons both to
personal allowance increases and to a new lower rate. In our coalition
agreement, we rightly set out our determination to get to
£10,000. Fiscal drag had brought more people into income tax

referring to fuel duty. He is a keen campaigner on that point and he

had implemented the fuel duty escalator. They will remain at least 10
pence per litre lower over the remainder of the Parliament than they
would have been had we stuck to the plans that we inherited. In

Graham</B> (Gloucester) (Con):</Member> In the dementia debate in the
House a fortnight ago, sadly I was tail-end Charlie and time prevented
me from contributing a Gloucestershire perspective, so I am very
grateful for this opportunity to put that right. I am also very
grateful to the Minister for coming to Westminster Hall this
afternoon.</hs_Para>

can be an emotional topic. In that earlier debate, many
Members—mostly female Members—from all parties in the
House talked about the very human side to the disease. It was a
reminder that we are no more and no less than a reflection of those we
serve; a mirror of the human sadness and strength that are part of the
disease of dementia.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:01:08"></hs_TimeCode>Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:01:17"></hs_TimeCode>
it is not given to men to be as open or as eloquent as women in
discussing our experience of family suffering. However, I will
embarrass my father briefly, for he looked after my mother at home
through many years of dementia. And after my mother’s death,
when I said that I could not have done what he had done, my father
replied quietly, “You never know what you can do until you have
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:01:47"></hs_TimeCode>.” It
falls to our generation to “have to” do something about
dementia, before we too—one in four of us, including one in four
of us in Westminster Hall today—are overtaken by this
disease.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012248000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000005"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:01:54"></hs_TimeCode>In
Gloucestershire—an ageing shire—the need is even more
pressing. So there are three areas that I would be grateful to hear my
hon. Friend the Minister’s views about in this brief debate, and
two on which I would like to share our practice in Gloucestershire.
Then I will finish by issuing an
invitation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:02:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000006">The
first area is research. It is good that Government research expenditure
has doubled, and that the Aricept brand of new drug can delay the speed
at which the disease spreads. However, although that is
valuable—not least for giving families a chance to
plan—Aricept may not work for much more than a year.
Furthermore, although the Government have recently invested
£22 million in research into 21 new products, can my
hon. Friend the Minister confirm that it may be years before we know if
any of them are successful? Since the goal of a cure is such a precious
one—way beyond even the estimated heavy financial cost of
treating sufferers, which is about £19 billion a year—can
he also say if any drug development is close to the stage where the NHS
could really financially back its
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:02:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:02:58"></hs_TimeCode>?

intervention. I know his constituency well, and I am sure that there
are points on which we could exchange information. My hon. Friend the

subject for a separate debate, and we may come back to that issue
another day.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012248000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000010"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:04:05"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
I want to talk about diagnosis. Currently, less than half of people
with dementia in England are formally diagnosed with the disease, even
as dementia affects more of us. Gloucestershire is the county with the
highest number of people with dementia in the south-west, and it has
one of the highest diagnosis rates in the region. However, although the
number of people diagnosed with dementia in Gloucestershire rose by 12%
last year, to 4,037, another 4,800 people in the county are thought to
have the condition but have not yet been diagnosed. Consequently,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:04:40"></hs_TimeCode>although the
diagnosis rate of our primary care trust is good regionally, at 46%,
one can see that we have a long way to go in absolute terms, especially
if the county council is right that our population of people over the
age of 75 will increase by 30% by 2022.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012248000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000011"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:04:57"></hs_TimeCode>Where
is the best practice currently in the country? Could my hon. Friend the
Minister tell us from whom we can learn best how to drive up diagnosis
rates within tight budgets? As the Alzheimer’s Society says,
low-ish diagnosis rates prevent sufferers from accessing support and
medical treatments that can help them to live better with the
condition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:05:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000012">The
third area is care. In the main debate in the House a fortnight ago,
other Members spoke about the link between dementia and care, and about
the growing need for a “fair” solution to the problem of
caring for an ageing population. Again, it falls to our generation to
resolve this situation. Across the country, the number of people over
the age of 65 is set to double during the next 20 years, and in
counties such as mine the rate of growth will be worse, and
faster<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:05:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000013">I
know that, in the wake of the Dilnot commission’s proposals, the
Government will make formal proposals shortly about how they believe
this issue can be settled. I wonder if my hon. Friend the Minister can
say anything today about whether dementia will have a part in that
process, and whether it will perhaps encourage the speed of
implementation of the plans that the Government are
considering.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:06:01"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

time, will my hon. Friend the Minister join me in congratulating
Gloucestershire county council for entirely ring-fencing its budget on
adult social care during these difficult years of local government
spending freezes? In the last debate in the House on dementia, we heard
from several Members whose authorities were not doing that, and it
would be interesting to know how many other authorities are doing the
right thing for the most vulnerable—a group that definitely
includes dementia sufferers—as Gloucestershire has been
doing.</hs_Para>

have promised to mention two local initiatives on dementia, as I
believe they show that Gloucestershire may be leading the way. First, I
pay tribute to the development in Gloucestershire of the community
dementia nurse, or CDN, service, which was launched in December 2011 by
the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust. The CDN service provides specialist
and direct dementia support to GPs, with each surgery in the county
being allocated such a
nurse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:06:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

are fortunate to have a local charitable foundation, the Barnwood
Trust, and it is working closely with the Gloucestershire clinical
commissioning group, which has won £500,000 from the NHS
dementia challenge to create dementia-friendly communities. That means
having community workers who are trained as dementia link
workers—people who are connecting to local
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:07:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:07:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000017"><Member ContinuationText="Rebecca Harris" PimsId="5546" UID="13012248000128" xid="1039" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000128"><B>Rebecca
Harris</B> (Castle Point) (Con):</Member> On that point, does my hon.
Friend agree that it is quite often the local voluntary community
groups such as the Mickey Payne Memorial Foundation, which was set up
by my constituent Caroline Dearson, that are leading the way in
spreading best practice, support networks and awareness within their
communities?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Richard Graham" PimsId="5561" UID="13012248000129" xid="1080" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000129">Richard
Graham:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Community
groups, such as the one in her constituency that she has mentioned and
championed, are exactly the groups of people that are driving forward
best practice at the local level. Of course, if they are able to win
funds from the NHS dementia challenge then so much the better, because
those funds would enable them to spread their good deeds
further.</hs_Para>

Gloucestershire, we also benefit from local charities. The Guideposts
Trust’s dementia web for Gloucestershire is a web-based support
site that provides information for people with Alzheimer’s and
other forms of dementia. We also have two very good-value day centres,
one run by Age UK Gloucestershire and the other by Gloucester Charities

at the same time enabling them to meet friends and access general
facilities, and enabling their carers or loved ones to leave them

there is a very helpful purple butterfly recognition scheme for
dementia sufferers that the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation

managing and dealing with dementia

that is not to say—as my hon. Friend the Minister will
understand—that all is perfect, or that we are necessarily doing
all the best things that can be done. The important thing is that the
barriers are down. All of us can talk openly, in my county and across
the country, about dementia. There is no stigma and no shame, just
shared sadness and sometimes that surprising strength that I alluded to

am sure there are other things being done elsewhere that I would like
to know more about and that my constituents would benefit from. So I
would be grateful today if my hon. Friend the Minister could do a
favour to us all—I mean all parliamentarians—by giving
some ideas of the best practice that he has noticed in different ways
of handling the disease and managing the suffering that goes with it.
Even if he cannot do so comprehensively today, perhaps he can do so
later by letter.</hs_Para>

us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:10:09"></hs_TimeCode>. What role,

across different ethnic minorities? Are there particular extra
sensitivities, such as elderly immigrants reverting to the languages of
their youth, of which we need to be more aware? What more can be done
to support GP surgeries in diagnosing dementia? How can people be

like all good pitches must, this speech ends with an invitation for the

the country and what we can perhaps do more

delighted if the Minister can accept my invitation, because dementia
matters very much to all of us in Gloucestershire, as it does to him,
and we want to continue being adventurous by pushing the boat out and
actively considering new ways to help people living with this ghastly
disease and their families, who are so intimately affected by all
elements of it. As I said at the start, we never know what we can do

then having that loss of recognition. We must understand how
distressing it can be for someone to cope with that, and sometimes with
changing and challenging behaviour, when they may have been married for

intervention that the diagnosis rate is quite good in Northern Ireland.
I applaud the work that is done there, but the support services might
not be as good as in some parts of England, Wales and Scotland. We are
learning about these things together, and there must be close
collaboration between England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.
Scotland has done good work to achieve high diagnosis rates. It has
also introduced the concept of dementia advisers, which my hon. Friend
the Member for
Gloucester<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:18:23"></hs_TimeCode>

collaboration with colleagues in Northern

must be said that that is coming from quite a low base, compared with

were several things I was unable to cover in detail during the recent

<?notus-xml column=62?>hon. Friend was a victim of that. One of them was research, on which we

I give some examples of that, however, I should mention one thing. My
hon. Friend talked about the importance of the scientific community and
the Government collaborating closely to meet the challenge we face.
Last autumn, I spoke at a conference that brought scientists from not
just the UK, but around the world, together with the Government and
interest groups, such as charities that campaign on this issue. Such a
useful gathering is a way of bringing the best brains to bear on this
subject, so that collaborative work must continue.</hs_Para>

21 December, the Government made £22 million available to 21
pioneering research projects to boost dementia diagnosis rates and to
trial groundbreaking treatments. The funding was designed to cover all
areas of scientific activity that are relevant to dementia across the
fields of care, cause and cure, including prevention. For example, we
can do a lot to prevent the condition of vascular dementia from ever
starting, so if prevention is
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:20:18"></hs_TimeCode>, we
must be much smarter. We have also provided £36 million for a
new National Institute for Health Research dementia research
collaboration to work on better treatments and care for, and
understanding of, the condition, as well as £9.6 million to
expand the UK Biobank. Last year there were potentially interesting
developments in treating early-stage dementia, particularly in
Alzheimer’s disease.</hs_Para>

drug companies continue to invest in research, there is now a real
prospect of a treatment within the next decade—that seems to be
the time frame we are dealing with—that could have an impact on
helping to slow or prevent the disorder, if it is caught early enough.
For instance, there have been key recent developments from Eli Lilly,
which is conducting an additional phase 3 study of a new
drug for patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease. I have also
heard about promising plans to expand the testing of a drug for
patients with pre-dementia.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend rightly emphasised the importance of sharing best practice,
of avoiding reinventing  the wheel and of encouraging
innovation, which is  vital for improving dementia care. I am
delighted that Gloucestershire benefited from the additional funding of
£10 million from NHS South West. It is by learning from the
innovative projects that he describes that we will find out what works
and how we can improve
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000041">My
hon. Friend asked me to highlight examples of best practice of people
taking the lead on dementia. One involves the fire and rescue service,
which has made a pledge to take action to increase the safety of people
with dementia. That is a critical area, because someone living with
dementia can be at risk, and the fire and rescue service can do a lot
to help them to remain safe. The service has made a commitment to
raising awareness among staff. Already 28 services have signed up, and
I applaud them for that work. In addition, Tesco has made a commitment
to increase dementia awareness and understanding among its staff and
worked with the Alzheimer’s Society to produce a DVD to achieve
that. The moment when a customer gets confused about change or forgets
their PIN is the one when a caring and 
<?notus-xml column=63?>understanding approach from the checkout operator who is coping with
them is particularly important. It is encouraging that companies such

my hon. Friend mentioned the demographics in his constituency, that
rang true for me, because my constituency, similarly, is rural with an
elderly population. I am pleased that the diagnosis rate in Gloucester
has risen from 40% to more than 45% in the past year but, as in many
places, there is still massive room for improvement to match the best
performing areas, such as Islington, where the diagnosis rate is 75%.
There is an enormous gap between the best and the worst, and a long way
to go<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:24:01"></hs_TimeCode>. We have

eating. People will have to pay up when they cannot afford it and then
get into debt or move out and away from their community. This is a

Member for Newport East, but for the record, the Government are seeking
to take £18 billion a year of what we spend on social security
and tax credits because of the vast amount of borrowing that we had to
deal with. It is not that the Government woke up one morning and
thought, “Wouldn’t it be nice to cut people’s
housing benefit?” We have to stop a situation in which for every
£3 the Government were raising in tax, they were spending
£4. That is unsustainable. It is not fair to the children whom
we are expecting to pay our debts. That is why the Government are
looking to save money on social
security.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000090">Housing
benefit is a vast and rapidly rising bill and inevitably had to be
looked at, so within the housing benefit budget, what can be looked at?
We have looked at private sector rent. We have looked at shared
accommodation for younger people. Within the social sector, there are
two reasons why spare bedrooms—where they are spare
bedrooms—need to be looked at. The first is the unfairness
between social tenants and private tenants. At present, a private
tenant cannot have housing benefit for a property with spare bedrooms.
They can have housing benefit only for a property of the size that they
need. However, a social tenant living next door can have housing
benefit for a bigger house. That is an unfairness. At a time when we
are trying to take costs out of the system to deal with the deficit,
being fairer to private tenants and not giving social tenants an
advantage over and above the advantage that they already have through a
subsidised rent is an issue of
fairness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000091">There
is also an issue of fairness in the system in relation to people who
are overcrowded. There was absolutely no mention in the hon.
Lady’s speech of people who are living in overcrowded
accommodation. If we have a limited social housing
stock—frankly, successive Governments have failed to build
enough social houses; it is a finite stock and a social house, with a
subsidised rent, is a very valuable thing—we owe it to those who
are overcrowded to make maximum use of the housing
stock<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:46:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000092">Getting
from here to there is a painful and difficult process. I accept that,
but many housing associations and social landlords around Britain have
been creative and imaginative—I accept that the position will be
different from area to area—about moving people who were in
overcrowded accommodation into family homes and finding places for
people in under-occupied accommodation to move to. It is not a static
case—on the register this week, there are only so many empty
properties. Social landlords have to start getting to know their
tenants much better than they have in the past. All too often, they
have not done that. That process—I accept that it will be a
difficult transition—should lead to better use of the social

Webb:</Member></B> No, I want to respond to the hon. Lady. She said
that these are the lifetime homes of some people, and I entirely accept
that. That is why we have exempted pensioners as a group. A set of
pensioners have spare rooms, living in the home that they have occupied
all their lives, and we are not touching them for the reasons she
gave.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000099">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>
who are below pension age can clearly respond in a range of ways. It
will be different for every person. For example, we are often told that
some people in social housing or on housing benefit are in work, and
the average £12 shortfall in Wales is the equivalent of two
hours at the minimum wage, so for some people, as the hon. Lady said,
it will be a matter of working a few extra hours. I accept that that is
not an option for everyone, but it is for some. Others might have the
opportunity to do a part-time job, if they are not currently. She said
that some would not be able to take in a lodger or tenant, but some
can. I had a constituent ring me up to say, “I am in a
three-bedroom house, I live on my own and I have just had one of these
letters. What shall I do?” We started talking and she said,
“To be honest, my brother and sister-in-law would quite like to
move in. Can we do that?” Yes, they can, and that would be using
the house to much better effect. That will not be right for everyone,
but there will be a range of responses. The system is geared so that if
people have a boarder or sub-tenant—most social landlords should
allow a sub-tenant, in an organised way—they get to keep at
least the first £20 a week of the income. Those are all options,
which will not work for everyone, but there is a range of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:51:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012248000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/halltext/130122h0002.htm#13012248000100">The

of the case studies. One of them is just wrong. In the case she
mentioned of the ex-serviceman with a teenager who might go off to
university, provided she is not away for more than 13 weeks
at a time, she can have the bedroom. That means that social landlords
have to be good at communicating with their
tenants. I have seen good examples, although I have
also seen some bad ones. The  
<?notus-xml column=72?>other examples may well be true but I saw that case
and it jumped out at me, and I thought, “That is not
right”, although there is a description of how distressed the
man was. Someone has a duty to know the rules—we have to
communicate them effectively, but so do the social landlords. I have
seen letters sent out by social landlords that are excellent, that
explain the rules and what discretionary housing payments are, but I
have seen others that do not even mention discretionary housing
payments. We have to ensure that social landlords up their

£50,000, £54,000 or something. The figure for that local
authority for the year we are talking about, when the policy comes in,
is not £50,000 but £193,000. That is when the policy
comes in. Clearly, the point of discretionary housing payments is not
to make up everyone’s shortfall, or we would not make any money

substantial adaptation, we get someone whom we did not think of just
the wrong side of the line and someone whom we did not need to include

stairlifts, extra rooms, widened doors and all the rest, it is pretty
obvious, or if someone has had a handgrip, it is pretty obvious, but

hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams)
mentioned rural communities. We will evaluate the
impact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:56:11"></hs_TimeCode> of the
policy over a two-year period, but with interim reports that we will
publish across England, Scotland and Wales, and across rural, urban and
suburban constituencies. As a consequence of debates in the House of
Lords on the Bill as it went through, we agreed—we were well on
the way to doing this anyway—proper evaluation, so if there are
particular issues in Wales or in rural areas, we will have the chance
to respond, for example, by adjusting the allocation of discretionary
housing payments. That allocation has been set for 2013-14 but not
beyond, so if we learn things during the year, we can look at whether
we need to change the allocation.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:57:09"></hs_TimeCode> could change
the rules of the scheme. Obviously, that is a more fundamental change,
but we have a fairly flexible lever if we get early signs that there
are problems in particular areas.</hs_Para>

are trying to support social landlords, so we have worked with the
Chartered Institute of Housing to produce a toolkit for landlords
called “Making it Fit”,  
<?notus-xml column=74?>which provides an overview of how different social landlords are
responding. The last thing I want to convey is that the change will be
easy for people, that there will not be people who find it difficult,
and that it will not be disruptive. However, there is a difference when
social landlords engage, get in there early and get to know their
tenants—for example, those who sit with their tenants and say,
“Are you claiming all the benefits you are entitled to? Could
you be getting disability living allowance, for example, which would
top up the household income?” There is chance to have a
constructive engagement with tenants to find out their needs and what
is happening. Many social landlords do not know whether their tenants
are even there, or whether they are sub-letting. A lot of beneficial
things that need to happen could happen as a
result.</hs_Para>

Webb:</Member></B> I accept that Bron Afon has been out and talked to
its tenants, and if that has triggered the process, it is a good thing.
As I said, I have some doubts about at least one of the case studies,
and in terms of some of the other case studies, I hope that the housing
association has explained what discretionary housing payments are,
because I think, from memory, another one had a disabled adaptation, or
something like that, and that is what DHPs are for. It certainly was
not a criticism of Bron Afon, but there are social landlords who are
upping their game, engaging, and trying to generate extra revenue
through benefit take-up. They are being creative, looking at the
private market, and they are moving people around. They accept that the
change is coming and are not simply saying, “Oh, this is
terrible”, but doing something constructive. I welcome any
housing association or social landlord that does that, and they deserve
credit.</hs_Para>

have mentioned the discretionary housing payment money. The particular
people we had in mind are those with disabled adaptations and foster
carers, but the local authority has discretion to use it in individual
cases. I do not belittle the impact that this significant change will
have. We need to save money, but we have the potential to make better
use of our social housing stock to deal with not only under-occupation,
but overcrowding, and to be fair between social and private tenants. At
a time when we are trying to take very large sums of money out of the
housing benefit bill to deal with the vast, yawning deficit that was
not dealt with, we need to look at this area but manage the process,
and that is what our research and use of DHPs is designed to
achieve.</hs_Para>

implemented a defined contracting process with fixed timings. Under
this new timetable, once bidders were informed they have been selected,

expired on 19 January 2013. Seven bidders have withdrawn. I can inform

authority areas where the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) did not
meet performance standard 3. This standard aims to ensure that EROs
make the necessary house-to-house inquiries to ensure that all eligible
residents are registered, in line with their legal duty to maintain
complete and accurate electoral
registers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012252000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0001.htm#13012252000046">In
2012 the Commission reviewed the canvass plans of all EROs ahead of the
annual canvass to confirm that arrangements were in place for the
necessary house-to-house inquiries to be carried out. The Commission
intervened where issues were identified and recommended improvements
that should be made before the completion of the canvass. The
Commission's report on ERO performance in 2012 will be published in
spring 2013 and will assess the extent to which house-to-house
inquiries are being carried out across Great

against this standard in response to feedback indicating that for

Barker:</Member></B> Under ECO there is no requirement for suppliers to
report on the number of assessments made. Ofgem, as the Administrator
of the ECO scheme, will be providing monthly information on progress
made against installation of measures by obligated energy suppliers.
The first of these reports is due after energy suppliers have submitted
to Ofgem at the end of February, and will cover all measures installed
since last October. However, there is strong evidence that ECO activity
is already under way, with company offers available in the market place
and a number of partnerships between energy companies and local
authorities—including in Bristol, Birmingham and
Leeds—under way. The Government's Energy Savings Advice Service
has also provided a significant number of referrals for
Affordable-Warmth eligible customers, and the first legally binding
auction on the ECO brokerage platform was successfully held on 15
January, selling packages of work to install hundreds of eligible
measures over the coming months.</hs_Para>

the risk of incursion from illegal imports. Should there be a disease
outbreak, we have tried and tested contingency plans that are evidence

its own assessment of the economic effect of London Southend airport.
However, we fully recognise the contributions that airports such as
Southend can make to local and regional economies, their important role
in maintaining the UK's air connectivity, and their potential for
helping accommodate forecast growth in demand for aviation in the UK.
In this regard it is encouraging to note the recent developments at
Southend airport, including the new railway station and terminal, and
the successful launch of more commercial flights to an increased number
of European destinations last year. Furthermore, the airport is
extending its terminal 
<?notus-xml column=144?>to allow it to handle more passengers from 2014. These developments will
benefit not only the airport but the area around Southend as well as
the wider

disclose is restricted to arrangements that fall within certain

the Member for Putney (Justine Greening), will return to the issue of
general budget support to Rwanda later in 2013. In December 2012 DFID
froze all UK aid spent through the Government of Uganda due to concerns
that aid money may have been misused. With investigations ongoing it is
too early to anticipate decisions on resumption. In Malawi DFID
suspended general budget support in July 2011 due to economic and

authoritative definition of 'household product' in UK or European
legislation. For the purposes of the current annual statistical
collection, project licence holders are required to report the use of
animals to test 'substances used in the household'. Where there is
uncertainty, decisions on whether procedures should be recorded under
this heading are taken on a case by case basis. No procedures were
reported for this purpose in 2011, the latest year for which figures

McVey:</Member></B> The introduction of personal independence payment
does not introduce a statutory burden on charities, business or civil
society organisations. We are aware that claimants may seek advice from
voluntary sector organisations and recognise the valuable support
charities provide. That is why throughout the design and development of
personal independence payment we have put claimants and disability
organisations, including charities, at the heart of our reforms. As
stated in my reply of 9 January 2013, <I>Official Report</I>, column

make any necessary changes before the majority of existing DLA

the current state pension system is dependent on the date they reach
state pension age. People who reach state pension age prior to the

opportunities Malaysia's strong economic growth provides. In the other

human rights situation in Tibet, including the large number of
self-immolations. Our diplomats visited Tibetan regions of China in
December 2012 to assess the situation on the ground. I issued a
statement on 17 December urging the Chinese authorities to
make every effort to resume meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama's
representatives as the best way to achieve a long-term solution to
underlying tensions. My statement also called on the Tibetan people not
to resort to extreme forms of protest such as self-immolations. We
believe a long-term solution depends on respect for human rights and
genuine autonomy for Tibetans within the framework of the Chinese
constitution.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13012263000088" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0002.htm#13012263000088">Travellers</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13012263000805" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0002.htm#13012263000805"><B><Member PimsId="4044" UID="13012263001044" xid="53" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0002.htm#13012263001044">Mr

Timpson:</Member></B> Lone migrant children, including those that may
have been trafficked, come into care, and then receive the full range
of support and care that all looked after children are entitled to.
Local authorities must allocate each child a social worker to assess
his or her needs and draw up a care plan which sets out how the
authority intends to respond to the full range of the child's needs.
This includes ensuring they have the necessary legal and other support
they need, including access to health, education and appropriate and
safe accommodation, whether through a foster care arrangement,
children's home, or supported accommodation. They also have an
Independent Reviewing Officer to oversee their care arrangements, as
well as access to an advocate and an independent
visitor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012271001076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0003.htm#13012271001076">Some
local authorities are very effective in supporting these vulnerable
young people, and others less so. We want all local authorities to come
up to the standard of the best. The Government, with support from the
Office of the Children's Commissioner, has commissioned a piece of work
to examine the practical care arrangements for looked after children
who have or may have been trafficked. This will identify good practice

The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the
principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has
been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the
offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same
disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is
the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>4</Sup> Every effort Is
made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete.
However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted

Wright:</Member></B> In the consultation ‘Punishment and reform:
Effective Community Sentences’, the Government sought views on
whether to create a sentencing power to seize offenders’ assets.
However, the responses to the consultation highlighted some
difficulties with such a power and as a result, the Government decided
not to take the proposal forward at this time. Instead, the Government
introduced provisions in the Crime and Courts Bill to make it clear
that when fixing the level of a financial penalty courts can require
offenders to provide information about their assets as well as their
income. In this way, courts will be able to take into account an
offender's assets when setting the value of a
fine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012271001892" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0003.htm#13012271001892">No

The National Offender Management Service has in place a prisoner
focused care planning system for those identified as at risk of
self-harm or suicide. The system, Assessment, Care in Custody and
Teamwork (ACCT), has helped prisons to manage prisoners’ risk of
self-harm and suicide since 2007. The vast majority of self-harm is not
directly life threatening but nevertheless can be extremely distressing
both for those affected by it

shown is the proportion of these costs as a percentage of the total
annual outturn expenditure incurred by Trusts against the funding
allocated by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). It should
be noted that trusts may also provide services to and be funded by
other sources, and as such a comparison of staffing and accommodation
costs against NOMS outturn costs may not fully represent the position.
In addition the staffing costs recorded in the individual Probation
Trust Annual Report and Accounts will reflect full expenditure by
trusts including the provision of any services to other commissioning
organisations in addition to NOMS. As a result, figures may not be
directly comparable between
trusts.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="2" Size="7"><table tabstyle="head"><tgroup cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="22*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="13*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="13*"></colspec><colspec colname="4" colwidth="14*"></colspec><colspec colname="5" colwidth="13*"></colspec><colspec colname="6" colwidth="13*"></colspec><colspec colname="7" colwidth="14*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="7" namest="1" rowsep="1"><hs_TableTitle Justify="centre"><I>Probation

the Government is delivering a package of measures to reduce barriers
to broadband rollout. It is relaxing planning restrictions around the
installation of new cabinets and poles via an enabling clause in the
Growth and Infrastructure Bill and amendments to secondary legislation,
which will reduce the cost of rollout and increase certainty for
communications providers. The Law Commission has undertaken a review of
the Electronic Communications Code (which governs the wayleave regime
for installing communications equipment over or under private land) and
will make its recommendations to Government in February 2013. The
Department for Transport has produced new guidance on issuing permit
schemes for street works, which will also simplify the process for
superfast broadband rollout. All of these measures are a vital support

Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) 2003,
consumers are protected from nuisance unsolicited marketing calls,
through the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), which is a free

registered with the TPS, or if they have previously notified the caller
that they do not wish to receive such calls. The Information

responsible for distributing millions of spam texts. The ICO has also
published on its website a list of the most complained about companies

the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) 2003,
considers complaints about unsolicited marketing calls. Therefore, the
ICO undertakes work of this nature with other regulators and through
international forums and is a signatory to the London Action plan,
which is a scheme to endorse worldwide spam enforcement. Also, the ICO
is a member of the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Enforcement
Forum, which creates a network of public, and other enforcement bodies
across the EU, that are responsible for the enforcement of consumer
protection legislation in member states. Although calls from overseas
foreign companies fall outside the jurisdiction of the UK, callers from
within the UK, or those based overseas calling on behalf of UK
companies, are already legally required not to call a number that is
registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), or if they have

Swinson:</Member></B> In the last five years (2007-12) the Office of
Fair Trading (OFT) imposed financial penalties on construction
companies on one occasion: a large number of construction companies
were fined in the OFT's 2009 infringement decision in the ‘Bid
rigging in the construction industry in England’
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012271003204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0005.htm#13012271003204">In
that case the OFT found that the infringing parties had engaged in
illegal anti-competitive bid-rigging activities on a large number of
tenders for building contracts from 2000 to 2006, mostly in the form of
‘cover pricing’. Cover pricing is where one or more
bidders in a tender process obtains an artificially high price from a
competitor. Such cover bids are priced so as not to win the contract
but are submitted as genuine bids, which gives a misleading impression
to clients as to the real extent of competition. This distorts the
tender process and makes it less likely that other potentially cheaper
firms are invited to
tender.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012271003205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0005.htm#13012271003205">Details

number of the companies fined appealed the OFT's decision to the
Competition Appeal Tribunal (the CAT). In 2011 the CAT issued judgments
upholding the overwhelming majority of the OFT's findings on liability
but reducing the level of fines the OFT had imposed on the appealing
parties. The relevant judgments are available on the CAT website

analysis of food products using DNA-based methodology is an established
technique and used routinely by United Kingdom official control
laboratories and commercial laboratories. These tests are used most
often to determine fish species in food products, and presence of
genetically modified organisms. Six UK official control laboratories
are able to analyse meat to determine whether it contains horse DNA

methodology.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301233000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0005.htm#1301233000058">The
DNA analysis method is only one of the analytical methods available to
determine whether substitution of meat has taken place. Other
analytical methods include ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno-absorbent

proteins present in known meat

year, local authorities carry out a substantial amount of sampling of
meat identification to ensure that the meat species in meat products
match the expectations of the label description. In 2012, at least 796

species in meat products) as part of local authority risk-based
sampling programmes. While some of the samples were found

maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements,
as one of concern among United Kingdom citizens. The Secretary of State
for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for South West Surrey (Mr
Hunt), met with the Commissioner on 17 January 2013, emphasising the
importance that any future proposals should be based on science and
safety, to allow for the highest safe maximum levels. The nature of the

Poulter</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 21 January 2013]:</I> Language
checks including tests can already be administered to European Economic
Area qualified doctors by employers and contracting bodies. However, as
announced in 2011 the Government is seeking to strengthen language
checking by amending the Responsible Officer Regulations so that
Responsible Officers are explicitly required to ensure that doctors in
England have sufficient knowledge of English language to perform their
work when they are appointed to an organisation. Subject to
parliamentary approval the amended regulation should be brought into
force on 1 April
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301233000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0005.htm#1301233000160">We
are also exploring amending the Medical Act to strengthen the General
Medical Council's (GMC) powers so that the GMC can undertake checks on
language knowledge where legitimate concerns arise during the
registration process about a doctor's ability to communicate
effectively, and before there is evidence of malpractice. The
Department is working constructively with the GMC, and we envisage that
shortly we will be announcing further steps to develop the
policy.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1301233000016" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0005.htm#1301233000016">Domestic

Poulter:</Member></B> Practices continue to maintain high levels of
achievement against the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in England
achieving 96.9% of the points available, compared to 94.7% in the
previous year. The main reason for the small increase in average points
achievement is technical, due to a change in the allocation of points
between QOF
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301233000434" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0006.htm#1301233000434">Achievement
on obesity is the same as the previous year at 100%. The indicator
rewards general practitioners (GPs) for keeping a register of patients
aged 16 years and over with a body mass index greater than or equal to
30 in the preceding 15 months. GPs cannot except patients from the
obesity register. The percentage of patients included in the register
is slightly higher than 
<?notus-xml column=283?>the previous year (10.7% compared to 10.5%). However, the indicator only
captures patients whose body mass index has been recorded as part of
routine care during the past year and so does not record true
prevalence in the
population.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301233000435" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0006.htm#1301233000435">The
QOF has brought improvements in patient care, but we need to go further

Association for changes to the GP contract to drive up standards for

priorities for development of public health indicators for

Soubry:</Member></B> In 2008 the Organ Donation Taskforce considered
presumed consent in considerable detail looking 
<?notus-xml column=284?>at the clinical, communication, cultural, ethical, legal and practical
aspects of opt-out legislation. As part of its evidence gathering for
its second report, ‘The potential impact of an opt-out system
for organ donation’, published in November 2008, the taskforce
commissioned a systematic literature review from the University of York
to assess the impact of opt-out legislation on organ donation rates in
other countries. It also reviewed eight studies comparing different
countries and found that direct comparison between countries was
difficult because of the wide range of other factors that influence
organ donation rates, for example, mortality from road traffic
accidents, religion, education, and transplant infrastructure. The
reviewers found that the evidence identified and appraised was not
robust enough to provide clear guidance for
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301233000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130122/text/130122w0006.htm#1301233000439">The
taskforce concluded that while such a system might have the potential
to deliver benefits, it was not confident the introduction would
increase organ donor numbers and that there was some evidence that
donor numbers may go down. For example, although the majority of faith
and belief groups interviewed were positive about donation most were
opposed to the introduction of opt-out legislation.</hs_Para>
