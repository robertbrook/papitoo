Lords, the Government’s economic strategy is underpinned by
fiscal consolidation, allowing monetary activism and supply-side
reforms to support the economy. This strategy has provided the
foundations for recovery. Market interest rates have fallen to
near-record lows; the deficit has been reduced by a quarter; more than

Mitchell:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply.
Today, this Government have been in office for 1,000 days: 1,000 days,
and we are teetering on the brink of a triple-dip recession; 1,000
days, and the UK’s credit rating is close to being downgraded;
1,000 days, and our national debt is rising; 1,000 days, and our
productivity is falling; 1,000 days, and our trade gap is widening.
After 1,000 days, does not the Minister think that this Government
should stop blaming the previous Government and start taking
responsibility for their own failed economic
policies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:08:55"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="13013053000164" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000164">Lord
Deighton:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for that question. I
confirm that we are facing extraordinarily challenging economic
conditions, but the economy is recovering from the most damaging
financial crisis in generations after a decade of growth built on
unsustainable levels of debt. This Government inherited the largest
deficit since the Second World War and the largest in the G20, and we
experienced one of the deepest recessions of any major economy. This
Government’s strategy is designed to protect the economy through
this period of global uncertainty, to maintain market confidence and
keep those interest rates low, and to lay the foundations for a
stronger, more balanced
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:09:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Soley" PimsId="4897" UID="13013053000165" xid="1906" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000165">Lord

you will not get out of this deficit. We had larger deficits than this

Deighton:</Member></B> I agree with the implicit statement of the noble
Lord that the economy is taking a long time to recover. That is because
of the depth of the problems that we confront and the global nature of
the economic recession with which we are dealing. There is only one
effective solution to that, which is to restore market credibility. The
only way in which we can do that is to ensure that our finances are
absolutely stable. The alternative strategy of borrowing more to
increase demand has already been proven, given the state that we got
into, not to work. You do not borrow your way out of a recession which
is caused by a deficit created by borrowing too
much.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:10:56"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="13013053000167" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000167">Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> Will my noble friend confirm that the
reason the Government are facing such terrible economic difficulties is
because at the height of the boom created by Gordon Brown, that
Government continued to borrow? As a measure of their economic
competence, they sold gold at the bottom of the market, which is
affectionately known in the City as the “Brown

Deighton:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for that excellent
contribution. I will not comment on the timing of selling
the gold. Hitting a market high is tough to do. I will refer to what I
would call the “scissors of doom”, which is the graph I
was first shown when I entered the Treasury, which shows that between
2008 and 2010 spending was heading north at a rapid rate while receipts
were heading south at an equally rapid rate, a situation that we are
now trying to recover through this period of fiscal
consolidation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:12:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tomlinson" PimsId="4304" UID="13013053000169" xid="1523" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000169">Lord
Tomlinson:</Member></B> Does the Minister agree that confidence in the
United Kingdom is being illustrated by the way sterling is devaluing
against the euro—the much derided euro on which we blame so many
of our economic ills? If the medicine is so good, why is the patient

Deighton:</Member></B> There are many positive signs. I do not think
that the patient does look so ill. I refer to the extraordinary
employment levels—the biggest increase in employment for the
past 20 years. On the question of the exchange rate, the noble Lord is
absolutely correct that sterling has recently weakened against the
euro. The exchange rate has two sides: the strength of the eurozone
versus the UK economy. What that exchange rate reflects is that many of
the risks that have been confronted by the eurozone over the past two
or three years are perceived by the market to be
diminishing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:13:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Flight" PimsId="5908" UID="13013053000171" xid="2118" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000171">Lord

Deighton:</Member></B> I welcome my noble friend’s encouragement
to delve a little deeper into the figures. Certainly, with respect to
employment, we are seeing a switch from an overinflated public sector
to a much more dynamic private sector, which will stand us in 
<?notus-xml column=1537?>very good stead in the longer term. If one looks at
the specific factors relating to the output figures, there are some
very interesting facts; for example, the majority of the decline in the
fourth quarter relates to maintenance in the North Sea, and coping with
the long-term decline of that source of revenue to the United Kingdom
is a structural problem to which we must
adjust.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Barnett" PimsId="3885" UID="13013053000173" xid="1068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000173">Lord

that I am replying to a former Minister for Tourism. I assure your
Lordships that the Government are taking tourism and its potential
extremely seriously. The Prime Minister is leading from the front on
this issue; indeed, the Secretary of State and the Minister for Sports
and Tourism are fully engaged in promoting it. The Government are
investing £137 million over four years via the GREAT campaign,
which is delivered through VisitBritain and in partnership with the
private sector. Through that investment, we hope that almost 60,000 new
job opportunities will be created. Those will of course include job
opportunities for the young, while the success story of apprenticeships
is very

being marketed abroad effectively by VisitBritain? This fact was
recognised by his ministerial colleague Mr Stephen Crabb, who said

important for China. Clearly, there are also important advantages. We
want to ensure that the growth of tourism from India and other
countries improves. Our objective is to get 500,000 new visitors from
China by 2015. This is clearly going to involve a great deal of work
co-ordinating vis-à-vis airports, as the noble Baroness

Isaias Afewerki’s Eritrean army indicate a shifting of regional

think all noble Lords in this House would agree that a legitimate
Government and stability in the region are essential. We can see from
what has happened in Mali and Algeria that it is absolutely essential
for us to support a democratic process to resolve border disputes. We
have been working with the United Nations and the European Union to try
to ensure that these countries continue to speak to resolve their
differences. As my noble friend will be aware, the Boundary Commission

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and
Climate Change (Baroness Verma):</Member></B> My Lords, following its
successful launch on Monday, I expect the Green Deal to revolutionise
energy saving in our homes. It will transform the energy efficiency
market, giving consumers real choice and control
over how they can improve their properties. The new energy
company obligation will ensure that those who
struggle 
<?notus-xml column=1542?>most to heat their homes affordably will get the help that they need.
The reaction of industry and other groups has been more than
encouraging. I am pleased with the warm reception from the party
opposite for the Green
Deal.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:30:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Ezra:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. I
agree that the Green Deal and the energy company obligation are
innovative schemes, and I hope that they are very successful. However,
there is one aspect that I am a little concerned about—the rate
of build-up at a time when fuel poverty is still increasing. There may
be a lapse before these schemes get fully under way. Would my noble
friend care to comment on that aspect? In that connection, would she
also comment on a number of reports that have come out on the fact that
there have been some lay-offs in the insulation
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:30:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000049"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13013053000209" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000209">Baroness
Verma:</Member></B> I begin by thanking my noble friend for his very
warm welcome. The Green Deal targets energy efficiency schemes and is
one of the most effective ways in which to tackle fuel poverty. That is
why the minimum of 40% of eco will help to support low-income
households. The eco-affordable warmth and carbon saving community
obligations will support around 230,000 low-income households each
year. The insulation sector as a whole has a real opportunity to grow
from the success of the Green Deal, and we estimate that overall jobs
in the sector will increase from the 26,000 recorded in 2011 to about
60,000 in
2015<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:30:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000050"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Worthington" PimsId="5934" UID="13013053000210" xid="2144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000210">Baroness
Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, interest rates for loans for home
improvement under the Green Deal appear far higher than can be obtained
on the high street. Both Homebase and the RBS, for example, offer loans
at below 5% interest, whereas the Green Deal base rate starts at 6.9%.
Can the Minister please explain why the Government have failed to
negotiate a more attractive offer? Could she also inform the House how
many people have signed up since the launch on
Monday<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000051"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13013053000211" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000211">Baroness
Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a market-based deal. To be quite
frank, it is really important that we allow consumers the choice of
finding where they want to go for their finance, but this offer from
the Green Deal Finance Company is available to 80% of the population.
So it is a competitive rate, but if people want to source elsewhere it
does not stop them from doing so. We also think that the energy company
obligation with the extra £540 million attached to it will help
those families who are not always able to access and source competitive
rates. As for commenting on how many people have signed up, it was
launched only on Monday, so it would be very predictive of me to be
able to predict a figure for the noble Baroness at this
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T15:32:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000052"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Foulkes of Cumnock" PimsId="4875" UID="13013053000212" xid="1866" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000212">Lord

the poorer sections of our community, the huge subsidies paid for the
installation of wholly inefficient wind turbines, which will make no
measurable effect on world CO<Sub>2</Sub> levels, are making British
industry uncompetitive and, as the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said earlier,
putting millions of households deeper into fuel poverty. Surely it is

could usefully be discussed, but I know that the reasons for it not
happening were beyond anybody’s

amendments are an attempt to test the Government’s resolve and
are a litmus test of their real intentions as regards growth and
infrastructure. I turn to the detail. Amendment 58 is about advance
payments. I should explain that when a compulsory purchase order is
made and land is taken, a claimant is entitled to an advance payment of
90% of the estimated compensation due to them, while the final amount
is being worked out. It should be borne in mind that at that stage, the
relevant land has been taken and the acquiring body is in possession.
The problem is that there is a lack of standardisation in the approach
to claiming and receiving this payment.</hs_para>

amendment would effectively alter Section 52A of the Land Compensation

advance payments through a regulatory framework. If taken forward, it

that demands for excessive or irrelevant information were curtailed,
and that payments would have to be made in a timely fashion. I accept
that there is a little more detail behind it than that but those are

loss payments. I ask your Lordships to ignore the length of the
amendment. The principle is a good deal simpler and I shall not go
through the amendment line by line. Loss payments are top-up sums paid
to claimants in recognition of compulsion being used. They apply
variously to occupiers or tenants and to investors or landlords.
Occupiers are entitled to 2.5% of the value of their interest as a loss
payment up to a maximum of £25,000. Investors—for some
reason that escapes me—are entitled to 7.5% of the value of
their interest up to a maximum of £75,000. However, the
Compulsory Purchase Association and I do not feel that this represents
a fair balance between the respective claimant interests. It is the
occupier in possession who is displaced and has to reorganise his
affairs and who bears the brunt of the acquisition impact. Therefore,
my view is that those figures should be reversed. The amendment would
reverse that inequitable treatment between occupiers sustaining the

as regards Amendment 58, the Government are very grateful to the noble
Earl for raising this matter. I, too, am concerned to hear about the
poor practice in making advance payments of compensation. However, it

the acquiring authority to make the payment when it is
due.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000062">The
provision to allow an advance payment to be made before possession is

Amendment 59, the Government note the view that the percentages for
loss payments should be reversed, so that occupiers get the

perhaps less so for owners. The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, suggests that
this change would be cost neutral and I have no doubt that cases can be
found where this is so. Some have been set out in the Compulsory
Purchase Association’s evidence to the Committee in the other
place. There may equally be cases where the amount of compensation
would rise. Currently, both the evidence and the views of the acquiring
authorities are
lacking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000064">For
both of these amendments, the issues raised would require further
investigation before they could be taken forward. As I said earlier, it
is not clear where the teeth could be found to ensure that advance
payments are made in time. This might be a subject for good practice
guidance, as we have mentioned in respect of other areas of the Bill.
That guidance should come from the sector. I am sure that some
authorities do things properly, and if others were told how this was
done, the situation may improve. The noble Earl was quite clear that
sometimes it is not apparent how this process can be done more
effectively and the information is not readily available.</hs_para>

regulatory power provisions. There is a much longer document behind
that, which sets out a series of recommendations that I know have been

with national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty.
The issue is how to get superfast broadband to them. The key
point on which we are all agreed is that this needs to happen
superfast. No one disputes this. The DCMS consultation paper, published
yesterday,
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13013053000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000126">“We

consultation paper published yesterday makes an excellent case for why
we need a rapid rollout of superfast broadband. It points out that in
the national parks there are more than 22,000 businesses, of which more
than 70% are SMEs. In areas of outstanding natural beauty there are
more than 61,000 businesses, of which 74% are SMEs. It also points out
that there are more than 153,000 homes in the national parks, and more
than 467,000 in areas of outstanding natural beauty. The consultation

providing planning certainty, the aim is to encourage operators to
invest in new infrastructure to support greater rural connectivity for
householders and SME businesses in protected areas, supported by the

I have spoken to those in charge of our national parks. They tell me
that, far from obstructing superfast broadband, they are desperate for
it. They see it as absolutely vital to their communities and to their

required for the installation of the necessary cabinets and masts
through the existing prior notification

to superfast broadband being installed is not planning, but the
commercial incentives and funding for the broadband suppliers to
install the infrastructure in the first place. Just to quote the

notifications and 97% of those were approved. Two-thirds of national
park authorities have not rejected a single application in the past
five years. There were 144 planning applications for telecoms equipment

Parminter:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the deletion of Clause 8
and in so doing I thank my noble friends Lord Greaves and Lord
Marlesford, and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, for joining me in this. The
debate today is complicated, given that we are considering the
Government’s proposed approach to deliver broadband to remote
and special areas through new secondary legislation that was set out in
a consultation published only last night, which they argue requires
changes to be made to primary legislation as set out in Clause
8.</hs_para>

first issue for the Committee to consider must be whether a case has
been made for any legislative changes. The examples given by the
Government in support of this legislative change do not, as the noble
Lord, Lord Adonis, has said, demonstrate convincingly that national
parks and AONB planning authorities are the barrier to delivering the
broadband that rural communities want and rural economies need. The few
examples of broadband planning delays cited are in areas outside
national parks and AONBs. Indeed, the argument used in the
Government’s consultation document to support changing the law
is not that planning authorities in national parks and AONBs have been
to date a barrier, rather it is the need to cut the costs of deploying
broadband infrastructure to enable it to go as far as it
can.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000086">The
second issue is whether the secondary legislation the Government want
to introduce requires the proposed changes to be made to the primary
legislation. Of particular concern in that regard is why there is a
need to change the long-standing duties in national park and AONB
legislation. I can see the argument to add a further consideration to
the Communications Act 2003 for the Secretary of State to have regard
to promote economic growth at the same time as other existing duties,
which is what subsection (1) of Clause 8 proposes. This means that the
Secretary of State would be obliged to consider the need to promote
economic growth alongside and, crucially, give equal weight to, other
considerations, which would include having regard to the need to
protect the environment, and in particular to conserve the natural
beauty and amenity of the countryside. However, I fail to see why the
following eight subsections of Clause 8 are necessary to ensure that
these pieces of legislation are consistent with the amended
Communications
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000087">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:14:38"></hs_TimeCode>
am not convinced that amending the Communications Act requires the
disapplication of the duty to have regard to conserving beauty in other
pieces of primary legislation. If this House is to accept changes to
the legislation, the Minister must make clear the legal case for the
necessity of such a disproportionate measure. It is a disproportionate
approach, which not only sets a dangerous precedent for weakening the
protection given to national parks and AONBs but creates the impression
that the Government are intent on nibbling away at protection policies
for our most valued landscapes and countryside; protection which has
been in place since 1949. This approach makes the commitment in the
recent National Planning Policy Framework to give great weight to
conserving landscape and scenic beauty in national parks and AONBs
sound very hollow indeed and is disproportionate, given that national
parks authorities are not inflexible regulators, bystanders or
obstacles to broadband rollout. National parks authorities are leading
the development of local broadband programmes, with the New Forest
National Park Authority supporting parish councils in a joint bid to
Defra’s very welcome £20 million rural communications
broadband fund and the Lake District National Park sitting on a
Cumbria-wide steering group aiming to get superfast broadband coverage
to 90% of the county, including the national park.</hs_para>

planning authorities are involved in decisions which balance the need
for broadband and countryside protection. Cabinets are big and
intrusive—nearly two metres tall—and the noble Lord, Lord
True, gave some excellent examples at Second Reading of insensitive
siting. Efforts to camouflage cabinets green are wasted when operators
such as Virgin and BT use them as advertising hoardings to promote
their campaign that, “Fibre broadband is here”. In
Guildford this week, Virgin Media is having to remove 200 posters on
such street cabinets. Experience to date hardly suggests that operators
are going to site in the least visible places, unless they are under
some duty to consult. It is right that planning authorities work with
providers to ensure that the effects on the landscape are minimised

need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000089">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:12:11"></hs_TimeCode>
the Government intend to regulate to temporarily remove the current
requirement for communication providers to seek prior approval from

development can go ahead—that seems to be their direction of
travel—I, too, would support a code of best siting practice
between operators and local planning authorities to show how broadband
undertakers should work with local authorities on siting. The
Government’s consultation does not make it clear whether the
code they propose is voluntary or mandatory. It should be mandatory, to
give operators the certainty they claim they want in planning
procedures and give local authorities the certainty that their
legitimate concerns will be heard. As the Government seek to champion
the speedy and cost-effective rollout of broadband to
deliver economic growth, it should reflect on the need to ensure that
the measures they propose do not unwittingly compromise the visual
amenity of rural areas which underpin rural
economies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000090">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:14:38"></hs_TimeCode>
impact assessment for this legislation and Minister’s remarks at
Second Reading make it clear that the Government have no idea of the
number of overhead lines, poles and masts which could end up
pepper-potting our most treasured landscapes if these changes go
through. The cumulative visual impact of broadband infrastructure could
have a chilling effect on the rural economy. Of people who were asked
why they went to the Peak District, 85% said it was because of the
visual appearance. However, the proposed regulations would leave
broadband infrastructure siting at the discretion of the operator. It
is crucial that the consultation period on the proposed regulations
identifies the scale of infrastructure that rural areas may need to
accommodate. Every step must be taken to ensure effective dialogue with
local authorities about siting, or the cumulative effect of these
changes could undermine rural tourism and local
economies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013053000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013053000091">In

ourselves of the significant investment made by Ofgem and electricity
distributors over recent years to enhance the beauty of treasured
landscapes by burying overhead lines. They are doing this because local
people recognise the value to local tourism and the economy of
maintaining the visual amenity in their most precious landscapes. They
have already spent millions removing 223 kilometres of overhead
electricity lines and now Ofgem has given approval for £500
million of investment until 2021 to 
<?notus-xml column=1555?>underground more lines. While electricity companies are working with
local communities to protect valued landscapes from visual scarring and
ensure that rural tourism can flourish, it would be inconsistent, to

areas and undermine the tourism

and to see that this totally ignores the national parks authorities. It
seems to me quite extraordinary. Many of them are bodies related to
urban matters, but not to these qualitative matters for the nation as a
whole.</hs_para>

necessary—as the noble Baroness did—to stress how
essential the parks have been seen to be since that period immediately
after the Second World War. In that period there was, in the best
democratic tradition, a lot of controversy, but about some things there
was a lot of qualitative cross-party consensus. We were interested in
the kind of Britain we wanted; we wanted a qualitative as well as
quantitative Britain. We saw the economy and the measures put in place
for the operation of society not as an end in themselves, but as a
means of underwriting and strengthening the kind of society we wanted.
With all the pressures that operate in society, all the impersonal 
<?notus-xml column=1556?>technological development and all the stress and strain that this puts
upon people, we desperately need—if we are to be a healthy,
effective, and prosperous nation—these special areas that
provide total contrast with the hurly-burly of life outside. They are
places for reflection, for physical engagement with nature and its
surroundings, and have the ability to raise the spirits by the beauty
and culture of what is there. That is crucial to the psychological
well-being of the

was saddened but not altogether surprised the other day when I heard
that there was a rather acute discussion going on—I have to say,
this was about the area in which I live; it was about the future of
nuclear waste disposal. An official of some significance within the
area of energy said, “Of course, we have to remember that we are
concerned about the practicalities of what is important for the nation.
The arguments about national parks are emotional”. Of course,
there is a great deal of emotion about the national parks and what they
mean to the nation. It would be a sad place to be if that emotion did
not exist.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013058000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000002">I
suggest that that official, and all those involved, should take on
board that this is actually a debate about quantity versus quality and
how to get the kind of society you want. It is about ensuring that
quantitative considerations are of course taken immensely seriously and
driven forward with all possible vigour—the survival of the
nation depends on this—but that we are absolutely determined to
preserve the qualitative elements that make the nation a good place to
live and which play into the health and well-being of the workforce, if
that is how we are to look at people, and those who service the
economic
machine.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013058000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000003">This
part of the Bill raises very serious issues. It is rather sad when in
situations of this kind, acute as they are, Ministers or others can get
up and say, for example in the context of committee work, “Well,
we have published a consultation paper”, when of course the
consultation paper was published yesterday. That really does not give
very much time for people to consult with those of us who have the
privilege of being able to speak in Parliament about the
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013058000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000004">I have
taken the opportunity of having some telephone conversations in order
to discuss some of the immediate reactions to the situation. I hope the
Committee will bear with me if I refer to those briefly. The first
thing that becomes very clear in the consultation paper is that the
Government intend to press ahead with the changes set out in the Bill.
Indeed, they are resolute in wanting to do that. Well, we take that
position seriously. It is important to consider why it is so
fundamentally important to press ahead before the outcome of the
consultations has become clear. Of course, a Government who are
sensitive and open to persuasion would want to take those consultations
into account before they decided they were going to press ahead at all
costs.</hs_para>

consultation paper refers to the establishment of a code to support
best practice. It is interesting to note that to date DCMS has not
sought any input on this from the English National Park Authorities
Association. Although a number of organisations have been charged with
the preparation of the code, the ENPAA, Defra, Natural England and the
National Association for Areas of Outstanding

it is important to recognise that the code in no way addresses our main
concern over the precedent that would be set by removal of the
“have regard” duty in Clause 8. Paragraph 1.4 begins to
create a division between different protected areas; for example, SSSIs
are to continue to be protected, but national parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty are not. Perhaps we could hear a bit more

1.5 refers to providing greater planning certainty. It can be seen that
the overwhelming majority of planning applications and prior

2.2 makes the case that undergrounding new lines is more expensive. So
it seems, although I am not totally convinced about this; I am not sure
that imagination has been exercised with as much drive when considering
different methods of undergrounding as the Government are bringing to
the Bill as a whole. This is sometimes a very emotional argument which
is not altogether practically borne out with evidence—but I
shall not advance that case at this moment. However, it would be useful
to know what other options have been considered for reducing the costs
of digging before going to the option of weakening the protection of

2.16 refers to the prior notification process relating to cabinets. As
I understand it, the park authorities would be happy to work with

this, but I have no authority to say that; I just have the impression

3.5 seeks to reassure that changes will be used only for broadband and

very firm and unquestionable protection of their special and unique

Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. What does this mean? It means a

that connection, I cite one instance from my area. A year ago, E.ON
submitted a planning application to run a cable from near
Worthing—where it will emerge from the sea, connecting 100 wind
turbines that are to be built about seven miles offshore from
Seaford—to E.ON’s substation in Bolney, some miles from
Brighton. This takes away from any real strength on the part of the
South Downs National Park. It is proposed that the cable will be laid
across the downs; it will be put underground. After some discussion
with the national park, the application was called in by the
appropriate Minister, as provided in law, on the grounds of its
importance in the national interest. Surely that shows, sadly, the way
in which we are
going<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:33:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013058000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000017">I
remind noble Lords that the South Downs National Park was only a
consultee on the application and now has no planning authority on it at
all. As a consultee, the park authority pointed out that the cable did
not serve the park’s two statutory purposes: first, to conserve
and enhance natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage; and,
secondly, to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment
of the park’s special qualities. All of that has gone. Instead,
it will be up to the Minister to respond in the way that he thinks

is clear to me that an applicant seeking to run power lines across the
South Downs will now have a fair chance of doing so, notwithstanding
the level of protection that Parliament gave to the national park in

decision away from the park authority, the process will be made so easy
for him that I wonder why he needs Clause 8 in the Bill at all. This is
therefore a matter for clear, keen thinking. Surely we do not want to
remove the power, actions or knowledge from national parks and put them

Cameron of Dillington:</Member></B> My Lords, I come to this clause and
this group of amendments entirely from an economic perspective. I am
very much in favour of greater economic growth for our countryside
because, frankly, all too often our rural deprivation is ignored, and I
am as keen as anyone that entrepreneurs and businesses should be given
all the help they need to thrive throughout rural England. It goes
without saying that broadband and all the modern means of communication
are a crucial godsend to the diversification and profitability of our
rural economy. However, I have also always believed that the economy of
our protected areas, such as the national parks and AONBs, is very much
dependent on their beauty. Not only do these areas attract tourists and
other visitors who spend their money there—indeed, because of
these protected areas our national economy attracts visitors who spend
their money in this country generally while going to or from those
areas—but their beauty affects the valuable branding of all the
businesses within the designation.</hs_para>

these businesses depends on the retention of the beauty with which the
area is associated. Branding could obviously affect agricultural or
food products—South Downs lamb, for instance, and Exmoor ale. It
could even affect other products such as dales furniture and so on.
Brand names are important in marketing; if they inspire visions of
beautiful countryside and fresh air, as cool as a mountain stream or
whatever, then they are also very valuable. It seems right that for
economic reasons, as well as for social and environmental reasons, we
should truly protect our protected areas. We must never allow them to
be nibbled away at in the way that this clause seems to be
doing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013058000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000021">This
is not to say that anyone is trying to prevent modern economic
activities in our national parks—indeed, far from it: the
national parks authorities have a statutory duty to promote the economy
within their territories. In this case, that is exactly what they seem
to be doing. As the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said, 97% of the 392
applications for prior notifications on overhead wires and cabinets
have been approved. The current system allows for meaningful discussion
about where and how they should be introduced. If in 97% of cases an
agreement has been reached, I see absolutely no benefit in changing the
current situation. I am quite happy to make the current, meaningful
discussions statutory or mandatory, as proposed in some of the
amendments in this group, but it seems to me that economic progress is
already being accommodated in our national parks. At the same time, the
crucial purpose of our protected areas as valuable heritage and
economic assets is being protected, so we should leave well
alone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:38:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_30_PT_1/8979111B9F2015022A46445A67FD09EC3182EF91" __version__="1.12"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 January 2013">Wednesday,

amending the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, in
the case of English and Welsh national parks. It refers to conservation
and amenity lands in Northern Ireland, of which I know very little but
I am sure they are important, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act
1988—the broads are a national park in all but name—and
the similar protection given to areas of outstanding natural beauty in
the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and to national parks in
Scotland in the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000. It is slightly odd

given to different considerations. For example, if you are siting one
of these cabinets on the edge of a fairly run-down industrial area, you
are not going to give much weight to the local environment. You are not

be given to materials: natural stone may have to be used, or the roofs

The argument in the consultation and elsewhere is that it is 50% more

That is a practical argument; there is a fundamental philosophical
element here about the purpose of national parks. If every time a
special interest comes along or there is a special need for the
development of a particular system or project, or whatever it is, in a

Marlesford:</Member></B> My Lords, I put my name to these amendments
for very much the reasons put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis.
Clause 8 is really not necessary. I declare an interest as president of
the Suffolk Preservation Society. I have some experience in this area,
because I did 12 years on the Countryside Commission, under the
distinguished chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord
Barber<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:51:59"></hs_TimeCode> of
Tewkesbury, and was lucky enough to get to know the national parks very
well during that time. In eight of those years, I was also on the Rural
Development Commission under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord
Vinson. One saw then the importance and possibility of combining the
conservation and protection of our finest countryside with economic
development, which the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, so rightly pointed
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:52:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013058000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000035">I
have always regarded the planning system and, with it, the creation of
the national parks, as one of the two great venerable icons of the
Attlee Government—the other, of course, being the National
Health Service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:52:50"></hs_TimeCode>.
Over the years, it has worked extremely well. I have seen at close
quarters how it works. Of course, it is necessary to have new
technologies, and indeed they are to be welcomed. Indeed, the broadband
technologies, which make new forms of economic enterprise possible in
remote areas is one of the least intrusive.</hs_para>

been<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:53:20"></hs_TimeCode> a lot of
talk about undergrounding, and I have a bit of experience of that, too.
I am very keen on undergrounding. For some years, I was a non-executive
director of the Eastern Electricity Board, both before it was
privatised and for a while afterwards, when it was taken over by
Hanson. I persuaded my co-directors to start a scheme for
undergrounding wires in designated areas, which worked extremely well.
It is not wildly expensive. Of course, the 440 kilovolt
pylons are hugely expensive to underground, but the network of
wirescaping, which can so badly damage a landscape, is remarkably
inexpensive to underground. We did it in some 30 designated
conservation areas on the heritage coast. The first one was in my own
village, and I was attacked by Paul Foot in <I>Private Eye</I>, on the
grounds that I lived in the village, because I had banged on about it
for about five years before they did it. But it is a perfectly good
scheme to do things such as
undergrounding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T16:54:34"></hs_TimeCode>.
All this can be done very well under the existing arrangements.
Broadband can and will come, and it is crucial that it should do so.

justifies the necessity for introducing Clause 8 to give

things. Everyone is in favour of helping the rural economy and

debate by making that absolutely clear. It is important to get
broadband into the rural economy. We know that the problems in the
economies of national parks are not easy. They depend on diversity, and
tourism is enormously important. People must be able to ring up, book
their bed and 
<?notus-xml column=1565?>breakfast or hotel, communicate and run businesses of all varieties. I

to somehow undermine the protection and beauty of the national parks.

high-quality broadband rapidly within a short timeframe, which is what
the whole House wishes to achieve, and that it does not require an
upheaval of the planning process. This clause is not the end of
civilisation as we know it or the end of the national parks as we know
them. That is a judgment that one or two noble Lords have thought to
make. The theme that came through in many speeches, including that of
the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, is that there is not necessarily a
fear of what the clause does but of whether it is a precedent for other
things that might then happen and be the thin end of a wedge that could

remote areas, including protected areas, are some of the places where
an infrastructure upgrade for broadband is needed the most. Without
action, it is likely that these rural and quite remote areas will be
left even further behind. I think that noble Lords have acknowledged
that people who live in these areas want broadband and that there is a
strong rationale for it. There are 700,000 households and businesses in
national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, and most of
these will not be served by the market alone. In England, 25% of
premises in 
<?notus-xml column=1567?>these areas currently get less than 2 megabytes per

rollout of broadband, businesses in these areas would suffer, including
those in the tourism service sector, which increasingly find that
visitors demand greater connectivity when they come and stay at guest
houses, bed and breakfast establishments and hotels, and these
businesses are frustrated by the lack of broadband to offer their
customers. National parks authorities, along with many other rural
areas in England, have cited insufficient broadband provision as a
particular barrier to growth.</hs_para>

are trying to tackle this disparity in the provision of superfast

close the rural-urban broadband divide and promote economic growth. The

I can take a few moments to set out what the consultation covers. The
consultation’s first proposal is that we will remove of the
requirement to underground telecommunications apparatus. This is the
only restriction that stops communication providers deploying overhead
infrastructure. It does not say that they cannot provide underground
structures. They can. If they want to share a gully or a trench with
some other provider, they can do it in a way that is satisfactory to
them. There is nothing to stop that. All this does is to say that it is
not a requirement. If you cannot do it for some

Greaves:</Member></B> This is a crucial point. It is clear that they
can still put them underground if they wish to, although there will be
the removal of the statutory power of the local planning authority,
which is usually the national park authority, to require it, and there
will be less time for consultation. If I have understood it correctly,
the consultation period will be 28 days and not 58 days in future. It
would be helpful to have that confirmed. Do the Government have an
estimate of the proportion of the lines in, for example, national parks
in England and Wales which, in future, would be put underground

second proposal removes the prior approval requirements for broadband
cabinets in protected areas. Of course, the cabinets have to be there,
otherwise you cannot have broadband. They have to be at certain spaces

Clause 8 to enable us to make these amendments to the communications

referring to the consultation paper, in the National Parks, there are
more than 22,000 businesses, of which more than 70% are small and

changes are about creating certainty and reducing the time and cost of
deployments. Evidence to date from commercial deployment shows that
deployment can be held up by planning decisions. In conservation areas
where planning permission is currently required for broadband, there is
evidence that it has been held up for 27 months by the need for
consultation. This has resulted in the new broadband service not being

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am beginning to feel like a jack-in-
the-box. I hope that I do not look like one, but I am beginning to feel
like one. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, asked a philosophical if not a
practical question. We are where we are. My job is the legislation
before us. It is not to proffer a view on that. This is how the
Government feel it is necessary to proceed in order to do precisely
what the noble Lord said, which is to get broadband across the country
as quickly as possible and in the best way possible. As I tried to say
as I was going along, the only way that you can get broadband is
through masts, lines and boxes, and somehow that has to be dealt with
in the best way
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:21:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:21:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013058000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000084">Turning
to Amendments 59A and 59C, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, I do
not think that there is a need to place conditions on the Clause 8
enabling power in the way that the noble Lord proposes, and I have
referred to the existing consultation requirements in the regulations.
That consultation must be considered before further action is taken.
The relevant secondary legislation—the Electronic Communications
Code (Conditions &amp; Restrictions) Regulations 2003—already
includes both general and specific statutory requirements for
consultation with planning authorities. This will continue to be the
case.</hs_para>

providers will be required to notify local planning authorities about
the equipment that they propose to install and where they propose to
install it. The regulations will make it clear, as they do currently,
that planning authorities will have an opportunity to influence the
siting and appearance of that equipment and can put forward objections,
as is currently the case. Communications providers will be required to
make changes, if they are reasonable.</hs_para>

providers are under a strong incentive to ensure that they follow the
statutory requirements for consultation with local planning

Lady Whitaker, called for the regulations to be subject to the
affirmative procedure rather than the negative procedure as is
currently the case. The requirements for consultation with local
planning authorities that we propose to introduce for protected areas
are not new. They are already well established and work well for
non-designated areas. I am confident that they can work well in
protected areas with the co-operation of communications providers and
local planning authorities alike. At present, I do not see the need for
the affirmative procedure. This is not new. It is not novel: it is how
things have happened in the past.</hs_para>

Adonis, also proposed Amendment 59B. As I said at Second Reading, we
are unable to draft legislation in such a way that is specific to
broadband infrastructure. I explained then that this is because of
Article 8(1) of the Framework Directive 2002/21/EC, which requires
technology neutrality so far as the primary implementing legislation is
concerned.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013058000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000089">We
can, though, be specific in secondary legislation. As I made clear at
Second Reading and make clear again today, and as our consultation also
makes clear, our proposed changes relate to broadband cabinets and
overhead lines—in other words fixed broadband technology. As I
said, that cannot be done in primary legislation. It will be done in
secondary
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013058000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000090">The
amendment also suggests that specifying consultation with local
authorities on changes to secondary legislation is necessary.
Consultation with local authority interests already happens under the
existing provisions of the Communications Act 2003. Section 109(4)
provides that before making regulations, the Secretary of State must
consult Ofcom and any other persons as she considers appropriate. As I
mentioned earlier, a large proportion of the existing regulations
consists of the requirements for consultation with and notification to
highway and planning authorities; this will not change, and of course
we are now consulting on our proposed approach. The Local Government
Association and others such as the national park authorities will want
to make their views clear on the proposed planning
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013058000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000091">My
noble friend Lord Greaves has proposed Amendments 59D to 59H. These
would remove what we believe are necessary subsections to ensure that
other legislation relating to protected areas is amended so as to be
consistent with the Secretary of State’s powers in Section 109
of the Communications Act. If we remove them, Clause 8 would not
deliver the result the Government are seeking to achieve. It would also
risk creating great uncertainty and inconsistency in the law. My noble
friend Lady Parminter raised this with us at a meeting we held
yesterday. We explained to her then that this was the way we had to
deal with the matter legally, and although it may seem rather
cumbersome, it is essential. I have heard nothing to change my mind
since our discussion, but I did undertake that we would consider the
reasons why. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:26:27"></hs_TimeCode>
also understand the intention of my noble friend Lord Greaves and I
want to reassure him that the amended legislation will continue to make
it explicit that the Secretary of State shall have regard to the need
to conserve the natural beauty of the countryside when making
regulations in relation to the Electronic Communications
Code.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013058000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013058000092">As with
the relaxation of prior approval in protected areas for cabinets and
poles, these subsections also only apply for a period of
five years, which I hope gives some comfort to noble Lords. The
provision of broadband to business and communities across the country
is vital to ensure that we have growth. We want to see the economy grow
right across the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:27:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

length regarding the existing and proposed consultation requirements
that will be necessary through the secondary legislation that Clause 8
will enable. Perhaps I may go over those requirements again.
Communications providers will still be required 
<?notus-xml column=1572?>to consult with local authorities on the siting of
infrastructure and to take on board any reasonable objections, which is
the current situation. The proposed code of best practice for the
siting of infrastructure will contain an agreed set of overall
principles for siting, as well as specific arrangements for
consultation with communities on new overhead wires. Local authorities
will be able to influence how services are deployed in their area in
consultation with their supplier when procuring under the Broadband
Delivery UK programme. There is a great deal of scope for local
authorities to influence what is going on, and it seems to me that
broadband providers are going to find it much easier to get their work
done if they co-operate and co-ordinate their activities with local
authorities to ensure that between them there is a sensitive
recognition of the
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:28:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

asked about advertising on boxes, an issue that has been the cause of a
lot of concern. Advertisements are not permitted unless
specifically approved by the local authority. Permission has to be
sought to do that. My noble friend Lady Parminter asked about the
siting of equipment. A number of statutory requirements are set out in
the Electronic Communications Code (Conditions and Restrictions)
Regulations 2003 which are aimed at ensuring that the amount of
electronic communications apparatus and its impact on visual amenity is
kept to a minimum, and these provisions will remain unchanged. The

Baroness for giving us so much detail as to how the reformed regime
will work. However, I cannot help but observe that she spoke for 27
minutes but did not give us a single shred of evidence as to why the
existing planning regime is halting or delaying the rollout of
superfast broadband to the national parks or to areas of outstanding
natural beauty. I will ask a direct question: does she have any
evidence that she would like to share with the House as to how the
current planning regime is delaying the rollout of superfast broadband
in the national parks or in areas of outstanding natural
beauty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:31:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, first, we need some speed to get this
done. As the noble Lord will know, so far there has been very little
deployment of broadband in areas of natural beauty and it is estimated
that 85% of premises will not be reached by the market unless we can
speed things up. This is at least a contribution to speeding up the
provision of broadband in the rural areas where, at the moment, it is
not very

Adonis:</Member></B> My Lords, that does not meet the point at all. The
evidence which the national parks have given to noble Lords shows that
97% of several hundred applications—I think 292 have been made
under the pre-notification procedure—have been agreed by the
national parks authorities. I am sorry to keep putting this to the
noble Baroness but it is a fairly fundamental issue. There has been a
large number of applications, and we obviously want a great deal more
so that we have a great deal more rollout of superfast broadband in the
national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. However, almost
all those that have been brought forward have been agreed. Does the
noble Baroness have any evidence at all that there are cases which the
House should take into consideration where the planning authorities
themselves have been slowing down a rollout of broadband that would
otherwise have taken

present for my opening speech, but I pointed out that national parks
authorities are not aware that any of those cases raised by BT apply to
national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty. The Government
say airily that they have received reports but will not actually
publish anything. The noble Lord, like me, has been a Secretary of
State in the past. It is one thing to declare airily that you have
received reports but it is another thing actually to give chapter and
verse. No chapter and verse whatever has been given in this debate that
there is a real issue that would justify a very major change in the law
of the kind that the Government are

point in what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has just read out? The noble
Lord, Lord Adonis, has quite correctly said that there has now got to
be a large expansion of broadband into the rural areas. What the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin, has cited is the experience so far of trying to
introduce broadband more widely. Maybe my noble friend is thinking that
it is a precautionary principle—that the Government are giving
top priority 
<?notus-xml column=1574?>to the expansion of broadband. I think that the point that I tried to

Earl of Lytton:</Member></B> I apologise to the Committee for
intervening now; I thought that I would intervene earlier but felt that
it had been discussed. I want to try to disassemble something here. The
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, of which I am a member,
recently looked into this question of the operation of the
telecommunications code. One of the things that became apparent was
that the code has been an exceedingly clunky means of dealing with
difficulties and disputes because it has to be dealt with through the
county court. One of the things that the institution was particularly
keen to air—and perhaps I should have done so earlier—was
that this process really needs to be dealt with. I would have invited
the Minister then, and maybe I still can, to say whether it is correct
that the Law Commission is looking into this whole business to try to
find a better and more streamlined way of dealing with that particular
process. I do not know whether British Telecom, or whoever it may
happen to be, is concerned about the whole process, or specifically
concerned about planning, or whether within that it is concerned about
national parks, or whether it is actually the telecommunication code
that is a common denominator for all planning authorities. If the
Minister cannot respond to that now, perhaps it could be explored at
some
juncture<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:36:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013067000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013067000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hanham" PimsId="3741" UID="13013067000069" xid="1742" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013067000069">Baroness

constructive. Given the scale of the concern that has been expressed in
the House and the noble Baroness’s good intentions—as

Boles, would agree to meet the chief executives of the national parks

go into the specific issue of how superfast broadband can be rolled out

issue that was not fully responded to in her reply—an issue
which was raised by a number of Peers, including the noble Lords, Lord
Adonis and Lord Cameron, and myself, namely the issue of statutory
guidance. The Minister said that the Government expect the operators to
abide by the code. For those of us who are concerned about this issue,
we feel that it should be a statutory code. Bearing in mind the fact
that the final siting will be at the discretion of the operators and
that the operators have the ability to deploy new infrastructure if
they believe that there is still merit in doing so, can the Minister
confirm whether the Government intend for the code of practice to be
statutory or
voluntary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T17:38:41"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013067000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013067000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hanham" PimsId="3741" UID="13013067000074" xid="1742" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013067000074">Baroness

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I could ask again: if
everything goes well with a particular proposal and notification, is
the difference in timing between the present system and what is
proposed just 28 days as it seems to be? In other words, does the
56-day prior approval system disappear but the 28-day period still
exist for the local planning authority to comment? Can the Minister
say, either now or perhaps in writing, what will happen and what is
available to people, particularly the local planning authority, under
the proposed new system if there is a difference of view that cannot be
resolved. If a proposal is put forward and the planning authority has
comments—not necessarily on whether the proposal should be there
at all but on the two key issues of siting and appearance—and if
that dispute between the local planning authority and the broadband
provider cannot be resolved, does the provider simply go ahead and do
it or is there some other procedure? I am a bit mystified about where
the county court comes in but perhaps everybody else understands
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013067000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013067000011">We have
been told that the number of such cases that have been refused is very
few indeed—it is a handful. But the fact that there was a
handful means that there will be some cases where the local planning
authority believes that what is being proposed is unacceptable. So
under those circumstances will it be possible now for the proposal to
go
through?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013067000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0001.htm#13013067000012">Finally,
with regard to the issue I was talking about before, Section 11A of the
National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act is a general section
that refers to everything. We are told that subsection (2) has to be
put aside for this specific purpose because when the decisions are
being made or the Secretary of State is issuing guidance and
regulations under the Electronic Communications Act, if the national
parks Act provision remains, there will not be a level playing field
and the different considerations that the Secretary of State has to
take into account will not be given equal weighting. Since Section 11A
of the national parks Act is a general provision on everything that
happens in national parks that authorities have to take account of,
surely that is the case with all sorts of other things as well, 
<?notus-xml column=1576?>yet all this other legislation that it must apply to—all these
other powers of the Secretary of State and other
authorities—does not appear to be invalidated by this section of
the national parks Act. This is a fairly esoteric legal point but it

the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, this was a discussion that we had last

the strong legal advice is that it has to be done in the way that has
been proposed at the moment. I said that I was happy to go back and

all local authorities, not just to certain cities—a point

decentralisation of power from Whitehall to local communities, with
councils coming together to make best use of these powers. This new
deal must include devolution of powers in areas such as transport,
housing, skills and ways of boosting economic development. Rather than
the Government poring over a list of approved councils or a map of new
boundaries in deciding who to entrust with greater powers, and where,
local government should decide how it wants to organise itself for the
purpose of taking these powers. It could be a city with a mayor, a city
with a leader, a city region, a county or another combination that
makes sense locally—including, of course, working with
businesses, particularly

out the case for a major reconfiguration of responsibilities for
economic development between central and local government, and indeed

have concluded that the door is ajar and that this amendment may well
represent a means of providing it with a gentle push, for all the
reasons that my noble friend Lord Jenkin outlined. There is a very

Councils will need to show governance structures demonstrating their
stability, their ability to manage risk and their ability to pool
thinking and resources with their local enterprise partnerships and
neighbouring councils so that driving growth in an area is seen as a
collaborative process rather than a competitive one. I am particularly

negotiations with the Government over the city deal. It was a very
interesting process. Obviously, we developed ideas on our own and in
conjunction. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is absolutely right that it
needs to involve not just local authorities but the local business
community. It takes a very special skill for many businesspeople to
rise above their day-to-day work to have that comprehension of local
economic policy, but in Greater Manchester we are fortunate to have
many people who can do that. We rely on them and other partners such as
universities, which are very important, too. On the key partners, we
need to remind the Government that this is not a financial issue for
local authorities. We are actually asking for devolution—not
necessarily for more money but to have the money spent at a local
level, where many of us believe it will be spent more effectively. In
some cases, no money is involved at all; it simply gives us permission
to do what we currently have to do.</hs_para>

They can harness the strengths of local partners and build on local
knowledge, and they can be addressed to the local circumstances. I am
sure that the city deal for Greater Manchester is different from the
city deal for Newcastle, because the issues are clearly different. We
will have some similar issues. No doubt skills are a very important
part but, for us, transport was a key issue. As the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=1583?>Lord Jenkin, rightly said, this amendment mirrors
the report of the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine. It is really beginning to
address this point about freedom. At a meeting of the Greater
Manchester Combined Authority on Friday, we were pleased that we were

expand, so the measure is working practically on the ground. It is not

Lord Shipley, I am a bit concerned about the wording of the amendment
because I would not like every local authority to have to have its own
deal with the Government. That is not what the spirit of this measure
is about. What we did very carefully in Greater Manchester was to think
about the functional economics. What is an economic area that makes
sense? As important and lovely as the great city of Manchester is, its
geography is a very odd shape. It is very long and thin. It is not a
functioning economic area. The centre of Manchester and the centre of
Salford are very close together, so we need to go over local authority
boundaries. I hope that in passing some version of this amendment, we
can encourage local authorities to be co-operative, as the noble Lord,
Lord Shipley, said, to work together to think about what is in the
interests of their communities and to make sure that we start to
deliver what all noble Lords want, which is more growth, more

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to follow the noble Lord,
Lord Smith of Leigh, because outside Greater London, Greater Manchester
is probably the best example of a classic city region in this country.
City regions suddenly became all the rage a few years ago under the
Labour Government, and they are perhaps making a bit of a comeback
now.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013075000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013075000013">The
problem is that when people get new ideas, they tend to regard them as
a template that applies everywhere. There is no doubt that city regions
can be very powerful places in democracy and growth, but the geography
of this country is not the same everywhere. Even within England, there
are places which it is difficult sensibly to allocate to a city region.
The temptation is for people to look at the model and try to impose it
everywhere, instead of asking about the geography of this country,
which is very different in different places, and about the appropriate
model given the geography of a region or sub-region.</hs_para>

the towns of west Cumbria—Barrow, Whitehaven and
Workington—and their local authorities, Allerdale, Copeland and
Barrow. It is very difficult to say which city region they can be part
of. Newcastle upon Tyne might have imperialist designs on them and
pretend they are part of it, but they are clearly not, and they are
equally clearly not part of the Greater Manchester city region,
Merseyside or whatever. They are different. The largest places in those
areas, including Carlisle, are smaller than the largest places in west
Yorkshire or Greater Manchester, obviously, so the system that is used
ought to take account of the geography of those areas. That is not to
say that they should not have the kind of powers which are set out in
this amendment, the powers that existing city deals have, which will, I
hope, go on to get more; it is to say 
<?notus-xml column=1584?>that central government has to get out of the
mindset of trying to fit everybody into the same size bottle and accept
powers have to be devolved to some smaller places because that is the
nature of the economic geography and the economic regions in those
areas.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013075000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013075000015">It
will not surprise noble Lords to learn that I think that east
Lancashire is another area, not quite as extreme an example as west
Cumbria, that is very difficult to fit sensibly into any particular
city region. If we were forced into a big city region, it would be
Greater Manchester, but we would always be peripheral and far too far
out. Despite the wishes of some people in Preston, it is very difficult
to claim that Lancashire is in any way geographically a city region
with Blackpool out on the coast, Blackburn and Burnley, former county
boroughs, further inland, Lancaster further to the north and then all
the other places.</hs_para>

successful, it has to be accepted that it is not just the major
metropolitan centres, such as Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle, and
smaller but equally important ones such as Norwich, that are going to
be the engines of growth in this country. They are probably the main
engines of growth because of geographical factors, but the rest of the
country needs a fair deal as well, and we do not want to be looking
forward to a country where some areas are growing: the south-east and
Greater London, obviously, but also those cities that have been
remarkably successful in recent years, of which Leeds and Manchester
are perhaps the leading examples. Those of us who live out in the
sticks need a decent standard of life, a decent level of growth and a
decent level of local services, just the same as everywhere
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013075000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013075000017">My final
point is that it is more difficult institutionally where there is
two-tier local government. In some areas, the districts are not
important. District councils vary hugely across the country. There are
some areas where shire districts are not really important within the
economic development sphere, never have been and are never going to be.
Some of them are quite weak rural authorities in that sense. There are
other areas where they are the motors of economic development and the
places were inspiration, motivation, ideas and people from the public
sector and the private sector come from. I suggest that west Cumbria
and east Lancashire are classic examples of this there the county
councils traditionally have not had a very strong economic development
role.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13013075000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013075000096">6.15

trying to impose one system and saying that the county has that
function, there must be some working together at county and district

the districts are going to provide the growth. I do not mean just the
district council; I mean the level at which it is going to happen and
where the local economic areas are: Burnley and Pendle, Blackburn and
Hyndburn and so on. In the system that the Government come up with to
devolve powers and perhaps some money, that is where the money is going
to be found locally. They have to take account of the geographical and
economic realities on the ground and not just assume that what has

looking across government departments and local authority functions
embodied in a small way in those arrangements was returned to under the
previous Government with the concept of Total Place. As I think I have
said before in debates in your Lordships’ House, that has, I
believe, been rebranded as community budgets, but it is consistently
compatible with the thrust of the Government’s policy on
city deals and the thrust of the amendments, which, of
course, I support. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, was quite right to
refer to the powers and resources that are required to invigorate local
economies. That involves, by definition, a wide range of public
organisations, including government departments. One thinks of BIS, the
Department for Transport, the Department for Work and
Pensions, the Department for Education, the DCLG, Defra and
the Department of Energy and Climate Change. All potentially have a
role to play with not only their policies but sometimes with
their resources in individual areas. I hope that the Government can
look at reinforcing the concept of the city deal by
connecting it to the concept of community budgeting or Total Place, so
that one looks at the sum of government-directed public
expenditure in an area and sees how it can fit into and be applied to
the issues of economic growth and
regeneration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T18:20:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

deals that have been announced are welcome. Newcastle has benefited; I
think that the figure is roughly £80 million. Liverpool got a
little more at £110 million. That is not necessarily cash coming
from the Government. It is the value of some of the freedoms that have
been given, including, for example, tax-increment financing.
Tax-increment financing is the permission effectively to borrow against
the anticipated business rate income, which will generated by
development. It has been deployed effectively for some years in the
United States. There is reason to hope that it will help us
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T18:20:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

not, then, a question of the Government passing resources to the local
authority, but of borrowing. Useful and impressive though those schemes
and those amounts of money to invest will be, however derived, they
have to be contrasted with the loss of financial resources to the very
same authorities as a result of the local government finance
settlement, exceeding on an annual basis in the cases of both Liverpool
and Newcastle—and perhaps the others, I cannot say for
certain—the value of the city deal and its financial
implications. That is ultimately money taken out of the local economy,
which is likely to have a deleterious effect on that local economy,
employment and business. It is a curious inconsistency, which the
Government have to address. They have to align their local government
finance policies with the ambitions, which we share in local
government, across the parties, of the city deal
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T18:21:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

agree with the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, and my noble friend Lord Smith
on the need for local authorities to co-operate and not to
be seen to be competing with one
another, at least in the same sort of area. There will no
doubt be competition —healthy, I hope—between different
parts of the country, offering
different attractions for investment from within this country or
overseas; that is a healthy process. However, it would be a
great mistake if, within regions—or, to use the current
governmental phrase, sub-national areas—there were to be
cut-throat competition between more-or-less neighbouring
authorities.</hs_para>

was striking in those dark days of the 1980s—which the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin, did his best to brighten in Newcastle—that
the region of the north-east came together in two ways. First, it came
together—I have to say, at my suggestion—to create a
Northern Regional Councils Association, which included Cumbria in those
days, as it rather looked to the east than to the south. It also came
together to facilitate the hugely important Nissan development in
Sunderland. There was no competition between authorities as to who
should get that. We came together and worked with business in the
region and the Government of the day on behalf of the region as a
whole. It is effectively a functional economic area, to use the jargon.
That spirit of co-operation certainly needs to be driven, and I hope
that the Government will incentivise it as these proposals go forward.

unlocking local growth and trialling different and innovative
approaches. Perhaps it would not be appropriate for every single trial
to be rolled out wholesale to every single council across the country.
That said, the Government have a strong record of commitment to the
localist agenda and are working directly with local authorities to
provide the powers and support that 
<?notus-xml column=1588?>they need. Where local models and city models make

done with local authorities, we have given them greater control over
their own budgets. First, an estimated 70% of income will be raised
locally, compared to 50% to 60% under the current formula grant system.
Secondly, from next April, councils will retain nearly £11
billion of business rates. Thirdly, the Government intend to devolve a
greater proportion of future growth-related spending, based on the
recommendations to which many noble Lords have alluded, as detailed in
my noble friend Lord Heseltine’s recent, excellent review. My
noble friend Lord Jenkin quoted my noble friend Lord Heseltine. We
agree with him that local leaders and businesses are best placed to set
the strategic direction of the area. He made a powerful case for
increased devolution, and the Government agree with that.</hs_para>

have. They can act as a stronger voice for local people, incorporating
the local private sector. As several noble Lords have acknowledged, we

the Secretary of State for Industry who in the end persuaded Nissan to

60A would allow local authorities to set their own permitted
development rights. It is a logical extension of the Localism Act,
because what is and is not permitted development should be decided
locally. The current system allows central government to set out
permitted development rights and provide local authorities with limited
mechanisms to amend this. We noted the debate in your Lordships’
House on Monday about free schools and the powers of government over
permitted development rights, and the limited powers that local
authorities can sometimes have. We shall debate that issue further, but
allowing permitted development to be managed by a local authority at a
local level would mean that individual local issues and differences

60B would remove the need for the Secretary of State to give approval

or extend permitted development rights via the use of an article for

<?notus-xml column=1591?>support local economic growth. But the procedures that have to be

This amendment would offer local discretion on permitted development
reforms. As I am sure my noble friend the Minister knows, there is
great concern about this. The amendment would offer councils the local
choice whether or not to introduce the permitted development changes
which the Government are seeking to introduce. It is not clear to me,
and has not been throughout the process, why the Government want to do
this. It is supposedly to have a positive impact on growth. It is not
clear to me how the Government’s proposals would have a positive
impact on growth. I have concluded that permitted development rules
should not be changed by Whitehall, since such a move cannot take
account of significant local differences. As I said a moment ago, city
centres, suburbs, town centres, urban areas and rural areas may all
have different requirements, and councils are best placed locally to
make these judgments. This is a very important issue, and there is a
very important principle at stake. If we believe in localism, surely we

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support these amendments. It
seems contrary to the whole thrust of the Localism Act that central
government should impose its decision on what are absolutely
fundamentally local matters, and do so in such a way as effectively to 
<?notus-xml column=1592?>preclude the local council from taking decisions of
this kind in consultation with its residents. For example, it would be
interesting to know how many extensions are being built under the
dispensation given by the Government. I should think that on the whole

lead to any significant development of extended housing in urban

effectively on behalf of every local authority in the country, and see
that it applies willy-nilly? What is the rationale for that? Where is
the evidence that it will lead to the satisfactory development

thrust of the amendment is to reverse the current arrangements whereby
permitted development is determined at the centre but with local

the local level with full obligations to prepare a draft order for
consultation. The Minister will doubtless argue, as was argued in the
Commons, that the powers available under Article 4 or a local
development order are sufficient to secure that the decision of the
centre can be modified in the local context. However, the LGA
briefing—the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, endorsed
this—makes clear that these approaches are heavily bureaucratic,
time-consuming and resource-intensive. If the Minister does not accept
that case, I would be grateful if she would provide the evidence to the

certainly set ringing by the November 2012 technical consultation on

Lord Tope and Lord Shipley, and Amendment 71A in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, have the admirable aim of giving local authorities
the power to decide how to adapt nationally set permitted
development rights to their own local circumstances. I am pleased to
say that that power is already there. Where local authorities have
concerns about the impact of permitted development rights locally, they
are able to consult their local communities on removing those rights
via Article 4 directions. I know that my noble friend Lord Shipley said
that that process is complicated, but it is really up to local
authorities how complicated it is and how long it takes. It is in a
local authority’s hands; it has to consult for 28 days, but
after that it can decide whether to confirm an Article 4 direction.
Because there are concerns regarding potential compensation issues,
local authorities can, if they give 12 months’ notice that they
are going to consult on an Article 4 direction, always manage to avoid
compensation requirements.</hs_para>

extend permitted development rights locally, local development orders
provide a quick and simple way to do this. After a slow start, the

of this flexible provision, which can be put in place through a simple
and streamlined procedure. More than 30 local development orders have
now been put in place in enterprise zones, and local development orders
are contributing to growth by helping speed up everything from small
domestic alterations to major industrial development. Rather than being
a cumbersome process, as suggested, local development orders work quite
well.</hs_para>

for local authorities to report on local development orders, with the
aim of reducing burdens further. The Secretary of State only
exceptionally exercises his powers to intervene in local development
orders. In many cases, local authorities can proceed to adoption within
a few days of submitting local development orders to the Secretary of

Lords’ wish to make sure that local authorities are able to take
their particular circumstances into account when considering the
operation of national permitted development rights. This is indeed a
vital safeguard, because nationally determined rights will of course
have different effects in different local areas. As I have already
outlined, local authorities have this power now through the use of
Article 4 directions, which they can implement themselves. However, I
remind noble Lords that every time permitted development rights are

years—usually continuously, but, basically, for 20 years; and
secondly, if they have used it for lawful sports and pastimes—in
other words, informal recreation—as of right as opposed to by
right. That sounds legalistic and obscure but “as of
right” means that they have not been stopped from using it; they
have not used force; they have not used it secretly, having sneaked on
there at two o’clock in the morning and kicked a ball about and
left before anyone saw them; and they have not had permission. All
those matters are crucial. If the owner of the land gives people
permission by putting a sign up saying, “Ball games
allowed”, that negates the ability to register it as a

is simply recognising the legal fact that, under the old common law and
under the Commons Act, where it has been codified, it is a green. It is
a matter of fact. It is quite different from planning permission, which
is a matter of saying, “Given the circumstances of that land and
given all the planning laws and regulations, is it a good idea for that
planning permission to be given?”. For example, it is very
different from a designation as a piece of new green space under the
new designation in the NPPF, where it is a matter of opinion as to
whether that is a good idea or not. Either it is a
green or it is not a green. That is why the process of registration

lawful pastimes can take place on it—by making a statement to a

stopped within the past two years, but it was used before that, you can
still register it as a green. The advice from the Government, which is
clearly set out in the Explanatory Notes, is that this provision in
Section 15(3) of the Commons Act means that even if an owner of the
land makes a statement under the new clause in this Bill to the
registration authority that it is no longer being used, you still have
two years in which you can register it as a green. The owner makes a

to this amendment—which is pretty complicated, for which I
apologise, but I think the point needs explaining—is: how are
people to know that such a statement has been made by the owner so that
they have an opportunity to exercise their rights under Section 15(3)
of the Commons Act? At the moment the Bill contains no proposals that
anything should happen other than that the authority should state in
the register of greens that the statement has been made. That is all it
has to do. The purpose of these amendments is to set down proposals
that there has to be a minimum of local publicity such as a sign on the
green or information on the website or an advertisement in the local
newspaper or all three, and anything else which local people feel is
appropriate. That is not excessive to the landowner or to a commons
registration authority.</hs_para>

someone’s rights are being taken away, it is common sense that
they should be told about it. The owner of the land does not have to
put up a fence or a gate with a lock and a sign saying, “Keep
out”. He can simply allow people to continue using it for the
next two years in blissful ignorance that their rights will cease after
the end of two years, or their ability to use that land for that
purpose will cease after two years and they will be locked out without
any redress whatever. This is a simple, reasonable amendment to say
that when a landowner makes a statement that the use of the green for
informal recreation has ceased, there should be sufficient publicity to
allow people time, if they wish, to make an application for a green
registration, which can then be tested in the normal way. I beg to

village green provisions to thwart development which is unwanted by
some. However, we equally reject legislation that would, in large
measure, make it difficult to establish such a provision in the future.

right in lawful sport and pastimes on the land. The knowledge of
cessation of use is important because it is the trigger to the two-year
window in which a person can seek to register the land as a green.

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, in responding to the noble Lords, Lord
Greaves and Lord McKenzie, it may be helpful if I briefly set out why
we are reforming the system for registering town and village greens.
This explanation will take us through to the next group of amendments.
In short, the reforms are needed to prevent the greens registration
scheme being used to stop or delay planned development decided through
the democratically accountable planning system. The changes will also
protect the ability of local communities to promote or support
development in their areas through consultation and decision-taking on
planning applications and local and neighbourhood plans. Another aim is
to reduce the financial burden on local authorities in considering

13 inserts new Section 15A into the Commons Act 2006 which allows a
landowner in England to deposit a statement and map with the commons
registration authority, the effect of which is to bring to an end any
period of use “as of right” for lawful sports and
pastimes on that land. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, very expertly went
through what lies behind this clause. I will briefly say that under the
current system, if landowners want to protect their land from town or
village green registration, they may erect fences and/or notices to
physically prevent access to the land. However, the courts have ruled
that even taking such steps does not necessarily bring to an end any
use “as of right”, in particular where fences
or notices are not maintained in the event of damage or
removal. Clause 13 will allow landowners to achieve the aim of ending
use “as of right” through the submission of a statement.
We hope that this reform will encourage landowners to allow
recreational use of their land, safe in the knowledge that they can
prevent the registration of their land as a green. That will then be of
benefit to those who use the land, as well as to landowners.</hs_para>

sufficiently local so that somebody will pick it up and pass it on.

tropical diseases a year ago today. Substantial progress has been made

are diseases caused by viruses and bacteria transmitted through snails

blindness to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It has been

do not intend tonight to do the Minister’s work for her by

the partnership approach of the London declaration: the bringing
together of the pharmaceutical companies that have contributed, free of
charge, more than 1 billion treatments; the endemic
countries, 40 of which have developed multiyear integrated NTD plans;
the donors who have committed funds to support delivery of those
programmes and increase the resources available for mapping and
research; and the academic institutions that are undertaking that
research such as the London Centre for NTDs launched today—an
important UK initiative—which will concentrate on identifying

are age-old afflictions. Twenty years ago, I chaired the Whittington
Hospital in Archway in London. The first health facility on that site
was a leper hospital in the 12th century. It was opened and positioned
there because it was just beyond the boundaries of the city of London,
from which people with leprosy were barred. Much more recently on Ellis
Island, emigrants from Europe to the USA were examined by immigration
officers for trachoma and sent home if they were found to be infected.

as a global health priority, NTDs have a much shorter history. It is
less than a decade since Peter Hotez of Sabin, David Molyneux of the
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and Alan Fenwick of Imperial
College first used the term in biomedical journals and they have been
tireless advocates for this cause, alongside Dr Lorenzo Savioli at the
World Health Organisation. Despite their widespread prevalence, these
diseases have been neglected in multiple ways and for multiple reasons.
They have attracted tiny proportions of budgets for treatment from
donor Governments or for research from private or academic
institutions. Médecins sans Frontières presented evidence
last month that only 1.4% of clinical studies undertaken in the past
year focused on neglected diseases, although they cause around 11% of
the global disease
burden<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013080000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013080000053">This
is partly because of the demographic that they afflict and its lack of
purchasing and political power, but also because in public health terms
these diseases have been seen as causing morbidity rather than
mortality. So the focus in the millennium development goals and
elsewhere has been on the big three killers in the  
<?notus-xml column=1606?>developing world—AIDS, TB and malaria. However, there is growing
evidence of the important and significant interaction between NTDs and
these three
diseases<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013080000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013080000054">As
well as the obvious overlap in geography and the demographics of
co-infection, the data suggest a strong association of exaggerated
symptoms, rapid progression of disease and a higher risk of fatality in
all three diseases where there is the presence of NTDs. To take just
one example, studies in Tanzania and Zimbabwe demonstrate that women
with female genital schistosomiasis have a 3% to 4% higher chance of
being infected with HIV than those who are free of the disease. If we
are to achieve the millennium development goal on AIDS, TB and malaria,
we also need to tackle neglected diseases. I hope that the Minister may
also say something about encouraging global fund programmes to
integrate NTD control, as they have, for the first time, in
Togo.</hs_para>

achieving other millennium development goals is also impeded by the

we are to achieve the ambitious targets set out in the London
declaration, we will have to meet many varied challenges, not the least
of which is providing the basic building blocks of public health, clean
water, sanitation, hygiene and education. These are essential to
underpinning NTD initiatives. We need to develop greater capacity to
deliver and distribute the drugs that are available, and we need to
know more about the best treatment regimes and about synergies with
other health programmes, such as the distribution of bed nets and
vaccination campaigns. I think that the London centre will be hugely
helpful in this respect. We need to mobilise research and development
on vector control, which is often a neglected area itself. Evidence
from the WHO <I>Global Burden of Disease 2010 </I>study shows that
diseases such as leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis and hookworm are
unlikely to be eliminated solely through mass drug administration
programmes. We urgently need research into the development of new
control tools, including drugs, diagnostics and vaccines. We need a
good pipeline of innovative products if we are not to be talking, in
20 or 30 years’ time, of re-emerging

the poorest of people in the hardest to reach areas. Because most of
these diseases do not exist in more developed nations, it is easy to

cause death or weaken individuals, putting them at risk of being

it describes as “unprecedented progress” made over the
past two years. A regular supply of medicines and general worldwide
strategic support has resulted in a vast improvement in the health of
many people. There now seems to be a much closer focus on simplifying
and fine-tuning the logistics of getting medication to as many people
as possible in the most cost-effective ways. The outlook has shifted
away from instigating the strategy to progressing it in a sustainable

Stone of Blackheath:</Member></B> My Lords, my involvement in this area
has come about from chairing DIPEx, an online health charity. We
publish videos and audio interviews conducted over 10 years of
qualitative research into people’s personal experiences of
illness by a brilliant team of academics at Green Templeton College,
Oxford. Our website, healthtalkonline, was featured last week in the
<I>Times</I> as number two in the top 50 websites that “you
cannot live without”. We are good at
publicity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T19:46:28"></hs_TimeCode>. Sir
Tom Hughes-Hallett, the chair of the Institute of Global Health
Innovation at Imperial College, has been a great supporter of DIPEx
International, and he thought that perhaps our methodology of videoing
patients’ experiences might help NTD workers to record and
report their effectiveness because they do not get enough exposure;
they are neglected. We are looking at that with the
institute.</hs_para>

Alan Fenwick, the expert at the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative at
Imperial College, he amazed me. The initiative has used its DfID
funding to such great effect that it facilitated some 4 million
treatments against schistosomiasis in its first year, which was 2011.
By 2012 it had reached eight countries and provided 15 million
treatments. Similarly, the Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases at
the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has increased its number of
treatments against lymphatic filariasis from 35 million in 2011 to 52
million in 2012. Both are confident that they will further expand their

DFID funding is reaching the poorest of the poor with cost-effective
treatments of NTDs, but the world should view addressing these diseases
not only within the health context, of course, but also in the
important economic context. The Hudson Institute says that about 50
million DALYs—disability adjusted life years—are lost in
developing countries to the NTDs alone. The treatment of NTDs is
immensely cost-effective on a massive scale. The teams involved in
these projects want the correct measurements, graphic representation
and feedback loops in place to prove the effectiveness of allocating
further huge resources to this work because it pays over the long term.
The sources of funding are entitled to know that the route whereby
their cash is getting to good causes is providing value for money. If
they know that, they can target their funding better and co-operate
across the piece, and thence give more. Yesterday evening, Lindsey Wu
of Policy Cures described the integration of the malaria vaccine
technology road map being co-ordinated by the World Health
Organisation. It seeks to involve players at all stages of malaria
control and elimination and considers how that can back into early
stage vaccine work. This type of holistic approach at all stages goes
beyond the lab to deliver the most impact on the
ground.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013080000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013080000065">There
are, of course, powerful drivers for “commercial” funders

because I know that water fleas, snails, blackfly and many other deadly
insects and parasites are still infecting millions with NTDs such as
trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis. “Trips” and
“oncho” became part of my vocabulary when I joined
Christian Aid 40 years ago. Remembering the WHO
mass-spraying campaigns in west Africa at that time, I now feel
disappointment that we always seemed to be on the point of eliminating
oncho but never quite

specialising in this field have long had the target of “clean
water for all”. Water is given a green light in the MDGs but
this remains an enormous task —the UN says that 783 million are
still using traditional drinking water supplies and one of the most
successful agencies, WaterAid, now has 27 country programmes, which
last year provided 1.6 million people with safe water and 1.9 million
with sanitation. Oxfam and CARE have also been prominent in this field.
Coming from the background of the voluntary sector, people like me can
sound quite glib in describing the needs of the poorest
people—all they have to do is boil their water, wash their hands
and follow the advice of the nearest health centre. However, life of
course is a little more complicated: the advice may be 50 or more miles
away; tradition and culture dominate; and the worms and flies may be
too numerous. Education is vital. Water and sanitation must be
complemented with child-focused health education that promotes lifelong
healthy
behaviour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013080000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013080000069">I
have some scepticism about the donations offered by pharmaceutical

known pharmaceutical companies in countries such as Bangladesh bought
doctors and tyrannised village clinics that do not comply with them. I
nevertheless congratulate these companies, and the charities that are
contributing to this important campaign. We know that more than 700

importance of tackling the NTDs with major campaigns. However, its key
message is that, as the communities affected are often those excluded
from health services, any work to ensure sustainable access to NTD
prevention and control interventions should always be integrated with
the strengthening of comprehensive health systems for sustainable
change. Does the Minister agree with that and will she ask DfID to

Lord Bishop of Derby:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayman, for securing this debate on a very important
topic and, as we have heard, a very neglected one. There are great
signs of engagement and creativity, as noble Lords have said, but the
statistics and effects are absolutely horrifying. I want to develop the
point that has just been made about an integrated and sustainable
approach. For medical intervention and investment to be
effective—I think the noble Baroness used the term “smart
aid”—there has to be an embedding in the local culture.
Often, there have been ways of handling these things for many years,
and it is not easy for western medicine to come in with all its
technology and suddenly change the situation. In fact, an article in
the <I>Lancet</I> in March 2012 provided evidence of the hostility to
this kind of intervention because people in the local community did not
understand it and were threatened by it. The article said that it was
important, alongside the medical intervention, to enable what it called
“behavioural change” and an “integrated biosocial
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T19:55:34"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013083000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013083000002">I
want to give an example of that and encourage the Minister, and our own
investment from this country and the work of the London centre, to take
this approach seriously. I declare an interest as a trustee of
Christian Aid, and it is good that there are other Christian Aid
supporters here. Christian Aid commends what it calls a
“community health approach”, which is local, joined-up
and sustainable. It has four aims: to respond to local priorities; to
integrate the approach to the various diseases and health issues; to
develop a local health system; and to involve local people and local
resources.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013083000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013083000003">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T19:56:32"></hs_TimeCode>
will give your Lordships an example. A cross-border malaria initiative
in Zambia was launched by Christian Aid and a number of partners in
July 2010. So far, 100 local people have been identified,
engaged and trained up to work as volunteers to enable this integration
of the care response and its embedding in the local community. That is
the kind of approach that I think we must commend and invest
in.</hs_para>

have two other quick points. Resourcing is crucial. Although it is not
the main topic of this debate, I cannot resist reminding noble Lords
that before Christmas we debated the issue of tax justice. Much of the
wealth that is created in countries where these tropical diseases are
prevalent is through tax avoidance schemes and is taken out of the
country to where it cannot be taxed to provide local resources for a
local response. We need to recognise that that is part of the
picture<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T19:57:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013083000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013083000005">Finally,
I will say something about vigilance. In the 1960s, sleeping sickness
was virtually eradicated in Africa, but by the 1990s, it was beginning
to return. There is a frightening pattern in a lot of aid and welfare
interventions that almost get there but somehow do not quite integrate
and create something sustainable. The problem then creeps back. That is
why I commend to the Minister, and ask her to take very seriously, this
approach of community health, which is local, sustainable, joined-up
and able to build a system so that the approach to neglected tropical
diseases will be a lasting and effective

Trees:</Member></B> My Lords, the debate today is to mark the first
anniversary of the London declaration on neglected tropical diseases. I
want to celebrate that important initiative and the considerable
progress that has been, and is being, made to control and eradicate
these diseases. However, I also want to emphasise that we cannot yet be
complacent. The job is not finished and there is much to do, even

NTDs are now getting the attention they deserve because they afflict
huge numbers of people in the poorest countries of the world—the
so-called “bottom billion”. These diseases are
inextricably bound with poverty. It contributes to these diseases and
these diseases, in turn, contribute to poverty. Their control is an
essential step in the achievement of several key millennium development
goals. These diseases, which include many with bizarre, exotic and
frightening names such as Kala-Azar, Chagas disease,
sleeping sickness, elephantiasis and river blindness, are for the most
part chronic and persisting infections, which may eventually kill but
which in many cases simply—but seriously—disable,
disfigure and stigmatise. The effects are pervasive and extensive in
the societies in which they

of their characteristics is that many can be treated, controlled and
even eradicated with tools that we already have. These are the
low-hanging fruit of tropical diseases. The costs of making progress
are relatively low and the benefits are huge, as has been said by
several speakers. It is very much to the credit of WHO, the Gates
Foundation, various NGOs, scientists and healthcare workers throughout
the world, and of course, the London Declaration, that these diseases
are now being tackled in a concerted and coherent way. The contribution
of the UK to this global effort is huge. DfID has played a very
substantial part, as have many scientists, medics, vets and healthcare
workers based in our universities and in our two schools devoted to
tropical medicine and public health in Liverpool and London.</hs_para>

factor has been the donation of drugs by major pharmaceutical companies
to this programme. Drugs to the value of $2 billion to $3
billion a year are being donated by big pharma; this is an altruistic
gesture that is not always fully appreciated. As a vet, it gives me
satisfaction that a lot of these drugs were initially developed for the
control of worms in animals. A staggering 700 million tablets are
administered each year to school children in developing countries to
control enteric worms, and that is just one example. All of these
efforts have resulted in a substantial reduction in the incidence of
infection and disease, and put the goals of controlling and eradicating
many—if not most—of the 17 targeted NTDs by 2020
within
reach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013083000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013083000010">However,
there is still a need for an estimated $2 billion to sustain
this effort to achieve these goals. That is a lot of money. Currently
only 0.6% of overseas development assistance for health globally is
being allocated to NTDs. Some $2 billion spread over 7 years
among the wealthiest nations of the globe, given the huge return, is
surely not only a desirable, but also a necessary investment. Fit and
healthy people can work to feed themselves, their families, their
populations and they can contribute to the economic and social progress
of their countries which in turn reduces conflict and

Rea:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman,
for bringing this important subject before the House. I was stimulated
to take part because half a lifetime ago I worked with children in
Lagos, Nigeria, for two and a half years and met with some of these
diseases. They can have a debilitating effect by causing anaemia,
malnutrition, impairment of immunity or renal failure. Most of them
have a secondary host, or vector, which spreads the infection. These
include a number of insects and other organisms which have
been referred to and described by other speakers. I think noble Lords
would agree that nobody living in the Western world would tolerate
being exposed to any of these pests. However, people living in poor
housing with no clean water or sanitation cannot guard against them. In
this context, I would echo the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, in asking
the Minister how far vector control for NTDs other than malaria is

international initiatives that have been praised by everybody, I have a
slight caveat, as did the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. Anthropologists
Tim Allen of LSE and Melissa Parker of Brunel point out in the

administration of drugs gives rise to a danger that these vertical

available for a lot of these diseases. That is far from the truth. We
have some treatments available for some of the diseases, and none for
others. In some cases, those that are available are highly toxic and,
more likely than not, will kill the patient. We need more research in
developing cheaper, more effective drugs. We also need a long-term

people suffering from, 
<?notus-xml column=1615?>or at risk from, neglected tropical diseases every year. I am delighted
that we have been supported by DfID to lead a global survey of blinding
trachoma, which will take us into 30 of the poorest countries in the

want to make four simple points. First, while I agree with my noble
friend Lord Patel that there is much research to do, when it comes to
these two diseases—and others—we know what to do. It is
well documented, researched and deliverable. We can rid the world of
these diseases and we can do so
sustainably.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013083000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013083000026">Secondly,
the way in which this whole programme around NTDs is developing is an
example to other areas of health and, indeed, development. First, there
is wonderful co-operation, which my noble friend Lady Hayman mentioned,
but that co-operation is not new; it did not start a year ago.
Co-operation has been going on at all levels around these two eye
diseases for more than 25 years; indeed, Merck has provided free drugs
for these eye diseases for the past 25
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013083000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013083000027">In
addition, in Africa there has been developed a process called
community-directed treatment, which relates directly to what the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby said earlier. We in Sightsavers
are in touch with 100,000 community volunteers in villages who deliver
these pills. It was developed in Africa; it was not actually developed
by western medicine, it was developed by Africans as a way of reaching
people in the community. What is interesting is that we can use that
network not only to treat people with the eye diseases—indeed,
ivermectin happens to treat lymphatic filariasis as well as
onchocerciasis—but to deliver other drugs. We as an eye
organisation are involved with others in delivering treatments for a
whole range of different things. The third way in which this is such a
good example is that surgery is often delivered by non-medical staff,
and there are examples of how you can do things very effectively by
being radical and
innovative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013083000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013083000028">My
third point is, as again the noble Baroness said in starting off, that
this is smart aid; it works. This should be publicised; it should be
communicated. Who can argue with 50p to stop people going
blind? That is what we are talking about.</hs_para>

sustainability one that has been brought up by a number of people.
These are diseases of poverty and indeed, as we have heard, of
neglected people. They are linked to things like clean water and weak
health systems. So my questions to the Minister are very simple. First,
what is DfID doing to integrate its policies around neglected tropical
diseases with its policies on water and sanitation? Secondly, how is it
going to make sure that the strengthening of health systems will be
part of the post-2015 development
agenda?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_30_PT_1/57AE76D1D6123B78F2E6EAB0D716D2AE75654E70" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 January 2013">Wednesday,

Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayman, for initiating this important debate. Although
neglected tropical diseases are the most common infections among the
world’s 
<?notus-xml column=1616?>poorest communities, they receive little attention in the media. As we
have heard, while they are not always fatal, their effect on
individuals and communities can be devastating. They disproportionately
affect the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people and are a
serious impediment to economic development in many developing
nations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000002">There
is no doubt that the coming together of the global health community in
January 2012 to plan a new way forward for achieving a world free of
these devastating ailments was a historic occasion. The commitment to
the control or elimination of 10 NTDs in line with targets set by the
World Health Organisation marked the beginning of a new and
co-ordinated
effort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000003">As we
have heard, the lives of millions of people have improved since the
launch of this plan. However, more resources and political will from
all Governments will be needed if we are to achieve the WHO’s
2020 goals. The control and elimination of NTDs is feasible through
mass drug administration but failure to also address the underlying
causes, including the environmental conditions that contribute to their
spread, such as clean water, improved sanitation initiatives and vector
control, will make this task almost impossible.</hs_para>

to achieving the WHO targets include: conflicts and the consequent
movement of people; population growth; vector or intermediate host
control; resistance to medicines and pesticides; expectations
overtaking science; inadequate support for research; and, of course,
climate change. We still have a world where some 780 million people are
without adequate sanitation and safe drinking water; 40% of those
without access to improved water sources live in sub-Saharan Africa,
where many of the NTDs are prevalent. The biggest challenge is in
India, where more than half the country’s population—625
million people—are without basic toilet

integrated approach is essential if we are to meet the WHO targets. As
we have heard from the noble Earl and my noble friend, there are other

mass campaigns need to strengthen and underpin fragile health systems.

sanitation as connected issues. Indeed they are, and we are well aware
of that. I assure noble Lords that the increase in funding
for NTDs is additional to DfID’s existing health, water and
sanitation commitments. Integrating with the health system is an
important tenet for NTD programmes to help to strengthen that
effectiveness and improve sustainability. If we maintain that approach,
those diseases can be eradicated, as the noble Lord, Lord Trees, said.

permission is completely different; it falls under the Planning Acts.
That is a request for permission to use land for a particular purpose,
or to build on it, to develop on it, and bears no immediate
relationship to the previous or existing use. The problem, and the
reason for Clauses 13 and 14, is that it is claimed—with some
justification, but less than some people are claiming—that
people are making vexatious or frivolous applications to register land
as village or town greens, applications that are without foundation, to
delay or prevent a particular development. Many of the examples that
have been cited concern housing. Little evidence for that has been
provided. We have been provided with lists of places where it is
alleged that that has taken place, but the evidence is, to put it
mildly, a bit
thin.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000028">Having
said that, I am not challenging the view that it is possible, or the
fact that it has happened in some places. I am not challenging the view
that it ought not to be possible to make vexatious and unfounded 
<?notus-xml column=1621?>applications for this purpose. The question is how to find an
appropriate solution to this problem. Quite a few of the examples that
have been provided have been on land owned by the council or by a local
authority. The fact that the situation has got to the stage where a
green application has been made is essentially down to incompetence by
that local authority. However, that is not necessarily a reason why it
should succeed.</hs_para>

principle that vexatious applications should not be allowed to get in

of non-planning consents<I> </I>looked at this issue as one which was
perhaps outside the planning system but which was delaying and possibly
stopping development. The Penfold review suggested aligning—an
important word—the green registration process, which is a
non-planning process, with the planning system where active planning
proposals on land existed and where people were making greens
applications. It should be said that some of those green applications
may have been triggered or stimulated by the planning application but
were not necessarily wrong—but let us assume that we are dealing
with vexatious applications.</hs_para>

consideration of this Bill Ministers stated quite clearly in briefings
that it was their wish to align the planning system and the greens
system. Unfortunately, this is not what the Bill does. It defines
“trigger events” which are related to planning and the
planning process, and which then immediately remove—that is to
say, abolish—the rights of people under the green registration
process. Instead of aligning the two processes and systems, the Bill is
solving the problem simply by abolishing the system that is thought to
be getting in the
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000031">Schedule
4 sets out the trigger events that will be involved. They are to do
with either applications for planning permission or the publication of
documents under the plan-making system. As far as planning permission
is concerned, the trigger event is the moment at which the application
is first publicised. A second trigger event is the moment that consent
is given. This applies to either planning permission in the normal way
or applications for development consent under the infrastructure
planning system. There is a lack of logic here. If an event has been
triggered by the application first being publicised, one wonders why a
further triggering is required when planning permission is
granted—but never mind. Those are the two stages at which the
process is triggered. Under the plan-making system, the event is the
publication of a development plan document or a neighbourhood plan; it
is either the publication of a draft of those documents or the adoption
of the plan.</hs_para>

Schedule 4 look fairly complicated, but all they actually do is to put
the trigger events on the adoption of a plan or the granting of
planning permission or development consent. In other words, it is the
final event in that process in which the land is then allocated for
that purpose. I am not arguing that the green application process
should not stop if land has active planning permission. As far as plans
are concerned, I am not arguing that the green application process
should stop if there is an adopted plan. It seems absolutely clear that
under those circumstances 
<?notus-xml column=1622?>that is reasonable. Where it seems unreasonable is where it is an
initial stage in the process, where no notice is given of it and where
people have no reasonable opportunity to know that it is going to
happen—and it immediately stops. That does not align the greens
process with the planning process; it simply stops the greens process
in its track.</hs_para>

which I have not set out in detail in the amendments, in which the
alignment of the process can take place: I think the amendments tabled
by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, suggest one or two. The green
registration process is notoriously lengthy. I might exhibit some of my
prejudices here but at the councils which deal with it, particularly
county councils, some of the officers who work there—lawyers and
bureaucrats, as I would call them, or administrators; I beg their
pardon—seem to take an unconscionable length of time. The
process of green registration could and should be speeded up.</hs_para>

application is made or proposals are made in a plan, there should be a
fast-track process and, in particular, a filtering process at the
beginning of the stage where quite a few of them could simply be
filtered out because they are obviously not going to succeed. I call in
evidence an example in my own area where the land belonged to the
district council, which was transferring the land to the county council
for a new school. The land was a council-owned public recreation ground
which clearly failed the tests as to whether it was a green. It was
clearly going to fail. It could have been discarded at the first
sifting process, if the green registration authority had felt able to
do that.</hs_para>

said for speeding up the green registration process generally, but it
is not for this Bill. There is something to be said for changes to the
system to deal with the problem of vexatious applications. It is my
submission that that can be done very significantly through a change in
procedure, process and regulations and does not need primary
legislation. If there is to be primary legislation, it should do what
the Penfold review proposed and what Ministers initially said the
Government wanted to do. The two systems should be aligned rather than
taking away people’s rights, which in a minority of cases will
result in wrong

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, we have Amendments 64A, 66A,
69A, 70A, 70B and 70C in this group relating to Clause 14 and Schedule
4. As we have heard, Clause 14 provides that the right to register land
as a green ceases on the occurrence of certain trigger events.
Partially in response to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who was talking
more broadly about whether the clause should stand part, I shall start
by saying that I think we share the same analysis about 
<?notus-xml column=1623?>the claim that there could be frivolous and vexatious use of these
provisions to prevent development and that we are concerned about the
lack of hard evidence. We agree that we should try to get a solution

impairing people’s long-standing rights to obtain town and
village
greens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000038">Clause
15 gives the Secretary of State the ability to disapply the triggers
from a specific piece of land. Amendment 66A would put a requirement on
the Secretary of State to set out in published criteria his reasons for
choosing to do that. There may be pieces of land that should be exempt,
but we need to be clear about what the instances are, not least because
without that clarity we may not see any improvement in the current
situation. Community groups will simply turn to the Secretary of State
to exclude their piece of land from the triggers to lodge an
application. This would be an ideal place to introduce consultation
whereby local authorities, some of which have clearly had a number of
issues with some town and village green applications, could set out
examples of where a town or village green was rightly protected.
Similarly, aggrieved community groups, which work extremely hard to
protect spaces that they believe deserve protection, would have the
chance to advise the Secretary of State of the circumstances that
should lead to an exception from the triggers set out in Schedule
4.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000039">Amendment
69A would take out of scope from the restrictions on registration
circumstances where the green is in an area that is not covered by a
local plan or neighbourhood development plan. Where a local or
neighbourhood plan has been put in place and the community has been
adequately consulted, the community is likely to have placed
protections on its most valued green space. We accept that
where there is a neighbourhood plan and there has been good
consultation, this is likely to be the case. However, where this has
not taken place the community will not have been through the process of
identifying the areas it deems to be most value. Without the amendment,
communities could find that by the time they have their say on a local
or neighbourhood plan, the precious spaces they want to protect have
already been snapped
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000040">We wish to
encourage neighbourhoods to put in place a neighbourhood plan, but
there simply has not been time for them to do that since the Localism
Act 2011 was enacted. When creating previous plans, parish councils may
not have considered the issue in enough detail. It is important that
local communities have the opportunity and enough time to identify
sites they wish to protect. They can then decide which process is most
appropriate for them. We want to move to a situation where those pieces
of land are designated under a neighbourhood plan process and, in the
mean time, we want to make sure that all communities are able to use
the registration processes that are in place at the moment. Local plans
are intended to ensure that we get development in the right places and
with community support. To take the right to protect land away from
communities before the plan-making process has even begun is no way to
foster their trust. We do not want to stop vexatious applications being
identified; however, we want to ensure that communities that have not
yet identified those very special open spaces

I am a firm believer in the importance of open spaces for the health
and happiness of our nation and our communities. Our love of and need
for such open land and our access to it is part of what makes us
British. It has been proven that the existence of such open land is a
considerable factor in promoting good health and well-being. So we must
keep our open spaces as much for our heritage as for the social,
environmental and even economic benefits that they
bring.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000050">Thus,
leaving aside existing town and village greens, and referring to
currently unclaimed rights, it is absolutely proper that the fact that
people have used a piece of land, or claim that they do, for open
access or other activities should be taken into consideration during a

put into

my experience of our planning system—again, I repeat my
interests as a farmer and landowner, and someone who is thus usually a
planning applicant—I have found that during any proposal for
development, or a proposal to try to drive forward an agenda for
economic or social change, there is inevitably an inherent fear of
change among the locals and, either genuinely or disingenuously, every
enthusiast in the neighbourhood turns up to insist that his or her
speciality or special interest is given priority over every other
matter. Sometimes these specialists can even be part of the Government;
it could be a conservation officer who has personal views about the
landscape or about the importance of anything from Georgian windows to
Victorian chimneys. It could be a badger specialist or a newt expert,
or it could be about bats, which are seen as a vital thing that must be
preserved at all costs, although we certainly seem to have enough of
them now. Alternatively, there was a case recently near me where
Natural England caused an important local development, involving the
provision of a much needed school as well as much needed housing, to
falter because of dormice. I am glad to say that differences were
eventually resolved, but only at a cost.</hs_para>

all-important priority for some people is energy, either energy saving
or even renewable energy. In the latter case, of course, it is less
likely to be a desire to include it than to be a desire to oppose the
means of generating it. Then again, it may be the absence of public
transport and available access that is the make-or-break factor in some
people’s minds. We have all heard of developments being
condemned as 
<?notus-xml column=1626?>unsustainable because they are not served by public transport or because
the social services find them difficult to access. It may be a public
footpath, or the loss of good agricultural land that is absolutely
crucial in the mind of the person putting the idea forward. Of course,
there is always flood defence or, as we discussed on Monday, excessive
demands for affordable housing. The list of special
interests—they really are special interests in people’s
minds—goes on and on. Of course, village greens must be included
in this
list.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000053">All of
the above, and no doubt others, are vital in their place, and when you
list them it is a wonder any development ever takes place in this
country at all. Noble Lords who listened to the debate yesterday on how
to “unbecalm” our national economy will be aware that the
delays caused by our planning system tended to crop up, mostly focusing
on the complications, demands and delays of getting anything done by
both small and big
businesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013084000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013084000054">With
regard to Clause
14<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T20:57:05"></hs_TimeCode>, it is
important that the developer and the local planners address all these
“overriding imperatives”. Furthermore, as the world
changes, the priority of these imperatives will inevitably chop and
change. Thus personally, and here I come to the nub, I think that we
need to think very seriously indeed before we allow any of these
imperatives to be compulsory or statutory show-stoppers. I am not
talking about our protected areas, or even existing town and village
greens. But as regards aspirational greens, surely it is up to the
planning committee, or even the Secretary of State, to decide what is
important in each and every instance. Maybe the problem can be dealt
with in another way; maybe if the open space went somewhere else, we
could enlarge or even enhance it. We all have to realise that for any
approved greenfield, or even brownfield, site development,
somebody’s valuable piece of England will have had to be
sacrificed—one hopes for considerable social or economic gain.
That is what planning controls are all about. Even heritage is not
completely sacrosanct. For example, there is the moving of Abu Simbel
to allow the flooding of Lake Aswan; it could be said that it is better
now than it was before, although I am not proposing that we move any of
our historic heritage gems. I am just saying that sometimes it is
necessary to think outside the box and a statutory show-stopper will
automatically prevent that

continue to remain show-stoppers in certain cases if the planning
committee so thinks. However, they should not have overriding statutory

might pertain to a particular development proposal. It is the balancing

brief comments on the clause stand part debate because it is important
to put what we are talking about into context. The process to register
land as a town or village green can cut across decisions taken in the
democratically accountable planning system. Applications to register
land as a green can, and have, delayed or prevented development. We
have heard, for example, about the implications of this for the
affordable homes needed in our communities. Clause 14
addresses these concerns by aligning the process for registering greens
with the planning system. Without this clause and the linked Schedule
4, the greens registration system will remain at odds with planning.
This would mean that applications to register land as a green could
continue to be made on land where planning permission has been granted
or which has been identified for development in an adopted local plan
or neighbourhood plan. Additionally, applications to register land as a
green could cut across consultation with the local community on draft
local and neighbourhood plans and planning applications, including
those seeking consent for nationally significant infrastructure
projects.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013087000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013087000004">At
Second Reading there was considerable support for these reforms.
Indeed, we were urged to look at more radical changes. The noble Lord,
Lord Greaves, considered the problem in relation to planning to be
small-scale and said that Clause 14 was an overreaction. He has
reiterated that today. However, this clause has been widely supported,
including by the Local Government Association, whose member councils
bear the responsibilities for planning and determining applications for
town and village greens. The association said that these reforms are
essential to align the greens registration system with the planning
system. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, mentioned Adrian Penfold, who
also gave evidence to the Commons Select Committee. He said modestly
that what is in the Bill is a better way of dealing with the problem
than he himself came up with in the review of non-planning consents
that the previous Government commissioned him to
lead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013087000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013087000005">The
proposed reforms do not drive a coach and horses through the ability of
communities to protect open land which is important to them; rather,
the changes are a proportionate response to a serious problem. They
strike the right balance and put decisions on the future of land where
they should be taken—in the planning system, which provides an
opportunity for everyone to have their say and for all relevant
considerations to be taken into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T21:02:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013087000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013087000006">I
shall deal with the amendments as briefly as I can but there are an
awful lot of them. In order to align the registration of town and
village greens with the planning system, Clause 14 and Schedule 4 to
this Bill insert into the Commons Act 2006 a new Section 15C and
corresponding Schedule 1A. The new legislation will not affect existing
registered greens, which will continue to enjoy the same strong
protection as they currently have. Nor is it our intention that the
changes will affect applications to register land as a town or village
green where there is no proposed development on the land in question.
Equally importantly, the reforms have been carefully drafted to ensure
that where an application to carry out development has 
<?notus-xml column=1628?>been considered, rejected and any appeal rights have run their course,
an application to register the land as a green can be considered in the
normal way. Each of Amendments 64 to 70C would significantly weaken the
proposed reforms to align the village green legislation with the
planning system. The combined effect would negate most of what these
reforms are intended to achieve. I will explain the damaging
consequences of each amendment in
turn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013087000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013087000007">Amendments
70, 70A, 70B and 70C concern Schedule 4, and I shall deal
with them first. Amendment 70 would remove the trigger
events in Schedule 4 that exclude greens applications when a planning
application, or a draft local or neighbourhood plan, is formally
publicised for consultation. Instead, the only trigger events would be
later in the planning process, when a decision had been taken to grant
planning permission, to adopt a local plan or to make a neighbourhood
plan that identified land for potential
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013087000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0002.htm#13013087000008">Amendment
70A would have the same effect as Amendment 70 in relation to local
plans because it would mean that applications to register land as a
town or village green could be made when a draft local plan was being
consulted on. We have the same concern about Amendment 70B, whereby a
town or village green application could be made where a draft
neighbourhood plan was published for consultation. Amendment 70C would
have a similar effect as Amendment 70, by removing the protection from
town or village green applications that we intend to give to major
infrastructure projects between the time when a proposed infrastructure
application is publicised and, if that application is accepted by the
Secretary of State, an application is publicised again. The trigger
events proposed in the Bill were carefully chosen to occur when formal
publicity and consultation is undertaken in relation to both planning
applications and draft plans. This is the right approach because it
will protect both decision-making by democratically accountable local
authorities and the ability of communities to engage in meaningful
consultation on whether land should be developed or kept
open.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013087000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0003.htm#13013087000009">Amendment
70 would mean that a town or village green application could be made at
any time up to when a decision is made on a planning application, an
application under the nationally significant infrastructure regime or a
draft plan. Amendments 70A, 70B and 70C would have a similar effect.
This would cast into real doubt whether a development proposal could be
delivered, and would cause significant delays to development
proceeding, if that was the eventual decision taken in the planning
process. These amendments cut across meaningful consultation in
planning. They would mean that an application to register land as a
green could be used to undermine a local community’s ability to
engage on whether an area should be developed or kept open, taking
account of the need for new homes, work places and infrastructure, as
well as concerns such as ensuring sufficient recreation
space.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013087000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0003.htm#13013087000010">It is
absolutely right that people should be able to argue their case that a
site should be protected as open space. They can look for support to
the National Planning Policy Framework, which gives strong protection
for open spaces. The framework also includes the new 
<?notus-xml column=1629?>“local green space” designation, which communities,
through local and neighbourhood plans, will be able to use to identify
for special protection green areas of particular importance. The
appropriate way for people to engage in planning is to use the
opportunity that consultation affords, while respecting that others in
the community may disagree just as passionately and wish to present
different evidence about what decisions on the future use of land would
be in the overall public interest. It is our intention, when the
outcome of the planning process is a decision not to develop land, that
the reforms will not then prevent people applying to register the land
as a
green.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013087000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0003.htm#13013087000011">Amendment
64 would mean that applications could be made to register land as a
green up to six months after a trigger event has occurred. The effect
would be that even when there was a planning permission, you would have
to wait another six months before you could be sure that the
development would not be delayed further or even stopped altogether by
an application to register land as a green. Equally, where land is
identified for potential development in a plan, the community would be
penalised by a further six months of uncertainty, despite the fact that
the proposals had been through a process of independent examination. In
both cases, proposals would have been subject to consultation and
careful consideration, but the final determination could be undermined
by a registration application. The amendment would be unfair to
everyone who benefits from development and would produce an unnecessary
threat hanging over delivery of the homes and economic growth that is
so urgently
needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013087000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-0003.htm#13013087000012">Amendment
64A relates to trigger events in the schedule concerning applications
for planning permission or development consent, and would mean that an

in the same way as Amendment 70 and, for the reasons I have explained,
we consider that Amendment 64A is equally flawed.</hs_para>

66A would require the Secretary of State to consult on any occasion

town or village green application could go ahead when it would

Government recognise the importance of consultation.
Equally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T21:10:01"></hs_TimeCode>,

amendment would mean that the Government would have to consult, however

Additionally, we have sought to include in the Bill only the main

need for additional terminating events to ensure that all outcomes in
plan-making are covered and that we avoid the situation where the
exclusion on green applications fails to lift even where there is no

fundamental difference of view, which I shall turn to in a minute. I
thank the Minister for replying in great detail to the amendments, most
of which I did not speak to specifically. I discarded my notes on those
because I thought I had spoken for long enough. I had listened to
myself for long enough even if other people had not. I am very grateful
to her for doing that, because it gives me something to go away and
read carefully. Many of them were probing amendments to find out what
the Government really meant by them. I am grateful for the offer from
the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, to have further discussions on this. I
hope that we might have further discussions all

may be agreement between the two Front Benches, but there is a wish,
certainly on the part of the Minister and I thought there might be on
the part of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, to bring the registration of
greens, as part of the process of deciding the future of land, into the
planning process. The Minister has said that quite clearly on several
occasions. She talked about the decisions on the future of land not
being bypassed by the registration process and so on.</hs_para>

submission is that there are two separate systems and that the
registration of greens is not part of the planning process because, as
clearly set out in the commons legislation, it is a question of the
establishment of fact and not a question of what, as a matter of
opinion or a matter of planning policy, ought to happen. That is the
difference. There are two quite separate processes based on different
principles and different legislation. One goes back to commons law, as
set out in commons legislation, and the other is the planning
legislation which is relatively recent, dating mainly from
1948<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T21:18:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

view here. It seems to me that the Government are saying that the
planning process, or the ability of communities collectively to make a
decision about pieces of land, should always trump the commons
registration and greens registration process. I think that they should
come out openly and honestly and say so and then we can have that
argument. They ought not to be pushing it through as one element of a
rag-bag miscellaneous Bill of bits and pieces gathered from all sorts
of places. At the moment, we have a problem with a meeting of minds
because we come from quite separate areas. Perhaps that can be thought
about and talked about
further.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_30_PT_1/4C478DAF16722507E22DED6F042167329A06D5E2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 January 2013">Wednesday,

have one question for the Minister. I am not sure that I know the
answer to it. What happens if a piece of land is subject to a
registration for a village green—if an application goes
in—and somebody makes a planning application after that? Is
making a planning application after an application has been made to
register a green a way of trumping it completely? That would run a
coach and horses through the entire system set out in Section 15 of the
Commons Act. I should like that question

agreed with a lot of what the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington,
said about the planning system. The purpose of the system is to balance
different interests and make a decision. I do not disagree with any of
that, and I agree that many of the people who come forward on planning
applications have special interests—in particular the people who
go out hunting for natterjack toads, great crested newts, various sorts
of obscure bats and types of birds of which I have never heard. That
always happens. A sensible planning system deals with all that. With
respect to the noble Lord, it seemed that what he said was not relevant
to this discussion because the green registration system is not part of
the planning system. If he and other noble Lords say that it should be
and want to change the system, that is a different argument. There

Cameron of Dillington:</Member></B> Surely that is the whole point of
this clause—to make sure that this problem is addressed by the
planning system so that it does not become the statutory show-stopper
that it currently is. The noble Lord talked about looking at this from
two separate points of view. We are looking at it from that point of

Greaves:</Member></B> I understand that that may be the purpose of it,
at least in certain circumstances—and I agree that it is a
show-stopper at the moment. If a piece of land is found to be a green,
and if the application is legitimate, that trumps the planning system;
there is no doubt about that. If noble Lords do not want that to
happen, they should change the system. However, this clause does not do
what the 
<?notus-xml column=1633?>noble Lord wants, and it does not do what the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, suggested that the local planning system should
do. There is no way, through a local plan-making system—whether
it is a neighbourhood plan or a local plan—to deliver a new
green, because that is not part of the planning system. No one can
state in a neighbourhood plan, “This will be a village
green”, or, “This will be a town green”, unless
the owners of the land want to dedicate it as such. Otherwise, no one
can do it because the systems are not aligned, or part and parcel of
the same process, so the plan-making system will not deliver a
green—particularly through a planning application. If a planning
application comes in, somebody may come in with an objection and say,
“I think that this is a village green because I have kicked a
ball about on it for the past 45 years”, but that cannot be
dealt with as part of the planning application because it would not be
a material consideration. A planning application cannot be turned down
on the grounds that something is a village green; it is just not part
and parcel of the planning
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-30T21:23:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

speeding up the green registration system and making it more modern,

under the triggering mechanisms. Having said all that, I will read with
great interest exactly what the noble Baroness said. Perhaps we may be

often stem from poor policy decisions by the unelected
bodies. For example, Manchester City Council’s proposals for
higher council tax this year are driven in part by a badly drafted
long-term PFI agreement signed by the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal
Authority, pushing up the waste levy on council tax due to the cost of
rubbish disposal being well over the current market
rates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013052000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-wms0001.htm#13013052000119">Another
consequence is that a referendum principle based on the relevant basic
amount affects the amount a local authority can raise through council
tax in cash terms, which can be to the authority’s detriment if
its council tax requirement includes a large proportion of levies.
Metropolitan authorities have made representations
expressing their concern and requested that
the calculation  of excessiveness should be based
on the basic amount of council tax, rather than the relevant
basic amount.

Government therefore intend to bring forward legislative proposals to
ensure that levying bodies are accountable to the public. The future
determination of excessiveness will be based upon the basic amount of
council tax (i.e. the actual band D amount). This will bring all
revenue raised through council tax—including
levies—within the scope of the legislation. Council
tax payers will want to see this change, which will ensure
that unelected levying bodies do not have a disproportionate effect on
council tax levels. As now, we intend that the referendum principles
should be determined on an annual basis to reflect prevailing
circumstances and should be subject to the approval of the House of
Commons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013052000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130130-wms0001.htm#13013052000121">Local
authorities should be on notice that we will pay close attention to
increases in their basic amount of council tax in 2013-14 and we are
prepared to take action in response to any large increases. Authorities
should have no doubt that we will consider setting principles in future

the FRS is known to under-report benefit receipt. Please see
the FRS publication Methodology chapter found at
http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/frs/2010_11/chapter9.pdf for more
details. However, the FRS is considered to be the best source for
looking at benefit and tax credit receipt by characteristics not
captured on administrative sources, and for looking at total benefit
receipt on a benefit unit or household basis. It is often inappropriate
to look at benefit receipt on an individual basis because means-tested
benefits are paid on behalf of the benefit

Freud:</Member> The Equality Act 2010, and the public sector equality
duty requires public bodies to be able to demonstrate how they have
paid due regard to equality issues in the development and delivery of
their services. One way in which the department can do this is by
monitoring our services and asking customers and claimants to give us
information about their equality characteristics. Providing any such
information would be on a purely voluntary basis, and in line with the
Data Protection Act no sanctions or withdrawal of services would be
applied to those people who preferred not to say what, for example,
their religion or sexual orientation was. The legislation does not
cover the issue of political preference, but this information would not
be needed or sought for the purpose of accessing DWP
