Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and
Climate Change (Baroness Verma):</Member></B> My Lords, the Government
have noted the contents of the NOAA report with concern. The observed
reductions of Arctic sea ice extent and thickness and the consequent
regional environmental and societal impacts re-emphasise the urgent
need for strong international action to tackle climate change. The UK
has a leading role in the international negotiations and is working
through the European Union, the G8 and the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change to reach further global agreement to reduce emissions.

Giddens:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that Answer. The
self-same report says, in heavy scientific jargon, that the extreme
melting of the Arctic is a kick up the pants to the world. In terms of
doing more to combat climate change, I take it that the Minister will
agree with that assessment.

issue—we must be mindful of the different weather patterns that
we are witnessing currently. We work through the UNFCCC process, and at
the recent conference of the parties in Doha all countries restated
their commitment to negotiate a global deal by 2015 on a single
comprehensive and legally binding climate agreement to come into effect
from 2020. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T14:39:02"></hs_TimeCode>

United States has reduced its carbon emissions and increased its
production of shale gas. However, this country takes the view that we
need to ensure that our energy supplies are a mix of renewables and
traditional fossil-fuel based. Therefore, although we are looking at
shale gas, it will be part of a mix of energy rather than our having a

it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T14:40:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord May of Oxford" PimsId="1757" UID="1301284000268" xid="1646" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000268">Lord

inequalities when commissioning public health services. The NHS and

Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for her reply.
In November, the BBC pointed out that the gap between the least served
and best served people was widening in this country. Cancer Research UK
pointed out in a recent survey that the likelihood of an unskilled
worker dying of cancer was twice as great as that of a professional
worker in the same region. In light of these figures, the Liberal
Democrats proposed, and the Government accepted, a specific duty on the
Secretary of State to have regard to inequalities in health. Despite
that, the outcomes framework has among its five domains no reference to
health inequalities and, despite the very strong support expressed by
the public in the mandate consultation, there was no specific reference
to inequalities in health in any of the recent DfH documents. Can I
therefore ask the Minister directly whether she will agree that, when
the review of the outcomes is made next year, a greater attempt will be
made to have a specific section dealing with health inequalities and,
one hopes, measuring real progress in this most difficult of
areas?</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> My noble friend is right to focus on health
inequalities that remain. The last Administration and previous
Administrations have sought to address them, as have we. In the Health
and Social Care Act 2012, for the first time there were specific legal
duties to reduce health inequalities. I am slightly puzzled by what my
noble friend says about outcomes, because if she looks at the public
health outcomes framework and the <I>NHS Outcomes Framework</I>
—in particular the public health ones—the two overarching
outcomes are increased health life expectancy, and reduced difference
in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy between communities.
That is the measure against which we will judge what is done
in public health.</hs_para>

numbers, as I have seen them but I do not have them in my brief here. I
point out that because health will be far more focused in the local

for example, to look at how health is delivered in their area. If there
are problems because of a lack of staff, they will need to address
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000047"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton" PimsId="3193" UID="1301284000309" xid="1108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000309">Baroness

relation to the controversy over what is happening in south London. He
explicitly said, it is true, that he could not comment on that case but
it is extremely important in these cases that a strategic overview is
taken of where provision is best set. The Department of Health is
obviously well aware of what is said about the strength of accident and
emergency at Lewisham Hospital. No doubt if that is a proved case, it
will be necessary to bear it in

assistants to progress to nursing roles, and a review of induction

no training and who are unregistered, unregulated and often
unsupervised? Will my noble friend do three things in the forthcoming

My understanding is that it will be published on 6 February. The
Government will be responding to what its recommendations might be, but
I have already mentioned that Skills for Health and Skills for Care are
developing standards for the training and conduct of support workers.
They should report on that very shortly. The CQC has also been

Government on the steps that they have taken so far, although they have
taken a long time to do them. In addition to the area that the noble
Lord, Lord Willis, talked about, there are still issues inside
hospitals of patients not understanding that healthcare assistants are
qualified to do the work that they are doing, while the healthcare
assistants desperately want them to understand that. The
Government’s failure to push this forward quickly is damaging
that relationship. It also makes patients feel unsafe when they really
have no need to.</hs_para>

with regard to out-patients, a common path is often beaten to their

with each group acting as if they came from independent—and

not agree that there is a

can focus on the most important planning matters in their respective
areas. We want to ensure that economic growth is not suffocated by
unnecessary constraints on development that is change of use. We have
already announced our intention to allow for the change of use of
offices to residential accommodation, measures to make better use of
existing buildings, and to make it easier to change use to a new

small-scale development. Indeed, Section 60(2) of the Town and Country
Planning Act 1990 already provides for the Secretary of State 
to make a development order containing permitted development rights
which require the approval of the local planning authority with respect
to certain matters. This allows potential impacts from the development
to be managed
effectively<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:10:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000066">Similarly,
Clause 4(1) will allow the Secretary of State to provide that local
authorities can ensure that, where permitted development is granted for
a change of use, the impacts from that development can be managed
sensitively. For example, this could include ensuring that adequate
measures are in place to manage the impact of any additional traffic
generation or noise created by the change of
use<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:11:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is also merit in providing that the power within Clause 4(1) applies to
the Secretary of State. By doing so, we are providing that the
Secretary of State can further prescribe the scope of a permitted
development night for change of use within the boundaries of the
existing use classes. This could ensure that only those particular uses
where additional freedoms would be beneficial, where there are
sufficient safeguards and indeed where they would not impact adversely
would be permitted. Therefore it would
be possible that the effect of a development order could be limited
to buildings or categories of building approved by the
Secretary of State or other Secretaries of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000068">Let
me be clear that the Secretary of State’s power in Clause 4 can
be used only within the context of a particular permitted development
right set out in the development order made by the Secretary of State
under powers in Section 60 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
Permitted development rights very often have conditions and limitations
attached. Clause 4 will enable those conditions to include
the approval of matters relating to the change of use by the local
planning authority, the Secretary of State or indeed both.</hs_para>

approved will be clearly set out in the actual development order. We
intend that the power will be used to bring forward our proposed
permitted development right to support the creation of new state-funded
schools. This will in this instance take account of a decision by the
Secretary of State for Education to have considered and committed to
the funding of a school. In doing so, we are ensuring that the planning
system supports our priority to ensure that every child has an
opportunity to benefit from a good state-funded education, something
that I am sure the whole Committee wholeheartedly supports. Indeed, in
response to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, I am sure that he is aware
of a place not too far from his area of Luton—Bedford. I can
think of no better words than those of the chairman of Bedford Free
School, who said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1301284000231" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000231">“these

that was a very good example of where the actual development of the
school was delayed but, had these rules been in place, that would not

in the national interest and that planning decision-makers can and

statutory obligations.</hs_parafo>

the tsar of Eland House goes 
<?notus-xml column=1319?>even further in eroding the position of local authorities. The proposal
that he has just announced would allow the Secretary of State to grant
permitted development status—as I understand it, for a
year—during which a planning application
would be processed. That seems to be an extraordinary pre-emptive
procedure. I cannot think of a precedent for something of that kind. It
would be bad enough if it were a final decision. It is ludicrous to
pretend that it is a temporary decision because it is almost
inconceivable that the Secretary of State, having granted that
permitted development, would not end up approving an application even

school is intended to be, but it is certainly not complying with a
number of regulations, including of course the planning regulations.
While I would not expect there to be many examples of wholly
unsatisfactory buildings being used in this way, there clearly is a
risk that schools will be encouraged by the order from the Secretary of
State to proceed willy-nilly with their proposals, potentially
excluding the local authority entirely. If that is what is envisaged in

now read the Statement while the discussion was taking place, the
proposal that is being put forward seems quite extraordinary. Anything
that is announced as a new state-funded school and has the support of
the Secretary of State for Education goes ahead outside the normal
planning system. That is, I understand, exactly what is being proposed
at least for the first year. Presumably it will apply to all of them
and not just to those which are said to have had problems opening on
time because of delays in the planning system. Once again, we find that
if there is a problem with planning—which is presumably caused
by something real and is not invented by the planning
authority—it is the planning system that is to blame. As the
Prime Minister said quite recently, the planners should be removed from
the scene. Those were not his exact words, but he said that they should
be swept away—that they should get out of the way and

that is what parts of the Government want, they should be fairly clear
and overt about it and we can have debates about it. However, what is
happening is that bits are being chipped away here and there. The noble
Lord, Lord Beecham, said that it is eroding the power of local
authorities. I would say it severely 
<?notus-xml column=1320?>undermines the whole reason for and purpose of the planning system. If
it is to be undermined for somebody who wants to run a small business
that does not really affect anybody else, and that person wishes to run
that business in very unsatisfactory circumstances—in a
condition of squalor—I suppose that is their business. However,
we are talking here about schools, children in schools and the people
who live in the neighbourhood around schools. Even if it is a small
free school, it will inevitably have some impact on the people who live
around
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:19:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the prior approval process will mitigate any adverse transport impacts

I will not comment further on that—or used for assembly and
leisure. These uses  can be converted overnight to a school
without so much as a by-your-leave other than prior approval 
to mitigate any transport and noise impacts. Surely this is
fundamentally wrong. It is stated that in a small number of cases free
schools have had to delay their opening because there were planning
problems; that may be the case. If there were problems, whatever they
were, that suggests that that opening should have been delayed and

permission in the first year has to spend that year getting planning
permission. If that planning permission is turned down because the
premises are obviously unsuitable to be turned into a school, for
whatever reasons, the idea that that will go to appeal and the
inspectorate will uphold the decision of the local planning authority
is not likely. The inspectorate will get its firm instructions. It is
quite clear that the Secretary of State for Education and the Secretary

free schools is that the demand for them comes from within the

desire to see a school established. Contrary to the notion that this is
top-down, this is therefore surely something that supports local people

we want to go too deeply into free schools and whether what the noble

what extent. Free schools exist and, whether some of us like them or
not, they are part of the system now. I am not in any way arguing about
that in this Committee because I do not think that it is our business.
What seems to be happening, however, is that in certain circumstances,
when a proposal for a free school comes forward, whatever the
instigation or motivation for it, the Secretary of State is saying that
the normal planning system will not apply for at least the first 12
months. That is the problem.</hs_para>

this, although people might want to use a slightly less emotive term
than “in cahoots”. They are, perhaps, working together
across departments, which some of us sometimes complain they do not
always do. Nevertheless, they are clearly doing this and saying that in
those circumstances the planning system will be set aside. That is
obviously what is being said. If I want to set up a free school and Mr
Pickles thinks that my free school is a good idea, I will not have to
get planning permission before it opens. In the circumstances of a

simply looking at the wording and the disparity between change of use
and physical development. However, given the debate that has just
ensued, I am very glad that I drafted it. We have yet another example
of something that runs through this Bill—an anecdotal approach
to a perceived problem in the planning system, with the answer being to
circumvent that planning system to deal with it. The issue is not the
existence of free schools but their location, and why the normal
planning process is not to be applied to that. Although this was a
gentle, probing amendment, which I thought we might pass over swiftly
with a clear explanation from the Minister, we have opened up something

writes to us, can the Minister set out what the role of the planning
authority will be in relation to a free school? The “prior
approvals” process applies to two particular things. Can he tell
us exactly how that will operate and, in particular, what the timescale
will be; will it be the same as a normal planning application, or will
it be a very informal thing? Will he also tell us what will happen if
there are strong reasons for opposing the location of a free school

spending money, perhaps on the building. What will happen if that is

amendment allows the Committee to discuss the proposals in the Bill to
set limits on the powers of a local planning authority to require
information from applicants for planning permission. My first two
questions are general. First, what is the evidence that this is a
significant problem? There seem to be a lot of assertions behind some
of the changes in the Bill that this and that are getting in the way of
development and growth. There have certainly been complaints—I
have heard them from time to time in my own area—from applicants
who say that they are being asked for too much information, and that
this is slowing things down. So there is anecdotal evidence from
applicants that they do not like the amount of information for
which  they are being asked. However, there is no significant
evidence—certainly I have not seen any substantial
evidence—that this is a significant problem in many places. We
have to ask the Government for more than just assertions and anecdotes
about how much of a problem this is. That is my first question: what is
the evidence that this clause is
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:40:16"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000102">My
second question is about whether in this Committee we are wasting our
time discussing this. I suspect that we might be. My question is: if
this wording is put in the Bill, what difference will it make? Will it
make any difference to the amount of information that planning
authorities in general ask of applicants in different circumstances?
There is already wording in legislation that is very similar to the
wording here, including in secondary legislation and in guidance. I
suspect that this perceived problem is a chimera, and that in practice
this will not make any

amendments in this group probe one or two things. The Bill states that
requests for information must be “reasonable”. Over the
years, I—along with quite a few other noble Lords—have
put down amendments to different Bills demanding that things should be
“reasonable”, in an attempt to get the Government of the
day to explain what they mean by their proposals. I remember being told
by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, who is with us today, when I tabled
amendments to past Bills, that putting wording about being
“reasonable” in a Bill is not necessary—it is
redundant and otiose. It should not be in legislation because there is
an underlying principle to all legislation that people have to act
reasonably. They have to make reasonable decisions on the basis of
reasonable evidence. That goes across the whole of the law. Therefore,
putting the requirement into a Bill is not something that one should
do. Yet here the Government want to put it into a

it is material to that application. I suggest that instead of saying

Hanworth:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to reaffirm some of the
points we have just listened to. The provisions of Clause 5, which seek
to limit the power of local planning authorities to require information
in association with planning applications, seem to be not only
unnecessary but pernicious. I am at a loss to understand their
provenance. As has been suggested, the key word that reveals the drift
of the thinking is “reasonable”. The Bill enjoins
planning authorities to limit their demands for information to those
that are reasonable. The implication is an aspersion that, hitherto,
there has been a significant number of unreasonable demands for
information. Where is the evidence that would support such an
aspersion? I am sure there is no such
evidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000110">Rather<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:48:09"></hs_TimeCode>
than relating to the practice of planning, the clause seems to relate
to a prejudice against the planning process. As such, it seems to
accord with the general tenor of this Bill, which has little or no
grounding in facts or in evidence. Perhaps the worst aspect of this
clause, as has been suggested, is that it gives no indication of how
judgments would be made of what is reasonable and what is not
reasonable. The consequence of this is that it invites planning
applicants to withhold information on the spurious grounds that it is
unreasonable to request it. A licence to behave in this way would
surely wreck the planning system. One can fairly ask the Minister
whether that is indeed the intention of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000111"></hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_28_PT_1/A8869C30F38B568E6C6FD82A87A59968E0B6F9DD" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 January 2013">Monday,

which are of course underfunded as the result of an unfair and
imbalanced central government funding system, planning departments have
inadequate resources, staff and expertise. I believe that some local
planning authorities are reluctant to engage in pre-application advice;
indeed, they cannot afford to do so. I am concerned about the first
encounter with the local planning authority for small applicants when
they submit an application. It is likely that they will find themselves
having to pay, say, 30% to 50% of the costs of a project—we must
bear it in mind that these are small projects worth £50,000 or
even less—in order to conform with the demands made by the local
planning authority in terms of reports and consents. The project, of
course, is also greatly delayed because they have to get all the
answers needed to complete these reports. It seems to me that the
belt-and-braces, tick-box approach applied by local planning
authorities is not necessarily in order to cover themselves in case of
a comeback on the result of an application, but all too often because
they lack the expertise within the department to know what is relevant.
That is why they 
<?notus-xml column=1328?>take a belt-and-braces approach. The fact that, due to the costs, a
small project is killed before it even gets off the ground is often the
cause of a secret sigh of relief in an overworked

have to ask yourself where our much-needed development will come

always strictly accurate. I have known reports to be asked for by
planning officers which are already in the file; in other words, the

underfunded rural local planning authority without knowledge and
expertise to apply this clause? How will an overworked planning officer

experience across the planning system, mostly from the point of view of
organisations requiring information from applicants through local
authorities, and I would say that it is the lack of information, or
delayed or poor quality information, which creates uncertainty and
causes delays that result in poor quality decisions and make it
virtually impossible for other interested parties to have a full and

regional spatial strategies, will mean that the information
requirements of local authorities are likely to be out of date and
should be updated every two years. However, it is clear from this

requirements—for example, with a regular updating of information

that some planning authorities struggle and are under-resourced.

Government’s response was provided on 12 December, so a response
has been made. The consultation paper demonstrates how the provisions
in the Bill form  a critically important part of a wider
package of deregulatory measures brought forward with the purpose of
simplifying the planning system. As well as ensuring a better alignment
between the National Planning Policy Framework and the primary
legislation that governs information requests by local authorities, the
consultation emphasises the need to place limits on the broad power
that currently exists in Section 62(3) of the Town and Country Planning

purpose of requiring such information requests to be reasonable is to
ensure that a local authority can justify whatever information it is

Presumably, that is something which we all agree is sensible and
appropriate. Amendment 54 would continue in a similar vein, by
weakening the requirement for local authorities to justify information
requests on the basis that it is reasonable to think that they will be
material considerations in the determination of the application to a
looser requirement that they would be likely to be. Although I can
understand the intention behind the amendment, we need to ensure that
local authorities are clear, consistent and certain in why they think
that information is going to be relevant to the determination of the

respond to the criticism that there is no statutory definition of what

statutory consultee. As I have already said, the purpose of including
“reasonable” in the tests is to require a local authority
to justify why it considers information is necessary for the
application to be validated. The likely requirements of a statutory

the noble Lord referred at Second Reading—somebody did anyway.
That review, commissioned in 2008, was of the planning application
process. Most recently, the department consulted on proposals to amend
secondary legislation to streamline information requirements. It was
clear from responses from the applicant community that they wanted us
to go further and look at the primary legislative framework, which is
what we have
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:14:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000140" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000140">The
noble Lord, Lord Beecham, referred to the impact assessment. The
savings predicted in the impact assessment are based on a reduction in

changes to secondary legislation. Both the clause itself and related

for applicants to access the appeals system. If I am

suggested would not necessarily be solved by this clause. Some planning

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:18:22"></hs_TimeCode> am not sure
that that is only rural councils. In the past few days I have been told
of a council that has only a handful of development control staff. Most
small councils are in the same position. The council has reduced the
establishment and encouraged people to take redundancy and so on. A
high proportion of its few existing staff have got jobs in other
places, which means that that authority is now down to one development
control officer. That is clearly a fairly parlous position to be in. I
am not quite clear how this clause will assist that local
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000145">Having
listened to the debate, I am coming to the view that, even if I were in

and listen to the experience of noble Lords around the Committee, the
more I think it will not make very much difference at all. It might
cause one or two authorities, which take a fairly slapdash approach to
this and send a list without thinking about what is on it, to think a

is as to whether this clause will have any significant effect in
practice and therefore whether it is worth while making the effort to
remove it. There is lots of legislation which has no real effect in
practice; we just accept that it goes through, I am afraid. However,
with regard to judicial review, the ordinary applicants, about whom the
noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, spoke, who might be having a
modest expansion to their farm, business or whatever, are not going to
go to judicial review. If there is a problem about too much information
being required, I suspect it will concern those people. The noble Lord,
Lord Cameron, is probably right that it is that sort of level of
applicant. I do not think the householder applicant who wants an
extension will be asked for lots of environmental information, and so
on.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1301284000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000151">The big

about our railways. Investing in transport infrastructure is not a
choice. To create jobs and to rebalance our economy we need better
roads, better airports and better trains. High Speed 2 is a central
part of that investment: an engine for growth throughout our country.
That is why, today, I am announcing our initial preferred route north
from Birmingham and on to Leeds and Manchester. These new services will
reach eight out of 10 of our largest cities: places such as Birmingham,
Liverpool and Manchester, as well as Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle,

three further points. The first is about the need for the line. HS2
will be the first main line to be built north of London for almost 120
years. Some say we do not need another, but the truth is that we are
already good at squeezing the most out of our Victorian railway network
and, yes, we will get even more out of it in the coming years with
massive investment. We are electrifying 800 miles of track and building
Crossrail and the northern hub upgrade. These will help to keep us
going for the next decade or two, but what
then?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000157">Rail
passenger numbers have doubled over the past 15 years and demand will
keep growing. The west coast main line is filling up. There is not
enough space for all the commuters, freight trains and intercity trains
that need to use it. That is why I am publishing, after very careful
consideration, my initial preferences for phase two of HS2. The case
for going ahead rests on the capacity it will provide and on the new
connections it will create. It is not just about faster trains to
London, but also about changing the way our great cities work with each
other. There will be easy links on journeys that are difficult today.
It will give muscle  to the economies of cities beyond London,
producing an estimated £2 in economic benefit for every
£1 that  is spent.</hs_para>

from colleagues in this House for better services to their local
stations. They are right to ask for them; High Speed 2 is part of the
solution. By creating free space on existing routes, it will allow
better services to places such as Milton Keynes and more trains for
commuters in areas such as Staffordshire, Leeds and Manchester. I am
determined to make sure the benefits of HS2 run much wider than the
places directly served by the new line.</hs_para>

point: the detail of  the route I am announcing today. This
follows the Government’s announcement last year about phase one
between London and Birmingham. On the western leg from Birmingham to
Manchester, I propose two new high-speed stations. The first is in the
heart of Manchester, right alongside the existing station at Manchester
Piccadilly, allowing easy connections to places such as Salford,
Stockport and Bolton and a journey time to London of just one hour and
eight minutes, down from more than two hours today. The second station
will be at Manchester Airport, giving direct access to the wider
Cheshire area. HS2 also will serve Crewe via a dedicated link and
high-speed trains will continue on the existing railway to Liverpool,
Warrington and Runcorn. They will also benefit from greatly reduced
journey times. Further north, near Wigan, HS2 will connect with the
west coast main line. High-speed trains can then continue at regular
speeds to places such as Preston, Carlisle, Glasgow and Edinburgh. I am
working with our counterparts in Scotland on their aspirations for
high-speed rail and I have already set out a long-term ambition to get
journeys to Scotland below three

leg, we will construct three new stations to bring people and
businesses in the East Midlands and Yorkshire closer to Birmingham, the
north-east and London. The East Midlands station will be located
between Nottingham and Derby at Toton. Links will be upgraded to
provide fast access to both. The second station will be at Sheffield
Meadowhall. It already has good connections and these can be improved
further, allowing it to serve all of Sheffield and South Yorkshire. The
third station will be located in the centre of Leeds, alongside the
South Bank area. As with the western leg, there will be a connection
from HS2 on to the existing rail network. A connection to the east
coast main line, just nine miles from York, will allow the north-east
to benefit, too—London to York in just one hour and 23 minutes,

there are differences between us, and I will seek to identify some of
them for the good of the Government in the time in which they have to
make judgments on this important project. I emphasise to the House that
in the long run this project will bring strength to the British economy
and relieve the pressure on rail lines, particularly the west coast
main line, which the Minister rightly identified as running at very
close to capacity, but it has nothing at all to do with the rhetoric
that he brought into the Statement about jobs and improving our economy
at the present time. The idea that the proposals contained in the
Statement, which, after all, refer to a project that will not be
completed for over a decade from now, will bring an enormous stimulus
to the economy and create jobs at present is quite erroneous. I rather
regret that the noble Earl has rightly emphasised that we welcome this.
Of course we will do our best in opposition and in government to see
the fulfilment of the project.</hs_para>

are concerned? It would certainly help with short-haul flights bringing
people into Heathrow if they could then travel speedily by train. That
would reduce the pressure on Heathrow for short-range flights and the
slots which they occupy, giving the airport, with its present colossal
problem, a chance to breathe. As the public know very well, every time
we have two or three inches of snow, as we have had recently, there is
a crisis at Heathrow because it is right up against the margins of

independent commission chaired by Sir Howard Davies to recommend
options for maintaining status as an international aviation hub. We

Bradshaw:</Member></B> My Lords, first, we thoroughly support the
recommendations. They are about capacity. However, you cannot talk
about capacity and ignore the freight dimension, and the freight

I want to talk about railway fares. We must be careful that we are not
building what will be described in the media as a “rich
man’s toy”. Is the Minister aware of recently published
research which says that British railway fares are in fact lower than
those in France, Germany and elsewhere on the near continent? Only
fares at the highest peak here are more expensive than in Europe. Will
the Minister contact the Rail Regulator and ATOC to see if we can stop
these very large increases, often in commuter fares, which are so far
above RPI plus one? Fares at 
<?notus-xml column=1341?>RPI plus nine are not uncommon. The next time fares are revised we
should attend to the fares basket, on which the fares are calculated,
so that people are hit less. Commuters in places such as Manchester and
Leeds have seen very little improvement to their services. They have
rotten rolling stock that should have been got rid of years ago, and
yet they are being called on to shoulder the burden of the investment
when it will be a long time before they see any
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:46:52"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:46:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

outside the railway industry is where the benefits lie. If you look at
Crossrail you will see already that the land and property values are

needs of freight. He is absolutely right, because one problem that we
face if we do nothing is running out of capacity on the west coast main
line for both passengers and freight. So it is a major driver that we
absolutely have to do this project to provide sufficient capacity for
freight, because there simply are not the train paths for people to put

transformation in the popularity of rail travel and the recognition of
the role that rail can play in our transportation has been little short

Leeds is opened? Otherwise, there might be a flight of investment
capital from developers who wonder whether points north of Manchester
and Leeds will actually be brought within the high-speed framework. The
solution to that problem is for a guarantee to be given that it will be
done in 2033, when Manchester and Leeds open. Secondly, I simply ask
for confirmation that there will be no reduction in the plans for
upgrading the east coast main line in the next 20 years, pending
completion of the second phase of
HS2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301284000196" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000196"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Attlee" PimsId="3822" UID="1301284000370" xid="1061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000370">Earl

Unfortunately, I cannot give the assurance that the noble Lord wants;
the date is too far away. However, I will take the point on board. My
noble friend also asked me about the upgrading of the east coast main
line. It is important to keep that line working properly, but of course
we are talking about something quite a long way ahead. I therefore
cannot give my noble friend any specific assurances, other than the key
one that the HS2 project will not divert resources from the

Grocott:</Member></B> Like other speakers, I warmly welcome the
Minister’s Statement. After all, in this country we built the
very first railways and exported the technology to build railways
across the world, although sadly in recent decades we have fallen
behind. This is a very positive—and for me,
exciting—development. I have two points to make from our
history. The Minister might find the first reassuring; the second is a
question.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1301284000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#1301284000198">The
first, reassuring point was made by a railway historian working at the
Ironbridge Gorge Museum in my former constituency. He helpfully
reminded me that many cartoons and sketches of the 1830s and 1840s
speak of cattle not producing milk, hunting and agricultural land
destroyed, and the picturesque nature of the English countryside lost
forever. I am sure that this is familiar to the House. We all
understand the objections that will inevitably come from people along
the line and I welcome the assurances that the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=1344?>has given about full consultation. However, in a relatively short period
of time, these railways became a treasured part of the

following less reassuring point to the Minister. This is an exciting
prospect of about 300 miles of railway—I have not added it all
up. The Victorians managed to construct thousands of miles of railway.
They did it with picks and shovels, and they managed to do it pretty
quickly. Is 2033 the earliest date we can talk about? I have always
wanted to live until I am 93, and this would give me an added
incentive, but surely it should be possible with JCBs and whatever else
modern technology offers to slightly improve on that

system of planning for these large infrastructure projects. However, as

it more certain that I will be in a position to do so. Secondly, will
he congratulate his right honourable friend in the other House on
producing a Statement that was as non-party political as possible,
because we need consensus? It did not refer to the fact that since
privatisation the use of the railway has increased enormously, and that

State in the other place made no financial and economic case at all for
the scheme. While I do not expect to be around in 22 years when the
scheme is meant to be finished, I am willing to bet that it will never
be completed, because the expenditure that is now stated for the cost
of the scheme will be inflated year on year, and ultimately a

as president of the Local Government Association, whose officers have,
as always, done brilliant work in preparing amendments for
the Bill, and as chair of the Hanover Housing Association, which is a
relevant interest for the amendments that now follow and relate to
affordable housing. These amendments begin with Amendment
55ZA, in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Tope, and continue
with those in the next six groupings. All of them address concerns
about the provisions in Clause 6, which allow developers to appeal to
the Secretary of State—that means to the Planning
Inspectorate—for a reduction in the level of affordable housing,
which the developer previously agreed to provide. This new right for
house developers would be activated if the local authority does not

debates on this new right for developers, I think it is necessary for
me to spell out why I believe this clause needs serious modification.
If I do this now, the Committee will be spared my making these points

groupings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:08:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012832000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#13012832000004">First,
developers have freely entered into legal agreements with local
authorities pledging that they will allocate a specified proportion of
the new homes that they build—perhaps 25% or 35%—to be
let or sold on a shared-ownership basis to those who cannot afford the
full market price. The developer has signed a deal which he believed
would deliver a good profit. In normal circumstances, the agreement,
under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990,
would have to be honoured if property prices turned out to be lower
than the developer had predicted. Equally, the local authority could
not amend the agreement if prices went up by more than expected and the
developer made a larger profit. For central government, using the
Planning Inspectorate to overrule the agreement 
<?notus-xml column=1347?>between the two parties in order to improve the profits for the
housebuilder would represent a retrospective intervention to change a
legal agreement freely entered into by two competent parties. I do not
think it has ever been suggested that Machiavellian local authorities
have hoodwinked innocent developers unfairly into signing Section 106
agreements. No, the developers thought they had a good deal and the
retrospective tearing up of a private contract by central Government
diktat would seem to set a sinister
precedent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:09:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question of fairness. To say the least, this clause is galling for
those would-be buyers of a site who were outbid by a
developer who, it now transpires, paid over the odds. The reason
housebuilders are now seeking to renegotiate the agreements they signed
is that they speculated on property prices rising inexorably, but now
find that their profit margins will be less than they hoped. In
outbidding others, including the many housing associations which have
been prevented from buying land by the exorbitant prices these
developers paid, they have taken a gamble which has not paid off. If
their rash behaviour means that with hindsight they should have paid
less for the land, is it fair on other more prudent housebuilders and
housing associations for the Government to bail them out? Is it fair
that Clause 6 should reward speculative developers by letting them off
their obligations to ensure that they can make a handsome profit from
the
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:10:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

argument that it is important to save a developer, even if he has acted
foolishly, from going out of business because we need to maintain the
capacity of the housebuilding industry through these difficult economic
times. However, while property prices have fallen in real terms in some
areas, particularly in Northern Ireland although it is not covered by
this measure, prices have seldom dropped dramatically, and in parts of
the London and the south-east, they have even continued to rise. Far
from going to the wall, a number of major housebuilders have recently
reported substantial annual profits and their share prices have risen
significantly. That does not suggest a need to make concessions to
prevent bankruptcies in the
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:11:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

importantly, we should scrutinise Clause 6 with great care because it
is likely to lead to a reduction in the amount of affordable housing at
a time when there are desperate shortages, fewer and fewer households
can afford to buy, and market rents are absorbing disproportionate
percentages of average incomes. Local authorities are already making
concessions in order to be helpful to developers, and if they have got
to the point of saying, “This far but no further”, they
have good reasons so to do. Section 106 agreements have been hugely
important in securing a high proportion of all the affordable housing
built over the past decade. These agreements have meant that the bulk
of social, subsidised housing, has no longer been built in separate,
segregated estates exclusively for the poorest and on the cheapest
sites. Rather, it has been integrated into mixed-income communities of
tenants, shared owners and owners. Backtracking on the gains for local
communities that have been achieved by planners through this route is
really bad news.</hs_para>

this element in a development was a key component in the planning
consent being granted in the first place. A block of flats in east
London with little or no affordable housing may be sold virtually in
its entirety to overseas investors and occupiers and will make little
contribution to supporting Londoners who need somewhere to live.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:12:23"></hs_TimeCode> rural areas
it is likely that local opposition to development was considerably
moderated because housebuilders signed up to some affordable housing on
the site so that local people who had been priced out of the housing
market could stay in the locality. I know that the rural case has been
addressed in relation to the special case of exception sites in the
government amendment we will consider with the Minister shortly, but I
am making the more general case about all developments in more rural
communities: take out the affordable housing ingredient and a
significant reason for both local authority and community approval for
housebuilding will be removed.</hs_para>

are the reasons why Clause 6 needs to be amended, and the first
amendment for consideration seeks to address the key argument against
my list of criticisms. This is the counter-argument that despite the
disadvantages I have set out, unless the developers in question are let
off all or part of their affordable housing obligation, they will
simply sit on their hands, do nothing and leave sites undeveloped. How

noble Lord has explained this amendment very fully. We are all too
familiar with sites all over the country where planning consent has
been given, somebody has come along a few months later and perhaps dug
a couple of holes, and that is a “material operation”
which satisfies the condition that the development shall have started.
However, particularly in the current climate, nothing then happens for
years and years. I have such sites in my boroughs. I look around the
Chamber and see people nodding—we are all familiar with that

amendment, or something very like it with the same purpose, would do
great service in strengthening the intentions here—I nearly said
the intentions of Clause 6, which is not quite right—to get
development moving and to start getting the building. We are not really
trying to start development here, we are trying to complete it.
Starting by digging a few holes in the ground achieves
nothing—what we want to see is the housing being built. Unless
we have a clause or amendment similar to this one, which requires
developers and local planning authorities to decide in advance what is
a “material operation” and what properly determines what
starts a development, which would mean a lot more than just a tiny bit
of infrastructure or my proverbial two holes in the ground—which
is not just proverbial, I know places where it is quite literally
that—then it is not going to be effective. The noble Lord, Lord
Best, mentioned that planning consents 
<?notus-xml column=1351?>already exist for 400,000 homes that have not been
started. No doubt on many of those sites there are those two holes in
the ground, but there is no sign of any homes materialising. If we had
this obligation as part of the requirements that will follow in Clause
6, that would serve, to a significant extent, to ensure not just the
starts but the much needed completions.</hs_para>

House have always had a very clear plot to avoid ever discussing. I
find it unacceptable that we should run our supported housing on the
basis that we tax people who need a house to pay for other people who

Governments of both parties have consistently spoken about this total
myth. The truth is that prices of homes in this country are greater for
first-time buyers than they would be if we did not tax them. It is

hypothecation when it suits it and against it when it does not, and
this is one of those occasions. The trouble is that hypothecation ought
to be between the payment of the bill and the advantages from the bill,
but in this case it is not that, and many of those who have to pay the
cost of Section 106 agreements are only just above the level of
benefiting from them. It is because this is a fundamental flaw in the

there is a big alteration that we ought to make if we really want
people to have housing, which is to say seriously that the cost should
not be a tax on a small number and those who are most vulnerable; the
cost should be a tax that we all bear for a proper social end. In case
the Opposition say that I am moving in their direction, I say that they
are as guilty as anyone else. They have imposed taxes in this area that
are just as large and always excuse it as a tax on the developer. The
developer does not pay taxes; he charges the cost to the people who buy
his houses. That is the nature of the market; there is no way of
avoiding it. I am very happy to support the drive of the amendment,

has taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the amendment. I am
glad that he has and the Committee should welcome an opportunity
briefly to debate Section 106, because it is an enormously important
factor in housing development in this country and the House is unlikely
to have another, foreseeable opportunity, either during the passage of

it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:33:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012832000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0001.htm#13012832000031">The
noble Lord, Lord Deben, argues, and I think that I can follow his
argument fairly clearly, that since there is clearly a cost for
developers in entering a Section 106 agreement, whether it is to build
affordable housing or to meet some other condition that may be imposed
by that agreement, that cost must be reflected in the price of the
houses that they sell and therefore be borne by those who buy those
houses, who happen to be a limited part of the population. I am sure
that that is the noble Lord’s argument—I am sure that he
will interrupt me if I have got it wrong. He leaves out an important
factor in the equation, which is that if there were no Section 106
agreements fewer houses would be built. Affordable houses are built and
receive planning consent only because of Section 106 agreements. If
more houses are built, there is a greater supply in relation to a given
demand, and that will be factor in the equation bringing down the
average price of housing, although not necessarily by the
same amount as the other factor in the equation brings it up. The noble
Lord should take that point into account if he is to try to design a
model for how the housing market
works<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:34:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:34:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012832000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000032">The
noble Lord, Lord Best, set out his amendment with great lucidity and
very persuasively—he of course knows a great deal about this
subject. I thoroughly agreed both with his analysis of the situation
and with his rather ingenious compromise solution, which we may well
want to adopt at this particular moment, having got as far as we have.
I deeply regret for two reasons that the Government have decided
retrospectively to waive Section 106 agreements. First, it will deprive
a lot of people of affordable housing. That is a very bad day’s
work. It is just the opposite of what we need in the present situation
and an extraordinary reflection of the Government’s priorities.
The noble Lord, Lord Deben, was concerned also about people who can
afford to buy a house which is not designated an affordable house. He
might dispense a little bit of his sympathy for those who could not
dream of buying a house which was not deliberately built to be an
affordable house and was in other words at the bottom end of the market
and a good deal cheaper than average houses in this country.</hs_para>

second reason why I regret what the Government have done is that it
seems to falsify to whole system of planning in this country. As I have
just explained, many Section 106 agreements result in land being
designated for development which otherwise would be not be so
designated. The local planning authority, 
<?notus-xml column=1354?>normally the local council, has quite rightly to make a choice, an
arbitrage, between considerations, on the one side, as to whether
giving planning consent for, let us say, development on green belt
areas or areas outside the existing curtilage of towns and villages
represents the loss of an environmental amenity, but, against that
negative public interest, as to whether there is a positive interest
which outweighs that, which in present circumstances is the need for
affordable housing. Therefore, the planning authority in the discharge
of its responsibilities has quite reasonably weighed those different
aspects of local communities’ interest and come out in that
particular direction. Now, of course, if the Section 106 obligations
are retrospectively withdrawn yet the development goes ahead, it
becomes no longer a balance but entirely a one-sided gift to the
developer and the community loses both ways. On the one side, it loses
through the loss of the land, the loss of the environmental benefit,
the loss of the amenity benefit and the visual impact of the
development, whatever that may be; on the other, it loses the benefits
of affordable housing or the other benefits of the Section 106
agreement which has been entered into. That is a doubly bad deal for
the local

County Council as the highways authority in order to finance the
southern bypass of Grantham. There was no way in the world that the
southern bypass was going to get into the then Government’s road

it could and was financed in that way. It took a long time and a lot of
negotiation, but it was well worth doing. However, it would have been
most extraordinary if, retrospectively, we had said to the developer

the planning consent, but you do not need to build a bypass any

that it is really everyone’s desire to see the spades
in the ground and housing being built. I was struck by a report in the
<I>Times</I> today about how over the next four years many people in
poorer categories will see their homes defaulted on because of their
inability to pay interest-only mortgages. Therefore, this already
difficult situation, with homeless people in this
country and people unable to get on the home ownership ladder, as the
noble Lord, Lord Deben, said a few moments ago, means that we have to
do all that we can to try to find space for affordable
housing. We must ensure that those who are in homes at the
moment will not have to renege on their mortgages and become
part of an issue that then has to be faced by local authorities because
they are under other obligations to find them temporary

think back to my own time as chairman of a housing committee in
Liverpool 30 years ago when we had vast amounts of derelict land and no
money at all to build large amounts of new municipal housing even if we
had wanted to. We came up with an innovative scheme at the time which
met some of the points that the noble Lord, Lord Deben, addressed in
his remarks. By retaining the ownership of the site—the
land—in the hands of the local authority, we were
able to pioneer the building of low-cost homes for sale in inner-city
Liverpool—the first that had been built there in virtually a
hundred years. Perhaps more importantly, we gave first priority for
those homes to people who were already in existing council properties.
This meant that, at the same time as encouraging people into home
ownership, we freed up their accommodation—at no cost to the
public purse—for people on the housing waiting list.
Perhaps, therefore, we should look at something along those lines for
first-time buyers and for existing council tenants, who would be able
to free up their properties and therefore not only stimulate the
building of new affordable housing but also create rented accommodation
for people currently on waiting
lists.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012832000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000042">The
other point I would like to make to the Minister concerns the issue of
integration. I agree with what my noble friend said about how,
particularly in rural 
<?notus-xml column=1356?>areas, it has been very good to have a mixture of
social housing alongside quite expensive housing. This has enabled
people to stay in communities from which they would
otherwise be driven. I think that many noble Lords from all sides of
your Lordships’ House will have seen how, in rural areas
especially, people have been driven away because they simply cannot
afford the cost of homes, which are often taken up as second homes by
people who live in cities or urban areas. Our first priority should be
to allow those people to stay in, and contribute to, their own
communities. Similarly, in urban areas, having a mixture of rented and
owner-occupied property ensures that we do not create the municipal
Bantustans that stretch facelessly and often aimlessly from the railway
lines to the cemetery, and which in the past have caused so many of the
social problems that we have to deal with

Burnett:</Member></B> My Lords, I remind the
Committee that we have been through, and probably are still in, the
most incredibly severe recession. It is an appalling recession and many
building companies have gone broke. They have gone into liquidation.
Unfortunately they and other companies have signed up to planning
agreements which, because such almost impossible burdens are
attached to them, sterilise the sites, development, and the ability to
build on them. This clause, the thrust of which I very much support,
recognises that fact, and some local authorities, to their credit,
recognise it because they are already renegotiating these planning
burdens. Local authorities recognise that they want some affordable
housing rather than none. The quid pro quo argument made by the noble
Lord, Lord Best, is well worthy of consideration as long as there are
reasonable time

thing that has not been mentioned sufficiently is that, even if you
renegotiate a planning permission, that takes a great deal of money,
time and effort. Let us get some planning done and let us get some
houses built. We are building only about 100,000 homes a year. We need
at least 200,000 a year. The noble Lord, Lord Deben, is absolutely
right. Let us try to remove some of these burdens and get builders
building again. There has been a fundamental change of economic
circumstances. That is what the clause is trying to deal with and that

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Deben,
made what Ministers are apt to call some interesting points, which
usually presages a disinclination to approve them. However, he did make
some interesting points, not least the thought that perhaps the
Treasury should revisit the issue of how significant housing projects
and more generally the construction industry, to take up the remarks of
the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, might be supported. However, the argument
of the noble Lord, Lord Deben, was too limited in some
ways<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:47:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012832000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000046">The
assumption throughout the noble Lord’s speech was that we are
talking exclusively about housing,  but Section 106 agreements
are not, of course, confined only to housing matters. Secondly, he
assumed that affordable housing schemes are for owner occupation. Of
course that is true of a greater proportion, but they are not
necessarily confined to owner occupation. There 
<?notus-xml column=1357?>is also a need—which is one of the reasons for these agreements
in any event, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, implied—for a mix
of tenure which would potentially ensure that there is a social mix
within the development. In addition, the noble Lord, Lord Deben,
implied that we are talking only about first-time buyers. I do not know
what the evidence is for that assertion. When new estates are built,
wherever that is, there are certainly a number of first-time buyers,
but equally there are people who are, as it were, trading up and who
are not necessarily first-time buyers. The position is not quite as
stark as he suggested.</hs_para>

follows that we need to be very clear about what the policy objectives
are. First, as everyone in this Committee and in the House generally
would confirm, we need to build more houses. Secondly, they should be
accessible, through one form of tenure or another, to a wide range of
people, not least in order to meet the desirable aim of having the kind
of social mix that would help avoid a divided society. There are
different ways of doing this. Clearly, Section 106 agreements can
facilitate matters, and we will debate that issue in greater detail
later. However, I recall in the 1970s, when there was a collapse in the
property market, that my local authority stepped in to buy up unsold
new private housing developments. That may have happened in other
places as well but I cannot say whether it did. They were taken into
the municipal stock. Subsequently, of course, under right-to-buy, they
virtually all left local authority ownership. However, this might be a
way of freeing up the industry; if not properties that are currently
built and standing empty, then at least local authorities or social
housing organisations taking a share of a development, thereby
providing initial purchases and helping to ensure that kind of
social
mix.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012832000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000048"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:49:47"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Greaves" PimsId="3545" UID="13012832000194" xid="1111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000194">Lord

follow the Minister’s suggestion that we do not range more

the value

planning permission and agreeing that they want their community to be
in a certain way, as a mixed community. An alternative might be to have
special taxes that you get from looking at the uplift in value from
planning permission—I will come back on that point—and
you might then have your national scheme. For as long as that does not
exist, you surely need to recognise that by agreeing to grant planning
permission the local community is giving value to the landowner and

has to take into account. One is: who pays that? I am merely saying
that in our present circumstances, when people find it very hard to
buy, first-time buyers and the rest of them are paying for that cost.
Secondly, we have a little difficulty here because to have the view
that planning permission is a privilege seems to be wholly against any
concept of the right to property, which says you can do exactly what
you like on it, if the community then decides that you are going to
have that restricted. The noble Lord is entering a very much deeper
philosophical discussion there. However, the crucial issue is: who pays
it? If the person who pays is the one at the bottom end of the scale,
as it very often is, we ought to ask whether it should be paid rather
more generally. That is

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> It seems to me that the value comes
from the granting of planning permission in respect of the land. If you

whole, not just the local community, surely you need mechanisms to get
that value raised and to redistribute it. You could not do it on the

point that I was going to make on the amendment. I recall that when I
first went on Luton Council, in the mid-1970s, we had something called
the Community Land Act, as I recall it, and the development land tax.
It was then very much the name of the game for developers to go and dig
a trench to demonstrate that they had started their development before
those provisions kicked in. Normally, there was a photograph taken with
somebody holding up a copy of the <I>Times</I>, or whatever, to

referred to the development land tax at Second Reading. It was a good
example of the fact that where you have prohibitively high rates of
taxation—I think the rate of development land tax was about
80%—it actually sterilised development so that building just did
not take place. That was the downturn to which I think the noble Lord,

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, we are back in the situation we were in
last time. I am not sure whether I am answering a Second Reading speech
that went totally away from the amendment, a clause stand part or just
something that everybody has made up around this amendment. While it
has not been made up, I think an opportunity has been taken to have a
very wide-ranging debate on the back of the amendment moved by the
noble Lord, Lord Best. He will understand that I was trying to confine
this debate to his amendment, although I realise now that that was
absolutely hopeless and was never going to happen.</hs_para>

philosophical aspect of our whole discussion, I will pin it immediately
to my thinking that everybody recognises that we desperately need to
build. We need to build housing in this country for several reasons.
The first, and most important, is that we have an awful lot of people
without homes. As my honourable friend at the other end, Nick Boles,
has pointed out, if we are not to have people in their 40s still living
with their parents and still unable to buy property in the near future,
we have to start building. Secondly, we are not going to jerk the
economy back into life if we do not jerk the construction
industry back into life. Those are two fundamental reasons
why we need to make sure that the growth of housing takes
place.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012832000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000061">There
are many elements to housing: housing for sale; housing that goes to
right-to-buy; housing for shared ownership; affordable housing; and
housing for rent. A great number of projects are all buried
within Section 106. Perhaps I could remind noble Lords that Section 106
is responsible for a very great proportion of the affordable housing
being built at the moment. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, said that we
were getting rid of that. We are not. In this clause we are not waiving
the requirement to build affordable housing. What is being said here,
and what we are recognising, is that negotiations which took place some
time ago when there was probably a very high market may now not be
viable because of the affordable housing element, which may be a very
large part of the Section 106 requirement.</hs_para>

that is, to look at that obligation to see whether it can be reduced to

viable, developers are not going to develop—and if they do not
develop, we can all wring our hands and talk about housing forever but
it will not be built. If a small reduction in affordable housing brings
that back into viability, it seems an exceptionally good reason to have
those discussions taking

friend Lord Deben set us off down an HS2 track, which I had not been
entirely expecting. As I understood his argument as he developed it, he
was actually totally against Section 106 in dealing with housing. He
was saying that this was a matter for the Treasury—a matter for
public funding—and not a matter for developers. He will forgive
me if I am wrong, and no doubt will take his moment to put that right.
Unless I am way down the wrong track, he will know, as I do, that the
Treasury will not now commit great waves of money to the development of
housing. There is already money going in from the Treasury, but not on
the basis of the 400,000 houses which are already in the pipeline. It
may be philosophical and it may be right or a good thought, but the
reality of the situation is that one of the only ways we are going to
get housing is through Section 106 agreements. That is right: it is a
charge on the developers—who are going to make, or are expecting
to make, a profit—and they should pay for that and pay something

context, we can look at Clause 6—when we actually get to
it—in a rounded way. Perhaps we can all agree across this House
that we want and need housing at all prices, but particularly for those
who are on lower incomes or first-time buyers—as my noble friend
Lord Deben said—and those who will never get on to a buying
ladder and will always need the support of social housing. There is a
big demand here for that. As for the point made by my noble friend Lord
Burnett, yes, part of the idea of renegotiating Section 106 is to bring
it into a form that will allow the developer economically to be able to
do this. I said that earlier on and do not want to repeat

noble Lord, Lord Beecham, is, of course, correct. Section 106 is not
entirely about affordable housing; it can spread pretty wide over the
elements. However, this clause deals only with affordable housing. It
is a quick, in-and-out clause where the developer can come and say,
“The affordable housing aspect of this particular Section 106
agreement actually means that I cannot start at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:02:37"></hs_TimeCode>”. The
amendment introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Best, could also mean that
they could not start. It is trying to ensure that where developers are

concerns set out by the noble Lord, I do not think that what he is

Government have also introduced a range of initiatives and financial
incentives, such as the Get Britain Building fund, to encourage local
authorities, communities and developers to start building. Local
planning authorities can also deal with the problem of uncompleted
development by issuing a completion notice. Where development has begun
but the local planning authority considers that there is no prospect of
it being completed within a reasonable time, the authority can notify
the developer that planning permission will cease—that is, they
will have to come back and start all over again and it may get
worse—unless the development is completed within a

Best:</Member></B> My Lords, I am deeply grateful to all noble Lords
who have joined in this debate. By covering a lot of the ground on this
now, we have saved time later. I will respond briefly to some of the
key points made. With regard to the powerful speech by the noble Lord,
Lord Deben, I have been discussing these things with Housing Ministers
and Planning Ministers for longer than I care to remember; it was the
noble Lord, Lord Waldegrave—then William Waldegrave, the
Planning Minister—who first introduced the idea of planning gain
paying for new housing development. I remember those
conversations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:09:28"></hs_TimeCode>.
It started in Docklands, where there was a need for local people to see
something for themselves when lots of new housing was being built that
was much more expensive than they could afford; from that came this way
of paying for affordable housing for a range of people.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012832000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000075">Perhaps it would be
better if one simply taxed more deeply the landowners, the house
builders and the occupiers, and put the money in a pot to pay for
affordable housing, but it would not then be produced in the way that
the noble Lord, Lord Alton, was commending—on sites that are now
a mix of owner-occupiers and people who are renting or in shared
ownership, which are socially very valuable. In a way, the way in which
planning gain operates is a tax, and there are really only three people
who can pay it. As the noble Lord, Lord Deben, suggests, the
purchaser—who may be a first-time buyer—will actually be
charged what the market can bear and the market is determined by the
85% of properties that change hands in the second-hand market rather
than those that are built new. The developer can charge only what the
market will bear, and the purchaser will look at other properties as
well. The purchaser is unlikely to see their price increase for that
reason.</hs_para>

landowner, where the tax finally lands, because there is a very wide
variation in the value of land for agricultural or other purposes 
<?notus-xml column=1363?>and land for development, and that is where the tax really has been

Lord Alton, talked about the social mix on decent sites, which is an
important part of Section 106. The noble Lords, Lord Beecham
and Lord McKenzie, were supportive, for which I am grateful. The noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, wondered whether this way of approaching the issue
would actually not work and one might require a different change to the
Town and Country Planning Act. The point of this amendment is that it
would enable a Section 106 voluntary agreement —yes, I agree,
with some pressure—to be made between two parties, and that
could specify the definition of what starting on site and getting going
would mean. That would not require legislation; you can put anything
into a Section 106 agreement. However, the inspectorate, in reducing
the amount of affordable housing, would make that conditional upon
agreement being reached about what it means to start on site. I think
that it could

the Minister is not minded at this time to go for an amendment of this
sort. She very properly applauds the way that Section 106 works and
accounts for a lot of affordable housing today. Like her, I approve
greatly of the work of Nick Boles, the Planning Minister, in
energetically trying to ensure that we build more homes, not just to
ease housing shortages but to help the wider economy. She brings some
reassurance that the community infrastructure levy provisions might
produce ways in which developers were obligated to get on with the job.
I am not sure whether that is going to be enough and I reserve my
position, but at this point I beg leave to withdraw the

housing obligation that is the cause of the project having stalled. We

and the housing that might be held up by this, but no real evidence of
the extent—if at all—to which this is caused by
affordable housing obligations, and our amendments seek to probe this.

Newcastle—I hope that it is going to appear on the ground as
opposed to being a rather subterranean task being discharged by the
contractors—will see 25% of houses being allegedly affordable at
the moment. Of that only a small proportion—10% or less of the
total—will be for rent. In the economy of my city and several
other places that strikes me as a rather low figure. Ironically the
development will start with the affordable homes rather than the others

that, while negotiation may take place, it might delay delivery because
negotiations might well be suspended until the Bill is enacted and
comes into force. It also points out the potential delays 
<?notus-xml column=1368?>with the appeals process and the like. It also refers to the fact that,

renegotiations and those which will follow under the government
amendments to Section 106 will have the potential to reduce the amount

That would clearly be something which I take it even the Government
would not wish to see, but may be an unintended consequence of what
they are doing. It would be helpful for the Minister to develop rather
more fully the Government’s view of what they mean by
“affordable housing” in terms of both tenure and price,
and how they will endeavour to secure it, given that what they propose
is—in the view of the Town and Country Planning Association, at
least—likely to lead to rather less affordable housing being

Greaves:</Member></B> The noble Lord makes some good points. I will put
a slightly different scenario to him and ask what he thinks. In an area
where development is difficult to get under way because it is not a
growing or economically buoyant area—I am obviously talking
about my own area—clearance took place under the old housing
market renewal scheme, so there are small brownfield sites. The council
will provide those brownfield sites for free to the main local social
housing landlord, the RSL which deals with the former council stock.
The intention was to build mixed developments of affordable housing on
there, some of which would be for sale and some for rent. However, when
you take into account free land, the cost of developing the site and
the rents which can be charged in a low-rent area over the next 30
years, as against the costs of developing and management during that
period or the price that would have to be charged for affordable
housing for sale, the figures just do not add up. Those sites remain
undeveloped because they are not affordable to the RSL under the
existing rules and regulations. Does the noble Lord have a
solution?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012832000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000104"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Beecham" PimsId="5821" UID="13012832000213" xid="2085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000213">Lord

economy as a whole. It is as good and necessary a time for that kind of
investment to take place, given low rates of interest in borrowing and
the need on the construction and housing sides. I think an element of
public subsidy would be desirable, but I emphasise that I am not

prior to April 2010. That was a point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham: voluntarily, before 2010, you could do that but the
regulations will make that part of legislation. These negotiations can
take time and be costly and complex, so we are also ensuring that there
is a rapid, focused mechanism for a review of the affordable housing
element only, where the viability of the scheme is at stake, with a
right of appeal to the Planning Inspectorate.</hs_para>

presents a real opportunity to stimulate local housing growth by

affect those affordable housing contributions that are planned on

developers cannot come back and suggest that they contribute less
affordable housing. However, the measure provides for adjusting
unattainable levels of affordable housing on unviable sites. Those
values may have been estimated during a high point in the market, and
we are clearly not there at the moment.</hs_para>

turn now to the amendments in this group. Amendments 55A and 55CD would
limit the life of the clause to those planning obligations in place at
the time of Royal Assent or three years after Royal Assent—this
is the sunset clause. I understand the arguments being made that the
intent of the clause is to address obligations made in different
economic circumstances. It is about giving developers the opportunity
to review affordable housing requirements and bring forward stalled
sites. The difficulty that I have with the amendment, which allows
applications in relation to existing obligations only, is that it
assumes that we are now in a period of stability in the market and that
any obligation made currently should not be challenged on the grounds
of viability because we know that all is well in the property market.
If we knew all the factors that were to be involved and
their impact on a developer’s viability—namely,
construction costs, sales values and borrowing costs—and if
those were certain and fixed for the foreseeable future, we
could focus on the past only. However, evidence from public
sources, such as the Office for Budget Responsibility, indicates that
we are not actually there yet. Evidence indicates varying performance
up and down the country. House price growth remains subdued across most
of the country. The recently announced 2.5% house price
increases in England were driven by a 5% rise in London and a 3%
increase in the south-east. Elsewhere across the country there is still
a wide variation in house price
growth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012832000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012832000120">There
remains uncertainty in the housing market. The Government continue to
provide strong support for housing growth—for example, the
NewBuy and FirstBuy schemes—and we are making progress. Net
additions are up 11%. Nevertheless, the wider market remains uncertain.
While transactions are up year on year, they are down around 47%
compared to pre-recession levels. So we do not yet have the certainty
that we would like on the housing market and associated
viability. The clause already includes, as noble Lords have said, a
provision to allow the Secretary of State to switch off the provision
by order. This has been drafted in a way that allows for a
judgment to be made at the appropriate time, based on the
state and stability of the housing market.</hs_para>

the life of the planning consent, even if they were originally granted
as a viable scheme. In practice, sites are not all going to be
identical. The noble Lord also asked why the £300 million given
by the Government for new affordable homes could not be used to
contribute towards the reduction of the affordable housing element. The
£300 million is a guarantee to deliver up to 15,000 new
affordable homes; that is above and beyond what there is. We will
publish further details of how the guarantee scheme will work. As part
of that, we are examining how social housing landlords will be able to
bid for it. So it does not really fit in with the measures that we are
talking about at the moment. We cannot make a blanket commitment to
fill the gap for aspirational affordable housing requirements with
grants in the event of a Section 106 agreement being negotiated.

the guarantee scheme and its associated capital grant funding. I expect

whether an equality impact assessment of this clause had been produced
and, if so, whether we could see a copy of it before Report. I did not
quite follow the rationale about the £300 million of additional
funding for affordable housing. The Minister said that it was for new
housing. If we are talking here about less housing than there otherwise
would have been, it seems to me that that itself is not a logical
reason not to be able to apply it to supplement Section 106 agreements,

come back on the cut-off point. As I understand it—and as I

April 2010, on the basis that agreements entered into after that point
would have recognised the current state of the market. If that logic
runs for that scenario, why does it not apply equally to consideration

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I can deal with the final point first.
As I have said a number of times, the clause is specifically about
affordable housing. It is perfectly up to local authorities, even at
the moment, voluntarily to renegotiate any aspect of Section 106
applications made before 2010. Regulations are coming out soon to make

aspects of Section 106 agreements may take quite a long time because
there may be a lot of elements. However, affordable housing ought to be
dealt with swiftly by the local authority or the Planning Inspectorate.
We want decisions on this that generate affordable housing. That is why
the issues have been separated; there is a single focus here. However,

link to Amendment 55BB and is concerned with circumstances where the
value of land on which planning consent has been granted with an
affordable housing requirement and where the land has increased in
value. If the requirement has not been met and the obligation not
fulfilled within two years, the amendment would enable the local
authority to initiate modifications to the obligation. The implication

requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:58:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
This is consistent with Amendment 55B of the noble Lord, Lord Best,

their sites, waiting for land values to
increase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:58:42"></hs_TimeCode>. This

when land values fall, why should the reverse not apply? We recognise

and down. It seems inconceivable that developers would want to
renegotiate affordable housing at the first chance, on the basis that
it might end up going up. They must produce a viability assessment to
prove that it has gone down. If the assessment does not prove that,
they go back to the original number. If they then rethink and decide to
have another go with the second application, at that stage, if the
local authority assesses that things have improved a lot it can require
an increase in the amount of affordable housing. From a
developer’s point of view, it is therefore a bit of a gamble to
come back a second time. We suspect that it is better to stick to the
original commitment and to get on with it. Regarding the equality

other aspects of such an agreement, such as contribution to transport

the community infrastructure levy itself. Therefore, if consideration

that in some circumstances it might be better to

or it could be thought in the light of viability studies that it is not
absolutely essential, but that it is a less undesirable penalty to
incur than having no or less affordable housing. There might be a
situation in which a Section 106 agreement required a contribution to a
local bus service. The way that local bus services are going at the
moment, with some county councils cutting subsidies, by the time the
estate is built, the bus service might not exist. It might be that that

seemed to me that some noble Lords speaking in this debate were
referring to a different world from that in which some of us are trying
to make the best of things. In the case of new housing
developments—greenfield housing developments in my part of the

general does not ask for affordable housing as part of the development,
because an affordable housing requirement would very quickly make that
development unviable. That is a fact of life. Local authorities in my
part of the world—we will debate an amendment on this
later—are finding it very difficult to set up a CIL regime,
because imposing CIL on developments would make them unviable.

for housing for sale or rent is simply not viable in present
conditions, even if the local authority has put the land into the

equation between local development costs and local house prices. The

6 introduces a fast-track application and appeal process to ensure that
quick decisions can be made on stalled sites. These amendments would
undermine this simplicity and add complexity, for very little benefit.
Amendments 55AC and 55AE seek to bring into the application process
consideration of the development plan and strategic policies contained
in it. The development plan will already have been taken into account
when the decision to grant planning permission was first made and the
development plan will presumably be the same at this stage as it was
then. I am aware that local planning policies may include policies for
the delivery of affordable housing to meet local needs. It is usual
practice to apply these policies in the context of individual site
viability. The effect of this clause is to help deliver those policies
by bringing forward viable development. It does not require a
revisiting of the local
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012838000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012838000019">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:24:03"></hs_TimeCode>
55AE seeks also to require an assessment of whether an alternative form
of development would be economically viable. This would tie the process
into lengthy consideration of alternative schemes. The effect of this
amendment would be to establish a complex and lengthy process and
clearly act as a deterrent to developers. Similarly, Amendment 55AC
seeks to prevent a determination to reduce affordable housing
requirements if modifications to other planning obligations would be
more appropriate. There is nothing to stop the local authority agreeing
to vary any obligation on a voluntary basis, as has been said a number
of times this evening. The authority could negotiate with the developer
to alter the Section 106 agreement outside the process of this
legislation if that would be beneficial to both parties. The purpose of
Clause 6 is to provide a quick, targeted review process based on
viability related to affordable housing only. The imminent regulation
change, which provides for a full review of Section 106 agreements in
pre-April 2010 obligations, will enable these older agreements to be
reviewed across the piece.</hs_para>

do not think it helpful to bring community infrastructure levy payments
into this consideration. The community infrastructure levy has been
introduced to provide a non-negotiable levy that is up front and

55AD seeks to require that the authority must assess the affordable
housing requirement to be the sole reason for the site being
economically unviable before it modifies the requirement. This
amendment is 
<?notus-xml column=1382?>not necessary. The current drafting requires that if the affordable
housing requirement means that the site is unviable, the council must
vary the obligation. The applicant will have to present evidence to the
authority to demonstrate this. The local authority
will have regard to this evidence and have the opportunity to prepare
its own evidence to justify any decision.</hs_para>

often comprises the largest single contribution on residential schemes,

55CA would allow land transferred at nil cost to be excluded from the
assessment of viability. I understand the importance that land
transfers of this type play in creating mixed communities. This is
particularly important in high-value areas. I can understand the
temptation to think that we should exclude land transfers from the
assessment of economic viability. However, the value of this land can
be a significant cost to house builders. It is right that the value of
this obligation is considered as part of the overall economic viability
of the scheme. If the value of that land transfer is causing the site
to be unviable, it should be adjusted; this does not necessarily mean
removed completely but adjusted to suit economic conditions. Only where
it is no longer viable to transfer the land at nil cost will an
adjustment be made. Our policy for mixed communities will be upheld and
delivered in a realistic and viable way by these clauses. With these
assurances, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012838000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012838000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tope" PimsId="4308" UID="13012838000038" xid="1468" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012838000038">Lord

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> I wish to raise a number of points and
to refer to the matter that the noble Lord has raised. I thought that
the current rule outside  
<?notus-xml column=1383?>these new provisions for affordable housing is that if a Section 106
agreement is not implemented within five years, there is a right of
appeal to the Secretary of State. I am not sure whether the same
criteria would have to apply to the Secretary of State in making a
determination of that appeal, but I thought that it was that process
which has been the subject of the parallel consultation. For example,
it had a cut-off point of April 2010. That may be wrong and no doubt
the Minister or her officials in the Box will tell me if that is the
case. However, I thought that that was the issue.</hs_para>

the issue of the local plan and development policies. No one is
suggesting that we need to revisit the local plan, but simply to ensure
that any change to the affordable housing requirement as a result of
these provisions is still consistent with the plan. That does not mean
revisiting it.</hs_para>

I may also come back on the issue of whether affordable housing is the
sole reason for a development not being economically viable. Are we
saying that if two reasons of broadly the same magnitude make a
development not viable, nevertheless it is right and just that it is
the affordable housing that is changed as a result? That does not seem
to be particularly logical or fair. If the affordable housing component
is the sole reason why a development is not viable, one can see how the
logic flows for what the clause provides. However, when it is not the
sole reason, why is it that only the affordable housing has to take the
hit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:32:09"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

the course of our debate that this clause relates only to affordable
housing. It relates to the developer saying that what is holding things
up and why he is not developing is that the affordable housing aspect,
for whatever reason, is making it unviable. Any other aspect of Section
106 can be negotiated with the local authority. A developer does not
have to do it. It is absolutely only the affordable housing

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> Perhaps I may press the point. I
understand that the clause is focused only on affordable housing and
changes and modifications to it, but if the reality is that the
assessment of viability shows that affordable housing and other things
are making the project not viable, you will nevertheless look to the
affordable housing component as that which has to take the hit and bear
the adjustment. I accept that everything else can be negotiated under
the current provisions, but if it is not solely the affordable housing
component, why is it that, to the exclusion of everything else in this

about. It concerns situations where it is believed that affordable
housing is causing the block. Every other aspect of Section 106 can be

can be given to other aspects, but it is only where affordable housing

raise an issue that I know vexes many in this House and puts
significant burdens both on British business and ordinary families. I
must declare my interests. I open my home in Berwickshire to the public
and I am a residual beneficiary of a banana plantation on St
Lucia.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012842000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000013">Air
passenger <hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:37:56"></hs_TimeCode>duty
has become an increasingly contentious issue over recent years and it
is worth reflecting on the reasons. When it was first introduced back
in 1994, the maximum that any passenger paid in air passenger taxes on
departing a UK airport was just £10, and for those flying short
haul it was half that. But, as is often the way with these things, once
a tax has been established it is almost impossible for the Treasury not
to resist the temptation to find ways to increase it—and what a
truly astounding increase we have seen. From that modest beginning, the
tax is now generating almost £3 billion each year for the
Treasury and costing passengers who pay the highest rate more than
£180 in tax alone for a single journey.</hs_para>

dramatic increases have been introduced in the past decade. In 2006, a
family of four flying to Florida paid £80 in APD—still a
significant additional cost on a summer vacation but nothing compared
with the £260 they now pay to fly to North America. That is an
increase of 225% in just six years. Following the Chancellor’s
Autumn Statement, we now have confirmation that APD is set to rise
again in April. I offer this example because it illustrates
just how rapid the increases have been and explains why
there is a growing concern about its impact not just on families, but
perhaps more importantly, on the UK’s business community.
Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence that points to the damage
the tax is having on jobs, growth and in various regions of the economy

that have already been expressed by other noble Lords in this debate.
In doing so, I declare an interest as president of the British Airline
Pilots Association. There can be very little doubt that the APD is an
important revenue raiser for the Chancellor and substituting it would
be an extremely difficult task. However, the rapid increases that have
taken place in recent years make the UK stick out like a sore thumb, in
the European airspace in particular, but rather more widely even than
that. At present levels, it is unfair and regressive. It is one-tenth
of the French level, and the Dutch have abolished this kind of duty at
Schiphol, which is perhaps the major competitor to Heathrow. As other
noble Lords have said, to fly to Australia via Amsterdam, which is a
very viable option for much of provincial Britain, could mean a saving
of about £85 in tourist class and more in the premium
classes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012842000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000038">Given
the other pressures that British aviation is under—particularly
the shortage of capacity at Heathrow, as confirmed again by the recent
snow, which demonstrates that the airport is always operating at the
margin—we are adding further, self-inflicted damage to ourselves

<?notus-xml column=1389?>with this tax and we risk losing ground against major competitors.
Airlines are being disadvantaged, and workers and employees of those
airlines are also at risk. I understand that the Flybe redundancies
that were announced just last week are being put down to the level of
this duty and its effect on the business, which has one or two more
marginal routes than perhaps some of the bigger airlines. I also
understand that AirAsia recently abandoned the Kuala Lumpur to Gatwick
route, citing the level of air passenger duty, as well they might. With
those figures, it is difficult to be
sceptical.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012842000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000039">Civil
aviation is a big British success story and we need big British success

major environmental impact, for reasons already expressed, and the
anomalies make it a very difficult tax to defend, except as a valuable
source of revenue. Justice demands that this tax is reviewed and that

I declare a non-pecuniary interest as president of the Caribbean
Council, which is not as exotic as the banana plantation of the noble

high commissioners, and we recently met many of the Tourism Ministers
from the Caribbean when they were in London. The unfairness of the APD
in general, and the Caribbean anomaly in particular, is top of the
agenda of all those meetings. The four bands, A to D, which have been
described by the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, are measured by the distance
to the capital of the country concerned, so because California is
nearer to Washington, the capital of the US, it is cheaper in APD terms
than the Caribbean, which is in the dearer band C. Travel to the
Caribbean is disproportionately costly, yet the Caribbean is the most
tourist-dependent region in the world; in Antigua and Barbuda, for
example, 74% of their GNP comes from tourism. The high APD
has resulted in British tourists choosing not to visit the Caribbean.
Between 2008 and 2011, there was more than a 10% decrease in

traffic

is the point of the Government putting an additional £22 million
into the GREAT campaign, announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

vastly outpaced inflation over the same period, which was 17%.
Non-economy visitors in band C from China or India—potentially
wealthy spenders—have seen APD increase by no less than 305%.
From Australia, it is even worse, with an increase of 360%. In overall
terms, the UK levies the highest level of APD of any country in the
world. Why is that? Britain’s aviation tax is now so high that
the Treasury will collect more than twice as much in passenger taxes in
2012—£2.5 billion—than the total of all other
European countries combined, which is £1.2 billion.</hs_para>

Irish Government acknowledged the negative impact of APD on their

Manchester Airports Group tells us that in 2010 AirAsia X dropped plans

Fowler:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord
Palmer, on promoting this debate and on his excellent speech. I make
one point, on the impact that air passenger duty has on jobs. All
parties are agreed that it is a national priority to bring more people
into employment, but we seem to be set on a policy with APD that
destroys jobs, not creates them. I declare an interest as a
non-executive director of ABTA, but also a past interest as Secretary
of State for Employment. When I did that job, tourism was in the brief.
My noble friend Lord Lee, who has just spoken, was my excellent Tourism
Minister. The reason that tourism was in the Department of Employment
was that it had one of the greatest potentials for creating
jobs—and still does, particularly for young people.</hs_para>

tourism creates jobs, but so too, and this is often forgotten, does
outbound tourism—the travel companies in the high street, the
big internet companies and the aviation industry that is the transport
carrier. We would be mad to turn our back on this source of employment.
Yet that is precisely what we are doing. By piling more cost on the
traveller, we deter people from coming to this country and at the same
time price out many people who want to take a holiday abroad. We also
hit the aviation industry and business itself. We seem to forget that
we are in a competitive international market. There is an increasing
demand for travel, which will come from countries
such as China, Brazil and India, but it would be all too easy to price
ourselves out of the market and lose jobs as a
result<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012842000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000050">Britain
currently has the highest air taxation of all European Union and G20

Treasury will collect more than twice as much in passenger taxes in

interesting is that in 2009 the Netherlands followed 
<?notus-xml column=1392?>Belgium by abandoning its equivalent to APD because, although it raised
the equivalent of £266 million in one year, the Dutch calculated
that the loss to the wider economy from the tax was more than
£950 million. So I entirely agree with all those in

APD. My view is also that this needs to be done quickly, before more

Morris of Handsworth:</Member></B> My Lords, on behalf of the humble
and proud people of the Caribbean region, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Palmer, for securing this important debate. As someone born in Jamaica,
I have more than a passing interest in this debate, which I declare. I
will therefore address my remarks not to the APD tax in general, but to
its specific impact on the Caribbean region. However, let me make it
clear from the outset that the Governments and people of the Caribbean
region do not seek favours from the Government. All they seek is
fairness. As we have heard, APD was introduced in 1994. It was argued
then that the duty would make a contribution to the overall cost of
carbon emissions. It was a green tax. So let me say why the current
banding system is unfair and offer a few words about its impact on the
economies of the
Caribbean<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:05:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012842000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000052">As
we have heard, the tax was originally introduced as a flat-rate charge
for flights, but in 2009 it was changed to a four-band system,
calculated on the distance between the capital city of the
country of departure and the capital city of the country of
destination. Let me remind the House of the anomalies of the banding
system, which have already been given in this debate. Caribbean
capitals, which are just over 4,000 miles from London, are in band C.
The capital of the USA and London are less than 4,000 miles apart;
consequently, every city in the United States is in band B. That
includes Los Angeles, which is more than 5,300 miles from London and
1,300 miles further than any Caribbean-location flight—hardly a
green tax.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012842000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000053">The
outcome of the rebanding means that the APD cost for a family of four
flying to the Caribbean is £324. As we have already heard, for
an equivalent family flying to the US it is £260. This
unfairness will get worse when the inflationary increases announced in
the 2012 Budget are introduced. They will not be applied evenly, which
emphasises that the APD structure has no logic and discriminates
against long-haul flights, particularly to the Caribbean region. The
Governments of the Caribbean do not seek to challenge the right of the
UK Government to impose this tax. What they seek is an equitable
structure, a level playing field and a fair application of the
tax.</hs_para>

cannot be fair that the banding system discriminates against the
Caribbean, the most tourism-dependent region in the world. It is not
fair that the APD banding system favours the United States, which is a
competitor destination. It cannot be fair that the UK takes no account
of the impact that the tax has on the Caribbean economies which are
still in transition towards being service-based economies. It is not
fair, as suggested, that the APD will now be increased annually by the 
<?notus-xml column=1393?>rate of inflation. Let us be clear: this is not a tax without
victims. Data from the CAA make it clear that there
was a 10.7% decrease in passenger traffic between the UK and countries
in the Caribbean region. This is having a devastating effect on local
economies, but it is not just having an effect abroad; it is having an
effect here, at home, particularly among people in the aviation
industry.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I join all other noble Lords in thanking
the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, for securing this debate. I should perhaps
declare a former interest as a former adviser to the Caribbean Banana
Exporters Association. In addition, until I took this job, I was a
regular traveller to the Caribbean in connection with the Sport for

acknowledging the important contribution that the aviation and tourism
industries make to the economy. The United Kingdom’s aviation
sector connects millions of consumers and businesses with international
markets. The five airports that serve London offer at least weekly
direct services to more than 360 destinations worldwide. That is more
than Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam. Overall, the United Kingdom has the
third-largest aviation network in the world, after the United States of
America and China.</hs_para>

fifth-biggest industry and our third-highest export earner, worth
around £116 billion to the economy, or roughly 9% of GDP.
Despite the tough economic conditions, the UK’s tourism sector
is growing at around 3% per year. As the noble Lord, Lord Lee, pointed
out, we are seeking to promote  
<?notus-xml column=1396?>tourism as part of the GREAT campaign—one of the most ambitious
and far-reaching marketing campaigns ever undertaken by the UK. We have
also, as he mentioned, made changes to the rules for Chinese visitors
to make it easier for them to obtain visas for travelling to the
UK.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012842000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000074">Turning
to APD itself, I would like to reiterate some of the history, which I
know a number of noble Lords have already done to a certain extent. APD
was introduced in 1994 as a pure revenue-raising tax. It was introduced
in recognition of the fact that air travel was otherwise undertaxed
compared to other sectors of the economy. Air travel is zero-rated for
VAT, and the fuel used in air travel and in nearly all domestic flights
is entirely free of tax. The initial rates of the duty were £5
for flights to destinations within the European Economic Area, and
£10 for flights to other
destinations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012842000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000075">In
2008, the previous Government announced a restructuring of APD,
increasing the number of bands from two to four. The reason given was
that this would improve the environmental signal given by the tax. As a
result of that restructuring, the highest rate was increased to
£170. These changes were enacted in the final Finance Act before
the 2010
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012842000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000076">In
the period since the election, the Government have limited increases in
air passenger duty to inflation only. During this time, rates have
increased by only £1 for the majority of passengers.
Budget 2012 set out rates from April 2013, which will also rise only by
inflation. The real burden of the duty will therefore remain unchanged
for at least a further year. Therefore, the fears of the BCC are,
frankly, greatly
exaggerated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012842000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000077">I
will respond to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord
M<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:23:10"></hs_TimeCode>onks, that this
is a regressive tax. This is not a regressive tax. In terms of its
impact on deciles of income-earners, households in the highest decile
pay more passenger duty as a proportion of their income than those in
the bottom income decile. As the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, pointed out,
to improve the fairness of the tax overall the Budget 2012 also
confirmed the extension of air passenger duty to business jets from
April this year.</hs_para>

by virtually all speakers—I suspect it was every
speaker—about the impact of APD on the competitiveness of the
United Kingdom. There have been widespread calls for a cut in the level
of the tax or for its abolition. The noble Lord, Lord Palmer, was kind
enough to mention my interest in cricket. My boyhood cricketing hero
was Geoffrey Boycott. I hope that the noble Lord will not be too
disappointed if I proceed more in the manner of Boycott playing an
innings on a troublesome Headingley wicket than Brian Lara at the
Antigua Recreation Ground.</hs_para>

Government’s view is that there can be a sustainable platform
for economic growth only if we are willing to tackle our overspending.
Demands for cuts in air passenger duty must therefore be balanced
against the Government’s general revenue requirement and the
need for a fair contribution from the sector towards reducing the
deficit. Air passenger duty is forecast to raise about
£2.9 billion in 2013-14. This revenue is essential if we are to
maintain progress toward our 
<?notus-xml column=1397?>goal of deficit reduction. If APD were reduced or abolished, other taxes
would have to be increased or public expenditure cut by an equivalent
amount.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012842000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0002.htm#13012842000080">The
noble Lord, Lord Palmer, and many other noble Lords have asked the
Treasury to undertake a study into the macroeconomic impact of air
passenger duty. The Treasury keeps all taxes under review and considers
them in the round. This is not the only tax that many people would like
to see abolished. In fact, it is almost impossible to find a tax whose
abolition would not be cheered to the rafters, so the fact that people
would like this tax abolished is not in itself a good reason to abolish
it. I am afraid that I must reiterate the context in which
we are working. Our central goal as a Government remains tackling the
fiscal deficit. This requires the aviation sector to make a fair
contribution, which is what we believe APD
does<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T20:26:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Caribbean, there have been strong arguments presented tonight and over
the years about the effect of APD there. I am aware of the strength of
the arguments because in a former existence I made them myself. In
response to these arguments, changes to the structure of APD were
considered as part of the 2011 consultation. For a number of reasons,
it proved much more difficult to do it than appeared at first sight.
One of the main challenges is that if you adopt the pure principle of a
distance-based tax, it would be seen—
bizarrely, in my view—as a proxy to taxing
fuel. That would be illegal under the Chicago Convention on
international aviation, so the Government looked at a rather simpler
restructuring. However, they found that the only way they could have
done it that would have dealt with the disparity of treatment between
the US and the Caribbean would have required an increase in the duty
for about 90 per cent of passengers, including 
<?notus-xml column=1398?>those flying to Europe and the USA. The Government felt that, in the

that, when push comes to shove, there would be much agreement to
designate anywhere as its capital. I am not sure whether you can
designate somewhere as a capital for one purpose but not a capital for
every other purpose. However, it is a new suggestion; I will certainly

discussions, I do not see any great merit here and now in delving into
the RICS draft guidance note on financial viability and where that
might lead us. The particular purpose of this amendment is to see that
there is some parliamentary process which sets out the framework for
the criteria rather than just guidance—I think guidance is the
preferred choice of the Liberal Democrat

will leave it there tonight but it would be extremely important to have

to divide viability among the various components and what that means.

to prioritise brownfield, formerly developed and regeneration sites

Prisk MP, the relevant Minister. It did not distinguish between general
viability issues and those that might have been occasioned by the

Viability can of course be called into question. There is a variety of
problems, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has just mentioned. They
might particularly relate to buying at the top of the market and
finding that land and other values have fallen since. That makes the
problem of viability clear, but there could be other factors as well.
If we are moving towards a position where guidance is to be given on
viability after the consultation that has already been referred to, it

exception sites are unique in that they are not allocated sites. They
come forward when a landowner is willing to provide land to enable
housing for local people to be built. They are sites, often in
sensitive locations, where housing would not normally be permitted.
Rural exception sites do not operate in a
competitive land market. Landowners provide land at generally low
value, with no expectation of market values or high levels of return.
Planning obligations are used to secure the housing for local people.
Clause 6 would introduce a risk of unsettling the practice of rural
exception housing by introducing the possibility of a challenge to the
planning obligation. I am concerned that this could prevent sites
coming forward in the future. I hope that noble Lords will
welcome the exemption that we are providing and I beg to
move.</hs_para>

Cameron of Dillington:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I could ask a
question about this amendment. It seems to me that one of the
underlying concepts behind Clause 6 is that some affordable housing is
better than none. In my opinion, that concept applies in
spades, as it were, in rural areas and
villages. In the current economic circumstances I worry about the
ability to build rural affordable housing on exception sites. Of
course, in large-scale developments, the affordable housing element is
calculated at nil return to the developer and the landowner, but it is
hoped that the remaining houses will provide the landowner and
developer with a reasonable profit. In addition, non-affordable and
affordable houses will be provided to house buyers. Therefore, the
scheme goes ahead, operates and both sorts of houses are
provided.</hs_para>

none of that applies in a village scheme of, say, six affordable
houses. Often, everything is staked against you. It requires public
funding—some of the £300 million, I hope—or
charitable or semi-charitable funding to make it happen, as well
as, usually, a generous landowner who often gives up what he
or she sees as potential future “hope value” land to make
these projects happen. However, it is not unknown for housing
departments, housing providers—RSLs or whatever—planning
departments and landowners to do a deal whereby planning permission is
given for full-market houses on the exception site or nearby land to
ensure the release of the land for affordable housing. Funding or
part-funding may even be provided for these small

guard against the developer obtaining an unjustified windfall gain
where estimates of future sale prices, on which the inspectorate has
judged the viability of the scheme and decided to sanction a reduction

amendment would mean a clawback, or so-called overage payment, to the
local authority of a portion of the sales proceeds above the predicted
levels. It seems only fair that if developers are to benefit from
Clause 6 where prices have fallen, that they share their extra profits
if, in fact, prices are better than feared. We have already aired
Amendment 55F very fully in combination with Amendment 55ZA, and it
goes to the heart of the matter. It would ensure that society gets at

Cameron of Dillington:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak to two of
these amendments. First, I cannot support Amendment 55EA. It has a mild
whiff of retrospective taxation which I do not approve of. More
importantly, it fails to understand the motivation of an entrepreneur,
and his or her assessment of risk. If a particular project is marginal,
then the developer does their own assessment of the upside and downside
risk. They will proceed only if they personally believe that the upside
returns are sufficient to justify the downside risks. If the upside is
threatened, as seems to be the case in this amendment, and only the
downside risk remains, I do not believe that they will proceed. In that
case, one nullifies the whole purpose of this
clause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012843000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0003.htm#13012843000028">Furthermore,
it occurs to me that if the local authority wants to share in the

below the estimated figure. In other words, it seems only fair that if
it is going to share in the upside, it might also share in the risk.

move on to Amendment 55F. At the risk of being boringly obvious, this
surely underlines the whole purpose of the clause and it is amazing
that it has been omitted. We are urgently trying to promote
infrastructure development and to prevent any further delays at a time
when we might be entering a triple-dip recession. Housing development,
as we are all aware, is very good for kick-starting our economy. It
employs a local workforce, and to a large extent uses UK raw materials,
while clearly performing a social good. In fact, the House Builders
Federation claims that every £1 spent on housing puts £3
back into the economy, and that increasing housebuilding by 130,000
units per year, which is the Government’s projected level, could
create 195,000 direct jobs and 400,000 in the supply chain. We want
housebuilders to get on with it. I therefore cannot see the point of
renegotiating affordable housing demands if there is not going to be a
quid pro quo whereby the house developer has to get on with the
development and build now. Otherwise, they are going to renegotiate and
wait for the market to
recover.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_28_PT_1/8F39B2A8B3FC3656752949F1FCB38B5648090927" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 January 2013">Monday,

believe that the clause already provides incentives for the developer
to get on and build. Where the Planning Inspectorate issues an appeal
decision in these cases, the revised affordable housing requirement is
only valid for three years. Any part of the development which has not
been commenced in that time will be subject to the original affordable
housing requirement. One way or another, the original affordable
housing requirement has to be dealt with within that timescale. We must
give developers a reasonable amount of time to get on site. Following
an appeal decision, the developer may need more time to begin
development for legitimate reasons, such as compliance with
pre-commencement conditions or securing vacant possession of the
property. For more complex schemes, a limited time period to get on
site would mean that the whole reassessment of viability could be
wasted. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T21:07:45"></hs_TimeCode> must

principle, Section 106 is intended to be a mechanism by which
development is made acceptable in planning terms. The amendment appears
to introduce a wider purpose for Section 106, related to profit rather
than mitigating the impact of development. I would be extremely

making 
<?notus-xml column=1407?>their own judgments as to whether there should be some
incentive within the revised agreement to start
development, such as an improved affordable housing provision, if
market conditions rise. The only constraint on the local authority is
that the outcome should not be more onerous than the original
obligation. In the event of an appeal, local authority proposals for
such flexibilities could be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate as
evidence. We will be clear in guidance that such evidence is
appropriate. Again, I see this as a matter for local discretion,
depending on site circumstances. We will be ensuring that guidance on
this matter is included in our statutory viability guidance which, as I

we will let you off and allow you to break the contract you have
already signed with the local authority. You will be let off the

at the time that the inspector provides their judgment, saying,
“Less affordable housing, but, if I am wrong in my predictions
and prices rise, then we will have some more affordable housing
later”. It must not be any better than the original deal,
however. That would be a fair way of handling the unforeseeable
circumstances of when properties are actually sold in the future as

move the amendment because I recognise that affordable housing,
particularly in London, is of crucial importance to the role of
strategic planning. It is largely central to it and a very high
priority for past, present and, I hope, future mayors. I make the same
case as I did the other day in Committee on another amendment. The
Mayor of London has been given that responsibility by Parliament. He
has been elected by the people of London. He is publicly accountable,
first of all to the London Assembly, which is elected by the people of
London, and also accountable—in a fairly high profile way, which
will always be the case whoever the officeholder is—to the
people of London. That must be more appropriate, better and certainly
more in tune with localism than giving the responsibility to an
unelected, unaccountable body, which is unversed, as yet, in this work,
elsewhere in the

making its judgments and decisions with knowledge and will be able to
hear, and take proper account of, all arguments put forward both in the
local context and in the strategic planning context for the whole
capital. That seems to be entirely appropriate for an elected mayor
with a strategic planning role. There is really no need at all to
involve the Planning Inspectorate, which is based elsewhere and does
not have either the knowledge or the accountability to carry out that

moving amendments in Grand Committee about copyright so it is
pleasurable to come back to a rather more familiar scene. I do not
think that I can add very much to what my noble friend has said. He has
put the case extremely well. The centre of the case is that the mayor
is there and has these powers accorded to him by Parliament. It seems
very strange that he should have no function in relation to this
important matter. Affordable housing in London is enormously important,
as I think my noble friend on the Front Bench will acknowledge. From
his own knowledge, he will be well aware of the need to find proper
housing for people who cannot afford to go out into the market. The
mayor has this overall responsibility. Why should he not be entitled to
have this role rather than it going to the inspectorate in Bristol? I

I have listened carefully to my noble friend Lord Tope. There are cases
where the mayor has a formal role in determining the planning

certainly see that there is an argument that, in certain specific

the Treasury. Unfortunately, I was not allowed a supplementary. Of
course it is a matter for the Treasury; some would say that that is the
whole problem. But it is still the responsibility of the
Minister’s department and all of us who support this
Government —and of those who do not support
them—to take the measures that would enable housebuilding to get
under way. This is certainly not the only measure but it is a single
measure that would make an enormous difference. If authorities were
still governed by all the prudential rules in the same way as normal,
they would still have to act responsibly, but if they were able to
borrow against their housing stock, it would make a significant
difference. It would get housebuilding moving on a greater scale. I

repaid out of rents. It is not frightening to overseas investors and
bankers to see another £7.4 billion, which is the amount
estimated by the report <I>Let’s Get Building</I>, produced by
John Perry from the Chartered Institute of Housing. Over a period of

just about providing decent homes for people. The boost to the economy
is surely well understood, as is the strong multiplier effect on GDP of
construction and the boost to employment. Given the grim GDP figures
delivered last Friday, this could not be more urgent. The need to boost
construction and build more social housing is clear. The
<I>Let’s Get Building</I> report also lays out why councils,
together with ALMOs, are particularly well placed to play a role,
especially in using their land assets, and to link it in with their
apprenticeship and work experience scheme. Do the Government accept

out, the revenue costs and savings of an expanded council new build
programme are complex and depend on such factors as whether a grant
from the HCA would be needed, the extent to which council tenants would
require housing benefit—or universal credit in future—and
the prior housing status of new tenants. To the extent that additional
council housing reduces demand for supporting people in the private
rented sector or temporary accommodation, there is a potential saving
for the Government. Additional build also provides an opportunity to
get a better

underoccupation.</hs_para>

issue is borrowing. It is accepted that, under current rules,
additional borrowing by councils will form part of public sector debt,
notwithstanding that it will be effectively financed out of rental
income. There may be arguments about recasting the treatment of that
debt, but they are probably not for us today. As we have heard, the
<I>Let’s Get Building</I> report proposes that additional
borrowing of some £7 billion over five years would
facilitate  the provision of 60,000 additional homes, although
the amendment does not call for this. It calls for the housing cap to
be removed. Even if the Government were not minded to support the
amendment, would they at least be minded to raise the level of the cap?
Have they given recent consideration to this? The Minister will
doubtless tell us that there is existing headroom of some £2.8
billion, but this is not evenly
distributed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012852000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0003.htm#13012852000062">It
is worth putting these borrowing numbers into context. According to the
December OBR report, the forecast for debt at the end of this March is
£1.2 trillion. Moreover, the forecast increased by
£27 billion between March and December last year. Given the
upside that it could bring to GDP growth, £7 billion over five
years would not seem of itself to be critical to our chances of hanging
on to our AAA rating—whatever they may be—or to the
Government’s chances of meeting their fiscal rules. That
£7 billion over five years is within the margin of standard
statistical error for public borrowing figures. As for removing the cap
entirely, the evidence from CIPFA is that the introduction of
prudential borrowing for councils in 2004 has been a complete success
and that borrowing levels have remained modest and prudent. Total local
government borrowing is in the order of some £81
billion.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012852000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0003.htm#13012852000063">The

the reply. Perhaps I should make clear that I do not have a direct line
to the Chancellor: my references were really only to what we can all
see, read and hear in the public media. There are calls not least from
the Mayor of London—who seems to have found favour
again—to increase investment, and that would inevitably mean
some borrowing. The borrowing we are talking about is very much
prudential borrowing, in all meanings of that word. Without question,
this issue is going to continue. I hope we will see some movement, but
it will not continue further tonight. I beg leave to withdraw the

Its purpose is to probe further into the future of planning
obligations, and particularly the future of Section 106 agreements and
their relationship to the community infrastructure levy, otherwise
known as CIL. I am aware that I am continuing with what I said when the
CIL regulations came out in 2010 and probably going even further back
to the Planning Act

a probing amendment about incredibly obscure and esoteric things. I
apologise to members of the Committee for introducing them at this time
of night but I think they are important. I have attempted to understand
the position but I cannot. That may be due to a lack of information, a
lack of understanding or even a lack of intelligence on my part. If I
cannot understand, I hope that the Minister can explain what is going
to happen so that at least we can assess whether it will be
satisfactory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012852000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0003.htm#13012852000076">The
future of Section 106 comes from paragraphs 122 and 123 of the CIL
regulations 2010. They come from concerns that in some areas the
substantial transfer of planning obligations to CIL from Section 106
will not be satisfactory, not least because CIL itself will not yield
very much, if anything at all. It is perhaps a minor pending disaster
in those parts of the country which are not very prosperous, where
property and land values are not very high, and CIL levies may not be
possible at all.</hs_para>

questions for the Minister which I will put on record. I am quite happy
for replies to these in writing because they are fairly technical,
although they may just show my lack of understanding. After April 2014,
how will the five-project limit work? Is it the same for large
authorities and small ones? What type of project will be allowed for
Section 106 obligations after April 2014 and how will they vary from
what they are now? Do these restrictions cover all Section
106 agreements and do we assume that the council concerned has agreed
to and has examined a CIL scheme? What is the position if a CIL scheme
has not been agreed to, as in certain financial environments in less
prosperous areas it may simply be impracticable? My advice is that in
areas such as east Lancashire, it is not likely to be possible within
the next four years.</hs_para>

which we have discussed in the Committee today, affect all this? Does
all this have any relationship at all to the Section 106 affordable
housing agreements, and that whole agenda we have been talking about?
What is the definition of infrastructure? Are there other Section 106
possibilities connected to an application that are neither housing nor
infrastructure? When we discussed this earlier, the Minister said that
not all authorities have yet got CIL schemes in place. It would be
interesting to know what proportion of authorities already have CIL
schemes in place, where they are, and, therefore, which authorities do
not  have them.</hs_para>

complicated, and that may be because I do not understand it. It may all

much broader use of Section 106. These statutory tests were introduced
by the previous Government. Their purpose was to scale back the use of
Section 106 so that it must be necessary, proportionate and directly

mitigate the impact of developments and no

second purpose was to ensure that Section 106 could operate alongside
the community infrastructure levy in a fair way. I remind the House
that the community infrastructure levy was brought in to provide a
transparent, non-negotiable and fair charge, addressing many of the
concerns around the operation of Section 106. At this late hour, I will
write on the specific question my noble friend raised about how many
local authorities are already within this. Of course, as the noble

be the Government’s preferred mechanism for collecting
contributions to infrastructure. The scale-back of Section 106 sits
alongside the roll out of the levy and prevents developers being
charged twice for the same item of infrastructure. The effect of this
new clause would undermine this, causing a dual system, which would
serve to confuse; I am sure that that was not my noble friend’s
intention. We therefore do not support the inclusion of this new clause
which would undermine the progress that we are making with the
community infrastructure levy. I hope that my noble friend is willing

an important question. There are parts of the country that CIL is
really designed for. Where there are developments which are clearly
profitable, even in the present financial circumstances, then CIL will
work. In parts of the country, even on the best sites that may be
available through the planning system, the imposition of CIL will make
the developments unprofitable and unviable. That is the problem. If you
do away with Section 106 on the one hand but you cannot impose CIL on
the other, there is nothing left. That is the stark problem that is

I respond specifically to the amendments in detail, it might help the
Committee if I set out briefly what Clause 7 is intended to do. Local
authorities have wide powers to acquire, appropriate and dispose of
land. The main constraint on disposals of land is that if an authority
wishes to dispose of land at less than the best consideration
reasonably obtainable, it must obtain the consent of the Secretary of
State. In order to avoid having to give decisions on minor disposals,
the Secretary of State has the power to give general consents for
specified classes of disposal for housing land and other land not held
for planning purposes. However, there is no power under Section 233 of
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to give a general consent for
the disposal of land held for planning purposes at less than best
consideration. So local authorities must apply to the Secretary of
State each time such consent is required.</hs_para>

remind the Committee that this clause had the support of all parties in
the other place. The shadow Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government stated at Second Reading in the other place that the
clause was sensible—I am sure that he did not say that about
other clauses—and he supported the removal of the anomaly on
disposal of land for less than best
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012852000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0003.htm#13012852000093">Amendment
57B will stop the power of having a general disposal consent by
preventing consent being given for a particular class of disposals.
Perhaps I may illustrate this by reference to the general disposal
consent under the Local Government Act 1972 for all land not held for
housing or planning purposes. The class of disposal in that consent is
all those disposals where the difference in value between the open
market value and the selling price is less than £2 million,
subject to certain
conditions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012852000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0003.htm#13012852000094">Amendment
57C will also wreck the point of having a consent by preventing it
applying to local authorities generally or those of a
particular class. I do not want to anticipate how a new
general consent might be worded but I might speculate that the
Government would want to give consent under this new provision to all
local planning authorities, or all authorities to which
Section 233 of the 1990 Act applies. Amendment
57C would prevent
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012852000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-0003.htm#13012852000095">My noble

Subsection (3) adds a new subsection (9) to Section 233 to
directly apply the protection set out in Section 128(2) of the 1972
Act. I am sure that that is clear but I will nevertheless continue to
explain. The protection set out in Section 29 of the Town and Country

relaxation of the terms and application of copyright, and some of those
arguments are reflected in the Bill. We are faced with the need to
reconcile legitimate open access with the essential protection of the

of a simplification, but we will have ample opportunity to explore that

us have had the privilege of listening to people from the IPO in the

efficient registration body for the registration of IP rights, but it
is not and never has purported to be a champion of IP. On the contrary,
it sees its role as holding the balance between creators and users.

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak first to Amendment
28C and then to my own Amendment 28D. I support the
amendment proposing a director-general of intellectual property rights,
put forward so eloquently by my noble friend Lord Jenkin. I was
extremely interested to hear about his Scottish connections, his
great-grandfather and his relationship with Kelvin. There was a
programme recently on the BBC about innovation that described how
Matthew Boulton, James 
<?notus-xml column=405?>Watt's partner, succeeded in making sure that Watt derived benefit from
his inventions and the modifications that he made to the Newcomen
engine<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:47:40"></hs_TimeCode>. It must
be one of the few cases where innovators and inventors received a
proper reward for their inventions. That was heartening. Perhaps it was
as a result of Matthew Boulton's commercial enterprise that the Scots
have been so inventive over the past couple of
centuries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:48:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301288000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#1301288000019">As
my noble friend mentioned, the UK is a world leader in intellectual
property. He put some significant figures forward in terms of
employment and the value of the creative sector. Therefore, how the
Government develop IP policy is vital for our economy. We hear much
about becoming a knowledge-driven economy. IP is vital for that and for
those whom it supports, such as in manufacturing.</hs_para>

is concern, however, extremely well reflected by my noble friend, that
the IPO is not in fact a champion of intellectual property. I was a
member of the All-Party Parliamentary IP Group inquiry into the IPO.
From the evidence that I saw, officials did not see their role as being
to champion intellectual property. Indeed, officials found it difficult
to describe intellectual property as a property right even though
nearly all creators believe that fundamentally. In fact, there were
three important conclusions. My noble friend mentioned them but they
bear repeating: IP is a vital foundation of economic growth, there is
no champion of IP policy within government and that the IPO's
policy-making function has lost the confidence of a large number of its
key
stakeholders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:49:39"></hs_TimeCode>.

disappointing, especially in the light of the kind of proposal that we
have here, but it is also fairly breathtaking. I shall not dwell on
those comments unduly but the fact is that, as was recently
demonstrated by Professor Hargreaves before the Culture, Media and
Sport Select Committee, the evidence base for his own reports has been
flimsy at best when justifying certain copyright exceptions. The impact
assessments for most of the relevant clauses in this Bill are also
wholly inadequate as a result. The mantra that somehow copyright is a
barrier to innovation and growth runs through the Hargreaves report and
the work of the IPO, I am
afraid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:52:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with the recent report on access to finance for the creative industries

and build on the value of creative content. He fully recognises the

hope—especially in the light of this amendment—that the
Government will rethink their approach to intellectual property policy.
As the feasibility studies by Richard Hooper and the work thereafter
show, ambition within the UK’s collective licensing bodies and
the creative industries to form hubs with other copyright
owners—for example, for licensing music for services of every
kind—right across the globe, making the UK a global licensing
centre, really does exist to a powerful degree. The UK’s
collective licensing bodies are investing in the technical expertise,
processing power and administrative efficiency to handle billions of
uses of music and other intellectual property, and to charge, collect
and distribute income with
precision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:53:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of far greater significance across the board in the technology sector
and the creative industries than the copyright law reforms proposed,
whether in this Bill or in the proposed exceptions put out before
Christmas. The Government should match this ambition and champion IP as
much as possible. The IPO clearly needs to be more overtly a champion
for IP. The United States has obviously benefited from having an IP
tsar, otherwise known as the Intellectual Property Enforcement
Coordinator, who is responsible for a national strategy and works
directly to the White House. Creating a director-general of
intellectual property rights to sit within the Intellectual Property
Office and serve as a champion of IP rights within and across
government would increase the influence of the IPO across government
and also strengthen the hand of the Minister responsible for IPO, if I
may say so to my noble

to Amendment 28D, as I mentioned, one of the most significant
developments—in my view, far more significant than changes to
copyright law—is the work following from Richard Hooper’s
feasibility studies into a digital copyright exchange, otherwise known
as the digital hub. Now the work following that feasibility study has
been entrusted to a broadly representative voluntary group, the
Copyright Licensing Steering Group. That has proved to get
by-in right across the creative sector. It is important to have an
annual report on the follow-up to Professor Hooper’s
recommendations and the progress made by the group in streamlining
copyright licensing. He refers to that in paragraph 167 of his final
report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T15:55:51"></hs_TimeCode>. We need

the Government could also look at whether there is any productive and
cost-effective overlap between reporting on and monitoring all the work
described in this final report and Ofcom’s reporting
requirements under the Digital Economy Act. This approach has the
advantage of an independent voice but the disadvantage of perhaps
moving away from the industry-led and industry-funded philosophy
underpinning all this work. Given Ofcom’s new role in relation
to copyright enforcement this may be an important idea for industry to
consider given their concerns about copyright enforcement not being
forceful
enough”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="1301288000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#1301288000104">That

Government therefore considers that the most effective way of
strengthening the IPO’s focus on innovation and growth would be
to require it to report annually on the extent to which its activities

powerful incentive to develop policy based on the best available
evidence, and to be clear about the respective weightings given to
economic and social impacts on individual policy issues. Where the data

points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:14:47"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
probably a pivotal time in that this industry is growing, it is new and
it is fast moving. We saw what happened when the sector itself failed
to respond to new technology in the appropriate way 10, 15 or 20 years
ago, and I think that we have been picking up the pieces ever since.
However, things have moved on since then. It is right that, as a
society, the Government and the industry now look at what is happening
and ask, “What do we need to do to make sure that we can
guarantee the future of this industry, giving people new ways of
accessing music design and all those things, but protect the copyright
holders as well”. Getting that right is what this legislation is
about. Given how fast things are moving, if we get it wrong now, we
will find it very difficult to go back and get it right again in the
future. This is a really important point. In relation to this
amendment, perhaps I may say to the Minister that I do not think we can
see how it goes and come back in 12 or 18 months’ time to
reflect and then take things forward. Now is the time to
act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:16:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:15:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point that I want to make in terms of background is that we talk about
people accessing the intellectual property that exists at the moment.
That is part of the structure that we are building, but in some ways it
is about ensuring a continuing flow of intellectual property for the
industry in the future. Those producing intellectual property are
businesses and they, just as 
<?notus-xml column=412?>much as anybody else, need a guarantee of a return on their investment.
We now have a wonderful system whereby people can access existing
intellectual property but, if we do not act for the future, we will

from two sources. One is a junior Minister in the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport, and I notice that there is a glut of former
DCMS Ministers with me on the Back Bench at the moment. Secondly, the
noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred to the All-Party Parliamentary
Intellectual Property Group, on which I also sat, although I was not
able to attend all the sessions. The Minister may tell me that things
are very different now but, quite honestly, going back to my days in
the DCMS, I was horrified at the lack of co-ordination of intellectual
property across government. I spent seven years or more in government
and I never felt as much animosity about copyright as there was between
the DCMS and the DTI, as it was in those days. The two departments were
on different sides. There was no coming together in the national
interest, and the IPO—I choose my words carefully; I do not want
to overstate it—was not seen as a friend of the DCMS. The DCMS
saw itself as promoting the creative industries.</hs_para>

departments to act in the interests of the future of this industry and
the future growth of intellectual property. Of course, the Minister may
tell me that it is all now sweetness and light and that there is a
wonderful relationship between the two departments. However, if you put
that together with the evidence that we took on the All-Party
Parliamentary Intellectual Property Group, I fear that that is not the
case. The sector that produces and those who represent the producers
are still not convinced that there are people across government who
understand them. It is not so much a case of acting in their interests
but of making sure that they give what they should be giving this joint
enterprise of becoming a society that makes the best use of IP. To have
the IPO as the body to which the creative industries can turn being

a  number of initiatives over recent years, running
education 
<?notus-xml column=413?>programmes in schools and other education institutions and in wider

creation of the Department for National Heritage, which is now DCMS,
there was a period when there were 18 different Ministers with
responsibility for films in the then sponsoring department, the DTI,
over a period of 17 years. As I was working at the BFI in part of that

problem for those working on this section of the Bill is that the
creative industries do not generally feel that they are being looked
after properly. Indeed, there is a wide sense of unease, as the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin, called it, and of imbalance, as my noble friends
Lady Morris, Lord Smith and Lord Howarth also mentioned. This is in
part because of the rather unfortunate split in responsibilities
between BIS and DCMS, which can sometimes—or, indeed, all the
time—appear to pull in different directions. My noble friend
Lady Morris put it well; she spoke from experience, and I think that
she spoke the truth. IP is not well served by the current system. But
it is also because there have been no real opportunities to debate in
this House and the other place some of the issues in the foreground of
this sector’s thinking at a time of great change in every aspect
of their businesses. The occasional SI does not compensate for
this—something that we will return to in other debates. That is
why, to me, the idea of an annual report and a subsequent debate in
Parliament seems such a good idea, which I am happy to

it is worth emphasising some progress. The Government have done a lot

benefits of around £290 million each year. The
Government’s copyright proposals  are accompanied by
impact assessments that have been scrutinised by the independent

extensively on these proposals through the Hargreaves review, a formal
consultation and numerous discussions with stakeholders and industry
representatives. We have considered all responses very
carefully. The Government will bring forward secondary legislation to
introduce these changes in 2013. Prior to this we will publish the

Amendment 28C, my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones referred to a
proposal for a tsar to enforce intellectual property, much as there is

Government have carried out a range of activity to support the
enforcement of
IP<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:32:34"></hs_TimeCode>. The
UK’s legal system convicts pirates and counterfeiters: 80% of
criminal cases under IP legislation in 2009 led to a guilty verdict. In
2009, the UK convicted nearly eight times as many copyright offenders
as in 2002. The assets seized from IP criminals amounted to £21
million in 2010-11, which was more than twice the previous
year’s figure. Figures vary from year to year but there has been
an increasing trend in the value of assets recovered since 2004-05.
Therefore, the IPO has made a substantial investment in creating an IP
crime intelligence capability. The IPO also provides direct support for
enforcement activities through its intelligence hub. The hub holds in
excess of 50,000 reports and this year alone has processed some 3,000

Lord Jenkin to respond to the main amendment. I welcome the fact that
the Minister has come out of his corner punching. He has certainly set
out the term extension, the charging charities, the anti-piracy

patent procedures, trade mark services and so on. He has also given us
a mini update on the copyright hub, which is what I asked for all along
on an annual basis. I am not at all convinced by the plea that there
will be lots of commercially sensitive data that would have to be
included in any report on the copyright hub. I ask my noble friend
whether the report on innovation and growth that the IPO is going to be
tasked to deliver on an annual basis could include licensing. I believe
that licensing is the way forward to innovation and growth for the
content and creative industries. It is extremely important, rather than
copyright exceptions. There is no reason why it should not be included
in the IPO’s report and maybe that is a way of coming to a
beneficial conclusion on

all those who have taken part in the debate. I think it justified what
I said at the beginning about the level of support there is for, if not
this particular amendment then the recognition that “all is not
well”—to quote the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. All is
not well in the field of copyright. I leave the Minister with this
thought. The Government have got to do a great deal more if they are
going to regain the confidence of copyright owners. I heard what he
said and I shall study it carefully. However, there is no question
about it, those of us who have been exposed over recent months to the
considerable expressions of dismay and, indeed, fear for the future on

Howarth, for seeking balance, is probably what the IPO claims that it
would be doing. The fact of the matter is that it has lost the
confidence of all those who are concerned as the owners of IP.
Something has to be done in order to get the improvement in the whole
copyright structure that is widely sought. It may well be that the
director-general proposal will need to be looked at again in 
the light of what has been said in the debate about it. One point I
would make is that the all-party group recommended that it come under
the Secretary of 
<?notus-xml column=418?>State for DCMS whereas the IPO comes under BIS. The amendment says
“Secretary of State” and that covers all of them, so the
amendment does not distinguish.</hs_para>

been said. There is a lack of co-ordination across Whitehall—a
lack of the same kind of recognition of the importance of IP lying at
the heart of our economy, and it will increasingly lie at the heart of
our economy as it becomes even more based on intellectual property and
less on manual labour. We have got to look at this very carefully.
Parliament has an opportunity to express its views. I have no doubt at
all that we shall want to return to the matter at Report. I give notice

of the difficulties about discussing the clauses on copyright in the
Bill is that, although they are very important, they stand apart from
important changes in copyright that the Government are making in
parallel. I refer, of course, to the announcement on 20 December 2012,
which prefigures the implementation of many of the recommendations of
the recent Hargreaves

many commentators have pointed out, making major changes to copyright
has usually been done by primary legislation. The Copyright Act 1911
brought provisions on copyright into one Act for the first time; the
Copyright Act 1956 covered the United Kingdom’s accession to the
UCC; and the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 is the current main
legislative
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:40:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301288000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#1301288000087">However,
according to last month’s announcement, the Government will make
changes by secondary legislation to private copying, education,
quotation and news reporting, research and private study, access for
people with disabilities, archiving and preservation, public
administration, data analytics, and parody, caricature and pastiche.
Many commentators feel that such a long list of copyright exceptions
should be introduced by primary legislation; and I have some sympathy
with that
view.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301288000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#1301288000088">When he
comes to respond, I hope that the noble Viscount will explain in some
detail the approach that the Government are taking. Pushing ahead with
those measures in secondary legislation will, after all, not allow for
the sort of debate and discussion that the torrent of representations

sensible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:41:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301288000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#1301288000089">The
line being taken by the Government seems to be that, as they already
have the power to make copyright exceptions under Section 2(2), they do
not need primary legislation. With respect, I think that that misses
the point. Those changes are important in themselves; they affect a
major part of our economy; and they will interact with hundreds of
thousands of people who work in those industries. If Parliament does
not have a chance to debate those measures in detail, we are simply not
doing our
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:42:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301288000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#1301288000090">I
have tabled two amendments on the Hargreaves exceptions so that at
least this issue can be raised. I shall make a couple of
general points and then deal with the amendments, although not in any
great detail. The first is that, in themselves, the new exceptions do a
pretty good job of moving the situation forward from one where, over a
period of decades, the focus of legislation with regard to copyright
has been on either extension of duration or intensification of
enforcement. On many of the copyright exceptions proposed, the
Government have trodden a careful path between the contending views
expressed in their consultation. Where an issue was
uncontentious—such as copying for archive purposes—we
have a clear and, to some people, radical 
<?notus-xml column=420?>change to the proposed position to allow unrestricted copying, which is
a very welcome move indeed for countless museums, libraries and
archives. Many of the specific proposals, however, seek to trade off
contending points of view and interests, and are all the weaker for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:42:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301288000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#1301288000091">If
I were to take a view on which of the proposed copyright exceptions is
likely to be viewed by the public as simply limp, I would say that the
private copying exception, being confined to the individual rather than
the immediate family, is the one that fails the basic test of realising
where the consumer is on these issues. If my wife buys a CD, she cannot
let me listen to it by copying it to my iPod. She can legally copy it
to the music system of our car, but only if she owns the car and, by
implication, the music system; it will not be legal if I am the
registered owner. That will seem pretty daft to most people. There are
of course arguments against a family private copying exception, not the
least being able to define what is a family, but many will feel that an
attempt should at least have been
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:43:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1301288000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#1301288000092">Turning
to my amendments, there are two issues. My concern about metadata is
that although it is good that the Government are moving on it, the fact
that they will be doing it through is secondary legislation means that,
despite the consultation, the SI, which we hope to consider, will come
through in the usual way in your Lordships’ House and will have
to be approved through the affirmative procedure. That is in no sense a
complete answer to the question. This is a controversial move,
especially for publishers, many of whom have expressed considerable
concern to both the Government and those of us involved in debating the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:44:24"></hs_TimeCode>. Treating
the proposal through the secondary route is not doing justice to the
issue, to the community or to the wider public. A Grand
Committee debate, where no amendments are permitted, is not a
substitute for primary legislation. Perhaps the Minister can comment on
that when he
replies.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_28_PT_1/D2B59B3886E351478EF63FD79A04E46DA125D059" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 January 2013">Monday,

amendment deals with parody. My point here is that what the Government
are proposing is extremely cautious. Perhaps the key point is that the
proposal is that parody will be permitted only when it is fair dealing.
In other words, this will preclude copying an entire work, and
therefore, as the Government helpfully point out, there is a readily
accessible licensing procedure available to pay for use of the work.
Which original author will be happy to license to somebody else who is
going to parody the work in question? They would have to have a very

UK has a significant tradition in parody. It is also strong in pastiche
and caricature. This includes literature, stage, film, fine art and
music. Parody, pastiche, satire and homage have been an important
vehicle for social and commercial innovation. These types of work are
among the most commercially successful and well-known works in British
history. Examples include T. S. Eliot’s <I>The Waste Land</I>,
which recontextualises elements of various previous literary works,
including Dante’s <I>Inferno</I>. Tom Stoppard borrowed
liberally from Shakespeare characters and plots to create famous
pastiches such as <I>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</I> and,
with Marc Norman, the brilliant film “Shakespeare in
Love”. He also used George Orwell’s <I>1984</I> and
Federico Fellini’s “Eight and a Half” to create
“Brazil”. Parodies frequently eclipse the work they are
based on in popularity. For example, the BBC television sitcom
“’Allo ’Allo!” is better known than the
original BBC television drama, “Secret Army”, which it
satirised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:46:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012828000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012828000005">EU
law provides that member states are free to introduce an exception for
parody, pastiche or caricature in national law, but the UK is one of
the few industrial countries which does not provide for such an
exception. Australia introduced a fair dealing provision for parody and
satire in 2006. Belgium—believe it or not—Spain,
Switzerland and France provide for a similar exception in their laws.
Countries which, like the UK, do not provide for an exception in law
have to rely on
litigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:47:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012828000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012828000006">I
suppose we should be glad that the Government now reject the argument
that relying on litigation provides sufficient legal certainty for
parodists for the reality is that parodists and those who make their
works available to the public face considerable risk of being sued for
copyright infringement and hence having their works removed by internet
hosts, and that is without considering the moral rights issue,
particularly as UK courts have interpreted increasingly minute parts of
a copyrighted work as constituting a “substantial part”,
and that their use is therefore copyright infringement. This means that
the Government cannot continue to defer the parody problem to the
courts and the courts cannot be relied on for the continuous protection
of a very important part of our
culture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012828000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012828000007">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:47:42"></hs_TimeCode>
view is that there is a contradiction at the heart of the
Government’s proposal—this is the reason for my
amendment—that is the combination of moral right and fair
dealing might easily mean that a wholly legitimate target of satire
such as a politician or a celebrity would be able successfully to fight
parody on copyright grounds in the courts. What a loss that would be.
Can the Minister confirm that, for example, he is aware of the video
done by soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan, “Gangnam
Afghanistyle”? Or perhaps more topically, has he seen or even
heard of the recent viral hit “Eton Style”, labelled on
YouTube “Gangnam Style Parody”? A simple nod of the head
would suffice. Even if he is discreet on this point, I am sure he would
lament, as would many of us on this side, if such brilliant and
incisive work was caught by this provision. I will send him the YouTube
link if he would like to have a look at
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T16:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

not think the approach being taken by the Government is what is wanted.
That is why I feel that my amendment would be the appropriate way
forward. Only an out and out exception of the type contained in our
amendment will get us to the right place. This may be the only
opportunity to request a major rethink on this issue, which is why I
ask the Government to look again at this proposal. I beg to

name of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson. I agreed with much of his
introduction, the broad sweep of which was impressive given the nature
of these amendments. He commented that exceptions will be introduced by
secondary legislation. I associate myself with those remarks. I do not

exceptions. It should be done by primary

unpacking the metadata amendment slightly because I think that exactly
how the amendment would operate should be on the record. Section 296ZG
of the 1988 Act, which was inserted in 2003, provides protection for
electronic rights management information by giving a cause of action to
rights owners when such information is removed or altered by a third
party without authority, provided that the third party has the
necessary mental element—that is, that it knowingly and without
authority removes or alters electronic rights management
information.</hs_para>

amendment seeks to deal with the specific problem that arises when
copies of works or other subject matter are gathered by an automated
process. It has particular relevance to the actions of search engines
and other operators who “spider” the world wide web.
Because copies are gathered and often stored or processed by an
automated process, no human mind will normally read rights management
information which is associated with or embedded in the protected
subject matter. The law is presently unclear about the circumstances in
which the operator of the automated process will be deemed to have
rights management information drawn to his attention. Therefore, the
amendment seeks to provide certainty in this regard. It does not expand
the scope of any rights belonging to the copyright holder or other
right holder. A person gathering materials is free to disregard any
restrictions which may be communicated by means of rights management
information if, for example, the acts he is carrying out are protected
by a fair dealing defence or for any other reason do not fall within
the scope of the copyright or other
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012828000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012828000012">Subsection

The spirit in which both Houses of Parliament worked on that
legislation 25 years ago was entirely collegiate. There was no party
politics in it at all. We were all simply seeking to work our way
forwards to find an appropriate legislative solution. Our deliberations
and conclusions were observed with very great interest in other
countries. We can continue to legislate in that spirit, but it would

suggestions that have been put to us in some of the otherwise very

not scrutinise secondary legislation, I think that the situation, at
least in this House, is significantly better than that, and we ought to
pay tribute to the committees of this House that examine the quality
and appropriateness of secondary legislation. We all know that it
cannot be amended, and a great fuss is made if a statutory instrument
is rejected by the House, so although we are not quite presented with a
fait accompli when we consider secondary legislation, it is not a
particularly satisfactory manner of advancing the frontiers of
legislation. Much more exposure in draft and much more
consultation—I know we will have it in due course—would
be preferable at this stage. The Minister has perhaps not had an
opportunity to consider this question of process as yet, so I hope
that, not today, but at some point, he will feel able to offer some

Bridgeman:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as a director
of the Bridgeman Art Library, of which my wife is the founder and
chairman. I shall speak to Amendment 28DZA in support of the noble
Lord, Lord Stevenson, and my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones. The noble
Lord, Lord Howarth, has reminded us of the history of the 1988
Copyright, Design and Patents Act. It goes a great deal of the way to
protecting the rights of copyright owners, it removes the excuses for
copyright material being lifted without a legal licence, it ensures
that works created in future are not orphaned whereby, as your
Lordships will be aware, work cannot licensed in the ordinary way
because those who hold rights in it are untraceable, consumers get a
genuine guarantee that the work is what it says it is and its creators
take responsibility for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012835000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000002">However
there is one glaring loophole, which has been so ably addressed by my
noble friend Lord Clement-Jones, in part opened up by fast-growing
developments in digital practice. It is that at present users are
currently 
<?notus-xml column=425?>able to shelter behind the fact that rights information, which forms
part of what is loosely termed metadata, obtained and distributed by
computer programs, as opposed to being obtained manually, escapes the
protection afforded to creators by the 1988 Act. This amendment seeks
to rectify an obvious anomaly in the existing legislation.</hs_para>

draw the Minister’s attention to the fact that, should this
amendment be accepted—and I am well aware that there is
considerable debate about whether this will be in primary or secondary
legislation—there will need to be a cross-over to those clauses
relating to orphan works and extended collective
licensing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012835000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000004">I
would also like to mention that giving effect to thus apparently simple
intention in plain English at the same time as making it watertight in
IT terms is no easy task, and the framers of this amendment are to be
congratulated on doing their best. No doubt, if this amendment is
accepted, as I hope it will be, the Bill team will be able to
consolidate the

Committee, I shall speak sitting

speak to both amendments. On Amendment 28DZA, will the Minister confirm
that there is already protection under the law for the stripping of
metadata knowingly and without authority? Other noble Lords have
alluded to that. I understood that it gave us the protection that we
were seeking rather than going down the route of this amendment. Any
infringement is therefore already contrary to civil law. If there are
concerns that that protection is not strong enough, especially in
relation to computer and electronic equipment—for example, in
cameras—it is not just about large internet companies stripping
data. There is a real problem for photographers; I know that some of
their data are stripped. I am looking at the noble Baroness, Lady Howe
of Idlicote, when I say that we have worked with the ISPs in relation
to child safety and pornography. Surely there is a more effective way
of working in the internet age with organisations that, whether
deliberately or not, might try to remove that data.</hs_para>

amendment is trying to tackle the problem, but I am worried that it
relies on individuals to instruct their electronic equipment. That
might be fine in the case of a highly proficient technical
photographer, but not necessarily fine for amateurs creating metadata,
particularly on the internet, as well as some for professionals who do
not understand the technology too well.</hs_para>

amendment creates a further barrier to orphan works, which we will be
discussing later. If this amendment is accepted, it will make it almost
impossible to collect copyright licence fees for some orphan works
because of the conditions it puts upon person A and person B.</hs_para>

28DZD. It is a complete change in tone. I declare an interest as a
former stage manager of Footlights. I worked alongside people such as
Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis on their very first shows. I worry that
paragraph (b), which states that copyright is not infringed
if,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13012835000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000029">“it

problem to people working in our fast-moving light entertainment and
comedy world. I can absolutely understand the parody of major works: I
think of Benjamin Hoff’s <I>The</I><I> Tao of Pooh</I><I>,</I>

there has been a traditional and proud history in this country of
parody and caricature, from “That Was the Week That Was”
60 years ago, moving right up to date with “The Now Show”
on Radio 4. Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis did a wonderful sketch a
fortnight ago on UKIP and the referendum on Europe using the theme of
Gollum in the film of <I>Lord of the </I><I>R</I><I>ings</I><I>.</I> I
do not know whether noble Lords heard it, but the theme of the
programme was “We wants referendumses”. It was very

problem is that proposed new subsection (3)(b) in Amendment 28DZAwould
mean that every sketch like that in a fast-moving half hour show would
have to stop to acknowledge that it was taking both a piece from Peter
Jackson's original film and the style of the actor. Therefore, frankly,
it would be unworkable. I apologise, but I am afraid that the stage
manager in me immediately thought, “Oh my goodness: this will
kill comedy and light entertainment of the spontaneous type that this
country excels

Earl of Erroll:</Member></B> My Lords, I not sure why these two
amendments have been grouped together because they are completely
different. However, I will deal with the first one on metadata. I do
not know what it has to do with stripping metadata off whatever you
might read on the internet. It is saying, as far as I can make out,
that if you have an automated system that comes across some metadata,
it should respond to that intelligently and either not breach copyright
or know that you are permitted to use it. But it does nothing about
controlling the metadata or stopping people from stripping
it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012835000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000013">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:07:04"></hs_TimeCode>
as much as it is saying that you should look at the metadata and
therefore respond to it intelligently, yes that is a nice thought.
However, I wonder whether many programmes would be able to do that. I
can see that it is probably targeted more towards the search engines
and various things like that. I can see some problems with this and
think that it will have to go into regulation to work out how to handle
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:07:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012835000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000014">We
also need to think about the world stage and what is being done in
other countries, because a lot of these things that look for items on
the internet are based abroad. We want something that is practically
useful. We do not want to drive things out of the UK. I am not saying
that we should breach copyright and I think that we should use metadata
intelligently to try to achieve the aims that we want, but we must be
careful how we do
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:07:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012835000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000015">I
am also keen on the use of data mining for research purposes. For
example, you can talk to Wellcome and such people. Huge benefits have
come from looking at disparate research material. Very often, new
discoveries come from matching things from completely different
spheres. That is what we forget when we worry about the protection of
copyright for the artist or creative 
<?notus-xml column=427?>person in that sphere. Actually, researchers have completely different
needs. They will not usually go around ripping off other people's
ideas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:08:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012835000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000016">One
of the challenges with this whole area of copyright is that we are
trying to treat everything as if it is the same. It is not. Very often,
when we benefit one lot we will disadvantage another and we need to be
careful not to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:08:46"></hs_TimeCode>. That
slightly worries
me.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012835000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000017">Leaving
that to one side, Amendment 28DZD has a good point behind it, which is
that you must have an exception for parody. Leaving the courts to
decide what is fair in parody and what is not is very dangerous. As we
know, courts are extremely expensive. If you are a small creative group
trying to create parody and a big boy comes along and tries to hit you
over the head in the courts, you will have to back down. That is
bullying. Unfortunately, I do not think that our laws on bullying
prevent that. If they did, we might be able to do something about
it.</hs_para>

must be very careful saying that recourse to the courts is workable.
Basically, unless you are very rich or very poor, you are outside the
law. You are not protected by British law because it is too expensive.
That is something I have become aware of in general. We cannot rely on
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:09:46"></hs_TimeCode>. I think it
is very important, but I entirely agree with the noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:10:00"></hs_TimeCode> Brinton. We
cannot try to attribute every single little thing that one tries to
parody. That would be absolutely ridiculous and unworkable. Without
that bit about the attribution, the idea that we are trying to protect
parody is extremely important. Therefore, I like this amendment; it
just needs a bit of tidying up I
suspect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:10:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:10:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, Amendment 28DZA would
introduce a provision into the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988
that changes the legal status of rights management information
attached  to digital material. This would make internet service
providers responsible for ensuring any rights management information
contained in metadata is recognised and acted upon. I have sympathy
with creators whose wishes about the use of their material, expressed
through metadata, are not always complied with. There are already
well-established methods to control automated use of material posted
online—for example, the use of robots dot text files to prevent
crawling of websites by search engines. I was grateful for the
technical insight on this from the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, who I
suspect knows a lot more about this than my good self.</hs_para>

providers are already responsible for removing infringing material when
it is brought to their attention. This is in keeping with other areas
of law, where we do not expect carriers of information to be held
liable for the lawfulness of that information. The approach suggested
in the amendment would require all aggregators, indexers and other
automated hosts online to develop systems to read metadata and comply
with any conditions. As noble Lords will understand, this would be no
small task. It would also replicate the efforts of a number of
industry-led initiatives in this area, which are making progress. These
include the Automated Content Access Protocol project, and work by the
industry-led digital copyright exchange to look at the related issue of
automated metadata stripping.</hs_para>

considered the amendment carefully but do not consider that legislative
change is the right step at this time. Moving on to Amendment 28DZD,
noble Lords will be aware that the Government have announced their
intention to bring forward legislation to introduce or update a number
of copyright exceptions. A new exception to allow limited use of
copyright works for parody, caricature or pastiche is part of that
work. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, is therefore
going in the same direction as the Government’s policy. Rather
than amend the Bill to achieve it, I suggest that it would be better to
wait for the introduction of a parody exception, with the
other proposed changes to copyright exceptions, in due
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012835000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000022">The
Government have already committed to publish draft regulations later in
the year, including provisions on this subject, for technical review by
any interested parties. This will be an important opportunity to hear
from experts, including in this House, to ensure that the regulations
will have the desired effect. I would like to pick up on a point
emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, concerning secondary
legislation. To clarify, we believe that exceptions to copyright that
are explicitly permitted by the copyright directive may be introduced
into UK law by means of Section 2.2 of the European Communities Act.
The Hargreaves changes to copyright exceptions announced in December
2012 will be introduced by secondary legislation under the European
Communities Act and not under the power in Clause 66 of the Bill. Our
intention is to publish draft regulations for public comment in the
spring. Government have considered the amendment carefully, but I hope
that in light of the above, the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, will feel
able to withdraw this

there was a touch of the real authorial actor there as well and I was
grateful to her for her points. My failure here was clearly to have not
done my research and realise that despite his youth and clear vibrancy
in terms of matters cultural, the noble Viscount had not listened to
his children and worked out where “Gangnam Style” was
coming from. I perhaps should have taken a leaf out of the book of the
noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, and actually done my bit of what it was

my time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012835000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012835000024">On

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> I shall speak also to the other
two amendments in the group which are in effect variations on a theme.
Article 17 of the Designs Directive (98/71) and Article 96(2) of the EU
Design Regulation (6/2002) leave to member states the freedom to
regulate the extent of protection offered by copyright to designs. The
amendments in this group seek to pre-empt what the Government intend to
do in this complex area, which is to repeal Section 52 of the CDPA, by
means of a general fair use provision and a narrower images
exemption.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=430?><hs_para UID="13012841000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000002">Amendment 28DZB seeks to
protect the interests of many of the third parties affected by the
Government’s proposal: those who have created images of existing
designed articles. This includes publishers who have included images of
old designs in their works, museums, individuals using images of design
on websites, educators wanting to use images in teaching,
photographers, picture libraries and so on. Many of these people will
have invested in the production of images and films of designed
articles when it was lawful to do so. Their interests are not likely to
be protected by a transitional rule allowing stocks to be sold off;
every time the images are shown in public, or reproduced, there will be
an infringement.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012841000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000003">This images exemption
seeks to protect these third parties by allowing the making and
exploitation of two-dimensional images and films of designed articles
which have been placed on the market. In fact, it goes a little further
than protecting these third parties during a transitional period, as it
will permit such images to be created and sold in the future. This is a
narrow derogation from the serious expansion of rights of design
proprietors by the repeal of Section 52 and, in my view, does not
prejudice the normal exploitation or the legitimate interests of the
copyright holder. I think there is a major issue here, and I hope very
much that the Minister will have further thoughts on this issue as he
listens to this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000004">Amendment
28DZC builds on the breadth offered by the directive and the
regulation. As drafted, the provision seeks to minimise the uncertainty
inherent in a fair-use defence, such as that available generally for
copyright under US law, with its white list and black list of deemed
fair and unfair uses, leaving other uses to be judged in the individual
case by reference to relevant
factors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000005">One
goal of this amendment is to protect follow-on designers: those who
incorporate parts of old designs but transform the totality. It is well
known that designers build with and on the design ideas of their
predecessors. I believe the extension of copyright term to life plus 70
will make this much more difficult because of the sheer length of the
term and because copyright protection is stronger in many ways than
design protection. In my view, this issue has not been given sufficient
weight, as we need to give careful consideration to the needs of future
generations of
designers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000006">Under
existing design law, copying a part of an old design and incorporating
it in a new, transformed design would not infringe any of the 25-year
registered design rights unless the overall design produces on the
informed user the same overall impression. However the copyright test
is different. Copyright prohibits reproduction of any part of a
protected work. One of the proposed white list of fair uses ensures
that no use of a copyright-protected design infringes unless it would
produce the same impression on an informed user. In short, it
harmonises the copyright test with the EU design
test.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000007">Another
goal is to protect educators, publishers, film-makers and website
operators who use images of designed articles in their teaching, in
their books, in their films and on their websites. These uses would be
white listed as automatically fair. The black list deems 
<?notus-xml column=431?>unfair any use of a design in making an article which does not credit
the original designer. It may be fair to start making old designs which
are no longer being marketed—for example, fabric or wallpaper
designs—particularly where the designer or design owner cannot
be found. This clause indicates that it would not be fair to do so
without indicating the origin of the original
design.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000008">However,
the debate on this issue resolves primarily on whether the Government
are right to delete Section 52 of the Copyright, Design and
Patents Act 1988, whether by so doing and ending the current regime of
registered designs they have fully considered all the issues which flow
from that decision, and the implications that arise for products which
are or are about to be out of rights protection under the present
registered design period of 25 years, which will in future be in
copyright for a period of 70 years after the death of the
designer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000009">There
is, of course, a very good case to be made for letting industrial
designers have the same protection for their efforts as is available to
composers, writers and the like, but I think there are some real
questions about this issue, which might suggest to the Government that
a pause for reflection before implementing this major change might be
sensible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000010">One
practical effect of this repeal will be to make replica versions of
classic designs, such as Jacobsen’s egg chair, unaffordable to
many consumers. Additionally, the creative freedom of future designers
will be constrained because of the need to avoid breaching the
copyrights of older predecessors, which cuts across the very essence of
much industrial
design.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000011">Why
was this proposal not preceded by a full consultation with
stakeholders? Why has the impact assessment that has been published in
fact got very little detail about the impact? Moreover, the assessment
seems to have failed to acknowledge the impact on anyone other than
designers, those who make and sell replica designs, consumers and the
Government themselves. Would the Minister not agree that this
initiative has not been handled
properly?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000012">The
Minister may well argue that the Government had no option but to
legislate. If that is the case, can he confirm that the Government are
rushing to legislate on the basis of one recent European case, Flos SpA
v Semeraro Casa e Famiglia SpA, which has been reported recently? The
case concerned the design of the famous Arco lamp, consisting of a
long, curved, metal arm supported by a marble block and finishing with
a silver globe-shaped lampshade. I should declare an interest since I
have one of the original design, fully paid for, at home. The design
was created in 1962 by the Italians Achille and Pier Castiglioni, and
any industrial design protection the design had once possessed has
lapsed. Flos nevertheless claimed copyright in the lamp and that it had
been infringed when Semeraro imported its Fluica lamp into Italy from
China.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000013">I am no
lawyer, but I think we need to be sure that the UK response to Flos is
appropriate and proportionate. The Government have decided on the basis
of this single and recent case that we should abandon the whole of our
registered design margin of appreciation. Surely the better approach
would be to try to maintain 
<?notus-xml column=432?>Section 52, as that was explicitly agreed between the UK Government and
the Commission during the process of adoption of the design directive.
For the avoidance of doubt, as I have already said, there
clearly is a good case for giving industrial designers the same
copyright protection as applies to other creative industries, but the
fact is that we currently have a different regime, and harmonisation of
design and copyright should not be an end in itself or be driven by one
isolated
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000014">The
impact assessment is far from complete, but it admits that the reform
of Section 52 will harm consumer welfare as classic
designs—those that are more than 25 years
old—will be re-monopolised. Replicas, currently available at
some 15% to 20% of the price of the original, will no longer be
available. No opportunity has been taken for consumers to be consulted.
Moreover, there are those who argue that the impact assessment
significantly underestimates the other costs that will arise,
particularly because of its focus on furniture and three-dimensional
design.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000015">The
Government believe that the change would encourage innovation and
investment in design, but this is supported by the flimsiest of
arguments in the impact assessment and no new evidence is offered to
explain why the balance of interests between designer and owner,
competitors and consumers, should be drawn differently today than in
1988 or indeed in 1994-95 when the Government successfully negotiated
to retain Section 52 of the
CDPA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000016">I am
also concerned—and here I echo the comments made recently by my
noble friend Lord Howarth—that as yet we have no idea what the
traditional arrangements will be when Section 52 is repealed. Will it
be on existing stocks and on articles which are out of copyright and
which will now gain further periods of protection? Surely we need to
see the draft proposals in this area as soon as possible and certainly
before Report.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012841000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000017">In conclusion, I should
like to return to the question of the impact that this change will have
on firms whose registered designs have come out of protection but which
may now regain copyright protection to the detriment of consumers but
to the benefit of rights
holders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000018">I
mentioned the egg chair, but it has been suggested to me that another
area which will be affected is wallpaper. Wallpaper is within the
current scope of Section 52 and is not in the exclusion for matters of
a “primarily literary and artistic character”, so the
change may well benefit companies in this field. The Minister will be
aware of the firm Osborne and Little, which is primarily a wallpaper
maker, founded in 1968. As I understand it, designs that were first
produced and sold by that company between 1968 and 1987 will, if this
clause goes forward, come back into copyright. It might therefore be
for the benefit of the Committee if the Minister could confirm whether
his right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been
alerted to this change, as it may be of some considerable interest to
him. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Clement-Jones" PimsId="2634" UID="13012841000044" xid="1164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000044">Lord
Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support Amendment
28DZB, and I shall also speak to Amendment 28EB. More particularly, in
view of the 
<?notus-xml column=433?>very cogent introduction to Amendment 28DZB given by the noble Lord,
Lord Stevenson—it was a tour de force, in my view—the
fact is that Clause 65 looks more problematic the more one looks at it.
The problems are exacerbated as there was no prior consultation by the
Government on these provisions, nor is any cost or benefit set out in
the impact assessment. Indeed, there has been no really authoritative
review of the impact of the ECJ case mentioned by the noble
Lord—Flos v Semeraro—and on whether it really does oblige
the UK to repeal Section 52.</hs_para>

design industry says that it has limited benefit, covering only works
of artistic craftsmanship and only then pre-1989 designs and the
introduction of the unregistered design right regime. The industry also
says that works of art produced before 1957 would not benefit from the
full copyright protection. On the other hand, many, including the
publishing industry and the art and museum world, are very concerned
about the impact of the clause on their ability to produce
two-dimensional images of these kinds of artistic works, as the noble
Lord, Lord Stevenson, has
explained.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000021">The
proposed new clause is intended to apply the same term of copyright
protection to artistic works as the term enjoyed by other copyright
works—that is, the lifetime of the creator plus 70 years
following their death. Currently, where more than 50 copies of an
artistic work are manufactured, the term of copyright is only 25
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000022">Publishers
are rightly concerned about the impact that this clause may have on the
publishers of books that include images and descriptions of artistic
works which will now be subject to extended copyright. Such
publications would be likely to find themselves retrospectively in
breach of copyright. Without this kind of amendment, the clause could,
as the British Screen Advisory Council has emphasised—I think
that my noble friend Lady Brinton will be extremely interested in
this—even include props used in a film and articles in a
location where filming has taken place so that this is deemed to be
copying of an artistic work which would otherwise have been permitted
by Section 52. The position of websites, so important for
public access and education, would also be uncertain. It would be even
more disastrous if retrospective clearance were
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000023">I
strongly support Amendment 28DZB, which would put this matter beyond
doubt. I was delighted to see that it is also supported by the V&amp;A,
which is as good a judge as anyone on these matters and is able to take
a balanced view—again, we have the word “balance”.
However, I do not support the introduction of the novel concept of fair
use in Amendment 28DZC, although I understand the motive behind
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000024">As a
preferable alternative, Amendment 28EB, suggested by a group of
professors of design and others, tries to meet the needs of follow-on
designers—the designers of today and tomorrow that the noble
Lord, Lord Stevenson, talked about. There are two concerns that
underpin this amendment, particularly from those who have a great deal
to do with up and coming designers. Copyright, as they explain, is in
important respects more restrictive on follow-on designers than 
<?notus-xml column=434?>the protection given by community and national registered and community
unregistered design rights, which limit protection for the making of
articles which do not produce on the informed user a different overall
impression. So if a designer uses part of an existing designed article
but incorporates it in something that overall appears different, under
the community registered and UK registered design, there is no
infringement. In contrast—and I know that the noble
Lord, Lord Stevenson, put this in other words—copyright has been
interpreted to prohibit the reproduction of any part which is itself
original in the copyright sense of involving creative choices. So if a
motif from a textile or wallpaper—we are back to
wallpaper—is copied but put in a very different context, there
will be infringement of copyright, but not design rights. These
professors say that the difference is not widely appreciated, as it
depends on a detailed understanding of each legal regime, added to
which we are only starting to get court decisions on the interpretation
of the community design test and the EU copyright notion of
reproduction in
part.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13012841000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000041">5.30

implications are significant, and they are seriously worsened if we
extend the duration of protection from 25 years to life plus 70, which
in the case of a design made by a designer at the age of 30 who dies at
the age of 85 would be 125 years. New and contemporary designers will
not be allowed to reuse any original part of existing designs dating
back for much of the 20th century. They say that we tend to
hear more from established designers in the design industry not fully
appreciating the implications for the future. So while generally
supporting the intention behind Clause 65, it does need some important
amendment. At the very least the clause, even if amended along the
lines suggested, should not be brought into force until there has been
a consultation and appropriate provision has been made to protect the
interests of third parties in future as well as during a transitional
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012841000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe" PimsId="4528" UID="13012841000045" xid="1488" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012841000045">Baroness
Warwick of Undercliffe:</Member></B> My Lords, there are concerns about
the impact of Clause 65 on designers and manufacturers, but this
amendment seeks to address a problem which the clause will create for
anyone who wants to use a two-dimensional representation of a design
that is in copyright. This will affect a wide variety of users, but I
am most concerned about the impact on those involved in teaching
design. I declare a non-financial interest as a member of the council

obvious that one cannot teach design without being able to show images
of designs to your students. If you want to do this by example, showing
a PowerPoint slide of a design during a lecture and the item is in
copyright, you need a licence. If the term for industrial designs is
increased to 70 years plus life, that means that you will need a
licence for almost all 20th century designs. Many of these will be
orphan works, so securing a licence under the current law would be
difficult if not impossible. This would be eased by the orphan works
provisions, which we will come to shortly. Meanwhile, this will have a
real impact on the teaching of creative subjects.</hs_para>

had almost nothing but consultation for the last decade, yet there was
no consultation of non-commercial users here. The Government should
consult all those potentially affected by the impact of this clause.
The proposed amendment would be a proportionate response to the
problem, allowing teachers, lecturers, museums, publishers and
libraries to use photographs of designs without the need of a licence.

programme, and one with a wider agenda—for example, financial or
political. A well known example of the latter is the case about two
years ago brought by Unilever, owners of the Marmite brand, against the

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I particularly support the comments
made just now by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, and the noble Lord,
Lord Howarth of Newport, on how the proposals would affect teachers in
schools, colleges and universities. We have already heard that in order
to use any type of digital information, users will need to apply for a
licence. In addition to teachers, publishers reproducing photographs of
industrially produced articles or museums and archives wanting to
display them will also require licences. Along with other noble Lords,
I am concerned that this will stifle the development of the creative
sector, which is vital to the growth of the economy. There 
<?notus-xml column=436?>needs to be a balance between what is trying to be achieved and the
practical problems that teachers and others would
face.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000005">I
am also concerned that the government impact assessment focuses solely
on commercial designs—as was pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson—particularly replica furniture and other household
goods. It is essential that non-commercial users are also consulted;
they are currently covered by Section 52 of the CDPA, as has been
mentioned. Those would include academics, museums, archives, libraries
and publishers to make sure that the repeal of this provision does not
have a negative, unintended
consequence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000006">On
Amendment 28EB, I am grateful for the reference by my noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones to props in theatre. Unfortunately, the second paragraph
of his amendment would create a practical problem. Before I went to
Cambridge, I was a stage manager at the BBC. When you ordered a prop,
you ordered it in one of three forms. It was either fully practical,
for example a phone that would ring and you could speak to somebody;
practical, so that you could pick it up and it would look and sound
like the real thing; or non-practical—basically wood painted to
look like the required item. All three of those were an identical
telephone. Unfortunately, the clause would create a real problem,
because the intention was to produce the article, as defined here, with
no intention at all to infringe any copyright. I suspect that, with
phones being so cheap these days, people do not go to the bother that
they used to in the early and mid-70s when I was carrying out these
orders, but there are plenty of other things within the creative sector
that would be caught by this unintentional
consequence.</hs_para>

It is not designed to deal with the props issue. The amendment put
forward by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, was to deal with that, but
this is to deal with an entirely different issue to do with follow-on
design. Young designers use inspiration from an existing artistic
three-dimensional work and want to incorporate that. That is the
purpose of this amendment. This is needed in addition to other
amendments to the clause. That is why the more you look at Clause 65,
the more problematic it

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 28DZB and 28EB are
intended to ensure that artistic works can continue to be used in two
particular ways after the repeal of Section 52 of the Copyright,
Designs and Patents Act, or CDPA for short: first, that it shall not be
an infringement to use an image of an article protected by copyright in
a film, photograph or book; and, secondly, that it shall not be an
infringement for new designs to use motifs from artistic works
protected by copyright. For example, following the repeal of Section
52, a publisher who reproduces a photograph of any artistic work in a
book may need to obtain 
<?notus-xml column=437?>permission to do so. Similarly, the scope for follow-on design may be
restricted. The amendments are intended to make special provision for
those circumstances.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012844000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000010">The repeal of Section
52 means that all artistic works, irrespective of how and by whom they
are used, will be treated equally under the law. The amendments seem to
be intended to create special cases for particular uses of works. It is
not clear that there is a compelling reason for some artistic works to
be treated differently in that way. For example, why should it be
necessary for a filmmaker to obtain permission to reproduce a painting
by Francis Bacon, but not for another artistic work, such as a designer
lamp?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012844000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000011">Amendment 28DZC would
create an exception that would cover the situations outlined above, but
it goes further. It would in some circumstances allow the production of
replicas and not just images of articles protected by copyright. As
drafted, this would not be compliant with existing law.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012844000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000012">There is another aspect
to consider. In December, the Government announced changes that will be
made to copyright exceptions. These will include, for example, an
amended quotation exception, which will permit the use of photographs
of artistic works in situations that the courts determine to be fair,
and new exceptions for education. Those could cover some uses envisaged
under the amendment. I reassure the Committee that the issue can be
returned to when we have some experience of how the new arrangements
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000013">I shall
pick up a number of points raised by noble Lords. First, I did indeed
spot the article in the press this morning concerning the family
business of a well known member of this Government. I think that the
question of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, was: is it true to say that
the wallpaper produced by the Chancellor’s family-owned interior
design business will qualify for copyright protection? The repeal of
Section 52 could benefit anyone who owns the copyright in a wallpaper,
but not all wallpaper will qualify for copyright protection. That will
depend on, for example, whether the wallpaper meets the requisite
standards to qualify for copyright protection and is, for example,
sufficiently artistic and original. Ultimately, that will be a matter
for the courts to decide. The Government and the Design Council
consider that the repeal of Section 52 will benefit young designers, as
it should lead to UK designers developing new designs in markets that
become less dominated by copies of artistic works. I hope that noble
Lords find that particular example
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000014">It is
important to address the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson, concerning consultation. Indeed, it was an issue addressed
by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick. It concerns what consultation
there will be before the repeal of Section 52. The UK is one of the few
member states that has such an exemption. Further consideration will be
given when the Government consult on how and when to bring that into
force. Further to that, I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, that
the Government have discussed the repeal of Section 52 with interested
bodies, including representatives of sellers of replicas of classic
design furniture, such as Scott Howard Office Furniture. We 
<?notus-xml column=438?>have also had discussions with the Publishers Association, the chairman
of the IP Bar Association and Professor Lionel Bently.</hs_para>

consult formally on how and when the repeal should take effect. We want
to hear from affected firms to ensure that the right transitional
arrangements are in place to allow them to adjust—for example,
by modifying their supply agreements where necessary. The Government
believe that it will be business as usual for many British firms who
manufacture or sell affected
replicas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000016">The
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, highlighted the question of how Clause 65
is supported by designers. Designers argue that the law undermines the

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> Briefly, my Lords, if I may, I understand
everything that the Minister has said, but I was a bit flabbergasted by
the final statement that the Government have considered this very
carefully. The Minister mentioned a few people whom the consultation
had taken place with, but the fact is that those people who are
suggesting amendments are the very people with whom the consultation
has taken place—the Publishers Association and seven professors
of design who, after all, ought to know whether young designers are
going to benefit from this kind of provision. They have a clear view
when they are looking at young designers in the future. There are seven
of them, from the University of Cambridge, King’s College
London, the University of Glasgow, Oxford, University College London,
Bournemouth University and the University of Edinburgh. If they do not
know what is going on in the field, who does? They have grave concerns.
I felt that the Minister’s response was both disappointing and
rather dusty. Perhaps he could give some sort of undertaking to look at
this a bit more carefully than simply saying, “There is no
amendment possible to this clause; all that is available is
consultation over how it is brought into effect”. Surely that is
unacceptable in the light of all the concerns that have been raised
about Clause
65.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13012844000104" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000104">Viscount

everyone who has contributed to this debate. We all broadly sung much

incidental and substantive issues and the need to be careful that we do

afraid, though, that I echo the comments of the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones, by saying that I do not think that we got to the heart
of the debate here. To be fobbed off with the idea that somehow by
taking these rather extraordinary Henry VIII powers—probably on
the wrong legal basis and almost certainly heading in the direction of
a conclusion that almost no one else, given the same facts, would
arrive at—and then to be told that we can return to this once we

satisfactory way of going about
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000022">This
needs a bit more consideration and debate. As was said, many of the
issues here are not party-political in the sense of opening up great
divides between us. We all want a solution to this; I have said twice
that I am not against the idea that in the medium to long term we
should find a way of establishing a comparability of status for
industrial designers and those in the other creative industries. On the
other hand, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, life plus
70 years is a very long time. To change radically, in one
short clause in a Bill that is largely about other things, from 25
years to life plus 70 is a big step. We are not saying,
“Don’t do it”, but we are saying,
“Let’s talk about this a bit more and try to get a better
sense of what the issues are”. As someone said—I think
that it was the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton—we are concerned
about avoiding unintended consequences. There are some already, and we
have picked up several of them in the examples that we have given

wallpaper, I thought that hoping that the Hargreaves report would come
to the rescue was a little limp. We are not talking about the sort of
designs that might be found in commercially popular suppliers of cheap
paper and products; we are talking about those people who have
registered designs that they have utilised in a perfectly appropriate
way in their business to obtain a suitable return on their investment
for a number of years. That is changing from 25 years to life plus 70
where the registered design is in the ownership of the company. That is

Whitaker:</Member></B> My Lords, this group of amendments is about
Clause 65 as it affects the creators of the work and thus it has a
different slant. I apologise for not being able to speak at Second
Reading to indicate the line of the amendments in my name and that of
the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, but they are very much in the
spirit of the Government’s repeal of the exception provided in
Section 52 of the 1988 Act, which I applaud. I am glad to say that the
design industry is in favour of our amendments and I am grateful for
its expert
comments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000026">Amendment
28DA simply completes the protection for our creative designs that the
Government provide by their initial repeal by applying it also to works
of art made prior to June 1957. Most heavily copied classic designs,
such as the Eames chair, were created prior to 1957, so without this
amendment the Government’s repeal would be of limited value and,
incidentally, would leave the UK in breach of the European Court of
Justice’s decision in Flos, to which my noble friend Lord
Stevenson and other noble Lords have
referred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000027">Amendment
28FA also completes, I submit, the Government’s intention in
their repeal. The two provisions in it are almost consequential to
Clause 65. The amendment to Regulation 16 of the Duration of Copyright
and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995 ensures that the
regulations apply to copyrights that were never protected under
previous legislation but will be now. If Regulation 24 of those
regulations were not amended as we suggest, the making or import of
copyright-infringing articles would be permitted indefinitely, on
payment of a royalty, in cases where, for instance, a furniture design
has been revived. This again is incompatible with EU law. Without this
amendment, some of our most important and iconic designs would not
receive the protection that the Government appear to have in
mind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000028">Amendment
28EA ensures a short transition period of four months, but with the
possibility of a four-month extension if warranted, for third persons
who manufacture or who hold stocks of copies of design works within the
European Economic Area. Most of these replicas are not made in the
EEA—we all know where they are most likely to originate. The
repeal of Section 52 will not have any substantial impact on employment
or businesses in the UK, so it is reasonable to allow a short time for
them to comply, with a proportionate extension to strike a
balance—there we go again with balance—between the rights
of designers and the interests of undertakings caught by the new
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000029">In
conclusion, I draw noble Lords’ attention to the present
situation for our many talented designers who add so much to our
economic strength, as the Minister said. Because there has been
insufficient protection, 
<?notus-xml column=441?>the UK has become a safe haven for the sale of replicas of designs that
breach copyright. Only two other countries in Europe fall short of good
practice in this way: Estonia and Romania. Indeed, there are several
criminal prosecutions pending against UK-based suppliers in other
countries. The damage to the reputation of our design
market—potentially one of our great strengths—is immense.
No British jobs are at stake if we implement these amendments and fair
competition as well as our international reputation will be improved.
Our brilliant design businesses will have more security to develop. It
is a win-win prospect. I beg to

Baroness’s amendment. I, too, have had representations from the
organisations that represent designers, and emphasise one point made by
the noble Baroness: that many of these replicated designs are not made
in the EEA, and certainly not in the UK. One group conducted
considerable research on this subject and discovered that quite often a
UK name is linked with the design, but that when you go behind that you
find that it is largely a sham. It is quite clear that all this comes
from abroad, so merely repealing Section 52 by itself will not achieve
the Government’s intentions. As for their representing it as
being of considerable value to designers, I have to say that without
the two amendments in this group which the noble Baroness has tabled,
it will be largely
ineffective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:56:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

hope very much, therefore, that the Government will feel able to accept
these amendments. As the noble Baroness said, they complete the reform
which the repeal of Section 52 is intended to provide. They add nothing
that is extraneous to it, they merely make it effective, and I am sure
that that is what the Government want. I hope very much that my noble

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, I oppose these amendments.
It seems to me that the extension of copyright design from 25 years to
life plus 70 years is altogether excessive. That could amount to
something like 120 years, and it would be particularly unfortunate if
we were to extend the proposed provisions to apply to designs created
before 1957<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T17:57:42"></hs_TimeCode>. I
entirely support the principle of a fair return to designers and to
their estates, but it seems to me that 25 years is sufficient. I am not
in favour of protecting the monopoly of the purveyors of Eames chairs,
which my noble friend Lady Whitaker cited as an instance, or indeed of
Eileen Gray chairs or any other famous and beautiful designs that would
be affected by this amendment. It seems to me that the prices that are
charged to people who want to buy these pieces of furniture are quite
outrageous. I ask my noble friend Lady Whitaker in particular why good
design should be available only for the rich? I want to see Eames and
Gray designs for the
masses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000033">I
further note that the proposals in these amendments are protectionist.
That does not seem to me to be particularly constructive. They are keen
to keep out replicas that might be made elsewhere. If we were not to
perpetuate beyond 25 years the inhibition on manufacturing and
retailing in this country, we would 
<?notus-xml column=442?>do good to a significant sector of our economy and we would
enable the quality of life of a significant number of people to be
significantly improved. So personally I do not favour the amendments

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I speak to Amendments 28E and
28F. The Government, and indeed the IPO, published a factsheet on
copyright protection for designs, but with the best will in the world
this was not adequate, especially in the absence of an impact
assessment. The Government need to provide detail in the Bill on the
transitional arrangements that they intend to introduce. Without clear
and explicit communication about those arrangements, manufacturers and
others affected—we have heard that considerable numbers will be
affected—will not feel confident that their works and therefore
businesses will not be affected. Waiting for the Bill to pass before
consulting on transitional arrangements is surely unacceptable and
creates a climate of uncertainty. The Government need to be clear as to
what they believe is an acceptable and legal transition period. Under
European law, the UK Government may have limited scope to introduce
transitional arrangements that would be broad enough to mitigate a
significant and detrimental impact on third parties. We know that, at
the very least, a period of 10 years’ transition has been ruled
by the ECJ as being too long, so it is vital to know what period of
transition the UK Government believe would be in compliance. Will the
Government provide an impact assessment to analyse the effect of
various transitional provisions under the clause on the publishing and
other third parties? My amendments put forward two rather different
suggestions for the transitional period for replicas of artistic
designs and are an attempt to tease out the Government’s real
intentions. The first amendment is very similar to that put forward by
the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, and is designed to flush out the
process by which the Government intend to introduce transitional
provisions. The second, along the lines of that of the noble Baroness,
Lady Whitaker, is designed to probe the actual transitional
provisions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:01:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000035">Amendment
28F would ensure a short—six months is more reasonable than
four—transitional period for products manufactured within the
EEA, and third persons that hold stocks of unsold items in the EEA.
That is a variation of the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness,
Lady Whitaker. It also foresees a six-month extension if a third party
provides justification of some exceptional circumstances. The design
companies say that most companies offering replicas of artistic designs
do not manufacture those products in the EEA. We heard that from the
noble Baroness and from the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. They say that most
replicas are imported from Asia. Has an assessment been made of this,
and has it been assessed as part of the likely transitional periods? A
six-month transitional period under Amendment 28F could be extended up
to 12 months. It would also be in line with EU law by being
proportionate and not going beyond what is needed to ensure an
appropriate balance between the interests of the right holders and the
legitimate expectations of the parties
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:02:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:02:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 28DA seeks to
ensure that copyright is revived in works of artistic craftsmanship
created before 1957. This would apply, for example, to works such as
the Wassily chair, designed by Marcel Breuer in 1925 to 1926. Chairs
seem to be a favourite theme today. The noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker,
mentioned a chair; I was not entirely clear what type of chair it
was.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000037">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:03:40"></hs_TimeCode>
law in this area is complicated, but the term directive is clear. If
the chair was protected by copyright in any other member state before
1995, copyright would also have to apply in the United Kingdom.
Amendment 28FA also concerns those works in which copyright is revived.
It seeks to remove those provisions which impose an obligation on the
owner of a revived work to grant a licence even if he would prefer not
to do so. The noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, has raised an interesting
point with this amendment that deserves further consideration. We shall
have the opportunity to consider these very specific issues more
carefully before the clause is commenced and there will be the
opportunity to deal with the issue in the relevant
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000038">Amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:04:21"></hs_TimeCode>

supply contracts and leases for warehouses where products are stored. I
confirm to the Committee that we intend that existing stock in the UK
will not be affected by the change in the law; the change will apply
only to items manufactured or imported after that date. If an express

put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson. The stated aim of Clause
66 is to ensure that where secondary legislation is used to amend
copyright exceptions, the existing penalties for copyright infringement
would remain unchanged. This is stated in paragraph 506 of the
Explanatory Notes. This stated aim by itself is unobjectionable.
However, throughout the Bill’s passage through the Commons, MPs
and outside organisations expressed serious concerns regarding the wide
drafting of the clause—then Clause 56 and 57. The
drafting was too broad and potentially involved the Government having
significantly greater powers to alter copyright exceptions by secondary
legislation than they currently enjoy. The Government amended this
clause at Report. An amendment introduced at Report in the Commons
permits the Secretary of State by order to change copyright exceptions
within the scope permitted under subsection (2) of section 2 of the
European Communities Act 1972—implementing European
directives—and repeals paragraph 1(1)(d) of Schedule 2 to the EC
Act in respect of such changes.</hs_para>

cover the scope of Clause 66. The Government recognise that concerns
about this clause remain, despite their efforts to clarify the scope
through a government amendment on Report in the Commons. The Government
have looked carefully at these amendments and I believe that we
understand the intentions of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson. However,
we believe there is the possibility that the amendments as currently
drafted would in fact widen the scope of the Government’s power
to effect changes in this area with respect to criminal penalties. I do
not believe that that is what the noble Lord intended through his
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000061">The
Government’s intention with this clause has always been to
maintain the current level of criminal penalties whenever it is
required to amend or remove copyright exceptions. However, there remain
concerns about this clause, as reflected in the intention behind the

again at what more can be done to ensure the clause does exactly what

an earlier version of Clause 66 was the subject of extensive
debate in the House of Commons, particularly in Committee. As a
consequence of the points raised, the clause is amended, and I welcome
the fact that the Minister has indicated a further amendment to give
greater clarity about the intention behind the Bill since then. The
primary intention behind this clause is to allow new exceptions to
copyright to be accompanied by the introduction of higher criminal
penalties for infringement: the power which the Government do not have
under the ECA.</hs_para>

copyright-owners in the creative industries are very concerned
even—we heard concern expressed earlier, notably by the noble
Lord, Lord Stevenson—that secondary legislation will be used

earlier, following Hargreaves the Government proposed, and have started
implementing, a copyright hub that without legislation and by the
voluntary participation of rights-holders and users is intended to
solve the problems perceived by Hargreaves, at which the exceptions by
and large are directed. Therefore, there are many who claim that those
exceptions are
unnecessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000069">However,
even if secured by secondary legislation, exceptions that impact so
greatly on the UK’s creative industry sector should not be
bundled in a take it or leave it fashion, which would not allow the
varying impacts of such proposals on separate creative sectors to be
appropriately taken into account. At the very least, they should be
accompanied by individual impact 
<?notus-xml column=448?>assessments and introduced in separate SIs. In the recent <I>Modernising
Copyright</I> White Paper, it is stated that the Government intend to
make changes to copyright exceptions in the smallest number of
statutory instruments. Therefore, if secondary legislation is to be
used, each proposed exception to copyright should be subject to an
individual statutory instrument, contrary to that statement. Rights
holders are concerned that the introduction of any new copyright
exceptions, whether through Clause 66 or the ECA, must be done through
careful consideration of each individual exception.</hs_para>

other possibility—that exceptions be bundled together in a
single statutory instrument—would prevent Parliament being able
to accept some changes while rejecting others. Such a
take-it-or-leave-it approach to copyright reform is wholly unsuited to
the nuance and detail of the subject and risks there being a fudge
across a number of different issues—for example, conflating
questions around photocopying educational text books with the question
of burning
CDs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012844000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000071">There
may, however, be some exceptions which are linked and which could be
dealt with together. Some of the exceptions are interrelated. For
example, I gather that the IPO believes that the exception on private
study links with the exception for research and with the exception
which permits libraries to copy for a researcher. Therefore, there is
not an unreasonable demand where there are links. It will be important
to ensure that changes across exceptions are consistent, and separate
SIs for each proposed change could lead to problems of inconsistent
law.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012844000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0001.htm#13012844000072">Each
proposed exception should have its own associated economic impact
assessment. As the economic evidence which accompanied the Hargreaves
review of IP and growth sadly demonstrated, the economic analysis
underpinning some proposed changes to copyright is either lacking or
flawed. Officials have indicated that new impact assessments will be
published alongside any proposed changes to copyright, and I would
certainly welcome reassurance from the Minister that that will be the
case. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak briefly to
Amendment 28JA. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and I have
discussed the issue of separate statutory instruments for each
exception. As he said, they may have totally different effects and it
would be quite difficult for the House to debate one single compendium
of exceptions when they may involve very different interests and very
different impacts. Mentioning impacts leads me to say that, if there
are to be separate statutory instruments for each change passed under
this clause, there should be separate impact statements.</hs_para>

collected the impact statement for this Bill from the Printed Paper
Office. I have not attempted to weigh it but it is about two inches
thick and I must confess that I have not waded through it. Of course,
the Bill contains a whole range of issues but one realises that, when
departments produce impact assessments on this scale, you have to be a
very devoted Peer and have plenty of time to be able to make anything
of them. I suspect that some of the changes that may be envisaged as
being achieved by order under this clause may be wholly
unexceptionable, in 
<?notus-xml column=449?>which case so be it. However, there may be some which will be very
controversial and should be properly debated, in which case they should
have a separate impact assessment. That is the burden of the amendment

account of it when he responds.</hs_para>

that it is realistic and practical for Parliament. There may be
problems in that, as has already been suggested, the material contained
within different statutory instruments may overlap with other statutory
instruments to a degree, in which case one must proceed pragmatically.
But it is right in principle that Parliament should have the maximum
opportunity to examine secondary legislation. One could say that the
more minimalist the primary legislation the more important it is to
ensure that the secondary legislation that stems from it is thoroughly
scrutinised.</hs_para>

more thoroughly in this House. We have committees of the House that

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, before introducing amendments
to this clause, I should like first to set out how the provisions in
this clause will 
<?notus-xml column=453?>work. This is a complex area, and I understand some greater clarity may
be helpful. At present, certain unpublished works that were created
before 1 August 1989 remain in copyright until 2039. This is
because of transitional provisions applying when the 1988 copyright Act
was introduced. The transitional provisions mean that works such as
centuries’ old unpublished letters or manuscripts remain in
copyright until 2039. This is far beyond the standard terms of
copyright required by the EU term directive 2006. Many of these works
are orphan because it is not possible to contact the rights holder,
possibly now a long-lost historical figure, to ask permission to
reproduce
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000025">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:38:55"></hs_TimeCode>
illustrate the scale of the problem, the National Archives estimate
that around 12 million or 42% of the 30 million archival items held in
English and Welsh public archives predate 1891. The vast majority of
these are thought to be unpublished and would therefore remain in
copyright until 2039 under the current law. Clause 67 will allow the
Secretary of State to reduce the length of copyright term for these
works. But, and importantly, the length of term cannot be reduced
beyond the minimum requirements of the term directive. I should like to
stress that it is only when the date 2039 is later than the date that
the term directive would produce that any reduction in term would
occur, such as when 2039 gives more than life plus 70 years for an
unpublished literary work by a known
author<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:37:52"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:39:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T18:39:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000026">For
example, the only literary works that could have their terms reduced
will be those where the known author died before 1969 or, in the case
of unknown authors, where the work was created before 1969. This is
because unpublished literary works by known authors will receive
copyright protection for the duration of their life plus 70 years from
the year they died. Unpublished literary works by unknown authors will
receive protection for 70 years from the year the work was
created.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000027">In
the case of photographs, the only ones which could potentially be
subject to a reduction in term are unpublished photographs taken
between 1 June 1957 and 1 January 1969. Where the photographer is known
and died before 1 January 1969, the new term would become 70 years from
the year the photographer died. If the photographer is unknown, the
term would be 70 years from the year the photograph was
created.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000028">The
term directive specifies different terms for different types of works
in different circumstances so it is not possible to list them all now.
I have a more detailed note available here today, which I will also
place in the House Library, of what this means for different works.
Many of the works that currently enjoy a longer term of copyright than
that required by the term directive are orphan works. Reducing the term
of copyright to the usual levels will bring many of these works out of
copyright. This will reduce the overall number of works classed as
orphan and is part of the solution to the orphan works
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000029">The
Government are bringing forward two amendments to Clause 67. This
follows further consideration on the scope of the clause and in
response to the observations made by the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee report published on 
<?notus-xml column=454?>14 December 2012. We accept that the scope of this clause would benefit
from clarification. The amendments will therefore remove the references
to “published but anonymous or pseudonymous” works and
clarify that the power is limited by the EU Term Directive 2006. We
have concluded that most anonymous and pseudonymous published works are
unlikely to be subject to the 2039 transitional provisions. As such,
these types of work need not be included in the scope of the power.
This amendment means that Clause 67 now applies only to unpublished
works, subject to the transitional provisions that currently enjoy
copyright protection for longer than the standard periods of protection
specified in the term
directive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000030">The

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister introduced his
amendment very fairly but I must admit that Clause 67 still baffles me.
I think that I understand the term directive. The Minister has produced
a splendid schematic of all the different rights that might be affected
in these circumstances, especially where copyright will be brought back
from 2039. However, I am still baffled to some degree as to why we need
to go the whole hog as regards Clause 67. Technically, I suppose that I
am speaking to the clause stand part debate. Originally, the clause was
much more objectionable. It is now much more clearly tied to the term
directive. However, what is the real motivation of the clause?
I think that all of us are very sympathetic to the idea of
medieval manuscripts and other old material being taken out of
copyright so that they can be digitised. However, the museums, the
British Library and others have made the point—whether publicly
or otherwise—that in practice there are no copyright claims or
difficulties and that by and large they have gone ahead and digitised
and have not had any problems in doing
so.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13012850000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000073">6.45

quite interesting and extraordinary is that the British Library notes
that it has material from the fourth century that is still subject to
copyright restrictions. I have no idea why that should be the case, but
it surely shows that our laws have unintended consequences. Trying to
get to grips with why this is needed, one could say as a good European
that conforming to the European term directive is desirable, but there
are always unintended consequences.</hs_para>

shall put forward are two authors who died before 1969. TS Eliot died
in 1965. His published work is protected for 70 years from the end of
1965 and his unpublished work, in the ordinary course, would lose
protection at the end of 2039. However, Clause 67 would give the
Secretary of State power to curtail the term of Eliot’s
copyright in his unpublished work. Such unpublished work exists.
His late wife, Valerie, was editing her husband’s
correspondence. 
<?notus-xml column=455?>What happens in those circumstances? A slightly longer ago example is
cited by the Society of Authors. Ford Maddox Ford, the author of the
novel sequence <I>Parade’s End</I>, which was recently so well
adapted by the BBC, died in 1939. What will happen to his unpublished
work in those circumstances? There are prominent authors in these
circumstances. Sometimes it is correspondence, sometimes it is
unpublished work, and the consequences of Clause 67 and the application
of the term directive will be
large.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000034">I

Blackstone:</Member></B> My Lords, I should declare an interest as
chairman of the board of the British Library. The library supports this
clause, and I hope that other speakers will do so as well. Unpublished
works account for a very large proportion of orphan works and include
very old material that remains under copyright. The British Library has
examples, going back not to the fourth century, as the noble Lord said,
but certainly to the seventh century, which are still subject to
copyright restrictions. Much unpublished material is of enormous
importance from the point of view of scholarship and some of it is of
unique quality. It comprises a large part of the important digitisation
project that the British Library has undertaken and wishes to continue.
It is important that this clause is retained because it will produce a
position where more work of this sort can be digitised and made
available to a wider range of people than is currently the

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 28KA, I shall
speak also to Amendments 28LA and 28LB. These amendments
provide for implementation of the EU orphaned works directive in
substitution for the Government’s proposals. The directive
provides for non-commercial use of orphan works by cultural
institutions. Although the permitted use is non-commercial, the
directive allows sales to recover costs. The major question here is why
we are going further than the EU orphan works directive, which EU
countries have to implement within two years of this September when the
directive was passed. It specifically makes provision for museums,
galleries, archives and libraries, educational establishments and
public service broadcasts to make use of orphan works. These are all
essentially cultural institutions. It may not be a perfect directive at
this stage, but surely if it will apply in 27 countries, we should
build on it. We can, of course, use the new digital hub to good
advantage when applying the provisions of the
directive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000044">The
Government’s proposals under Clause 68 go much further by
permitting exploitation for commercial purposes, which is a matter of
real concern to many, particularly the creators of images, where the
metadata has been stripped and attribution lost. That is the reason
that equivalent provisions failed to get through Parliament under the
Digital Economy Bill before the previous general
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000045">Has
no account been taken of photographers’ strong concerns, voiced
during the passage of the Bill and in the Hargreaves consultation? The
impetus for orphan work licensing comes largely from cultural
institutions. The provisions of the directive, therefore, should
largely satisfy the need for orphan licensing among those institutions.
On 13 September 2012, the orphan works directive was passed, and it
must be implemented within two years. Digitisation for preservation and
replacement of any work and supplying copies of unpublished work to
other libraries, unless the author has forbidden it, is already
permitted under current UK copyright law.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012850000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000046">On the other hand, the
proposed measure in Clause 68 is designed to make orphan
works available for commercial exploitation. That measure would deprive
rights holders of their property simply because they have not been
found by the would-be user of their work, although the Government have
not yet formulated the rules and do not intend to publish them until
after the measure has been enacted. Being exercisable by secondary
legislation, they will not be fully subject to parliamentary
scrutiny.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000047">Those
are some of the problems which are not dealt with in the measure. Many
works contain other copyright works, such as photographs or
illustrations. Unlike the EU directive, there is nothing to protect the
owners of those copyrights if the overall work is declared an orphan.
Diligent search has been used in a number of fields for many years and
produces a high level of false orphans. That is because copyright does
not have to be registered and there are no definitive registries of the
ownership of copyright works. Some types of works, such as photographs
and illustrations, are especially easy to separate from the information
about their creators—I mentioned the issues about metadata
earlier. 
<?notus-xml column=458?>In particular, foreign copyright holders are likely to be unaware of the
provisions and so will be more likely to lose out as others exploit
their works commercially in the UK. Primary legislation should
not allow orphan works provisions beyond the EU orphan works directive
until it has been drafted to give the same standard of
protection to creators as are provided under the
directive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000048">Great
concerns have been expressed not only by photographers but by a whole
range of others, such as AP, British Pathé, Getty
Images, ITN, the Press Association and Thomson Reuters, which are UK,
European and worldwide news agencies and audiovisual archives; and
FOCAL International, which is the industry body representing commercial
and audiovisual archives throughout the

provisions in the clause are premature and should not be introduced in
the Bill. If there are flaws in the directive—there may well
be—surely we should work on them rather than erecting a totally
separate definition of orphan works, which will have few equivalents
anywhere else in the world and will certainly be of no use in
international rights clearance. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000050"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Howarth of Newport" PimsId="4870" UID="13012850000094" xid="1872" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000094">Lord
Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments
28LA and 28LB, which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has
introduced. I see these issues very differently from the way that he
does. I am sure that he would agree that it would be a pity if
we in the Committee excessively polarised the issues of
contemporary creators against those of our great cultural institutions
and the public, who benefit from the work of those institutions and
could benefit so much more if a larger part of their collections were
to be made
accessible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012850000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000051">The
simple answer to the question raised by the noble Lord, both on Second
Reading and just now—why we should go beyond the provisions of
the European Union orphan works directive—is simply that the
directive does not go far enough; it is too limited. Only public sector
bodies and educational establishments, not companies, can benefit.
That means that public/private partnerships, and even
cultural bodies, are prevented from working in partnership with the
private sector. Mass digitisation, which would confer very great
benefits for the public, is best carried out with private sector
contractors and partners. In that way, the production is made possible
for global educational markets.</hs_para>

directive sets the bar for diligent search too high. It requires
diligent search for each individual copyright work, even if embedded in
another. For example, a postcard could involve rights in the stamp on
the postcard, the design of the postcard itself or the text of the
postcard. It is absurd to require that every component of a single
item, which is almost certainly an orphan work, should be subject to
exhaustive diligent search. If that is to be the requirement, it will
simply mean that large volumes of material will never be cleared for
use.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012850000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012850000053">Unlike
the provisions of this Bill, the European Union directive does not
facilitate payment to relevant owners. The use of orphan works in
publications—books 
<?notus-xml column=459?>and articles, for example—would be prohibited. Limiting the scope
of licences to non-commercial purposes would restrict the ability of
universities, libraries and museums to raise revenue through
exhibitions that included orphan works. It is not realistic to try to
maintain a barrier between non-commercial and commercial activities and
uses in cultural, educational and academic environments. I believe that
there are risks to rights owners that would actually be averted by the
provisions of the Bill.</hs_para>

think that that is entirely appropriate. I would say that rights
holders have nothing to fear from academic and cultural institutions.
They themselves are generators, as well as active users, of copyright.
As users of copyright, they have a long history of respecting and
clearing rights. They have no intention whatever of jeopardising the
rights of creators. Indeed, libraries and archives, knowing the
background of their own collections, will not infrequently be in a
better position to search for a rights holder than would a collecting
society representing mainstream commercial material. Orphan works
licensing will provide a new incentive for institutions to search and
secure a licence for assumed orphan works and so potentially will
increase the number of rights holders who will benefit financially from
their work.</hs_parafo>

Blackstone briefly explained to the Committee just now in a previous
debate, it is essential to find means of licensing orphan works. Many
forms of expression—the speaking notes of the Minister or of the
noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, correspondence, diaries, blogs, private
photographs, the archives of clubs and societies, official archives and
oral histories—are all covered by copyright and, of their
nature, will not be represented by collecting societies, but they are
potentially too important to stay in limbo. They need to be treated
differently from material that was originally produced commercially.
The noble Lord worried about depriving rights holders, but there is no
question of that. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will not allow
these amendments to find favour.</hs_para>

this debate between the needs of cultural institutions, scholars and
researchers and the requirement in the 21st century that we should 
<?notus-xml column=460?>be able to digitise material en masse, which should include orphan
works. Until now, it has required huge amounts of time and
effort—pointless time and effort—to try to establish who
the authors of these so-called orphan works are, usually with
absolutely no useful result. Therefore, I very much hope that the
Committee will reject these amendments and support Clause 68 as it
stands. I hope that when the regulations are formulated, they will be

Universities UK, the British Library and the Wellcome Trust have all
explained in considerable detail why the orphan works provisions must

Greenway:</Member></B> My Lords, I have every sympathy with the aims of
the British Library, the Wellcome Foundation and others. However, I
should like to bring the debate back to the photography angle. I am a
photographer and there was a time when I used to make my living as a
photographer, although I no longer have the time to do that. However, I
have a considerable archive of my own photographs and photographs that
I have acquired over very many years. In effect, I have what could be
termed a small photo
library.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000002">I am
concerned about this measure because copyright is, and always has been,
a minefield. To my mind, what we are doing here risks making it even
more of a minefield. What will be the position for the large number of
photo libraries which, after all, make their living from selling
reproduction rights for photographs? They are worried that they will be
badly affected by this Bill. They do not think that there has been
enough consultation. There is a risk that, if the Bill goes through as
it stands, some of them could go out of
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000003">I
find this business of orphan works difficult to comprehend. I have lots
of photographs that could well be orphan works. I have no idea who took
them. Some of them are 100 years old and were taken in other parts of
the world. Do I have to license all those photographs and pay money
into an account that may well build up into a huge sum of money and
will be sitting there, most of the time unused, when such 
<?notus-xml column=461?>money could be used, especially by photo agencies, to increase their
business in other ways? I find the whole thing exceedingly confusing. I
would welcome the Minister pouring some light on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Brinton" PimsId="5945" UID="13012853000112" xid="2149" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000112">Baroness
Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to add my voice to the
“Me toos” of the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, and the noble
Baronesses, Lady Blackstone and Lady Warwick. I do not support these
amendments and I support the retention of Clause 68. I will not repeat
the very helpful points that were made earlier. Some other points that
have been made by the National Museum Directors’ Council show
the real problems with making the amendments work. This is not just an
issue of not being able to identify or trace the rights holders; any
activity requiring permission from the rights holders cannot happen
because that in itself infringes copyright. This severely impacts on
what an institution can do with the work. For example, a museum may
display an orphan work but it cannot digitise that work for display in
its catalogue, put it online, advertise it in any other way or have it
as part of a picture on a postcard, as was talked about earlier. That
makes a much bigger problem. The practical problem is that the work
will be put into store. There are 4 million orphan photographs and
documents in the Imperial War Museum stores at the moment, and 11
million orphan works occupying 180 kilometres of shelf space—the
distance between here and Bath. At the Natural History Museum, there
are approximately 125,000 art works and 200,000 notebooks, which they
suspect are orphan works, as well as 1.3 kilometres of
manuscripts—that is, here to Buckingham Palace.</hs_para>

here, particularly in these times of austerity. Earlier, we discussed
the borderline between what is commercial and what is not commercial,
certainly for universities, where I have worked for more than two
decades, as have the noble Baronesses, Lady Blackstone and Lady
Warwick. In these times of austerity, universities and other public
organisations are being encouraged to be as commercial as possible and
to find other sources of income in order to help to minimise the
reliance on public funds. That is also true for the museums, libraries
and archives world. The problem with these amendments is that they
would make it so complicated that the orphan works would just sit in
those stores for ever. Even if we do not know who owns the work, that
does not mean that it is culturally insignificant. I believe that the
public would be horrified if they thought that such a large number of
works were inaccessible and banned for ever because tracing the rights
holder, their heirs and successors was impossible.</hs_para>

solution is a helpful one that will allow UK museums, libraries,
archives and universities to produce much better exhibitions and
displays for wider public knowledge and education. I think it will also
facilitate the more effective use of public funding and reduce the
almost impossible task of tracing the rights holders of some of these
works. I pick up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, just
now about what happens to accumulated funds, but frankly that is
something that the Government need to address. It is right that there
should be protection for rights holders, and I think that the
organisations that 
<?notus-xml column=462?>we have mentioned this evening are more than happy to pay a licence fee
that reflects the commercial nature of an item where it is clearly very
commercial, but I remain concerned that where there is no commercial
rate, even a very small fee for an item in a museum might make the
museum decide not to display it.</hs_para>

the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, on the EU
directive. It is only a partial solution to the orphan works problem.
It does not allow, for example, the models of public/private
partnership that would fund the digitising of large archives; nor does
it allow for any revenue-raising activities using orphan works. The
revenue raised is limited to the cost and preservation of the item, or
to making it available to the public. The EU directive on its own does
not recognise the reality of public-private boundaries in our top
universities, museums, libraries and archives
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lucas" PimsId="1570" UID="13012853000113" xid="1324" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000113">Lord
Lucas:</Member></B> My Lords, I am not going to give any comfort to my
noble friend Lord Clement-Jones on this, I am afraid. There is an awful
lot to be gained from the orphan works clauses in opening up our
cultural heritage and allowing us to share it. We absolutely need that
to be a commercial enterprise as well as a public enterprise. For those
who are active and fear that their works, particularly photographs, are
going to become part of someone’s orphan collection, I say that
there are things out there on the internet. There is TinEye for
photographs, Shazam for music and Turnitin for text. All you have to
do—and presumably the Government will do this when they come to
say what diligent research is—is to make sure that you have
registered your photographs with TinEye and then they can be found. I
can recommend Shazam to anyone who does not have it as an app on their
smartphone. It listens to the music and will tell you who is playing
what. The tools are there. We do not have to wait for the copyright
hub, although that will be useful when it comes. It merely uses these
tools as ways of identifying the music or the photographs. We have the
means, as long as people declare themselves to be a copyright owner, to
make sure that they are
found.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13012853000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000107">7.15

he wishes me to say at the end of the

there are a couple of things that are worth picking out of this very
good debate. The question of photography and photographers is not yet
well resolved. That is true in general terms because, in particular,
the metadata problem affects photographers more than anyone else, and
we have to be very sensible about that. When he comes to respond, I
should be grateful to have the Minister’s comments on whether he
foresees any particular difficulty
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000011">Like
other noble Lords, I have received a number of communications from
photographers in recent weeks. One of them, from Leon Neal, struck me
as being of particular interest because the argument being made is 
<?notus-xml column=463?>that the impact that this clause will have in relation to photography is
substantial. I think we take that point, but he points out that a
number of the decisions that will be affected will be very dependent on
whether the copyright hub works. In saying that, he wonders whether the
Government have in mind giving the copyright hub a chance to get going
to see whether it has a solution for the particular problems of
photographers that would decrease the requirement for this legislation
to be as prescriptive as it is. I am not sure whether I can agree on
the basis of this correspondence, but it is something that the Minister
should reflect on, and perhaps he can come back to it at that stage.
Leon Neal wrote: “I request that you please support the proposal
to delay the directive implementation until the October 2014 deadline
and then only implement it to relieve any of the restrictions that the
copyright hub has failed to address”. That seems a very
sensible suggestion.</hs_para>

line with that, we are aware that the way in which the Government are
progressing on this is to take the powers that are set out in Section
68, which we broadly support, and work out the details of the scheme to
be brought forward through, presumably, secondary legislation at a
later stage. In order to help them with that, they have set up a
collective licensing working group, which is presumably also looking at
orphan works. The group meets regularly, I understand. It has been
going for four months, so perhaps it has not got very far in its
discussions. The list that I have seen includes publishers, authors,
visual artists, musicians, broadcasters and potential users of the
schemes, which all seems very good. Of course, there is a missing
group: photographers. When he comes to reply, will the Minister give us
some assurance that photographers’ interests—perhaps he
should co-opt the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, to his
discussions—can be taken into
account?</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 28LA would limit
the scope of the UK orphan works scheme to that of the EU directive on
orphan works. The proposed UK scheme in Clause 68 is intended to
complement the EU directive. The exception provided for in the
directive is more narrowly focused on enabling the cultural use of
orphan works, specifically the digitisation of, and cross-border online
access to, orphan works in libraries and archives. The directive does
not prohibit the UK developing a domestic scheme for licensing orphan
works within the UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000014">The noble
Lord, Lord Howarth, raised the issue of whether the EU directive can be
widely used. I agree that the range of the EU directive is extremely
limited. The same sentiments were expressed by my noble friend Lady
Brinton. It would not be adequate for the purposes of copyright
licensing as proposed by Richard Hooper’s work. Use of orphan
works under the directive is limited to publicly accessible libraries,
archives and public-sector broadcasters. The directive also allows for
the generation of revenue to cover only the costs of digitising orphan
works that are made available to the public. This does not allow any
kind of distribution, such as publication in a book or TV programme.
The directive also does not 
<?notus-xml column=464?>cover photographs, which make up a significant proportion of the orphan
works held by archives, libraries and museums.</hs_para>

Government’s proposals are about opening up the commercial and
economic potential of orphan works. It was clear from the responses to
the Government’s copyright consultation that there are many
desirable uses that could be made of orphan works which
would have a commercial element—for example,
reproductions in exhibition catalogues, books or television
documentaries.</hs_para>

the UK scheme would allow broader commercial as well as non-commercial
use, we are proposing a key extra safeguard which is not in the
directive. This is the requirement for the diligent search to be
verified by an independent authorising body. Allowing commercial use of
orphan works will not undercut the market for non-orphan works. In many
cases, there is unlikely to be a comparable non-orphan work that could
be used instead—for example, unique records of historical
events. In any event, the Government’s proposals will provide
for remuneration to be set at a rate appropriate for the type of work
and its proposed
use.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000017">Amendment
28LB would remove four paragraphs from Clause 68 in respect of the
proposed orphan works scheme. These paragraphs set out various issues
that the regulations either must or may cover and contain the key
safeguards for rights holders that will underpin the scheme. This
includes the fundamental safeguard that a diligent search for rights
holders must have been undertaken before a work can qualify as orphan.
My noble friend Lord Clement-Jones, asked whether foreign rights
holders would lose out. I can confirm that a diligent search will be
needed to check for foreign rights holders,
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000018">Another
key safeguard that the amendment would remove is the requirement that
the orphan works authorising body must be independent and therefore
cannot license itself to use an orphan work. The regulations could
still contain such safeguards even if they were removed from
the Bill. However, the Government’s view is that these
safeguards are such an integral part of the proposals for an orphan
works scheme that they should be set out in the primary
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000019">I

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
reply, and other noble Lords for their not always helpful responses. I
was very struck, however, 
<?notus-xml column=465?>and think it very telling that the noble Lord, Lord Greenway,
raised the concerns of photographers. That is really at the heart of
much of the objection to the proposals for the orphan works
legislation, but it does go wider. As I mentioned earlier, it extends
to the news agencies and photo libraries, which have very strong
concerns, particularly because at the moment—and despite what
the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said—we do not have the copyright
hub fully in place. That would make a huge difference to the ability to
carry out diligent search and identify circumstances where metadata has
been stripped from contemporary photographs, which have effectively
been turned into orphans. This is one of the problems. Photographers
are worried about the possibility of a cynical exercise whereby a
photograph is turned into an orphan by stripping the metadata, and, lo
and behold, the diligence search is inadequate and it is treated as an
orphan. There are uses for commercial purposes, not just by cuddly
museums, universities and cultural institutions making an honest penny
out of books in their shops, but by fully commercial publishers. So
there is considerable concern, and it is not a question of polarising
the debate but recognising the concerns underlying these orphan works
proposals, which are held by substantial numbers of creators and rights
holders. The European directive is, as I said clearly, not perfect in
every respect, but to allay the fears of many it is better to build on
that than have legislation that explicitly goes far beyond what has
been
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000023">Clearly,
I will not win the argument today—certainly not in the light of
the Minister’s response. I am worried about foreign rights
holders; I do not believe that diligent search will be that
straightforward where foreign rights are concerned. I think that the
IPO will find that a lot of concern is expressed as the regulations and
the clause come into effect. It has already been expressed in letters
to the Secretary of State and to the former Intellectual Property
Minister. I suspect that the volume of correspondence from those
foreign rights holders will increase over time.</hs_para>

what everyone has had to say. It may even be that I come back with a
suitable response on various issues that have been raised here today. I
believe that digitisation is a great deal more straightforward than it
has been alleged today. For instance, my noble friend spent most of the
time arguing for orphan works. At no point in this debate have I argued
against the concept of orphan works; I think that they could be
usefully employed, constrained within the right limits. In the mean

orphan works provisions satisfactorily. The most important question in
that context was how the licensing system needs to operate. The system
needs adequately to protect the interests of the orphan works copyright
owners and to be efficient and cost-effective. It is vital that the
operation of a licensing system is planned in a pragmatic way that
considers the needs of different licensees of orphan works. One way to
ensure the efficiency of the system is to make the best use of the
existing licensing systems of collecting societies. Collecting
societies are in a position to process complex usage data and allocate
fees for such licences as broadcasters.</hs_para>

any orphan works licensing scheme includes certain safeguards to

Section 116A set out certain conditions under which a licence to use an
orphaned work may be granted. However, there is not enough detail in
the Bill. The amendments provide that detail. To avoid confusion, I
should say that Amendment 28S is part of this

new Section 116A specifies that each individual work must be subject to
a diligent search for the rights owner. The nature of that diligent
search, however, needs to be specified. It cannot be assumed that a
work is orphan unless a diligent search of each individual work in
question has been carried out. New Section 116A(3) sets this out only
in general terms. There are discussions taking place in the working
group on orphan works, which include defining what constitutes a
diligent search. We need to hear the Minister set out what the
Government believe must be included in any diligent search, and what
sector specific guidelines are likely to be
provided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000030">Thirdly,

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments have at
least enabled us to discuss some very important issues. I want to
concentrate on the question of diligent search. Whether the proposed
United Kingdom orphan works licensing scheme will work depends on
whether the regulations ensure that the requirements for diligent
search are proportionate and manageable. Unless the time and cost of
diligent search are reduced in appropriate circumstances for cultural
and academic institutions they, for the most part, will not bother to
attempt to use the orphan works in their collections. The noble
Baroness, Lady Brinton, briefly described the scale and quantity of
orphan works that it is believed are in our national collections. It is
thought, for example, that some 50% of archive collections consist of
orphan works. There are three very interesting and helpful pages in the
impact assessment. I keep on praising the impact
assessment—counter-culturally—which gives instances of
the scale of orphan works in particular collections and the prodigious
volumes of time, effort and cost that would be required to perform a
diligent search item by item on all of them.</hs_para>

to be proportionate, they will take account of the nature of the work
in question, for example whether it was originally produced for
commercial purposes or was unpublished; the use that is proposed for
the work—whether, for example, it is intended that there should
be free access to it for educational or cultural benefits to the
public; a realistic assessment of any risks to potential rights
holders; and the feasibility of tracing rights holders. I understand it
is the Government’s intention that there should be
proportionality in the way the regulations stipulate the requirement
for diligent search. However, I would be grateful if the Minister could
enlarge on the Government’s intentions in this regard. I hope he
will be able to give some comfort to those of us who believe it is
important to remove unnecessary obstacles to making orphan works
accessible.</hs_para>

are totally unrealistic. To require a diligent search for each
individual work, regardless of the practicalities, would make
digitising orphan works in major areas impossibly time consuming and
expensive. Therefore, that would be unreasonable and disproportionate.
I hope that my noble friends will not wish to pursue amendments to that
effect. I hope the Minister will be able to give us comfort in what he
tells us about the Government’s intentions in this
area.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:34:29"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Warwick of Undercliffe:</Member></B> My Lords, I also comment on the
question of diligent search. I agree that we need clarification about
what will constitute diligent search, but I would worry if we set the
bar too high, and these amendments ask us to set a very high bar
indeed. Many noble Lords appreciate the time and effort involved in
tracing the authors of some categories of work. It is essential that
this is proportionate to the type of material involved and the
likelihood of finding the owner.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the
amendments cover both the scope and detail of the proposals
for a UK orphan works scheme. Amendment 28L
would  
<?notus-xml column=469?>limit who could be authorised to grant licences to use
an orphan work and de facto would mean that only a
collecting society already operating in the sector could be authorised
to grant licences. The amendment assumes that all orphan works will be
licensed by collecting societies. However, many orphan works are simply
not of a type that is licensed collectively—unpublished works,
diaries, old photographs and oral history recordings, for example.
There will therefore need to be a separate independent authorising body
for orphan works which are not covered by any collecting
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000046">Amendment
28M seeks to make clear that the orphan works scheme applies to a work
where there are multiple rights owners and one or more of these are not
known or cannot be traced. The Bill already makes provision for this.
The requirement for a diligent search for the copyright owner will be
described in greater detail in the regulations. This will include all
relevant rights-holders where there is more than one.</hs_para>

mean that a separate diligent search had to be undertaken for every
orphan work that someone wants to use. The clause already provides that
a work must have been subject to a diligent search for the rights
holders before it can qualify as an orphan work. However, requiring a
separate diligent search for each individual orphan work could result
in potential licensees having to conduct repetitious searches. For
example, five poems by the same poet whose name is known, published by
the same publisher, would require five separate diligent
searches.</hs_para>

concerned with creators who have assigned some or all of their
copyright in a work that goes on to be a suspected orphan work. The
diligent search for rights holders will cover all potential rights
holders in a work, including the creator. This amendment would also
provide an author with a new right to remuneration for the use of an
orphan work, even when the author had assigned the relevant copyright
in the work to someone else. Only those who are rights holders will be
entitled to remuneration for the use of an orphan work. This is exactly
the same as for non-orphan works.</hs_para>

seek to clarify what the term “authorised” means in this
subsection. In particular, they seek to ensure that those authorised to
license orphan works cannot grant themselves a licence. This is an
important point and one on which the clause is already clear—in
new Section 116A(5)(c) introduced in Clause 68. Any body authorised to
issue orphan works licences cannot license themselves to use an orphan
work.</hs_para>

mean that a licence to use an orphan work must be time-limited and not
run beyond the copyright term in a work. I can confirm that regulations
will provide for limits for orphan works licences. These will be
appropriate to the type of use being licensed and could be a time limit
or a limit according to intended use—for example, a print run.

friend Lord Clement-Jones spoke to Amendment 28S, which I shall address
at this point. The amendment seeks to clarify that orphan work licences
can be granted even when it is not known 
<?notus-xml column=470?>whether an exclusive licence has been granted. An orphan works licence
may be granted where a diligent search does not find all the relevant
rights holders, including an exclusive licensee. The noble Baroness,
Lady Warwick, raised this particular issue. Where the diligent search
reveals the existence of an exclusive licence, the work will not
qualify as an orphan work. Where an orphan works licence is granted
following a diligent search but subsequently an exclusive licence
holder appears, the exclusive licence holder will be treated in the
same way as any other absent rights holder that appears. The detail of
this will be set out in the regulations. That is why the clause
specifically applies to cases where it is uncertain where the copyright
subsists.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012853000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000052">I
turn to Amendment 30. This concerns the very important issue of

believe that the term “royalties” is not used in all
sectors but it is understood in the Bill to mean the same as
“remuneration”. The phrase “other sums”
would also cover any other types of fees to be set aside for rights

already provides for remuneration to be dealt with by the
regulations.</hs_parafo>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:49:29"></hs_TimeCode>I move this
amendment on the basis that noble Lords wish to carry on beyond eight
o’clock. As I say, my speech will last seven or eight minutes.
This group is entirely devoted to the issue of extended
collective licensing and seeks to amend Clause 68. First, I will deal
with Amendments 28T to 28Y and 52 to 56. Then I will speak
to Amendments 28SA and
28AA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:49:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000059">Extended
collective licensing is a system whereby a collecting society can
extend its licences to include the works of non-members. Non-members
will be able to opt out of the licence if they choose. There are mixed
views ranging from tepid to hostile in the creative industries.
Nevertheless, all see the following safeguards as crucial in any ECL
system that is introduced. Extended collective licences must be
permitted only in certain strictly controlled circumstances. For
example, a collecting society that grants them must be representative
of rights owners in the field. Licences must be granted on a
scheme-by-scheme basis and the mechanics of opting out should be
clearly prescribed. Although the Government’s policy documents
and verbal assurances have indicated that such strict conditions will
be imposed, they have not been placed in the Bill. This is alarming for
rights holders as they therefore do not have a cast-iron,
future-proofed assurance that the power in the Bill will not at some
indefinite point be used in a way that results in secondary legislation
unfairly interfering with their exclusive rights, which are the
preserve of primary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:50:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:51:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000060">Extended
collective licensing allows for collective licences to be granted by a
collecting society in respect of all works of the type for which it is
authorised whether or not it has the mandate with respect to each
individual work. So, for example, a collecting society for publishers
could be granted the ability to license literary works by publishers
with whom it did not have a direct relationship. ECL schemes would also
allow collecting societies to issue non-exclusive licences for 
<?notus-xml column=472?>particular uses of works beyond the uses covered by the scope of its
rights holder mandate. So, for example, a society could issue a licence
to a third party to allow the digital reproduction of works by a member
publisher even where its mandate did not provide for this use. As such,
ECL can potentially deprive rights holders of the ability to make a
choice as to how their work is exploited. Collecting societies are
permitted to go beyond the scope of mandated agreements and therefore
act without the direct permission, and perhaps without the direct
knowledge, of the rights holder. The rights holder who wishes at the
outset not to be subject to such treatment would be required to opt out
of the licensing scheme—the direct opposite of the present
situation whereby they opt in. This important shift of onus on rights
holders is a serious inversion of their position and requires a greater
level of vigilance and monitoring. For many smaller rights holders this
may well prove a very onerous
burden<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:52:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000061">If
ECL is to be introduced, the creative industries therefore believe it
is vital that additional safeguards are set out in the Bill to protect
rights holders as much as possible from unauthorised and undesired use
of their works. The Publishers Association, UK Music and many others
believe that a licensing body should be granted an extended collective
licence only if the following conditions are satisfied. First, the
licensing body is significantly representative of UK rights holders in
the field concerned. Secondly, the authorised licensing body has
adopted a code of practice which gives members and non-members equal
rights. Thirdly, an application has been made and a separate licence
granted for different uses of works. Fourthly, the Secretary of State
is satisfied that the licensing body is acting with the approval of its
membership. Fifthly, members and other interested parties have had the
opportunity to comment on ECL applications under consideration by the
Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:53:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000062">Amendment
28SA adds necessary safeguards to the ECL provisions in new Section
116B. A licence limited to the provisions as drafted could breach the
requirements of the Berne Convention and TRIPS agreement in relation to
non-UK works. This is inherent in ECL and cannot be cured.
Nevertheless, this amendment gives extra protection to right holders if
ECL is introduced. It is argued that copyright licensing is
administratively burdensome on those who wish to use copyright works
and should be streamlined. ECL is presented as the means by which the
Government can sort out this situation. However, the industry is
rapidly bringing its own digital solutions to the
marketplace<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:54:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000063">A
collective licensing scheme is a voluntary arrangement in which owners
of a particular kind of copyright authorise a collecting society to
enforce those copyrights on their behalf. Yet the scheme proposed in
Clause 68 resembles a form of compulsory licensing under which the
Government will authorise a licensing body to grant licences for works
which neither it, nor anyone who has authorised it, owns. ECL is stated
to be voluntary on the part of a rights owner in that he can opt out of
the scheme after it has come into
being.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000064">However,
opting out is possible only if a rights owner knows about the scheme
and how it may license its works. Those unlikely to know about ECL
schemes 
<?notus-xml column=473?>licensing their works will include amateur creators whose works are on
the internet, although they are not published commercially, and foreign
rights holders. In the view of many, the existence of such a body will
artificially distort the market for rights, as its rates would become
the de facto standard against which negotiations would take
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-28T19:55:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000065">Properly,
ECL refers to a statutory scheme that extends the collective licence to
those rights owners who have chosen not to join the scheme. It is
impossible to extend a collective licence that does not exist. Several
economically significant sectors within the current creative industries
have no collective licensing scheme at all. That includes news clips,
films, photographs and illustrations. Those who have argued for ECL
point to the Nordic countries, where there are ECL schemes. However,
those schemes are very limited in their type of work and rights
licence, and there are major differences between the small Nordic and
large UK copyright markets.</hs_para>

collective licence schemes are narrowly limited in scope and subject to

minor use has great commercial value to the copyright owner, are
generally excluded.

international obligations, including the three-step test. The proposals

ECL is proposed to solve perceived copyright licensing problems, which

Amendment 28AA was proposed by the Artists’ Agents Association,
which is a voluntary trade association whose membership comprises
102 British literary agencies. It suggests that there should
be a requirement in the Bill that customary warranties be made to any
users being granted licences to use works under an ECL scheme. In a
publishing contract, an author usually makes the following warranties
to the publisher: that he has full right to enter into the agreement;
that the work is an original work written by the author; that the work
in no way infringes any existing copyright; that the work contains
nothing unlawful, indecent or libellous; that it does not infringe any
right of privacy, confidentiality or intellectual property rights; and
that any recipe, formula or instruction contained in the work is
accurate and is not injurious to the

your Lordships will be pleased to hear—on Amendment 20AB, the
schedule sets out some welcome provisions for any orphaned works or
extended collective licensing schemes that come into force. However, as
Sections 116A and 116B make clear, orphaned works and ECL are two quite
separate licensing schemes governed by different qualifying criteria,
authorisation processes and provisions. The schemes are not
interdependent in any way. For the avoidance of doubt and to reinforce
the distinction between the two schemes I have tabled Amendment 20AB. I

Buscombe:</Member></B> I rise briefly, given the hour, wholly to
support the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones.
This is an area that I focused on in my Second Reading speech. Without
wishing to repeat what my noble friend said, there is something rather
disingenuous about saying that this system is voluntary but, at the
same time, you have to opt out. I know there is huge concern across the
industry with regard to this clause on extended collective licensing.
It is important that the Government recognise that there needs to be
more clarity around how this system would work. There are big questions
about how much such a scheme would be policed and regulated with, I
understand, just £10,000 per annum earmarked to administer it,
and whether extended collective licensing bodies could license content
for the internet, meaning that ECL will spill well beyond these shores.
I believe that any new system should be opt-in only. It should be
limited to a specific remit, such as extended collective licensing for
non-commercial use and orphan works.</hs_para>

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, there is a mass of
significant matter in these amendments. It is, perhaps, a rather
unfortunate degree of bundling that we have them all together. It is
particularly unfortunate that the Committee is attempting to deal with
them at this stage of the evening. There is important material here
that we should not be trying to address under this sort of pressure of
time. Noble Lords will be glad to know that I do not intend to comment
on each amendment now. I simply want to say a word about Amendment 28SA
because I believe it is singularly important. Its effect would be
impractical and destructive. As Universities UK has explained to us,
limiting the scope of extended collective licences to the UK would
require users to manage different territorial permission for some works
from a licensing body and not others. It would mean that much broadcast
or digital use of these works could not be sold abroad or put on the
web and would effectively render extended collective licensing
unworkable. The British Library concurs in finding these amendments
unmanageable. This amendment also raises issues with regard to existing
licences from collecting societies that are de facto extended
collective licences that support business and education and already
allow use outside the United Kingdom, so, unintentionally, I am sure,
this is a wrecking amendment.</hs_para>

Lord Howarth, said. It is entirely inappropriate for the Committee to
be discussing these important amendments at this stage of the game.
Like the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, I would like to have made a
much longer speech. I shall not, for which noble Lords will, I am sure,
be grateful, but I reiterate the great concern of the British
Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies regarding ECL. It is keen
to ensure that ECL will not supplant an existing framework to manage
image rights. I shall not go any further than that, but this subject
needs much greater concentration rather than rushing it through at this
stage of the evening. On that note, I shall sit down, but I am
not happy.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to
Amendment 28WA. The key issue is whether it may be necessary to broaden
the remit of an existing licensing organisation and, if it is
necessary, I hope the amendment will do what is required to achieve
that. The background to this amendment is to try to open up the
archives of the BFI, in particular, but also those of other agencies
that hold film and broadcast material. The power of film to transform
the way we see the world around us and understand it cannot be
underestimated. Britain is one of the world’s greatest film
cultures and has a heritage dating back to the very first days of the
invention of film. We believe that every young person, regardless of
where they live or where in the UK the archive material is actually
held, should be able to access and learn from this heritage. Film has
significant value as a teaching tool for many different subjects, as
well as having a value in its own right in its artistic content. If it
is true that the innovators and creators of tomorrow can be found in
our education sector, we believe they should have access to film of all
ages, much of it stored in publicly managed archives and in copyright
and other related materials, just as they have access to libraries of
printed
words.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000076">The
Bill contains a proposal for extended collective licensing that will
make it easier and more practical to mass digitise archive material,
particularly for educational access use. That is to be welcomed.
However, this change to the law will not be relevant to film or the
moving image more generally, as currently there is no collecting
society or agency available to license film and moving image material
under copyright for educational use. As the Minister will know, Section
35 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 provides an override
to the exception which allows broadcasting material to be licensed for
use by educational institutions. This scheme has been operated by the
ERA since 1990, and it helps copyright owners and performers to derive
an income from the licensed use of their literary, dramatic, musical
and artistic works. This is extremely valuable, but the ERA’s
remit is limited to broadcast material which was recorded after the
commencement of the Act and does not cover film. Most educational
organisations are covered under the ERA licence scheme, which is
renewable annually. It allows teaching staff to record the broadcast
output of ERA members for non-commercial educational
use.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000077">One
simple way to introduce collective licensing to film would be to extend
the remit of an existing 
<?notus-xml column=476?>society, which could be the ERA, to include film and also pre-1990
television broadcasts that are not covered under ERTA licensing. In the
age of convergence, it makes little sense to maintain different
approaches between film and television. This solution will benefit
rights holders, whose interests will be protected as they see a
resurgence of educational interest in their creative work and an
extended shelf life for their former work, as well as a new income
stream. Also, existing education users who are already paying
subscriptions will see the value of their investment considerably
increased through access to wider audio-visual
collections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000078">Is

28T and 53 would prevent an ECL authorisation from applying to works
where any part of the copyright was owned or controlled by the
collecting society or its member. The idea behind this is to prevent a
collecting society from unilaterally extending its mandate. In
addition, Amendment 28SA specifies that ECL authorisations could extend
only existing licences, and only for use in the UK. The Government
agree that ECL should not be used to unilaterally extend existing
mandates from members. We do not believe that the current drafting will
permit this. This is due to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988, which provides that ownership of copyright refers to ownership of
any aspect of copyright. The Government have been clear that no ECL
application can proceed unless the applicant has the explicit support
of its membership. It is extremely unlikely that support would be

<?notus-xml column=477?>reiterate the Government’s view that ECL authorisations should be
granted only as an extension of an existing mandate from a licensing
body’s
members.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000084">Amendments
28U, 28W, and 54 add new conditions, which must be met before an
authorisation to run an ECL scheme can be granted. These conditions
accord fully with stated government policy. First, ECL schemes can be
approved only where the collecting society is significantly
representative of the type of rights holder affected. Secondly, the
application process will closely consider the extent of existing
mandates, ensuring ECL is introduced only where there is clear support
for collective solutions. Thirdly, ECL schemes will require the
explicit consent of the applicant’s members. This ensures that
rights holders have an effective right of veto. In practice, we
anticipate that a collecting society will be required to ballot its
members before applying to operate an ECL scheme. This, I submit, is a
more specific and effective safeguard than is offered by these
amendments.</hs_para>

specify that an authorisation to operate an extended collective
licensing scheme could be used to grant licences for the use of
audio-visual works for educational purposes. I can confirm that the
power in new Section 116B is designed to enable licensing bodies to
apply to operate extended collective licensing schemes for specific
uses of copyright works. Nothing, including educational uses of
audio-visual work, has been ruled out as long as rights holders want
it. A central pillar of our policy is that it is up to the collecting
society, acting with the consent of its members—the rights
holders—to choose whether to initiate an application and to
define what they would like to see in scope. Government have no power
to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000086">In the
case of audio-visual, although there is currently no single collecting
society that could cover the range of rights, there is nothing in these
provisions that would stop several collecting societies collaborating
to offer a joint licence. Indeed, there is already precedent for such
collaboration in collective licensing. For example, the Copyright
Licensing Agency already offers licences on behalf of both authors and
publishers. The only restriction on this would remain that for such an
application to succeed, the licensing body would need to meet the
safeguards in the Government’s proposals. It would need to
demonstrate that it was significantly representative of the type of
rights holders affected by the scheme, and would need to secure
explicit consent from its members for the application.</hs_para>

these thresholds would need to be met in relation to each of the
various groups of rights holders who contribute to such works. This is
crucial to ensure that ECL is introduced only where it works in the
interests of rights holders. The noble Lord also asked when provision
could be made in relation to this power. Subject to the passage of the
Bill, the Government would look to make regulations as soon as
possible. It is our hope that licensing bodies that wish to apply to
operate ECL schemes will be able to do so from 2014
onwards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000088">The
second part of the amendment raises the question of whether pre-1990
broadcast works would be in scope for educational use and learning
purposes. The 
<?notus-xml column=478?>Government believe that the exception in Section 35 of the CDPA, which
this refers to, may already apply to pre-1990 works, but our legal team
will be considering this in more detail when preparing the legislation
on exceptions. I am pleased that the noble Lord is thinking about the
benefit that extended collective licensing could have in some sectors.
I hope we have assured him that the type of use he suggests would
already be possible under the Government’s proposed
scheme.</hs_para>

28V and 55 would mean that authorisations for ECL schemes must specify
the use of works allowed under the scheme. The existing proposals
already address these concerns. The Bill already requires ECL
authorisations to set out the types of work and the acts restricted by
copyright to which they apply. In October, the Government deposited a
briefing document in the House Library including further information on
how ECL will work in practice. This sets out that a collecting society
applying to use ECL will need to provide details of its proposed
scheme. Any authorisation could then cover only the specific uses set
out in the
application.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000090">Amendments
28X and 56 would require the Secretary of State to extend the right to
opt out to an exclusive licensee or authorised representative. The
rationale for this is understood, but further work is needed to
explore how it would work in practice. This will be explored with
stakeholders in the working group on ECL and orphan works. While this
issue will be considered further, the Bill does not rule out such
provision as it stands.</hs_para>

28Y would require any collecting society operating an ECL

has already made good progress in this area. Most UK collecting
societies have already adopted codes of practice on a self-regulatory
basis. The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to require a
collecting society that fails to self-regulate effectively to adopt a
suitable code of practice. The minimum standards for codes of practice
include specific protections for non-members represented by ECL
schemes. The Government intend to develop further such protections
before any applications to use ECL can be
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000093">Amendment
28AA seeks to ensure that any legal action arising from the licensed
use of a work with a missing owner would fall to the licensing body and
not to the user of the work. The Bill already provides that an orphan
works licence will have effect as if granted by the missing owner.
Similarly, a copyright licence offered under an approved extended
collective licensing scheme would license the use of all works within
the scope of the authorisation—except any that had been opted
out—regardless of the status of the owner. In practice,
collecting societies often already indemnify licensees who use works
within the terms of their licence against copyright claims.</hs_para>

number of scenarios where the proposed warranties may not be applicable
or appropriate. For example, it will not always be the case that a work
will have been written by the copyright owner. A warranty to that
effect would therefore not be appropriate. In addition, the Government
anticipate that, in certain cases, it may be appropriate for the legal
risk to fall on the user—for example, should the user exploit
the work or works outside the terms of the licence. Likewise, the user
and not the authorising body may be rightly responsible for any
non-copyright issues that might arise relating to use of the work, such
as libel. When a licensing body applies to operate an ECL scheme, it
will be required to make the terms of the proposed scheme clear,
including any indemnities or warrants it intends to
offer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000095">Finally—and
I thank noble Lords for their patience—Amendment 28AB seeks to
make clear that the orphan works and extended collective licensing
schemes are two distinct and separate schemes with different criteria,
safeguards and processes. I have sympathy with the ideas behind many of
the amendments, and I am confident that the Government have already
sought to address the issues concerned or have committed to
do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012853000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128-gc0002.htm#13012853000096">The
schemes need to be flexible enough to respond to changing circumstances
and to reflect best practice. Changes to the Bill which make particular
requirements on regulations limit this flexibility and may have
unintended consequences. I realise that I have somewhat run on from the

hour is late, the best thing to do would be to answer those questions

nuggets in what the Minister had to say. Some of the detail he gave was
very useful, but I was particularly interested in his affirmation that
ECL was not useable for rights outside the United Kingdom. The noble
Lord, Lord Howarth, seemed to think that it had that flexibility, but
it does not. That is what makes it an unsatisfactory arrangement and
why many people object to it. It is setting up a separate UK situation
which eventually, I hope, will be overtaken by an EU directive on ECL,
so in many ways ECL is premature.</hs_para>

reforms we want to ensure that the planning system supports our
priority to ensure that every child has the opportunity to benefit from

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and

personal independence payment should be targeted at those people who
face the greatest barriers to participating in society. In order to do
this, the assessment for personal independence payment considers
individuals’ ability to carry out selected key activities, and
what support they might need to do so. Ten of the activities are
focused on daily living and two on mobility. Priority in the assessment
will be focused on those people who are least able to carry out the
activities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012819000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128w0001.htm#13012819000034">The
10 key activities related to the daily living component cover a range
of aspects of daily life, including one activity on the ability to
communicate verbally. If an individual needs communication support to
be able to understand complex verbal information, they could be awarded
descriptor C in this activity, which has four points attached to it.
While four points on its own will not be enough to bring entitlement to
the daily living component, individuals may also score points in other
activities within the assessment, depending on their individual
circumstances. Individuals needing communication support to be able to
understand basic verbal information will receive eights points, which
in itself brings entitlement to the standard rate of the

Northover:</Member> The European Commission has
proposed that the European Development Fund (EDF)
amounts to €30.32 billion over 2014-20, compared to an
allocation of €22.68 billion for 2008-13. The UK’s top
priority in the negotiations for the European Union (EU) budget and EDF
in the period 2014-20 is that the level of EU expenditure must be
carefully contained. We oppose increases beyond real growth in any area
of EU expenditure, including the EDF. However, we believe that it is
also important to maintain or increase the proportion of official
development assistance within a restrained overall budget. Any funds
which do not get committed to programmes under the current EDF will
reduce payments member states are required to make under the 11th
EDF.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13012819000607" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128w0001.htm#13012819000607">EU:

and pedestrians, before deciding what to do
next.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13012819000640" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130128w0001.htm#13012819000640">UK
