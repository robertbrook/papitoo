pressed the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s

aware that I have just returned from Blue Nile and South Kordofan,
where I witnessed daily aerial bombardments by the Khartoum Government
that directly targeted civilians with 500 kilogram and incendiary
bombs, destroying villages, markets and schools, inflicting death and
injury on women and children, forcing thousands to hide in caves with
deadly snakes and to die from hunger and disease with no health care;
and causing nearly 200,000 refugees to flee to camps in South Sudan?
Will Her Majesty’s Government assist with the provision of
life-saving aid to these regions? Our NGO, HART, has used reliable ways
of sending food and medical supplies to people dying of hunger, injury
and disease. In response to the reluctance of other donors to send
life-saving aid, one local doctor emphasised

noble Baroness’s recent visit to the region. It is a constant
experience for those of us on the government Front Bench to answer
Questions from noble Lords who have much more detailed knowledge of
what they are asking about than those of us who answer. I thank the
noble Baroness also for sending me a report of her findings, which are
a stark reminder of the appalling conditions that the people of these
regions now face. Somewhere between 750,000 and 1 million
people have been displaced. Some of them have crossed the frontier and
some are living in caves and elsewhere. The impact on the civilian
population of indiscriminate military tactics, food shortages and lack
of access to basic services is of course completely 
<?notus-xml column=994?>unacceptable. The Minister for Africa will attend the AU summit this
week. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary at DfID is currently in Sudan.

before we use the genocide label. There are some very nasty conflicts
going on across the new and still not entirely settled border between
South Sudan and Sudan. Some aid is going into the region from South
Sudan but it is a dangerous area to cross. NGOs that have done so have
found themselves in considerable difficulty. We need, therefore, also

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, we are well aware that the
situation in Darfur is also unresolved. There are, of course, outbreaks
of conflict in Jonglei in South Sudan. Part of the problem is that
neither of the Governments in Sudan or in South Sudan entirely control
their own territories or necessarily entirely control their own
Governments and armed forces. There have been two agreements between
the heads of Governments and state of Sudan and South Sudan in the past
four months: whether or not they will be accepted and implemented by
those who are asked to do so is not entirely

the Government make it clear that without progress the UN will

using words such as genocide, does he recall that it is exactly year
ago when Dr Mukesh Kapila, who is one of our senior
officials in Sudan—indeed, he was an official at the United
Nations—used precisely that word to describe what is happening
in South Kordofan and Abyei? Having listened to my noble friend a few
moments ago describing what is happening now, a year later, in a regime
headed by Omar al-Bashir, who is a war criminal indicted by the
International Criminal Court, surely we should be stepping up the
pressure for at least the ICC investigations, to which the

the pressure and are very much engaged. We are working with the African
Union and the high-level group, with Mr Mbeki as the co-ordinator, to
see what pressure we can bring to bear on all concerned. We are all
conscious that this conflict is taking place across the great dividing

think that the Minister is going far enough. The warrant has been
around for some time and I can say from first-hand experience that the
one thing that President al-Bashir was consistently concerned about was
that someone might act on that warrant on any occasion when he was
outside Sudan—and he is outside Sudan reasonably frequently.

point has to be to find a way of resolving the interconnected conflicts
between Sudan and South Sudan. We also have to be concerned not to
drive the current regime in Khartoum further into the arms of Iran. As
the noble Lord will know, an Iranian ship has visited Port Sudan and
there are various reports of Iranian financial support for the current

depression, bullying and sexual abuse, especially for those who do not
comprehend the nature of grooming and blame themselves. Will the

abuse of any vulnerable person, whether a child or an adult, is taken
very seriously by the Government and any measures that are proposed to
counteract it will be supported. As she says, ChildLine has developed
its services to meet the needs of children today. One of the reasons
why the number of children approaching it has increased is that there
is now an online facility, and many children find it easier or more
acceptable to express their troubles online than over a telephone. That
is providing a very helpful and vital service to vulnerable
children.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_22_PT_1/026C5CEB1293A8834C79825640F0196C994F79C4" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 January 2013">Tuesday,

down is a central aim of government policy. In terms of what is

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, helicopter operations in central London
are strictly controlled, and last week’s accident was the first
fatal helicopter accident in London since civil aviation records began
in 1976. We are waiting for the Air Accidents Investigation Branch to
complete its investigation to ensure that the reasons for the accident
are understood before we consider whether any further measures are
necessary. There is no reason to believe that helicopter operations
over London are
unsafe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:01:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012247000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000052"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Faulkner of Worcester" PimsId="3199" UID="13012247000405" xid="1216" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000405">Lord

helicopter flying in London has indeed been very good, as the Minister
said, but does he not agree that the number of new high-rise buildings
around Vauxhall Cross has made the approach to Battersea heliport
increasingly hazardous? Can he give an assurance that the inquiry into
last week’s accident, which could have been so much worse, will

of the investigation or to tell the Air Accidents Investigation Branch
how it should conduct its operation, as I am sure the noble Lord
understands. The Civil Aviation Authority is closely involved in the
planning process, and it is unlikely that planning permission would be

Investigation Branch will be able to deduce what all the reasons were.

whether balloons could be used rather than helicopters. The
difficulties are, first, that balloons are more vulnerable to wind

manoeuvre over a street to get a good view of it. The advice I received

been selected will be made on 18 June this year. Applicants will then
be given six months’ notice and non-applicants 12 months’
notice before they leave the service. While we need to make up to 5,300
Army personnel redundant, the programme will not adversely affect
operations in Afghanistan.

will be discharged through the standard medical process.</hs_para>

transition workshops; up to 35 days of paid resettlement training; and

to find work outside the Armed Forces. Historically, 93% of those who
look for work are in full-time employment within six months of leaving,
rising to 97% after 12 months. To that end, 91% of tranche one

join the commiserations expressed by my noble friend. In the short time

getting the inherited defence budget in balance, but unfortunately
events take place and nothing has more events than defence. Does the
Minister not think that the Prime Minister’s Statement yesterday
about the willingness to use force in Mali and other places shows that
you cannot use a budgeting system on defence in quite the same way that
you can in other departments because events take place that need action
or no action? With a force depleted to 82,000 personnel, the headlines

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, in speaking to Amendment 1, I
shall speak also to Amendment 32 in the name of my noble friend Lord
Greaves and to which I have added my name. Clause 1 gives the power to
the Secretary of State to designate a local planning authority as
deemed to be failing, thus enabling applicants for major projects to
apply direct to the Planning Inspectorate should they so desire. I said
at Second Reading, and I will say again, that I am very grateful to
Ministers in the other place for the assurances that they have given
for the criteria that have been proposed and for the reassurance that
the clause is not quite as bad as it seems. But I still say that it is
directly contrary to the spirit of localism, which we have spent many
happy hours discussing in this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012247000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000109"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:34:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:34:19"></hs_TimeCode>I
understand that the Government are determined to keep the clause in the
Bill and, of course, I respect that. The Local Government Association
has described it as using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I am bound to
say that I am inclined to agree with that description. However, if we
are to have the clause, it is the role and duty of this House to make
it as workable as it can be—some might say, to make it as
harmless as it can be. The Government have said that they wish to keep
the clause as a deterrent. I would feel happier if we could approach
this on the basis of keeping it as an incentive. The latter approach
calls for a different state of mind. The Government are adopting a sort
of target-led approach whereby an authority that does not meet certain
criteria will be designated. I think we all accept that there have
been, are, and sadly probably always will be some local planning
authorities that do not perform as well as they should. There is a
different debate to be had about exactly what we mean by performance
and how we measure it, but let us start from that
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:30:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012247000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000110">I
believe that the best way to improve a poorly performing authority with
regard to planning as to most other things is first and foremost
through what is normally called sector-led improvement to enable it to
improve itself, not to punish it in some way by taking away
its authority. The purpose of Amendment 1 is to require the
Secretary of State to give 18 months’ notice of designation.
That 18 months would allow the local authority to look at how it can
improve its performance and then to be judged on the way in
which it improves, not on the way in which it has performed in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:32:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012247000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000111">I
am aware that Amendment 32, to which I have given my support, suggests
a period of 12 months rather than 18 months. At this stage I do not
want to get too hung up on the difference between 18 months and 12
months. The important principle with this amendment is that the
Secretary of State should give a lengthy period of notice to enable a
local authority to improve itself, helped and assisted by other local
authorities and, indeed, by the Local Government Association. The Local
Government Association thinks that 18 months is probably a more
appropriate period, primarily because it enables better and more
realistic data collection so that we can see the direction of travel
that that authority is taking. Is it gradually improving? If it is
improving over that period, designating it would be a considerable
disincentive, not an incentive. If it is making no improvement, or
indeed even getting worse, that is more justification for the
designation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:32:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

local planning authority may well need to recruit better planning
officers and better staff to enable it to improve its performance.
However, it takes considerable time to recruit and embed those staff
and for the improvements that we hope they can bring about to work and
be seen. It takes time, of course, to engage effectively with other
helpful authorities or outside sources in order to improve. For all
those reasons, the Local Government Association thinks that an 18-month
period is more appropriate. However, the important point is that we
have a lengthy enough period—be it a year or 18 months—to
enable a local planning authority to improve itself before the
imposition of the final, and frankly draconian, measure of designating
and taking away its right, and therefore the right of the local people,
effectively to decide their own major planning applications. I beg to

one could call it that—of providing information to authorities
on how close they were to being designated, but this approach would not
impact all authorities equally, which is why we consider that the
opportunity to make representations should be allowed. This might 
<?notus-xml column=1012?>be particularly important for smaller districts
where the numbers of applications for major developments might be quite
small. Indeed, we received some data a short while before Committee
today. I do not know if all noble Lords received it, but some
authorities in the year to March 2012 received as few as two major
applications to deal with. Others received more than 160. Therefore,
this process will not impact on all authorities
equally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T15:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>. One or
two applications might have a significant impact on an individual

if problematic applications are in the pipeline, someone might try to
game the system to push an authority towards designation. The delay
might also be down to community issues. Applications relating to Gypsy

<?notus-xml column=1017?>However, it contains a number of measures that will improve growth in
the economy and remove barriers to investment. In these circumstances,
one has to look very carefully at amendments that are designed to make
the process outlined in Clause 1 more difficult. I do not say for a
moment that it is all right. I will listen to the debates on
amendments. I have put my name to some of them and, when the Marshalled
List is reprinted, it will be seen that I have added my name to others.

closed on 17 January and I have already made the point that I hope, and
ask my noble friend to confirm, that the Government’s response
to the consultation will be available by the time we come to deal with
the clause on Report. They have spelled out quite clearly their
thinking on the criteria for designation and that it is unlikely to
apply to more than a very few local authorities. Indeed, Ministers have
said that they hope there will not be any. But if there is a wide
variation in the planning performance of different local authorities

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> The noble Lord raises an important
question in asking whether the Government should sit back and do
nothing. The answer is clearly no, but is not the right approach to try
to put some resources into understanding what is happening to
differential performance and why the metrics have declined in recent
times? Those issues should be addressed rather than make the assumption
that authorities that fail the test—it is all to do with the
speed of dealing with applications and nothing much to do with the
quality of decisions being taken—are somehow failing.</hs_para>

think that the upheaval in the planning system in recent months may
have had an impact? We have had the Localism Act, the NPPF, the demise
of regional spatial strategies and all that goes with that. Those are
very considerable changes, and of course local authorities are facing
the horrendous cuts to their budgets, the worst that have been
experienced for generations. Perhaps these factors are having an impact
on what is happening. Is it not better to address them rather than make
a spurious judgment that it is all to do with the speed of application?

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> I understand the points being made by
the noble Lord. The question of the pressures on local authority
finances and therefore on local authority staffing is important, but of
course authorities do charge. My noble friend Lord Tope made the point
that some local authorities could improve by hiring better quality
staff. These are the kind of things where, if there is some form of
longstop provision of the sort that is in Clause 1, minds will be
concentrated. I am not saying that the clause needs no amendment and I
have already made the point that I have put my name to several
amendments that we will come to, but I would not be happy to join
forces with those who would prefer to see it removed altogether. I

miscellaneous set of measures rather than a large and comprehensive Act

likely by itself to make a huge difference, but taken together they are
a brave attempt to try to find out what the obstacles are. Many noble
Lords will have seen that there is plenty of evidence about the
barriers, and I want to make it clear that in the interests of growth

precisely to make places better for the people who live there. There is
a price to pay for that. If you have a planning system it will cost
money in the sense that if you did not have one, developers would not
have to pay the costs of putting forward a planning application. It
seems to me that those figures are pretty much nonsense, because all
they are is an adding up of what it costs to have a system in which the
public have some say in the conditions and the places where they live.
That is a fundamental part of the life of any community. My concern is
that it is difficult enough now for communities to plan their future,

words of my noble—and real—friend seem to give away the
reality of the matter, which is that it is always about people’s

Everybody always is, in particular if they do not win. I am afraid that

things wrong with the planning system. I believe that large
infrastructure projects should always be done centrally and that it is
nonsense to have another debate about the safety of nuclear power every
time you go round the country. That is barmy. It is barmy to accept
that if you want to build a railway or something of a serious nature,
you have to deal with every single bit, because it is not the bits that

problem—which is why I support these amendments—is that
this particular clause seems to be inapplicable, in the proper sense of
that word. First, if we are not going to deal with more than a handful
of authorities and a handful of applications, then it does not meet the
vocality. It does not meet what people are 
<?notus-xml column=1021?>complaining about, so they will go on complaining. No doubt, as the
noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said at Second Reading, we will have another
Bill—because we always do—and there will be another way
of not achieving what those who are vocal want.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T16:14:15"></hs_TimeCode>The reason is
that it is not achievable. What they really want is something that
distinguishes between planning applications not on the grounds of merit
but on the grounds of speed. That does not seem a very sensible basis
on which to do it. Of course, bigger planning applications take longer.
Anyone can decide about a car port in a short period. A complex
decision on mixed development in an area of outstanding natural beauty,
with difficulties of infrastructure, takes time. If it happens to be in
a small district council, it takes longer, because the district council
is unlikely to have spare capacity to deal with
it.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13012247000340" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000340">4.15

improve it. I suggest that it cannot do it by being applied to a
sufficient number of occasions and cases to meet the needs of the
complainants. Will it do it by being an exemplar, forcing people to do
what they would otherwise not have done because it is there as the
great atomic weapon? Is that what it is about? I find that very dubious
democratically, because, after all, the local authority makes its
decisions with some sort of reference to the people who elect it. That
is its job. Is a local councillor now going to say, “I’m
not going to listen as closely to the people who have elected me
because there is this thing over here which may come and destroy what I
have to say”? We already know the dangers that arise when local
authorities fear to say no lest they lose on appeal and have a large

them to do. The problem with this Bill is that I have no more idea
having read it than I did before, because it is not in it. Would it not
therefore be sensible to say that we will find out about it through the
workings of the Bill? That means giving proper notice to the local
authority and saying, “We do not think that you are doing very
well. Here are the reasons why we don’t think you’re
doing well and you’d better get yourself better over the next 18

their planning powers, because it seems that even with the consultation
paper—and  
<?notus-xml column=1022?>I hope that my noble friend the Minister will give us some help on
this—these criteria will not be fixed for ever but could change
and a different Government might think differently. I do not know what
the local authority is going to do to understand that. The best way to
do it is to give the local authority a proper period to consider what
the Government have said and to see whether it can put it right or
whether the authority will turn to its electorate and say, “We
are not changing because we actually do not agree with the Government,
and if the Government want to take it away from us, they will take it
away because we are not prepared to do what it is they think they want
done, because, in this locality, in this place, in this part of the
world, which has given all the pleasures and powers of the Localism
Bill, we think differently”. That is one result that might come
if people are given proper advance notice. That is why I want there to

of the things that I find most suspicious about the whole provision is
that nobody will tell me a single authority on which they would like to
use this power. If you have a draconian answer, you really ought to
have a draconian question. To cheer up the noble Lord opposite, who
accused me of agreeing with him, which upset him enormously, let me
give an example of a draconian question. There was an appalling time in
Newcastle when the local government tax was driving people to
bankruptcy, where it cost four times as much per square foot for John
Lewis there as in Oxford Street. That was an appalling position, and
the Government, quite rightly, produced a draconian answer. That was to
say that the business rates could not be in the hands of people who did
not appear to understand what business was about. My goodness, there
was a good argument. I got up in Parliament and named the places; I was
not ashamed. It did not make the noble Lord and I very good
friends—although we got much more friendly afterwards when we
discovered that we agreed on a lot of other things—but at least
he knew, I knew and we all knew what the argument

see how you can bring forward a draconian answer such as this without
telling me which authorities are involved. Is it the Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea? I have had a number of complaints about the
speed of its planning. Is it Liverpool? Is it Newcastle? Is it Suffolk
Coastal? Is it Forest Heath? Who is it? We need to see whether this is
a suitable answer to a suitable question; or whether it is merely the
only answer we can think of, given the pressure from the developers.
Unless we can say that it is this, that or the other, everyone will
believe what I fear I think, which is that this is an attempt to do
something because something must be done. That is a very dangerous road

noble Lord, Lord Deben, asked whether anyone can suggest some draconian
questions that should be asked of local authorities. I can suggest one
or two. Some adopted local plans are lamentably out of date. That is a
criterion of performance and one that developers find incredibly
frustrating if it is not met. I understand the position of local
councillors, although I have never been one. Some matters are
incredibly difficult for them to decide. Sometimes cases go to appeal
and the planning inspector will decide them. When you are trying to
propose housing, commercial or shopping development, and so forth, you
cannot really be expected, as a developer or a builder, to rely on a
local plan that is seven, eight, nine or 10 years old. That is just
impossible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012247000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000168">That
could be one measure. Another that I referred to in my Second Reading
contribution is that greater attention must be given to measures of
housing need. With the demise of regional spatial strategies, each
local authority will face the task of assessing housing need in its own
authority. There should be a clear, intelligible and compelling basis
for assessing need. The underlying basis and calculation should be
publicly available—and should be available to challenge by the
customers of local authorities. It is not good always going for the
lowest number when in fact that is not appropriate.</hs_para>

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendments
spoken to by my noble friend Lord McKenzie this afternoon. Clause 1
gives the Secretary of State powers to take over planning application
decisions, as I see it. Why? I thought that the Government were in
favour of localism—a point that has been made by a number of
speakers already. Planning applications are surely best handled
locally. They should normally involve a consultation process involving
the local community. That is certainly the situation in our
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012247000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000174">There is
a housing crisis in London. Everything has become incredibly expensive,
and developers have become very greedy indeed. They take over large
houses when they become available and attempt to extend and develop
them, often to the disadvantage of adjoining property. They are not
developing affordable housing—quite the contrary. When local
residents object, the local planning authority has to pay attention to
what the local community has to say.</hs_para>

have recently been involved in such a situation in an area where there
are quite old houses, and where the developers are attempting to build
basements in places that were never intended to have basements. This
destabilises the houses next door, and of course the residents have all
been objecting. If the Government really respected localism, they would
not attempt to undermine the procedures that are provided by Clause 1.
The residents in the case I refer to are certainly not against social
housing. They are simply against a large fortune being made by
developers trying to profit from scarcity, which is the situation in
London.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012247000176" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000176">In
the circumstances that have been explained by a number of speakers this
afternoon, the amendments submitted by my noble friend Lord McKenzie
would substantially modify the provisions of Clause 1, and that would
be to everyone’s advantage. It would give the local authority
the right of representation before the powers were assumed by the
Secretary of State, and there is provision in Amendment 32 for a proper
consultative process. I therefore hope that the Government will look
with some favour on these amendments, because they modify the thrust of
Clause 1, I think to the advantage of

part debate at this moment. We have a bunch of amendments on which I
detect that everyone, including both the previous Secretaries of State
who have talked on this, actually 
<?notus-xml column=1025?>agrees—namely, that if the Secretary of State is to have the
power to take away powers currently in the hands of local authorities
for planning, then we may need to put in place some constraints on the
use by the Secretary of State of that new power. These amendments are
all about putting some constraints on the Secretary of State, and they
seem to be entirely reasonable and proper. Nick Boles, the Minister may
get his way; he says quite clearly, and I am sure that he is right to

consultation paper suggests that there are really two criteria here on
which local authorities would be judged. The local plan does not
feature very prominently but they are about the performance at appeal;
quality, which is measured by the approval rate by local authorities;
and speed—how fast they do it within the timetables that have
been set. On the first of those measures, the performance at appeal, it
is fair to say that no local authority at the moment would fail this
test at all. If you take account of the fact that a local authority is
quite entitled to come up with a negative view, even if the
inspectorate goes against it later, it is only really where costs are
awarded against a local authority that one could say that that local
authority had not been behaving in a proper and sensible
manner.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012247000179" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000179">There
are so very few cases of costs being awarded that I do not think anyone
would fall on performance at appeal. It is
speed—timeliness—on which local authorities are likely to
be judged to be failing. Here it is possible for local authorities to
change their ways in order to speed up. At the moment there is no
intimation that those that are already demonstrating in their direction
of travel that they are improving their performance will be
acknowledged or taken into account. Northumberland County
Council’s performance under the speed/timeliness measure has
improved in the following way over the past 12 months, for example: it
had 30% of its major applications determined within 13 weeks in the
third quarter of 2011 and that was improved to 48% the following
quarter, 52% the quarter after that and 57% the quarter after that.
Improvements can happen. Clearly, local authorities need to be given

and of great importance, including a professor, saying that the
planning system is a great economic drag on the country and we must do
something. One could say such things of employment law, health and
safety, transport regulations or any number of things. It is not in
itself an argument to remove elements of a system. The question that we
must ask in this Committee is whether the remedies are proportionate,
whether their administration is going to be objective and whether,
overall, they will be conducive to the public good. I actually think

made the same point at Second Reading. It is not enough for a current
Minister to say, “I will only use these
criteria”—which we have not yet seen—“for a
limited number of purposes”. A future Minister given
extraordinarily wide powers by your Lordships could use them in a very
different way. I am sure that is something that we will examine later
as we proceed. As Committees of your Lordships’ House have said,

build into the system, not only for the reasons that have been cited. I
am not going into the question of whether it should be 18 months or 12

presumably on the basis of the criteria that we will have seen by
Report, and say, “Toytown Borough Council, you are hereby
designated”, and the next day a developer can whack in an
application to the Secretary of State and, heigh-ho, off we go,
everybody is happy, particularly the developer. It may be that in
existing law and in the Bill there are things that prevent that, but if
that can happen, there is a great moral hazard in any Executive having
this sort of power. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, used a phrase: he
said that people might “game the system”. I do not know

that context, and in the context of this amendment which deals with an
18-month period, perhaps I may further suggest how important it is for
the Government to take clear account of the trajectory of an
authority’s performance over the previous two years. If it was
poor and is getting better, that should be born in mind. But that is
not quite the same as, “It was pretty good and it is getting
steadily worse”. Therefore, the four amendments in this group
are important because they would give time for solutions to be found to
those issues. Even if the trajectory is getting worse, it takes only
about 18 months, or perhaps a bit less, for it to improve. Improvement
can be delivered very quickly and peer-group support is a key element

said will be said all over again as we go through the full Committee

to do; namely, to stick purely to the amendment which seeks to delay
any designation for 18 months. Taking a short breath, I have decided
that I will do a bit of both because some areas have come up that are
relevant to the designation. I am sure noble Lords would agree that it

local authorities will know whether they are bordering on designation.
They will know that help will be available if they are designated and

designation can cease following an annual review. I do not think that

Clearly, the criteria are going to be driven by the speed at which
applications are dealt 
<?notus-xml column=1032?>with. That is very clear from the consultation
document. If, in the Government’s eyes, there is a delay in
dealing with an application, why do they attribute blame only to the
local planning authority? The cause could be due to the developer or
other consultees in the community engagement. Why is blame attributed
solely to the local planning authority? That is basically

usually reasons why planning applications are delayed, and one may be
that an application will take longer than the normal consultation

that view forward and say that it has not been able to deal with
certain applications because it has agreed that the process will take

I thought that was quite telling; I have to accept that that is
certainly the effect, but it is not actually the intention. The
intention is to find a better way of dealing with the problem that the
Government perceive. Its intention is to try to help the Minister
achieve the aspiration of never having to use this provision. The

Therefore, when we legislate here, we need the assurances that these
amendments seek to achieve. They may or may not be the right way or the
best way to achieve them, but I discern from this debate that noble
Lords on all sides of the House are seeking those assurances before we
pass this clause. I hope the Minister will take that concern back to
her ministerial colleagues and see what the Government can bring
forward to meet the concern that has been expressed. In the mean

Amendments 27, 28, 29 and 35 in the group. Amendments 2 and 35 have to
an extent been the subject of some discussion on the prior amendments.
The 11th report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
draws the provisions of Clause 1 to the attention of the House.
Specifically, it emphasises the point that, whatever the declared
intent, the Bill does not specify the criteria for designation or
provide for them to be set down in an instrument subject to
parliamentary procedure. That is what the amendment seeks to
rectify<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Amendment 35 requires that there is an affirmative
procedure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:09:46"></hs_TimeCode>. To
emphasise that point, Clause 1(8)
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13012247000298" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000298">“The

the clause has been represented as having very limited application, it
enables a profound shift in process and, indeed, in principle by
removing from democratically elected councils the first engagement with
a planning application, undermining the role of local accountability.
We will debate elsewhere whether such a designation process should
apply and what the appropriate criteria should be, and we will pursue
the point that planning should be not just about process but quality
outcomes. The Delegated Powers Committee said that they must merely be
published. Accordingly, although each local planning authority might be
designated individually, the power may be used by this or a future
Government to designate a significant proportion of local planning
authorities based on criteria that have no relevance to poor
performance. My noble friend Lord Adonis made that point. Essentially
the door would be open for a fundamental undermining of the planning
system as we have known it since 1947. The Delegated Powers and

29 requires the length of the designation to be identified and, more
importantly, what must be achieved for the designation to be removed.
It should mean that a qualitative assessment must be made on a
case-by-case basis of where a local authority is failing. LPAs that
fail on the designation criteria in the Government’s terms will
not necessarily all do so for the same reason. The government
consultation suggests that designation will last at least for a year
but will be subject to review before the end of the year. This is all
very well, but if there is no initial assessment of the problems a
local authority faces, how will improvement be judged? Speed of dealing
with minor applications may be irrelevant; indeed, this aspect of
activity may already be more than satisfactory on the
Government’s criteria. Once designation is made, whether the
local planning authority can show any improvement in handling major
applications is entirely outside its control. The noble Baroness made
the point in response to the previous debate that it will depend on
whether any applicants choose to submit locally, and how many to
the Secretary of State. Improvement should be about

<?notus-xml column=1036?>focusing resources, skills and culture, and performance, and it is also
about the training of counsellors. If central government is to remove
planning powers for a local authority it must be incumbent on the
Secretary of State to make a proper case-by-case assessment of why and
how the authority is failing, and how it can be supported.</hs_para>

28 is very much by way of a fallback position. If the Secretary of
State is to proceed by just publishing criteria, as the Bill currently
allows, at the very least for that to happen, there must be a proper
consultation. The Secretary of State may argue that one has just
closed, but, sadly, it looks as though we will not see the full

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 8, standing in my name, is in
this group. It largely speaks for itself. It requires the Secretary of
State to take into account improvements—or otherwise—that
the planning authority has made in the five years prior to his
considering it for designation. The purpose is that the Secretary of
State should not just take a snapshot, or even just take into account
the two-year period that has been referred to, but should look at the
direction of travel of the planning authority. Has it remained poorly
performing over a significant period? Has it got worse over that
period? In that case, the Secretary of State must truly be looking at
designation. However, if an authority is making significant
improvements over that period—in our previous debate, the noble
Lord, Lord Best, referred to Northumberland making significant
improvements over time—it would be heavy-handed, and I would say
quite wrong, to consider that it should be designated. If it shows
evidence over a significant period that it is putting its house in
order and improving its performance, surely the Secretary of State must
take that into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:16:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012247000236" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0001.htm#13012247000236">Amendment
34 is in the name of the noble Lord, Lord True. As he explained in the
previous debate, unfortunately he had to leave just now to attend a
meeting of his local council, of which he is leader. As my name is on
the amendment and I support it, I will refer to it and say that the
concern is that time taken over legal proceedings under judicial review
should not be counted in this regard. He would like the Minister to

Secretary, I had 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>to suspend the Lambeth, Southwark &amp; Lewisham
Health Authority because it was refusing to live within its cash
limits. That suspension was overturned by the High Court on the grounds
that I had put no limit on the time of suspension. The embarrassing
consequence was that I had to bring legislation before Parliament to
validate what the commissioner whom I had appointed had done in the
intervening period. Has my noble friend taken into account what the
courts might say about what would appear to be an indefinite period of
designation, or does she envisage that a designation will always
include a time limit during which it could be considered, reconsidered
and if necessary renewed? I was stung once, and one can use

Tope. Before I speak to Amendment 33, I will say that I strongly
support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton,
which sets out that the criteria for making decisions should be in
regulations that are subject to parliamentary approval. We can argue
about whether approval should be by affirmative or negative resolution,
which is the argument we normally have, but here we are arguing about
whether the criteria should be in parliamentary regulations and
statutory instruments or whether the Secretary of State should have the
power to issue an order stating what the criteria will be, or simply to
publish the
criteria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:19:58"></hs_TimeCode>.

development orders made in the planning system are not subject to

the system works. This legislation is different because it would take
away the statutory powers of authorities to carry out their planning
functions and transfer them to the Secretary of State. It is on a
different level from normal development orders and it is right and
proper that the criteria should be subject to parliamentary
approval—not the decisions as to which authorities should be
designated but the criteria that the Secretary of State has to follow
to carry out a designation. Unless they are, the opportunities for
judicial review might be substantial simply on the basis of something

there are two issues involved. One is the genuine underlying difference
in performance, which no doubt will and does exist. The other is what
the statistics show and whether those that we have at the moment on
delays in determining planning applications have any underlying
meaning. In many cases, they are based not only on different levels of
efficiency in dealing with planning applications but on the different
practices of local authorities. For example, on major applications, the
level and depth of the pre-application discussions that take place vary
from one local planning authority to another. Some local planning
authorities will wish to extend the pre-application discussions until
they have got to a point where they think they can put an application
through the system and probably get a decision in favour. That will
mean that the submission and registration of the application will take
place later than in other authorities which take the view,
“Let’s get the application in and, once it is in, we can
have a great deal of discussion and debate about it”. Of course,
it will be more difficult to keep that within the 13

authorities that take longer than 13 weeks over many major applications
are necessarily making the decision later than authorities that appear
to make the decision within the 13 weeks. It is a question
of when the application is submitted and registered. There will be
authorities that register an application almost as soon as they get it,
while others will accept the application when it is submitted, look at
it, and then say, “You have not provided this and that, so we
are not going to register the application until you have provided it
all”. All this is done with the agreement of the applicant. The
second group of authorities will fit within the 13 weeks more easily
than the former group because they will spend time gathering
information after the application has been

generally all right with only a few details to be sorted out, some
authorities will give the developer a nod and a wink and come to an
agreement that the application is rejected. Instead of lodging an
appeal, the developer spends a little time sorting out the application
and then resubmits it. I think that developers have a right to resubmit
within 12 months without paying an extra fee. Different practices mean
that authorities generate different statistics in terms of whether they
deal with applications within eight or 13 weeks. The statistics are not
based on differences in the underlying efficiency of authorities, but
if the period of 13 weeks becomes more important because authorities do
not want to be designated, they will use these processes to reduce to a
minimum the work that actually has to take place within the
13 weeks and do as much of it as possible in advance. That
does not mean that the final determination will be made any later or
any sooner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:26:23"></hs_TimeCode>. All

on major applications, negotiations always take place between the
applicant and the local planning authority to cover the detail and

point I made earlier about what happens if the Planning Inspectorate
does not determine an application within 13 weeks was met with the
answer from the Minister: “We intend that they shall do”.
However, a council might also say, “We intend to
determine all our major applications within 13 weeks but we have not
managed to do it”. The Planning Inspectorate may say the same.
My experience, and I think many 
<?notus-xml column=1041?>people’s of the Planning Inspectorate over
the years, is that it has not always been the speediest and most
efficient organisation in the world. I once had an overdue planning
application where the appeal had taken, I think, two and a half years;
a matter that I ended up raising in your Lordships’ House about
10 years ago. Things have improved—I accept
that— and the Planning Inspectorate deals with things
more quickly now, but there is no guarantee whatever that, if it is
dealing with a number of large applications in a particular locality,
it is going to be any more efficient at doing it, for all the reasons

supportive of her, that we really need a greater degree of knowledge.

make no criticism, I think, on either side of the House, of the

she would seek to ensure that there was at least a reasonable degree of
certainty—if not on the face of the Bill, in the secondary
legislation that is indicated in it—so that we are not breaking
what the Constitution Committee quite rightly suggested was the
fundamental rule that you cannot rely on the generalities and
assurances of Ministers to bind their successors. That is just a fact.

first time I have spoken on this Bill and I have a number of
interests to declare. Unfortunately I was not able to be present at
Second Reading, having been laid low by one of those 24-hour bugs which
one hears so much about. I am here not to make good my Second Reading
speech but to pick up on the specifics of this group of amendments. In
so doing, I declare my interest as a practising chartered surveyor with
an involvement with the planning system. I am also the president of the
National Association of Local Councils, which is the national
parent body of parish, town and neighbourhood
councils<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:38:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

have been following the issue of planning and how it has unfolded from
the times when we had county structure plans, and the planning system
under that regime, through to the local development frameworks and
regional spatial strategies, and now into this new era of local plans
and the National Planning Policy Framework. As with all these
situations, we are now in a transition. I fully recognise that and can
understand some of the reasons why the Bill is framed in quite general
terms. Picking up on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Deben, I do
think that there is a lacuna here, but it is slightly different from
the one that he referred
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:39:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012258000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000003">There
are lots of duties in the planning context but I see two particular
ones in local plans. First, there is the duty to deliver on the
national strategic needs, to which a local plan must have regard. We
know what some of those needs are—housing, for instance, because
of the statistics on household formation. The second thing, of course,
is making local decisions for local people. Having not been able to
deliver my Second Reading speech in person, I gave it to the Minister
in writing. I have just had her reply, for which I thank her. I asked a
question about what I saw as a lacuna between the National Planning
Policy Framework, and what the Secretary of State is putting in place
in that respect, and what has to be decided at local level in the local
plan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:40:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012258000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000004">Picking
up on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, I would say that
there is a high degree of variation between different planning
authorities, be it geophysical, social or economic, and we
cannot necessarily second-guess how those will bite. By virtue of
localism and there being a greater say at community and neighbourhood
level, the chances are that the way in which those are cast
into the local plan will be different from what we have experienced
hitherto<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T17:40:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012258000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000005">However,
the larger strategic and supra-local issues and imperatives cannot so
easily be dealt with by localism in terms of the local plan if you are
looking for a local voice and a local view. You require for that
purpose the local view to be better informed and to look outside its
own local existence in a way which I suspect is not the
received wisdom of the fruits of localism being passed to
communities and neighbourhoods. Some of these supra-local issues are
going to be the least palatable to communities, particularly where they
exceed the criteria for local organic

putting in place the National Planning Policy Framework—here I
echo what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said earlier—it was
necessary to try to render down a lot of the guidance and everything
else into a matter of simple arithmetic. My fear is that it has gone
slightly too far in that respect and that some of the more specific
guidance about growth and targets—those things that local plans
needed to build into their criteria that sat above the strictly local
level—is not so well informed under the National
Planning Policy Framework. There is insufficient definition of those
issues in the framework, as opposed to the laudable aspirations that it
contains, for a local planning authority to be able to resolve
them.</hs_para>

need as an organic local construct, as against the national imperative
of household formation, was a matter that I raised with the Minister.
She did 
<?notus-xml column=1043?>not answer that question. I referred to a local authority of my
acquaintance. I shall not name it and I would not be the judge of
designation in such circumstances, but I have seen the numbers go up
from one figure to another figure and back down again. This oscillation
has taken no account of what has happened during the many years that
have passed in the period starting with country structure plan targets
and going on to regional spatial strategies. We are now back to a
figure for that particular authority that is below the figure
considered by the country structure plan and the SERPLAN
decision-making process, yet we know that the numbers likely to be
required, particularly in growth areas and key areas of economic
growth, which is the circumstance of the authority that I had in mind,
are mounting all the time—and there are aspirations. What has
happened with the National Planning Policy Framework is
simplicity—yes—but I am less sure that there is guidance
that is of real use in informing local
plans.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13012258000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000122">5.45

this situation, local planning authorities are obviously going to have
to be judged. Where there is a lack of clarity, the risks of

work things out on the hoof are likely to exacerbate the situation at
precisely the time when we need slicker and speedier delivery of the
economic fruits of growth and infrastructure development. It worries me
that we do not know what the criteria are. I would therefore be in
favour of something along the lines of Amendments 33 and 35,
just by way of making sure that we are clear that there is not some
elephant trap for a local planning authority inadvertently to step
into, and to prevent it being designated as an underperforming
authority for reasons that, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, touched

relating to performance. I would be very worried about using the simple
expedients of the speed of making decisions and the robustness of those
decisions before an inspector is appointed by the Secretary of State.

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their
contributions on this amendment. Some of the ground was covered
previously, but not substantially, so I am grateful for all the views
that have been put forward. What is being underscored here is that a
local authority should not be penalised for something which 
<?notus-xml column=1044?>is well outside its own control. As I said in response to the previous
amendment, it would be our intention that where a local planning
authority was on the bar for designation it would at least be able to
discuss some of the reasons for why it thought that it was slow,
particularly over one or two applications. The noble Lord, Lord
Greaves, is right: there are a number of areas where local authorities
simply cannot do anything about that.</hs_para>

place at any stage in the planning process. If you get to a certain

34, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord True, and to which the noble Lord,
Lord Tope, spoke, concerns the question of judicial review and proposes
that any judicial review should be excluded from any assessment of
speed. An absolutely minute number of planning applications are subject
to judicial review and, in the vast majority of those cases, the
proceedings are instigated once the application has been determined.
They do not take place during the course of the review, which might
take up time. I do not think that judicial review will impede
councils’ performance on the consideration of the application.
It is therefore unnecessary to make special provision for applications
subject to judicial review in any way. I suspect that if it happened in
the middle of a process it would be as relevant to have that as a
planning agreement to be sorted out as any other. I need to check that,
but that seems a pretty logical

because if it is still not at the criteria level now, it will make no
difference whether it started from nought or not or whether it has gone

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to
Amendments 5 and 25 in this group. These amendments would preclude the
Secretary of State from including in the types of application that can
be made to the Secretary of State, rather than a designated authority,
certain types of developments. We have a parallel amendment grouped
with this that would preclude any planning authority with
responsibility for all or part of any of these areas from being
designated. These include developments affecting flood
risk areas, world heritage sites, national parks,
areas of 
<?notus-xml column=1048?>outstanding national beauty and sites of special scientific interest.
Our natural environment and our heritage are precious assets that
require special consideration in this context. Indeed, issues around
conserving and enhancing the natural and historic environment, and
meeting the challenges of climate change, flooding and coastal change,
rightly feature robustly in the NPPF.</hs_para>

allayed by discussion at the other end on this matter, is that the
focus on process and timing under Clause 1 will drive the behaviours of
local planning authorities and the speed of decision-making to run
contrary to a wider, quality-led approach, which the NPPF demands. What
it demands entails significant engagement, and not just from the
applicant. It is clear from the Government’s consultation
document that they see the speed of decision-making as paramount and
are intent on increasing the threshold for designation in subsequent
years, so excluding these situations from designation entirely is a
necessary protection.</hs_para>

made great play of having clarity over designation, indicating that it
will follow automatically after some transitional issues. However, we
may have a qualification on that as a result of our last exchange.

From what the noble Baroness said a moment ago, perhaps she will say
that that is now not the case.</hs_para>

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 6 stands in my name and has been
suggested by both the Local Government Association and the Campaign to
Protect Rural England. It would of course mean that only local
authorities which do not already have a local plan in place could be
designated as poorly performing. In other words, it would immediately
remove from the possibility of designation all those authorities that
have a local plan in place. As we all know, the preparation and
adoption of a local plan is a lengthy process. It is sometimes too
lengthy a process but it is fully democratic and shows that the
planning authority concerned is performing to proper democratic
accords. On that basis, it is believed that they should be excluded
from this threat.</hs_para>

than that. National parks are very special places that have been
designated for very special reasons. The national park planning
authorities are already different from ordinary local planning
authorities. They are not the ordinary district councils; they are the
national park authority, which is a planning authority in its own
right. A substantial proportion of the members of national park
authorities are already nominated and appointed by the Secretary of
State; I think it is the Defra Secretary of State, but is definitely a

take functions such as major planning applications away from the
national park authority, in these very special places with their very
special landscapes, and put them in the hands of a different Secretary
of State —the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government—with a quite different agenda risks the balance of
decision-making on these applications in national parks, shifting away
from the importance of nature and landscape and towards development.
Clearly, there always has to be a balance in every sort of area and
national parks have to have development, but the criteria on which
planning applications in national parks are assessed and decided are
materially different from the criteria in much of the rest of the
country. That is why they have been designated as national parks. The
national park authorities have the responsibility for looking after
those parks and for ensuring that those criteria are applied, in the
interests not just of the landscape but of the people who live there.
To take that away from them on technical operational grounds, based on
the proportion of planning applications that were dealt with and
determined within a two-year period or on other similar criteria, would
be quite wrong.</hs_para>

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, on this occasion I hope that the Minister
will not accept any of these amendments because they do not stand up at
all. As she knows, I am not happy about this clause, but the national
park authorities have one of the worst reputations when it comes to
dealing with applications—we cannot avoid that; when I was
Secretary of State I had a constant stream of particular authorities
that were quite unable to do these things properly—and the idea
that somehow or other they should be put aside seems to be
unacceptable. If, as we are beginning to understand, the criteria are
largely those of speed, it would do the national parks quite a lot of
good to get their answers in rather more quickly than they do at the
moment. The idea that they have to be slower than anyone else is not an
acceptable position as far as national parks are concerned. If we
accepted the quantum of these amendments, there would hardly be any
application anywhere in the country that would not find itself in one
way or another touched by one of the designations that we are talking

ought to concentrate on the issue that really matters, which is how we
make the clause work in a sensible and transparent way. That is what we
have been pressing for, and to try to avoid its implication by putting
a series of designations outwith it does two things that are dangerous:
first, it would remove any value that the clause might have, and,
secondly, it would detract from the things that we are trying to say
elsewhere. I want a regime that can work properly wherever in the
country it is applied. I hope therefore that the Minister will not
accept these amendments but that she will recognise that the reason for
them fundamentally is this unhappiness with the uncertainty of the
basis upon which this clause is going to be imposed.</hs_para>

about the objectivity, correctness and clarity of the basis on which a
planning authority will be designated, there would be much less of a
problem. It is the unhappiness with that which lies behind most of our
concern. If the Minister could put that right, I think most of us would
accept that within those contexts it is perfectly reasonable to ask the
planning authority of a national park to do its job within a reasonable
amount of time. If it has only two planning applications a year, then
obviously no Minister is going to say, “We’re going to
apply the 30% rule”—I am not sure how you would apply
that—and I am not too upset about that; it does not worry me too

respond briefly to the noble Lord, Lord Beecham? He questioned whether
the 20 years suggested in my amendment might be too long. He may well
be right and it may well be so. At this stage, my consideration is more
to get the principle accepted rather than a specific time period. Part
of the reason for that is that I think we would all want to incentivise
the surprisingly large number of local authorities that still do not
have a local plan in place. The positive intent, if you like, of the
amendment is to provide that incentive. I suggest that whether the
period is 20 years, 15 years or any other period is less material at

criteria for granting planning permission in national parks are much
more rigorous and strict than in many areas, many developments will
actually need more time for negotiation and discussions with the
applicants to make them acceptable within a national park context. In
national parks particularly, it may well be that some of the
authorities are not as efficient as they might be—I can quite
believe that—but in general I would expect that similar
applications in national parks will take longer than in what I might
call ordinary areas, for those reasons.</hs_para>

statistics are interesting and worth putting on the record. In the past
year the Lake District had 19 major planning
applications—far more than most others, which is
interesting—and the Broads Authority had 13. Of the rest,
Dartmoor had two, Exmoor had two, the New Forest had seven, the North
York Moors had seven, Northumberland had two, the Peak National Park
had five and the Yorkshire Dales had three. With that level of
application, it would clearly be ludicrous to apply anything like a
strict 30% rule or any other simple
cut-off.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012258000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000055"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:19:23"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Lord Jenkin of Roding" PimsId="1169" UID="13012258000145" xid="1291" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000145"><B>Lord

to have regard to flood risk and any designations that affect the site,

where local plans are not up to date. They are required to do so by
law, just as the local planning authority is. Similarly, there is no
logic in saying that local authorities should be 
<?notus-xml column=1053?>exempted from designation just because they have responsibility for
protected areas. Applicants for planning permission and local
communities should be served by an effective planning service in these

We will, of course, be looking carefully at what the consultation
responses say about this, but I do not think a case could be made to
exclude national parks from possible designation just because they are
national parks and because they may not deal with an enormous number of
applications. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, read out the list that I
have had passed to me, and it is clear that some have more than others.
The same argument can be made for all the other areas that noble Lords
want to exclude. I guess most, or a great part, of London is in

applicant can bypass the local planning authority and make an
application directly to the Secretary of State. As a practical matter,
it is expected that this means it will be dealt with by the Planning
Inspectorate, although it does not have to be the Planning
Inspectorate, as I understand it, to which the 
<?notus-xml column=1054?>Secretary of State delegates this task. To be able to do this, the local
planning authority in question must have been designated and the
development in question must be of a description prescribed by the
Secretary of State. The prescription is by way of an order subject to
the negative procedure. This amendment seeks to clarify in the Bill
that the application must relate to a major development. I think the
noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has a parallel amendment requiring that
before prescribing any types of application there should be
consultation with local government and that the regulations should be
affirmative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012258000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000071">The
power for the Secretary of State to decide which applications he wishes
to determine is very wide. The Government state that it will be limited
to applications relating to major developments, but the Bill places no
such limitation on the power to prescribe, just as the Bill places no
limitation on the type of planning authority that might be designated.
This is frankly not good enough. This is in line with the other
discussions we have had. Indeed, as matters stand, there seems to be
nothing to prevent a local planning authority being designated because
of perceived poor performance on the timing of decisions on major
applications but all its application being open to be determined by the

State.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012258000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000072">We are

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I need to start by explaining why we
have made provision for connected applications in subsections (3) and
(4) of new Section 62A to be inserted in the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990 under Clause 1. In the few cases where a
planning application is submitted directly to the Secretary of
State—that is, at the behest of the developer—it is
important that if there are any other consents that need to be obtained
under the planning Acts, and which are directly connected to the scheme
concerned, it makes sense to have the ability for them to be considered
by the Secretary of State at the same time. That would be a normal
planning process.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:40:25"></hs_TimeCode>This is not a
hidden provision that would allow an expansion in the use of Clause 1
by the back door but a common-sense measure to minimise bureaucracy and
to streamline the
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012258000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000093">We
have not sought to specify every single consent that could conceivably
fall into this category but have instead cited the principal ones and
given the Secretary of State the ability to prescribe any additional
consents that may need to be dealt with in a similar way, which
might include, for example, hazardous waste, advertisement consent or
tree preservation order consent. There probably are some others but
those would be the main ones.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012258000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000094">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:41:09"></hs_TimeCode>
is a common approach in legislation, which avoids the Act becoming
unnecessarily detailed and complicated. In practice, it will relate
just to a small number of applications and consents that are required
only occasionally, and which are, additionally, limited 
<?notus-xml column=1058?>to consents required under the planning Acts and not
under any other legislation. Nor is there any need, as Amendment 11
seeks to do, to say in the Bill that in dealing with such applications
the Secretary of State should comply with relevant statutory
requirements. We will ensure through the secondary legislation that all
statutory requirements apply, whoever the decision-maker is.</hs_para>

17 seeks to make decisions about the submission or transfer of
connected applications subject to published criteria. Once again, I do
not think that placing such a requirement in the Bill is at all
necessary. It usually will be a matter of common sense as to whether a
particular consent is “connected” or not. Therefore, we
do not need to add to the mountain of planning guidance that already
exists. Indeed, as noble Lords will know, the Government are
undertaking a radical streamlining of the planning guidance under the
noble Lord, Lord Taylor. He probably would not welcome adding any more
to his

briefly with Amendment 12, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has
said, concerns the language—we have discussed this on many
occasions as regards many amendments—and whether it should say
“may” rather than “must”. However, this is
consistent with the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which is the
legislation that this clause would amend. This is a matter of drafting
convention that we should respect. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked
me where the advice would come from and whether an application is
connected. We would expect that that would be covered in any
pre-application discussions either at the time the application was
moved to the Planning Inspectorate or initially.</hs_para>

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, I think I have got the answer that I
was seeking on the “may/must” issue: the Secretary of
State would send it back to the local planning authority and there
would be no question—I think that those were the
Minister’s words—about that, which is okay. As
someone who believes that words must mean what they mean, I do not
understand why it should say “may”. Nevertheless, I

the conservation consents and the listed building consents fit
naturally with the relevant application with which the Secretary of
State is dealing. I started to get a bit alarmed when the Minister
referred to advertisement consent and TPOs. Advertisement consent tends
to concern things that happen over a period of time. For example, at
the beginning of a big new development, there will be some adverts. But
what happens if someone comes along two years after the development has
taken place and asks for more or different advertisements, or whatever?
Because the application originally had been a relevant application
dealt with by the Secretary of 
<?notus-xml column=1059?>State and assuming that the authority was still designated two years
later, would it still go to the Secretary of State or would it be
regarded as a completely new application, although not a major
application because it refers to just advertisement consent, and be
dealt with by the local authority in the normal way? In other words,
what would the system be for minor additions to the development or
minor changes to the development once the development had been
completed and signed off? That is the question that arises in my
mind.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13012258000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012258000126">6.45

is not usually a question of consent as regards tree preservation
orders. It is usually a question of the local planning authority making
TPOs generally against what the applicants would really like or because
there is a fear that the development will interfere with some
particular trees. They may have been there for quite a long time and no
one has threatened them in any way: therefore, they do not have TPOs.
An application comes along for development and TPOs are put on at the
instigation of the local authority in order to protect those trees from
being harmed by the development. Obviously, that takes place in the
context of the planning application. If a building is being built and
there is a tree in the middle of it, a TPO is not put on it. But TPOs
perhaps are put on surrounding trees which are important to the
landscape or the
streetscape<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:46:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

will comment again on TPOs. It seems that they are a classic case where
making the TPOs at least should remain with the local planning

which sometimes takes place—might be regarded as being connected
to the development. When we talk about trees, they always make

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 13 and this group of
amendments are about money and the extent to which local planning
authorities will be recompensed for work that they do which is related
to applications that have been referred to the Secretary of State as
relevant applications. Amendments 14 and 23 in this group
also stand in my name and other amendments in the group stand in that

13 is an even more classic traditional amendment, which seeks to leave
out “and”. However, the grouped Amendment 14 is rather
more significant. It also concerns connected applications. If somebody
lodges a connected application with the Secretary of State and the
latter, after due consideration, decides that it is not a connected
application and sends it back to the local authority—as the
Minister assured us would happen when we discussed the previous group
of amendments—what happens to the fee that has been
paid when that application was lodged and submitted? Is that fee
returned with the application to the local authority or is it returned
to the applicant and the latter is told to make a new application with
an appropriate fee to the local planning authority? This is a technical
issue but one that needs to be cleared

can imagine that it is most likely to happen in the case of the local
planning authority which has been designated and which will still be in

to me that this is a perfectly reasonable way in which the new system
might work: namely, that the planning inspectorate has somebody dealing
with applications in a particular authority, but dealing with
them through that authority’s staff. Perhaps this would be a way
of giving support and training to help that authority become more
efficient.</hs_parafo>

happens, if the local authority has to do work in relation to an

should be handed over to the local authority to enable it at the very

its major source of planning income—the major

Committee in another place, the Minister was taken to task over the
rather strange wording of this provision under which the Secretary of
State can give a local authority or hazardous substances

obviously gives rise to uncertainty about resources and

may know the outcome by the time we get to
Report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T18:57:26"></hs_TimeCode>. The
consultation suggests that a small number of administrative functions
will need to be carried out locally, including: site notices and
neighbour notification; providing the planning history of
the site; and notification of any cumulative impact
considerations, such as where environmental impact assessments or

local planning authority would remain responsible for maintaining the
planning register. The discharge of any planning conditions would
remain the responsibility of the local planning authority. If this is
the range and type of functions envisaged, they should be clearly set
out and subject to some process. At the very least we need something

for reimbursement of costs, I anticipate that the Government’s
response will remain that planning fees will go to the Secretary of

loss-making activity for local authorities, notwithstanding the recent
increase in fees, they will be relieved of this loss and in any event

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I understand and agree with the
intention behind Amendments 13 and 14. We have no argument with the
suggestion that the fee for any connected application should be
transferred to the local planning authority or the hazardous substances
authority if it is found that the application is not, in fact,
connected and the authority is the most appropriate body to determine
the application. I hope that that covers those points. That is not,
however, something that we want to provide for in the Bill, because
such matters are most appropriately dealt with, alongside
other fees issues, in the appropriate secondary legislation. It will be
in secondary legislation and I should like to reassure noble Lords that
that is what we
intend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012260000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012260000012">Turning
to the other amendments in this group, it is our intention that the
Planning Inspectorate will deal with as many aspects of an application
made directly to the Secretary of State as possible. In these
circumstances, as the consultation document makes very clear, we intend
to ask a designated planning authority to carry out only some basic
administrative tasks. These include entering the application on the
local authority’s planning 
<?notus-xml column=1063?>register, undertaking neighbour notification and posting site notices.
Therefore, subsection (6) of this clause has probably generated more
excitement than is merited because none of these situations is very
cost-intensive. While the provision indeed gives the Secretary of State
a direction-making power in relation to designated authorities, it is
intended to be used in a manner strictly limited to those aspects of
handling an application for which it makes absolute sense for the job
to be done locally. While I agree with the sentiment behind Amendment
20, I am not convinced that it is necessary to put such a requirement
in the Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012260000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012260000013">I
am also confident that there is no need to add
“designated” before “authority” in
subsection (6)(b), which Amendments 21 and 22 seek to do. The

been designated under this clause. It follows that the additional words

numbers and it may not be possible to split them up into part-time
staff. The authority may have to choose, if it has four development

the department to performing basic administrative tasks simply may not
be possible in reality because, with the best will in the world, the

information and knowledge, which will reside within the local planning
department; there is no doubt about that. Is the idea that the
department will perform only a few administrative tasks and that staff
will not receive telephone calls, e-mails or whatever asking for more
information? When you are dealing with a major planning application,
all the time you are seeking lots of information from lots of sources,
and some of it will be ambiguous and you will want to know its planning
history. You will therefore go to the local planning officers to get
that information. That will inevitably take up their time and some of
the resources of the local authority. The idea that the local authority
planning officers simply bang up a few notices on site or put them in
the local paper is utterly unrealistic. They are going to get involved
because it will be in the interests of the Planning Inspectorate that
they do so; and that will be the way to get a good, quick and efficient
decision. The inspectorate should not have to seek information from
scratch when it is there within the local planning department. That
will happen all the time and it will cost money. We may continue to

raised some extremely important issues. Perhaps this is a matter on
which we could receive a letter but my understanding is that the
imposition of conditions will be part of the planning permission. I am
not sure what “discharge of conditions” means, but if it
means checking that they are taking place, and monitoring and
supervising that, if the local planning authority is to carry that out,
depending what the conditions are, it will take time and
resources—particularly staff time. If there are then complaints
from anybody that it is being done wrongly, the local authority will be
responsible for enforcement. That costs money, which, in a normal state
of affairs, would be partly paid for by the planning application fee.
In the case of big applications, the fee can be

I had when the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, was questioning the Minister
was that it is inconceivable that a local planning authority—by

if it is a major planning application. It is inconceivable that the
planning management committee, or whatever it is called in a particular
area, will not consider that application, just as the local parish
councils will do. In doing so, it will want quite a lot of solid
evidence from its officers. It will not be prepared to behave like a
parish council that simply gets the application and talks about it but
does not really have any expert advice, the advice being based on local
knowledge and so on; it will be a planning committee which expects a
proper report and which expects to make representations to the
Secretary of State—or Planning Inspectorate—who makes the
decision. It is inconceivable that that would not happen.</hs_para>

need to correct what I said so that we are absolutely clear. I should
have remembered that the proposal in the consultation is that the
planning authority will continue to deal with Section 106 and the
discharge of conditions, although we will of course need to look at
what people have said in the consultation. However, the proposal is not
as I think I presented it; it is that the planning authority will
continue with Section
106<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:12:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, this gets a bit more mysterious. The
decision on whether or not to grant planning permission sometimes
depends on whether a satisfactory Section 106 agreement is available.
That is what tips the balance one way or the other if it is a marginal
application. Certainly, I do not know what “discharge of
conditions” means. Perhaps we need to understand that, as I have
already said. However, the decision as to what the conditions are is an
integral part of granting planning permission. You do not grant
planning permission and then sit around thinking, “What
conditions shall we put on it?”. You discuss the conditions and
all the arrangements and then, on the basis of the whole package, you
say, “Yes, that’s okay”. You might take off one
condition that is proposed and put on another, or you might say,
“We’ll have another condition to make it reasonable for
people within that particular street”, or whatever. That is how
it works, and I simply do not understand how the Planning Inspectorate
can give planning permission without conditions. I do not believe that
it is going to do so because, with regard to appeals, when an
application is turned down the inspector decides what conditions to put
on at that stage. He will always ask the local planning authority that
turned down the application for a list of possible conditions if he
decides to approve it. That is how it works. I think that we need some
clarity on this. Having said that, I shall make a further attempt to
beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

that paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 to the Town and Country
Planning Act 1990 will apply to relevant applications

because most of the consultation rules for planning applications are
set down in secondary legislation. However, this one appears in the
schedule to the primary legislation—the main Act—and it
sets out the rules for notification to parish and town councils of
planning applications and any significant amendments to planning
applications. It is a procedure that is well established and well
understood, and it happens because it is in the legislation. Local
planning authorities are geared up to do it, and it is obviously now
easy enough to do so with electronic communications. It is absolutely
vital that the Secretary of State is given the same
duty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:17:18"></hs_TimeCode>. Given that
this duty lies on the face of the 1990 Act, it seems

amendments refer to publicity; consultation, including with statutory

designated local planning authority. Some local planning authority
applications may still be major applications that people have preferred
to submit locally, and some will be relevant applications that go off
to the Secretary of State.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:19:16"></hs_TimeCode> important
principle is that all the bodies consulted should be the same in both
cases. In most cases they will be because most of the consultees are
statutory. For example, there is the local highways authority and the
Environment Agency and so on, and they have to be consulted, but
practice varies in different areas. In some, local organisations will
be consulted because of local circumstances—for example, the
internal drainage board. One can imagine all kinds of local bodies that
the local planning authority has decided at some stage are important
enough locally to be added to the list of consultees, and so the
consultation goes off automatically with all the

further part of this amendment refers to the rights of ordinary members
of the public—citizens—to make representations about
planning applications. It might be a big application and they might
have strong views on how it might affect their area or their town, they
might be in favour of it because of the extra jobs, or they might be
against it because it is being built in an area that they value. In
every area, there is a system by which people can put forward their
views; it varies from council to council because councils over the
years have brought in different ways in which people could make
representations. In particular, in some areas, people have the right to
make representations in person to the decision-making body—the
committee which has responsibility for determining applications. If
that right is to be taken away, or other similar rights are to be taken
away because the application is being dealt with by the Secretary of
State nationally, at the very least, that is not going to go
down very well in those areas. It is unnecessary and a publicity

It means that the Planning Inspectorate has to make some arrangements
whereby people can make representations direct to the planning
inspector who is primarily dealing with this application. If that does
not take place, then there is a dysfunction between the rights that
people have—the rights in the general sense—and the rules
that apply to the way in which they can put forward their views on
planning applications in an
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:21:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012260000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012260000038">Amendment
31 is related to the ability to inspect documents. Again, there will be
a system locally and people will know what that system is. They will
know that if they want to inspect documents, they have to go to the
town hall or perhaps the local library, or wherever it is. The council
may have district offices where relevant planning applications in an
area are provided. It is very important, if this system is to work
smoothly, that people can find the applications in the same places,
under the same terms, even though the application is being made to the
Secretary of State and not to the local planning authority.</hs_para>

a lot of people look on the internet for this information, so it is
important that whatever system there is locally, access to information
on the internet—including all the planning documents related to
the application—applies to a planning application made to the
Secretary of State. This must not be on some obscure website that
people cannot find because it is a government website hidden away
somewhere when they are used to finding local planning applications on
the local authority’s website. It can be made perfectly clear
who is making the decision on the application—who is determining

being contrary to the localism agenda; I cannot say that I was entirely
convinced, but she obviously is concerned that it should be consonant
with the localism agenda. Surely, the one important thing in the
localism agenda is that the public locally feel themselves involved.
The nature of the kinds of applications which are likely to be referred
to the Minister rather than to the local authority is that they will be
controversial and particularly controversial locally.</hs_para>

in the light of that report to which my noble friend Lord Jenkin
referred, one could say that that was another cost on the back of the

very expensive. A lot of volunteers, including me, worked on
it, but it delivered a locally agreed attitude and a locally agreed
solution. Sizewell B has been overwhelmingly supported throughout its
operation by people locally because it started by people being able to
put the issues that they were concerned about. I cite that example to
the Minister because what came out of those discussions were that the
things the public were concerned about, which were not the same things
that the media said they were concerned about. It was not the nuclear
issue but where the lorries would go, where people would park and what
would happen to the buildings that would be used temporarily for

is incredibly important that there is a clear protocol that does not

small discussion, a big discussion or a written

I am very unhappy about being so uncertain about who should have this

really will be affected, which is not necessarily done by applying to
the preservation society, or the local residents’ association.
We need to make sure that everybody who has a view and needs to put it
forward can do so. Written submissions are all right for people in
metropolitan places, but those of us who have worked for so long in
rural areas know perfectly well that it is not a means of
communication that people necessarily find easy and that they want

they do not want to have those opportunities restricted in the sense of
there being some sort of spokesman who will put forward what they

I was not one of those who said he had nothing to do with planning
applications. I had a lot to do with planning applications and I made
sure that the local party knew what people thought. I did not tell it
what to do but I made sure that it knew what people thought. I am very
worried because I do not see that people will have their voice heard at
all unless there is a much tougher statement from the Government that
will be included in the supplementary legislation and the guidance to
ensure that the inconvenient facts, which are that the public do not
always welcome a particular development and do not always have the same
problems with a development as the experts would want them to have,
ought to be certainly faced. If this House does not face it I am not
sure who will insist that people locally should feel part of the
decision. I cannot guarantee to the Minister that people will agree
with the decision, but I can guarantee that if they do not feel they
have been part of that decision it will be difficult to carry it
through and there will be more and more direct action by people who

is not clear to me precisely what has been appealed and whether the

under the original 1990 legislation, the parish council had to notify
the planning authority that it wanted to be notified in relation to
appeals. I do not see how that process will operate with the Planning
Inspectorate. I am sure that there must be a way, but I would
appreciate having some clarification as to how it will work in
practice. The effect of Clause 1 is to move this one stage further away
from the parish and neighbourhood in an application going direct to the

because conscience and truth go together, it must be right that there
is more concern about freedom of religion than there has been for some
time. This debate is topical because of a considerable increase in the
encroachments upon religious freedom all over the world. Many sources
could be cited. Objectively, I draw particular attention to the United
States State Department’s annual report of 2011 from its Office
of International Religious Freedom. This records a rising tide of
anti-Semitism in many parts of the world and pressures on many
religious groups: the Baha’i and Sufi Muslims in Iran, Coptic
Christians in Egypt, Ahmadis in Indonesia and Pakistan, and Muslims in
a range of countries, including Europe. I emphasise that that is not an

not to indulge in a tit-for-tat debate about who is persecuted most but
to emphasise that no one should be discriminated against on grounds of
religion or conscience, for the sake of the stability of societies and
their common good in a multicultural and multifaith world. Towards this
goal, it is essential that religious communities speak out on behalf of
others and not only their own adherents. Also, faith communities should
not be slow in condemning behaviour within their own communities which
is discriminatory to

sadly recognise that no religious communities have a perfect track
record in this regard. Even this House, with another place and the

example, to the Act of Uniformity. Although it returned the <I>Book of
Common Prayer</I> to 
<?notus-xml column=1076?>the Church of England and the nation in 1662, it was also the instrument
of the expulsion of many ministers and people who could not accept it.
Nor was Catholic emancipation so strongly supported from these very
Episcopal Benches in the beginning of the 19th century; nor were
Methodists much welcomed as partners in the Gospel. I am aware of

contrary, have precedence over another right, such as the corporate
image of a company. I am thinking here of the Coptic Christian, Ms
Nadia Eweida, her modest cross and British Airways. In the other three
cases the balance was held to be different—health and safety,
for example, in the case of the hospital ward or surgical theatre. My
point here is that a balance of rights and recognition of context is
indicative of religious freedom as a real and not only a nominal human
right. Nor is religious freedom ultimately in opposition to other

Parekh:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Guildford for securing this debate and introducing it with
such wisdom and eloquence. As the subject of the
debate rightly points out, freedom 
<?notus-xml column=1078?>of religion and conscience is both a human right
and a source of stability; in other words, it is desirable in
principle as well as for its consequences. I have two small but
critical footnotes to add to the

about religion and conscience, there is a danger—I do not think
that the Bishop made this mistake—of equating conscience with
religion as if a non-religious conscience does not have the same rights
as a religious conscience. I would like to insist that atheist and
secularly minded people can feel just as strongly, hold certain beliefs
just as strongly and be committed to a certain way of life just as
strongly as religious people, and they need to be protected. Secondly,
I am slightly uneasy about calling freedom of religion a fundamental
human right. If something is important enough to be a human right, by
calling it fundamental one is either guilty of tautology and thus not
adding anything or one creates confusion by saying that there can be
human rights which are not fundamental. To call something a human right
is by definition to say that it is absolutely fundamental and
non-negotiable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T20:02:09"></hs_TimeCode>.

to promote freedom of religion internationally. How can we do that? I
think that there are two ways, although there is a tendency to
concentrate on one and neglect the other. We promote freedom of
religion positively as well as negatively. We do it positively by
persuasion, through moral and political pressure and by setting an
ideal example. However, I do not think that we have always been a good
example in terms of promoting freedom of religion in our own society
and therefore sometimes we have spoken to the world in inconsistent
voices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T20:03:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on how we can promote freedom of religion negatively, and on how we
have failed to do so. We can easily undermine the conditions in which
freedom of religion can grow and flourish in other societies. We do
that by following certain kinds of economic and foreign policies that
create the conditions in which religion becomes an object of suspicion,
conflict is created between religious groups, and religion becomes the
site where deep political and economic group conflicts are played out.
By and large, in every society people know that they have to live
together and they work out a kind of modus vivendi whereby those of
different religions somehow rub along and learn to live together.
Things begin to go wrong when the normal rhythm of that human
relationship is disturbed, and that is where the outsider comes
in. The outsider can disturb the rhythm of human
relationships by creating conflict, wittingly or unwittingly.
Situations can be created in which people feel threatened, frightened
and besieged, so they turn on each other as objects of hatred.
Consciously or unconsciously, I think that we did that in Iraq by
invading the country and in how we ran it afterwards, creating conflict
between the Shias and the Sunnis. That is what we did in uncritically
supporting Saudi Arabia and the Wahhabis where religion is hardly
respected; or at least only a particular kind of religion is
respected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T20:04:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

done by supporting aggressive secularism, as we did in the case of
Algeria several years ago when the army took over. We are so frightened

<?notus-xml column=1079?>of religion that we encouraged secular forces
which came down heavily on religious people, who then felt
threatened and became terrorists. That gave rise to a vicious cycle
whereby religious and secular fundamentalism have played each other
out. If we are really concerned about freedom of religion, we have to
make sure that our foreign and economic policies do not create the
conditions, wittingly or unwittingly, in which religious groups are at
each other’s throats and, as a result, freedom of religion
becomes the first

indulging in tit for tat, the reality is that the faith tradition now
suffering the most widespread and systematic violations of religious
freedom is Christianity. It is estimated that there are at least
250 million Christians suffering persecution today, from
harassment, intimidation and imprisonment to torture and execution.
Major ideological contexts include residual Marxism-Leninism in China
and Cuba, the totalitarian repression of any religion in North Korea,
and extremist Hinduism erupting into episodic attacks on other faiths
in India. But the most widespread and escalating violations of freedom
of religion for Christians are associated with militant Islamism. The
so-called Arab spring has left a legacy of increased pressure on
Christian communities in countries such as Egypt. President
Mubarak’s rule posed many challenges for the Coptic Christian
community, but since his downfall there have been even more attacks on
Christian communities and the exodus of many Copts from
Egypt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012264000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012264000046">Time

firsthand experience of visiting communities suffering from militant
Islamism in Nigeria and Sudan. Last June, I and HART colleagues visited
the states of Plateau, Bauchi and Kano in Nigeria. The Islamist Boko
Haram group, to which the right reverend Prelate referred, had already
attacked many churches with the express intention of eliminating all
Christians from northern Nigeria. Suicide bombers had driven into
church services, detonating their bombs and causing multiple deaths and
injuries. But the Boko Haram assaults are just the latest in many
attacks against Christian communities in Nigeria over the past 20
years. Thousands of Christians have died and hundreds of churches have
been destroyed.</hs_para>

many have died from starvation. Some 200,000 have fled to refugee camps
in South Sudan. Those suffering include Christians, Muslims and African
traditional believers who resist the Khartoum Government’s
intention to impose Sharia law. The people of the Nuba Mountains are

the first issue, as to whether everything is all right in the United

there are some who would say that it is not. How so? We have a head of

gorgeously enrobed bishops here in their places to show that they are
part of the body religious. However, if you go a little further than
that you see that we live in a very secular society. Religion is a

that the churches and Her Majesty’s Government must under all

three countries where some people have suggested that we have not been
even-handed. Turkey is a fellow NATO member and one-time cadet member
of the European Union. It is a terrific place to do business in but not
very free as far as religion is concerned. Sometimes people have said
that UK Governments—in the past, I am not just speaking about
since 2010—have been pretty muted in what they have said about
the terrible conditions of the Alevi Muslim minority sect. It is also
pretty rough to be a Greek Orthodox in Istanbul today. An Anglican
vicar—I hope I have the term right—came to see me not
long ago in your Lordships’ House. He tries to minister to
holidaymakers—it is a very good job that they go to church in a
couple of the peninsulas in Turkey—but he says that he is not
given the freedom to have a public service anywhere. He has to have the
mass or celebration, as in the old days, in a house church. He asked
why the Turkish Government cannot be nicer to Anglicans. I said that I
did not know. I am nice to Anglicans and try to be nice to them all the

raising this profound issue for our world, of freedom of conscience, as
a human right

want to concentrate on two areas. The first is the increasing abuse of
blasphemy laws across the world. The Church of Pakistan has actively
challenged the misuse of blasphemy laws in that country, which has led
to the persecution of both Hindus and Christians and which, in
particular, appears to be used to prevent Muslims from converting to
another religion or to no religion. Although it is perfectly
appropriate to deprecate the insulting of any religion, it is a denial
of human rights to prevent anyone from changing or abandoning their
faith stance. In principle, Pakistan continues to uphold the rights of
religious minorities but, in practice, the existence of the blasphemy
laws encourages illegal persecution and
rejection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T20:15:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012264000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012264000059">The
same sort of danger exists, for example, in Sri Lanka, where Muslim and
Christian minorities fear the effect of blasphemy laws in a

second point of emphasis is on the way in which our Government could,

main commonality between people of all religions is that they cherish
the sense of unity provided to them by their faith, a sense of
belonging and endearment that often carries over into a sense of
comfort and stability on a regional or national level. I have always
maintained that there are more similarities between people than
differences and nowhere is this truer than in faith. Unfortunately, in
some parts of the world, certain religious communities are undermined
and persecuted for their beliefs. The United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights provides for freedom of religious
expression, yet too often a growing number of individuals are denied
this fundamental right. I am not naive to the fact that evil is
sometimes conducted in the name of religion, but these minorities are
merely using their manipulative interpretations of faith for their own
gain. The message that we are calling for to be promoted here today
will help to tackle this destructive behaviour, which is detrimental
not just to religious communities but to their relationships with
others who live alongside
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012264000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0002.htm#13012264000067">In a

increase, up from 15% 2001 to 25%—or 14 million British
citizens—in just 10 years. I speculate, but the fact
that so many millions of our fellow citizens now refuse any religious
affiliation may well be linked to the increase in violence by religious
extremists. As we have heard tonight, noble Lords who are religious

minorities and limit the freedom of expression of non-believers, or
even threaten them with death. Inevitably, that continual, low-profile
oppression has been overshadowed by the sheer scale of sectarian

After all, the 25% who declare that they have no religion are in almost

in Britain share common values—many of them anathema to the

discuss issues of religion and human rights, it is to consider the ways
in which sets of rights conflict—or seem to be in
conflict—with each other. I was particularly pleased to hear the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford note that religious
freedom is not ultimately in opposition to other rights such as freedom
of expression, non-discrimination, women’s rights and gay
rights. As a humanist, I would certainly not suggest that freedom of
religion and belief be elevated over other human rights, nor that they
can go unchallenged where the safety or rights of others are
threatened. Yet neither can religious belief simply be seen as a right
at the margins, to be considered only when no other rights come into
play. In that context, the point made by the right reverend Prelate
about the right to manifest religion taking precedence over other
rights, such as the corporate image of a company, was an important one.
Above all, a balance of rights and a recognition of context are
indicative of religious freedom as a real, not just a nominal, human
right.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012272000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0003.htm#13012272000013">As
with other fundamental freedoms, religious freedom is something that
benefits everyone because it creates conditions for peace,
democratisation, development and human rights. To that end, I ask the
Minister whether the Government have considered following the example
of such countries as Canada and the US in prioritising the issue of
protecting religious freedoms. Our country’s links of tradition
and trade to many of the most troubled areas make it well placed to use
that influence to best effect. And act we must, for the
human rights abuses of which we have heard this evening must not be
allowed to continue
unchallenged.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_22_PT_1/A9BD3AE41F5938D364C8945211B400F344247577" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 January 2013">Tuesday,

Resolution 1618 as a framework. It is important diplomacy but of course
it is risky; I have had numerous conversations with my officials about

therefore protect all minority religions, wherever they are and

when I say that evil in the name of faith can be found in the
distortion of any faith, and we must therefore all speak out when
we see that evil. The strongest arguments that I have heard are
from those people who speak out not for a religion that they themselves

have learn from those mistakes—and making the issue universal in
a globalised world. I have often said that maybe it is not Christians

religion or belief is set out in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, but the issue is not about abstract discussions or a debate on
philosophy or human rights law but about people’s
lives—the right to be individuals and to be free. The right to
be free, as far as your religion or belief is concerned, is very broad.
It is not about the freedom just to hold a belief, but also to manifest
that belief, for example through worship, dress and the wearing of
religious symbols. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford
mentioned the European court case. Noble Lords will, I am sure, join me

freedom of religion or belief also includes the right to share your
faith and to teach others about it and, importantly, it includes the
right not to hold a religious faith. All these approaches deserve space
in society, and it is the responsibility of government to ensure that
this is the case. We are tireless in our efforts to defend these rights
worldwide but, sadly, according to recent research by the Pew Forum on
Religion and Public Life, 75% of the world’s population now live
in countries where Governments, social groups or individuals restrict
their ability to practise their faith freely. Restrictions on religion
are increasing in each of the five major regions of the world,
including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where
overall restrictions had previously been in decline, and the share of
countries with high or very high restrictions on religious beliefs and
practices rose from 31% in the year ending in mid-2009 to 37% in the

following the wrong religion can lead to torture, violence or even
death, so we need to make sure we do our utmost, both to raise
individual cases where freedom of religion or belief is under attack
and to tackle it through organisations such as the UN. This Government
are absolutely committed to getting it right because, quite simply,
lives are at stake if we do not. It is because defending this
right is so important to us that we have developed a
comprehensive strategy to guide our work in this area. The strategy
draws on valuable expertise from members of my right honourable friend
the Foreign Secretary’s human rights advisory group, which is
composed of leading British experts in the field of human rights. The
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford asked about a religion
or belief advisory group. I know that such a group existed under the
previous Government, but I understand that it became unwieldy with each
religion and each brand of each religion demanding a seat at the table.
What we have done instead is to ensure that some of the members of the
Foreign Secretary’s human rights advisory group—Malcolm
Evans and Joel Edwards—bring a faith perspective and an
awareness of international human rights law in the area of freedom of
religion or belief to the group. We are currently looking at broadening
that brace to bring in experts in relation to other
religions.</hs_para>

Berridge some comfort when I say that it includes: 
<?notus-xml column=1090?>working in multilateral organisations, chiefly the UN, the EU

negotiations, where we raise individual cases, practices or laws that

do not knowingly walk into the consequences that were spoken of by the

mindful that, while Governments play a key role in creating the
conditions for all to practise their religion or belief freely, or for
individuals to live free from discrimination on the grounds of religion

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 19 is a
probing amendment, which I hope will not detain us for long. So far as
the planning guarantee is concerned, the consultation document proposes
that a 26-week limit will apply to the Planning Inspectorate where it
is determining applications. That is fine because, clearly, given the
lack of a right to appeal, a limit of no more than a year is not
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012272000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0003.htm#13012272000035">However,
paragraph 64 of the consultation document proposes that the performance
standard for the inspectorate would initially be to determine 80% of
cases within 13 weeks, or 16 weeks where proposals are subject to an
environmental impact assessment. On what basis has this target been
set? For how long is it envisaged that the initial phase will endure?
What will the Government do if it emerges that the inspectorate is not
meeting its targets—a point that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves,
also touched on earlier? I beg to

Lords, I want to make absolutely clear the level of service that an
applicant can expect from the Secretary of State in those very few
cases where the applicant applies directly to him, and to explain why
this amendment is unnecessary. As I have said several times today, the 
<?notus-xml column=1092?>ability to apply directly to the Secretary of State would be limited to
a very small number of situations where there is clear evidence that a
local planning authority is not delivering an effective service. For
example, in relation to the speed with which applications are dealt
with, we have proposed in our consultation that the measure should
apply only to authorities that have decided 30% or fewer of their major
applications within the statutory period.</hs_para>

a performance standard for the Planning Inspectorate of dealing with
80% of those applications within the statutory period unless an
extended time has been agreed in writing with the applicant. That
compares to the current average performance among planning authorities
of deciding 57% of applications for major developments within 13
weeks.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012272000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0003.htm#13012272000038">The

does a shifting of powers from local planning authorities to central
government. It is not, of course, the only clause in the Bill to do
this. We will debate Clause 24 in due course and there are other

course, the clause is predicated on the proposition that delays in the
planning system are holding back growth, but scant evidence has been
provided for this. There is obviously clear evidence on the time being
taken by local planning authorities to handle applications, but any
linking of this to growth—or the lack of it—is, frankly,
anecdotal. In any event this seems to ignore the existing powers of the
Secretary of State in relation to call-in and the right of applicants
to appeal to the Secretary of State against non-determination. We
should bear in mind that an appeal against non-determination can be
made up to six months after the expiry of the period that the local
planning authority had for dealing with the application. This is 13
weeks for major cases and 16 weeks if the application is accompanied by
an environmental statement, or whatever extended period has been agreed

the right way to proceed. In the other place, we set a time limit of a
year but, on reflection, that is not particularly sensible, which is
why we propose a two-year limit for the retention of the clause. That
two-year period would provide a chance to evaluate how the provision is
working, but it should not provide an opportunity for it to be
continued. There would

little support across the House. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is

two amendments are the first to refer to the unique position of
Greater London in these considerations. At Second Reading, the noble
Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, reminded me of the combined authority in
Greater Manchester; it is not exactly the same as in Greater London,

would certainly consider them with great sympathy. In view of the time
of night, I do not want to go into great detail on this; I am not sure
that, at this stage, it is necessary to do so because I am sure we will
return to it on Report. However, the situation and position in London
is that the Mayor of London—and here I refer to the office, not
necessarily the office holder at any particular time, in which I have
not so far had any interest to declare—already has the
responsibilities for strategic planning in
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T21:13:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I am

seems to me that if any London planning authority has the misfortune to
be designated—we all hope that this does not happen, and I have
made my views clear about that—it would be sensible in all
respects for it to be referred to the Mayor of London and to the
Greater London Authority, rather than to the planning inspectorate,
which just happens to be in Bristol. I say that on a number of grounds.
The first is the important democratic principle that the Mayor of
London is elected by Londoners; he is accountable to Londoners and he
is accountable particularly directly to the elected London assembly.
Therefore, the actions he takes and the decisions he makes are directly
accountable to an elected body, which is not the case with the planning
inspectorate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T21:14:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

department in the Greater London Authority has on the whole a good
relationship —certainly a relationship—with all the
planning authorities in London, some more than others, as necessary. It
knows the situation in London and the individuals concerned in many
cases. It is by definition more local than somebody based in Bristol
could possibly be. It is better placed to consider particular local
circumstances, and indeed, people are able to make their
representations directly to that elected and accountable
body<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T21:15:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012272000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0003.htm#13012272000073">From
the point of view of the Mayor of London with his responsibility for
strategic planning in London, if a planning authority is performing so
badly as to be designated, that must have implications for him and his
strategic role, so again, in all respects the mayor has a particular
interest in planning. For me the important principle is that if there
is to be designation, at least in London it can go to an elected and
accountable body rather than to an appointed body some distance from
London. I have made my position clear several times, but if it is to
happen, that is a far preferable situation and far more in accordance
with our belief in
localism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T21:16:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012272000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0003.htm#13012272000074">Briefly,
Amendment 80, which is much further on in the Bill, would ensure that
planning applications for developments relating to school and energy
infrastructure must be referred to the mayor as being of potential
strategic importance. This would allow him to call in applications that
are deemed to have strategic significance for the capital’s
future and expedite the decision-making process, getting key projects
off the ground. That would also allow the mayor to delegate his call-in
powers in cases where he does not have the time personally to hold the
representation hearing or he has a conflict of interest in which case
the power is currently automatically lost. We need to consider the
position of London in the context of a Greater London Authority and an
elected mayor. Should it be deemed in the future that Greater
Manchester is in that position, that will be fine. It is the principle
that I am concerned with here. In England, that principle applies only
to London, and I do not see that the Government have yet given any
consideration to the position of London in relation to their proposals.

point I would make is that the Mayor of London—I am talking
about the office and not the individual—already has very
substantial strategic planning functions in London. As to the question
of designation and the right of an applicant to apply under the rest of
the Bill to the Secretary of State, it seems obvious that in London the
application should be referred to the mayor because, by
definition, we are talking about major applications. As I think my
noble friend said, the mayor has extraordinarily good planning
relationships not only with the boroughs but with a
range of other 
<?notus-xml column=1100?>interests, such as developers, other stakeholders and so on,
who are very much concerned with planning. That has been developed to a
considerable degree of expertise and skill. That is the right body to
exercise the function if, as has been said, any London borough suffers
the misfortune of being designated. I very much support
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012272000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0003.htm#13012272000077">I hope
that by the time we come to debate Amendment 80, my name
will have been added to it. It is a very useful and important addition.
The Mayor of London, with his overall economic functions, has a very
considerable interest in ensuring that there is sufficient energy to
supply London, particularly when one is dealing with decentralised
energy—what might be local wind-power turbines and things of
that sort. It would be entirely appropriate in those circumstances that
he should have the right to call in applications that refer to such
functions. Like my noble friend Lord Tope, I warmly support the
amendment and hope that the Government may see their way to
accepting it. Amendments 39 and 80 were drafted to follow the pattern
of the earlier part—Clause 1—of the Bill, so I
hope that the Government may feel able to accept them. It
would be very much welcomed in London, and also by the London boroughs.
I have already declared my interest as a joint president of London

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I will explain the
Government’s position on this amendment. I was amused when my
noble friends referred to the distinction between the office and the
person. When one thinks of the present incumbent of the Mayor
of London’s office, or indeed his predecessor, it is very hard
not to talk about the person in the office. One can make that claim
about both the current incumbent and his

listened to the arguments in favour of Amendment 39. First,
I will say that I concur completely with the point that the Mayor of
London should play an important role in strategic decisions affecting
the capital. My 
<?notus-xml column=1101?>noble friend Lord Tope made that point very well. As
a former councillor in a neighbouring borough to his, I dealt with
issues in collaboration with the Mayor of London’s office. As my
noble friend Lord Jenkin said, the mayor already has powers to put in
place a strategic framework for planning in London, and to call in for
his own decision any applications that are of potential strategic
importance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T21:23:58"></hs_TimeCode>.
Clause 1 was drafted to ensure that his power to call in such
applications would remain where proposals were made directly
to the Secretary of
State.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T19:46:44"></hs_TimeCode> The
question was raised about discussions with the mayor’s office.
The Government have had positive discussions with the mayor’s
office about how this would best be implemented. We gave the
reassurance that applications of potential strategic importance would
be notified to the mayor very quickly once they had been received by
the Planning Inspectorate, so that he will be able to act immediately

is also important that we do not overcomplicate the process for
applicants. As it stands, the amendment would introduce a three-way
choice for those proposing major development in the capital should the
borough be designated on the basis of poor performance. They could, for
example, choose to apply to the borough as normal, or to the Secretary
of State, or to the mayor. In the Government’s view this would
complicate matters further. In other words, what constitutes the
application’s potential strategic importance or falls into one
of the other proposed categories could end up being extremely
complicated and confusing and risk further delay should an applicant
misjudge the criteria. The mayor would then have to return an
application because he could not decide upon it. It is much simpler for
the applicant to have a two-way choice, as we propose, and for the
planning inspectorate to decide whether an application it has received
is one in which the mayor could have an interest. This approach is
entirely consistent with the existing situation where the authorities,
not the applicant, decide whether an application is of potential

arrangements when an application has been made to the Secretary of
State in circumstances where another person is to be appointed to deal
with the application. The provisions of Schedule 1 enable the Secretary
of State, for so long as the application has not been determined, to
revoke that appointment and to appoint another person to determine the
application instead. On the face of it, this is a very wide
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T21:30:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

course, that for these purposes the Secretary of State has to appoint
an individual and it is further accepted that there may be
circumstances where the individual may be unable to complete the task
for a number of reasons and has to be replaced. However, the revocation
of the appointment can be for any reason or, indeed, for none. Our
amendment seeks to constrain the power by making it subject to the
agreement of the local planning authority and the applicant. This is
not the only constraint that might be adopted, but it is the one that
is being proposed.
Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T21:31:26"></hs_TimeCode> the
Minister will put on the record the policy involved in the application
of this power. Concerns obviously arise around the Secretary of State
intervening to pre-empt a decision that is on the point of being made.

this power? I beg to

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, this provision in Schedule 1
allows a new inspector to be appointed in cases where, for example,
illness or probity would prevent the original inspector considering a
particular case. It is a safeguard and a check, and nothing more. The
applicant would be informed of the change of inspector as a matter of
course, but there should not be a requirement to do so, only with their
agreement. The Secretary of State must be able to choose the most
appropriate person to determine an application, just as happens
currently with any planning appeal. Equally, there should not be any
need to agree this with the designated authority, especially as it
would not be the determining body for the application. With those

usage. Perhaps I can take this opportunity to pick up a point we
touched on earlier, which is that persons who can be appointed by the
Secretary of State under these provisions are not just the Planning
Inspectorate; it is not limited to that body. I think that the noble
Baroness is going to write to me on that point. I am sure that she has
not had a chance to do so in the dinner break, so I will forgive her

that all parties to an appeal act reasonably is of course essential,
but the clause risks overly penalising local authorities and working
against localism. If the risk of being designated as failing is not a
strong enough deterrent for local authorities to turn down
inappropriate development, the risk that they might have to pay the
costs of appeals certainly will be. There are concerns that the costs
of appeals are inhibiting a true localism. Given that, how can
increasing the number of instances in which a local authority would
have to pay the other party’s costs be beneficial, especially
given shrinking budgets and the huge resources that developers often
have at their disposal to undertake appeals? When local authorities
consider the risk of having appeal costs awarded against them alongside
the risk that any decision overturned at appeal may contribute to their
designation as failing, that makes it much more likely that
developments, whether good or bad, will be nodded through by a local
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012272000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130122-0003.htm#13012272000100">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T21:36:01"></hs_TimeCode>

sets out that, last year, costs were awarded in only 3.7% of cases but
goes on to predict that, under Clause 2, the number of cases would
rocket, with costs being awarded in as many as 20% or more of all
appeal decisions. Worryingly, the Minister’s department has made
no estimate of the amount that that would cost local authorities or any
other party; hence, the need for amendments to allow for clear criteria

assessment of how long that might take. Published criteria, set out in
regulations, would surely speed up the change in behaviour more
effectively. Such criteria would allow the Secretary of State to define
what would be deemed unreasonable behaviour and would therefore

in giving the Secretary of State discretionary powers to award costs in
the hope that it will change behaviour unless the instances in which
costs are to be awarded are plainly set out.
Furthermore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-22T21:37:25"></hs_TimeCode>, as
the clause will allow the Secretary of State to award a portion of
costs, he will need clear guidance in setting out the formula on which

48 is key to this argument that we are making against the clause. New
sub-paragraph (11) allows the Secretary of State to subsume to himself
personally any power in connection with the award of an appeal. Can the
Minister explain why the Secretary of State would require individual
power to award costs, independent of the experts appointed to decide
such an award? The amendment seeks to ensure that such power will be
used only when it is to the benefit of all involved. It is difficult to
conceive of a set of circumstances in which that might be the case;
nevertheless it is important that some restraints are put on the
Secretary of State’s powers under the sub-paragraph. We need to
ensure that the Secretary of State is able to take such power unto
himself only if parties to the appeal agree that it is appropriate in

49 further constrains the power proposed in sub-paragraph (11). It
seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State will make any decision
under the sub-paragraph in accordance with published criteria, which
would be extremely useful to assist in trying to determine what is in
the Secretary of State’s mind. We want the Secretary of State to
publish criteria that can be assessed to see whether he is making a
fair and even-handed decision about the award of costs, and we want a
requirement for him to publish his reasons for his decisions. Not only

doing, doing it more efficiently is a good idea. However, I do not
understand what the allocation of costs—increasing the costs on
local authorities and increasing the number of cases where costs are
allocated—has to do directly with efficiency. I said earlier
that, in my experience, the Planning Inspectorate has not always been
the most efficient organisation in the country. However, my perspective
is that that is not because the Secretary of State could not get his
costs back at the end of it all or that more costs might be allocated
to other people in the process but that, as a bureaucracy, the Planning
Inspectorate was not very efficient. Either it did not have enough
people working for it or those people were not working sufficiently
efficiently. The long delays that there were in planning

On the contrary, no local authority or developer will face an award of
costs if they behave reasonably. It is in everyone’s interest

announced in the outcome of the Strategic Defence and Security Review
in October 2010 that, as part of moving to Future Force 2020, 
we would reduce the size of the regular Army by 7,000
personnel, and both the Naval Service and Royal Air Force by 5,000
personnel. In addition, in order to balance the British Army’s
regular and reserve forces, further reductions were subsequently
identified to deliver a regular Army of around 82,000 by 2020. We also
made clear that, in order to maintain balanced force structures for the

September 2011, 2,860 service personnel were notified of
their redundancy in the first tranche, (1,020 service personnel from
the naval service, 920 from the Army and 920 from the Royal
Air Force) 62% of whom had applied for selection. On 12 June 2012,
3,760 service personnel were notified of their selection for redundancy

meet the published criteria. The redundancy programme will not impact
adversely on current operations in Afghanistan, and no one who is
serving on specified operations on the day the redundancy notices are
issued on 18 June 2013 will be made redundant unless they are
applicants. Similarly, those preparing for  or recovering from
such operations on the day the redundancy notices are issued will not
be made redundant unless they have applied. Those personnel who are
liable to deploy with their units to Afghanistan in autumn 2013 on the
day the redundancy notices are issued will be exempt from tranche 3
unless they are an applicant; as a result of the drawdown plans already
announced, those units liable to deployment will not be confirmed until
April 2013. Any applicant who is selected for redundancy and whose unit
is subsequently deployed will be able to choose whether to deploy with
the unit or not. Personnel who are assessed as being permanently below
the level of fitness required to remain in the forces will
not be considered for redundancy, and will instead leave through the
medical discharge route at the appropriate stage in their
recovery.</hs_para>
