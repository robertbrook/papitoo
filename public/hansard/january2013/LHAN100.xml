years or more—and active efforts are made by the homes to keep
in touch with children once they move on into adulthood. Will the
Minister look at this best practice to see whether it can be applied

Nash:</Member></B> I shall try to get the words out in the right order
now. I agree that many children in children’s homes have had
failed foster placements. Our statistics show that 29% of children
placed in children’s homes 
<?notus-xml column=1110?>have had five or more previous placements. I have
met quite a few children who have had over 20 placements. That is why
we set up the expert working group: to look at how to improve the
quality of support these children receive, building on good practice.
This group has now reported to Ministers, and Ministers will
make announcements on this shortly. We recognise Break’s
impressive record—four years is an impressive average length of
stay—and that is why we invited Hilary Richards of
Break to be a member of the department’s expert group on
quality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012342000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:10:18"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hughes of Stretford" PimsId="5818" UID="13012342000679" xid="2080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000679">Baroness

ensure they receive the support they need. Children in care are
entitled to free early education for two year-olds, the pupil premium
while at school and the new 16-to-19 further education bursary. Every
child in care has to have a personal education plan setting out how
they will be supported to fulfil their potential. Every school,
including academies and free schools, has a legal duty to have a

Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> My Lords, I asked a Question many years
ago about adoption, and it has been asked again many times since. The
age at which children are adopted is still far too high. Could we not
avoid having so many children in care by applying more widely the
concurrent adoption system, whereby a parent hoping to adopt can have
the child to foster at a very early stage, even before the age of one
year? All the world recognises that bonding works far better if a child
comes to a family as early as possible. Would that not save us having
ever so many unattractively aged children who people do not seem to
want to adopt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:12:26"></hs_TimeCode>,

Nash:</Member></B> I share my noble friend’s concerns on this.
There is no doubt that the average time taken for a child to be
adopted—two years and seven months, and a further year for a
black child—is far too long. It is also true to say that
would-be adopters in the system have not been well treated, when they
should be welcomed with open arms. We are determined to reduce the time
taken for adoption, and have introduced adoption scorecards to compare
the performance of different local authorities, which varies widely. We
have also published draft laws to stop ethnicity being a barrier 
<?notus-xml column=1111?>to adoption. We are addressing the adoption recruitment problem by
streamlining the adoption approval process, and we have published draft
laws that promote the idea of fostering for adoption much
earlier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:13:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

comments about relationships and attachment. I myself have spoken to
many people who have told me that the worst experience of care is the
loneliness of leaving it. It has always troubled me that we spend a lot
of money and time with these young people but they are then often left
on their own when they leave care. This is something that troubles us
greatly. We are taking action to recruit and retain more social workers
and, to focus on this, are reforming and improving their 
<?notus-xml column=1112?>ongoing training. We have, for instance, invested
more money in the excellent programme, From Care2Work, started by the
previous Government to help care leavers into work. We recently
published the <I>Charter for Care Leavers</I>, and the Minister for
Children wrote to all DCSs on 30 October last year, mentioning not only
the charter but data packs on care leavers and the staying-put
arrangements, which seem to be working quite well and which we will be
promoting

Does he agree that every penny to meet this £10 billion

national assets such as Cadbury, Northumbrian Water, BAA and others,
without which the deficit would be much bigger? Would he also agree
that we cannot indefinitely trade at a loss and see our borrowing pay

recommendations of the 2011 independent Heathrow resilience inquiry
into a £50 million improvement programme, including more snow
clearance vehicles and improved operational command and control and
passenger welfare procedures. These enabled Heathrow to reduce
disruption significantly compared to 2010. Airlines have also improved

it is not a question of de-icing or clearing the runways? British
Airways comes on the television screens explaining proudly its problem
that, “We run at 99% capacity. The slightest difference in
allowing time between flights means that we have to cancel”. It
turned out in this case that one in 10 incoming flights was
cancelled on one day, and that on another it was one in five. Is it not
time that an airport that is trying to pretend that it is an
international hub stops running at a rate of capacity that is clearly
outwith its capabilities to

Bradshaw:</Member></B> My Lords, I have managed all sorts of transport
terminals and routes. The only way to deal with the problems at
Heathrow would have been to put in a contingency plan which reduced in
advance the number of flights taking off and landing. Proper
contingency planning is needed so that passengers are advised well in
advance not to leave their homes, not to leave their hotels and not to
sleep on the terminal floor. Will the Minister encourage the CAA and
other aviation authorities to introduce such
plans?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012342000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000054"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:34:22"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Attlee" PimsId="3822" UID="13012342000720" xid="1061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000720">Earl
Attlee:</Member></B> My noble friend is quite right in his analysis of
a possible solution. Indeed, that is what happens. A committee called
HADACAB determines whether we need to cancel some flights in advance in
order to provide capacity to do things such as keep the runway clear.
In addition, in future, as a result of the Civil Aviation Act 2012, the
Civil Aviation Authority will be able to set resilience conditions on

very difficult it is to capture and maintain certain groups of our

already most likely to be disenfranchised—those in private

schools, tenancy deposit schemes, and credit reference

move to individual registration, there is surely a right for all such
people, many of whom think that they are on the register, to be invited
to register, with it being clear that being on all those other lists
does not make them a voter. All of this might appear obvious: that such
sources of data will be key to finding those millions missing from our
existing registers, let alone from the new system. However, without
this requirement in the Bill, we fear that such data will not be shared

Rennard:</Member></B> My Lords, it may not surprise the House that I
have very considerable sympathy with the arguments just made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter of Kentish Town, and with the amendment
tabled in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of
Thoroton, as it is remarkably similar to the
amendment that I moved in Committee. I made my points in support of it
at col. 473 of <I>Hansard</I> for 29 October, and I shall
not detain the House by rehearsing all them. However, I emphasise that
we on these Benches feel very strongly that it is very important to
make a success of what we are setting out to do through this Bill and
that the widest possible range of data sources are used to encourage
more people who are missing from the electoral register to be on
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012342000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000075">Of the
organisations in the amendment, the Government have so far said
publicly that they will move substantially on the Student Loans Company
database only. There are very important issues still to be addressed,
which could be addressed in further regulations, so it should not be
necessary to vote at this stage. At some point, the House would like to
know that the very good practice used in Northern Ireland of returning
officers visiting schools as part of a civics lesson and registering 16
and 17 year-olds to make sure that they can vote when they are 18 and
suggestions put forward in Committee about using things such as the
tenancy deposit protection scheme and credit reference agencies’

particular, we would like to know from the Minister, if possible before
the end of this debate, that action will be taken to try to ensure that
the DVLA database is used in the same way as the DWP database, if not
in exactly the same way for any legitimate reason. In the debates we
have teased out the fact that very many people are missing from the
electoral register because they move house. If we were simply to use
the database of those people who notify the DVLA that they have moved
house to then notify electoral registration officers that they should
contact those individuals and invite them to be on the electoral
register, that could ensure that many of the people missing from the
voter registers were included.</hs_para>

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, we have come a long way in
discussing this issue since the Bill was subjected to pre-legislative
scrutiny, and the character of the Bill has changed quite a lot as it
has gone through both Houses. We have also learnt as the various data
matching and data mining exercised have been piloted, and that
continues to be the case. We had an interesting and informative debate
on this subject in Committee and, as I said then, the Government are
sympathetic to the spirit of the amendment, which seeks to ensure that
the best possible use is made of data matching to identify people not
on the register who may be entitled to be. The outcome of the second
round of data pilots showed that some 70% of voters could be confirmed
through the DWP database. As the noble Baroness said, this varies from
local authority to local authority, but it enables us to focus on the
30% who are not
confirmed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012342000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000079">We
are all aware that it is the frequent movers and young
people—above all, young men—who are the hardest to
identify. In the various pilots under way, we are experimenting with
using other databases. I remind noble Lords that, in last year’s
data matching pilots, data were matched with organisations such as the
DWP, HMRC, the Royal Mail—which was particularly useful for
people who had given their changes of address—the Department for
Education, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department for
Transport, the Student Loans Company, the Ministry of Defence and, for
Scotland, the Improvement Service company. In early 2013, we
are currently planning to undertake pilots of data mining using
databases held by the DWP, the Department for Education,
HEFCE, the Welsh Government, the Royal Mail, the Student Loans Company
and a small number of county councils.</hs_para>

locally and some centrally, some are public and, as far as the credit
reference agencies are concerned, some are private. The Bill
enables us to remove any barriers to the usage of private

repeat: this is an area in which the Government are already very
actively engaged. The amendment is not necessary. This schedule gives
us the power to remove barriers to data sharing. Working through

most useful and effective in identifying potential

such careful consideration of which may be the most appropriate data
sets to use by specifying them in primary legislation could limit
flexibility by requiring the unnecessary use of data sets that add no
value to the work of EROs. The amendment would mean that the Government
could not bring forward a data-matching order that did not include one
of these agencies. That could potentially mean ruling out the future
use of as-yet-unknown data sets or carrying out multiple data-matching
exercises. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, that we are in active
discussion with the Department for Transport on the use of DVLA
databases and others. It is likely that in 2013 we will be testing out
other such databases.</hs_para>

unnecessary and limits flexibility in an area where the Government are

return to it, and underline some of the points that I made last week,

disenfranchisement at the parliamentary level—I stress at
parliamentary level only—of the vast majority of our fellow
countrymen and women who have lived outside the United Kingdom for more
than 15 years, retaining their British citizenship, in which so many of
them take the deepest pride. Apart from a very limited number living in
nine small Commonwealth nations, they cannot vote in the national
parliamentary elections that take place in the countries where they
reside. The world over, the parliamentary franchise rests on
nationality, not on residence and not, it should be emphasised, on the
payment of taxes. As the noble Lord, Lord Wills, stated in Committee

<?notus-xml column=1124?>inconsiderable proportion have of course been abroad for less than 15

interesting and important issue about nationality and representation.
There is clearly a strong case for some rationalisation and, indeed,
for a careful look at the way in which our EU partners handle this
issue, as was again said today. At the same time, we must note that the
majority of them have a very different electoral system from our own.
Here in the UK, we have a system of single-Member constituencies with a
special link between an MP and his or her constituents. It is
irrational to have people who used to live in my old constituency in
north Cornwall, for example, still on the electoral roll
15 years or more after they have left for possibly sunnier

me clear up any misunderstanding: every UK election, with the notable
exception of European parliamentary elections, is in a sense a local
election. Voters in a particular locality decide which local
representative would in their judgment best represent their interests
and those of that specific locality. It is also true that many local
issues, from development threats in that locality to the level of
council tax more generally, can be major factors even in a UK
parliamentary election. For those who have left that locality 15 or
more years ago to have a potentially decisive voice in such an election
is illogical. I still remember the occasion when I was elected with a
majority of nine. For all I 
<?notus-xml column=1126?>know, that majority of nine came from many thousands

a fact of political life. Therefore, anything we do on this issue has
to take that into the reckoning. If he or anybody else is now expecting

the absence of any such reform, we urge my noble friend Lord
Lexden to think again about his strategy. If he is to address the
anomalies that he has rightly identified, he must take up the issue of
an additional constituency for overseas voters. Several contributors to
last week’s debate in Committee, including my noble friend Lord
Lexden, referred to the French arrangement for overseas voters. Indeed,
again, he made very important reference to the experience of French
overseas voters. However, the significant point is that they have a
separate constituency; they do not interfere with the individual
constituencies in mainland France. In those circumstances, we believe
that this amendment puts the cart before the horse. We believe that the
creation of a separate constituency on the French model—or,
indeed, constituencies, if the numbers justify something beyond one
constituency—would be a much more appropriate way to make this
injustice less of a problem in future. Surely that is the right and
only way for the interests of former UK residents to be represented
without diluting those of the people who still live in this

Norton of Louth:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment moved
so ably by my noble friend Lord Lexden. It is a novel amendment but a
modest one. In Committee, there were essentially two objections to the
proposal to extend the 15-year limit on British nationals who live
abroad having the vote. A third objection was to the mechanism proposed
by my noble friend, which is again before us

extending the 15-year limit was that citizens who have retired to live
abroad and enjoy the sunshine of foreign climes had effectively fled
the United Kingdom and therefore should not be able to
vote—certainly not for any great length of time. My noble friend
Lord Tyler referred in Committee to the fact that some people may deem
them to have deserted these shores. That is to misunderstand the
situation of British nationals living abroad. Most emigrants from this
country live abroad for work-related purposes. Some will be moving
around the globe for their companies, which may well be UK companies.
The fact of living abroad for some years is no proof of leaving the UK

basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012342000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000107">My

they can do it in the same way in which they currently represent those
who live abroad but have not yet done so for 15 years and are

other objection was raised by my noble friend Lord Gardiner of Kimble
in respect of this particular amendment, on the grounds that it would
be unusual to make such a change in secondary legislation. I note that
he said “unusual” and not “unique”. In any
event, what is involved here is not a new right but an extension of an
existing right. Far greater changes affecting individuals are made
through secondary legislation than is being envisaged here. What the
amendment does is provide some flexibility. In Committee, my noble

suggestion is that we should extend the right to vote to those who have

raised by my noble friend in

noble friend Lord Norton of Louth, particularly when he talked about
soft power. That soft power extends in a network world increasingly to
include economic power. These people are overseas on

this. My noble friend Lord Lexden pointed out that currently 4.4

would be useful for the Electoral Commission to undertake extensive
research into the reasons why people do not register overseas for this
right to vote, which is extremely important to them?
Secondly—perhaps this is better addressed to my noble friend on

this does no harm. Moreover, it is only an enabling measure; it does
not change anything. It creates a power to change things, which, to me,

I want to stress another consideration which I raised in Committee.
Should this extension go forward, such non-residents would then also be
able to continue to make unlimited donations to UK political parties.
By being on the electoral register, they are also categorised as
permissible donors to a political party. The previous Government, in
the light of ongoing concerns about overseas funding of our politics,
passed the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009. Section 10 of the
Act prohibits a registered party from accepting a donation of more than
£7,500 in any year from a UK national living abroad and on the
electoral register, unless they become resident in the UK and pay UK
income tax. Sadly, however—and I think wrongly—this
section of the Act has not yet come into force and the coalition

as that provision has not been brought in, it means that all those UK

by declaring an interest: I have two sisters, two nephews
and one son who are British citizens living abroad at the moment. At
least three of them, I think, are dual nationals; this is, of course,
one of the many complications in addressing this. I said at an earlier
stage that I knew a British civil servant who had gone to visit his
cousins in Vermont so that he could vote in the US presidential
election—on the right side, I am happy to say. This is one of
the many complications in addressing this large area. I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Lexden, for ensuring that the Government will take a more
active approach to this consideration from now on. I should criticise
my noble friend Lord Tyler for suggesting that there could be,
possibly, sunnier climes than Cornwall. I thought, when I was a boy and
saw the Cornish Riviera Express go by, that it was called that because
Cornwall was very warm. Among the messages that I, and
probably others, have received from voters abroad—in particular
from a group in the Var, Provence—have been some
rather abusive messages suggesting that any attempt to take away the
winter fuel allowance from people living in Provence would encourage
them all to register en

and the short debate we have had suggests the many complexities that
exist. The Government’s view remains that the franchise for UK
elections is set out in primary legislation, and that it should be
changed by primary legislation and not by regulation. It was pointed
out earlier that, of our 4.5 million potential overseas
voters, only 30,000 were registered at the peak in 2010. That is weak
evidence that there is a pent-up demand that we are failing to
satisfy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:17:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

French have a great many more overseas residents registered, but the
French approach to registration of citizens abroad is very different
from the British one. Certainly, the Foreign Office would have to
consider the consular resources available for much more active
registration of British citizens abroad. I think the right figure at
the moment is that some 50,000 British citizens abroad are currently
registered with consulates, which suggests that if we were to follow
the French model, we would be going through a whole sea-change in our
relations with our overseas citizens. We do not know how many of our
estimated 5.6 million overseas citizens are dual citizens; we do not
know how many of them were born in Britain or born abroad. We have some
interesting questions about how this would work: for example, in which
constituency would British citizens born overseas be registered when
they wished to vote? There are a very large number of
questions even before we get to the question of special constituencies
for them, and I would suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Lexden, should
pursue the question of an all-party inquiry into this rather neglected
area, not leaving everything to the Government here.</hs_para>

is the only way of judging whether the other systems that take

Rennard:</Member></B> My Lords, the annual door-to-door household
canvass is an extremely important part of the current registration
system and has been shown to be very effective. Recent evidence from
Northern Ireland shows that it was clearly a mistake to remove the
annual canvass from the registration process there when individual
electoral registration systems were introduced. However, some are
arguing that for the data-mining and data-matching exercises to be
successful, the Government may want to signal that at some point in the
future it may be possible to remove the annual canvass. Personally, I
cannot envisage it in the foreseeable future, but I accept that if all
the other methods being tried to register voters prove as successful as
some of us hope, there may be a case for doing so in the future.
However, it would be unwise for the Government to proceed with removing
the annual canvass without considerable consensus and the advice of the
Electoral Commission that it was safe to do so, and without the new
electoral registration systems being put forward in this Bill having
been in place and embedded for a very considerable period.</hs_para>

we move more towards online and digital registration by default and we

said in Committee, which is that in certain parts of the country new
housing in particular is making it increasingly difficult to carry out
a full canvass. I visited the electoral registration office for
Wandsworth. The figures there show that currently some 50,000 housing
units are sited in gated communities or apartment blocks with entry

noble friends and I have set out the steps incorporated into the plan
for implementation of individual electoral registration under the Bill

Maxton:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall be very brief, except to say
that sometimes I sit here, as I have today, wondering what world it is
that we think that we live in. The world around us is changing a lot
faster than we are prepared to change the electoral system, apparently.
As I have said before and will say only briefly again, what we really
need is a national register based on every individual getting benefits,
et cetera, only if they are on the register, backed up with an ID
card—sorry, a smartcard; I had better not use the term ID card,
I know that it sometimes causes frissons down people’s backs.
Smartcard technology is now so advanced that although I am grateful to
the Minister for calling my name in aid in the previous debate, the
fact is that 10 years is now a very long time in
technological terms. If you look only at the two years since this
Government came into power, when we abolished—wrongly, in my
view—ID cards, the way in which smartcard technology has moved
in those two years now makes it very feasible to have one register and
to divide it up into the constituencies. Everybody who is on the
national register and is a holder of an ID card would then be entitled
to
vote<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:57:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I think that we ought to be moving to a system whereby the actual
voting is done electronically as well, using that smartcard. That will
come, but, at the moment, it would appear that the last place in which
we will be using a pencil will be to mark a cross on a ballot paper in
some school, where people have to go out in the cold and wet to do it.
I think that even golfers will give up the pencil before this
Government are prepared to give up the pencil for ballots under the
electoral system. Please, please, will the Government take this slight
delay as an opportunity to look again at how we can introduce a
national register to ensure that every citizen of this country is
entitled to vote in the next general
election<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:58:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012342000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000161"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Rennard" PimsId="349" UID="13012342000756" xid="1408" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000756">Lord
Rennard:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Tyler and I have
both signed the amendments in this group. They clearly result from the
lengthy discussions we had in Committee about the right time to end the
carryover for electors from the household register to the individual
register. The debate then centred on how confident we can be as to how
well the transition to individual electoral registration will be seen
to be by 1 December 2015. Some people may be very confident that it
will all work well in terms of both completeness and accuracy; as your
Lordships know, I am a bit less confident about that. None of us can be
certain about which is the right assessment to make until the
transition is actually under way and properly tested. As we know, we
are piloting various things at the moment, but with software which will
not even be the final software for use when we are fully into
individual electoral registration. It was for that reason that I was
determined in Committee that there should be a mechanism by which we
could extend the carryover if, for example, the Electoral Commission
reported by 1 December 2015 that many people would unjustifiably be
removed from the electoral register and that the register was at that
point significantly less complete than at present.</hs_para>

Electoral Commission will, of course, give advice on this
issue, but I do not think that it is appropriate for the
commission to decide on such an issue. The Electoral Commission should
advise us, and Parliament itself must be able to decide on
this issue. It would not be right for a Minister simply to decide
that—in his opinion, or in the opinion of the
Government—it was the right time to make such a fundamental
change. These amendments are right to extend the period of carryover
for voters on the existing household register to 2016 as a default
legislative position, while permitting the Minister to propose to
Parliament that the carryover be ended in 2015, with the proviso that
either House can
disagree.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012342000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000163">The
government amendments in this group provide an essential failsafe and
are an important part of protecting our democratic system. If it
appears that this transition has not worked effectively enough in 2015
but a Minister tries to press ahead in any event, Parliament can
prevent that Minister doing so. I am therefore very grateful to all
those who have contributed to debates on this subject, and for the
discussions that I have had with Ministers and for the flexibility
shown. We on these Benches will therefore support the government
amendments unamended.</hs_para>

I have a brief word on Amendments 6 and 7, tabled by the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, which are about
postal votes. I tested the logic of the Government’s position on
this issue in Committee. We received considerable reassurances that
postal voters will be given considerable assistance in ensuring that
they can continue to have access to a postal vote, should they decide
to do so. They are also, importantly, still able to vote in person
should they wish to do so. They are not losing their right to vote if
they are not registered under the IER system by the time of the
relevant election. The Government have made a little concession on this
issue. Perhaps it is something that we will still have to review but,

Falconer of Thoroton:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments in effect
fall into two categories. First, on dealing with the carryover of the
register up to 2016, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, will be
aware that an amendment similar to the one that he has put down was
moved in Committee. We of course welcome the fact that he has extended
the carryover period to 1 December 2016. I welcome it for the reasons
that the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, gave in his speech and the reasons
given in the speeches heard before.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Wallace, I am slightly worried that he is starting
from the predilection that the Government will exercise their powers to
stop the carryover at 1 December 2015. I would be anxious about that
and would hope that the Government, whichever Government they were,
looked at the matter with an open mind rather than saying, “We
hope that we will be able to use the powers”. One thing that has
emerged during these debates is that everybody expects there to be a
real diminution in the number of people who are on the register, at
least the first time around. I very much hope that it is looked at from
an objective point of view rather than a biased one.</hs_para>

that, I should say that this is an incredibly important issue for our
democracy, again as I think everybody accepts. It would be much better
if Parliament definitely had to debate this issue, which would be the
effect of our Amendment 9 to government Amendment 8. We achieve that by
saying that there has to be a positive vote in Parliament before the
carryover is moved back to 1 December 2015, rather than having the
negative procedure, which would mean that somebody would have to object
in either
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012342000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000168">It
would be useful if the Minister could explain why something that goes
right to the heart of our democracy can go through by default. I was
deeply disappointed and injured by the fact that my new friend the
noble Lord, Lord Rennard, did not feel able to support me on this,
although I know that in his heart he really does—I should make
it clear that he has not said that to me. Will the Minister explain why
he thinks it is not appropriate that this be dealt with by, in a sense,
a compulsory prescription to Parliament where the
Government—whoever they may be—think they have to in

no idea who the Secretary of State will be. My anxiety was not what I

Administration—indeed, a Liberal Democrat Administration as
well. My anxiety was the coalition’s predilection, should it
remain in power, to say, “We think the position is that we
should try to bring it back to 1 December 2015”. That is all I

publicity and support for people to register themselves individually,
it will not work with everybody. If that logic applies to individual
registration, it is bound to apply to those whose proxy or postal vote
you have to carry over. We are surely in a position where we wish to
encourage people to vote. If you believe that you have a proxy or
postal vote, and then you discover you have not, the likely effect is a
reduction in the number of people who can vote.</hs_para>

that he was persuaded by the logic. He did not say why, and I was
therefore unable to know why one should be persuaded by the logic. I
would be grateful for an explanation from the Minister as to why the
logic applies to extending registration to 1 December 2016, where there

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for
contributing to this short debate. The statement made by the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Falconer, that everyone expects a diminution of
registration in the process of transition is not one that I accept. As
I have stressed throughout, we are facing a number of problems with
electoral registration altogether. We have the difficulties of
identifying potential electors; we have the difficulties of keeping, in
particular, young voters on the register; and all the research that I
have looked at in the past two years demonstrates that we have the
problem of disillusionment with politics as such, which leaves a number
of people positively to wish not to be on the register. As I take part
in local politics in Bradford, I come across large swathes of people
who have no interest in politics whatever and simply do not wish to be
on the register. They are very often in Labour-held council
wards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012342000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000175">I think
we all recognise that what needs to accompany the process of transition
is a range of activities by the Government, but not just the
Government, to make 
<?notus-xml column=1143?>sure that everyone understands what is going on,
that people are alerted to the need to move through to a process of
individual registration, and that we work with schools, colleges,
universities and others to persuade people that it is part of their
engagement with our civil society to register to vote. I hope that the
Labour Party will play an active role in this. I recall discussing with
a senior Labour figure the desirability of a Labour Party electoral
registration drive, to which the answer was, “You know very well
we can’t do that these days. We have too few members, and most
of them are retired”. That is a problem,
incidentally, which all political parties now face, of course. We have
fewer members than we used to have. We are not so good at getting out
and rounding up the marginal people. The Government certainly intend to
be out there in schools, colleges and elsewhere, drawing attention to
what is going

Government’s position on Amendments 6 and 7 is that the largest
area for electoral fraud in recent years has been postal vote fraud. We
know that a certain amount of this has not proceeded through to
prosecution. Talking to electoral registration officers, as I was last
summer, I was told that a great deal is known that is not provable and,
as such, is not prosecuted. However, we are clear that, particularly in
local elections, postal vote fraud has been the largest area of
electoral
fraud<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:11:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the accuracy as well as the completeness of the register, we wish
to hold to ensuring that those who have existing absent-vote
registration renew that registration as they go through this process.
This will be accompanied by making sure that those who are in sheltered
accommodation, and those in particular areas where absent-vote
registration is concentrated, are aware of what is happening and are
encouraged to renew their absent-vote registration. This is a question
of the accuracy of the register, and not just the existence of voting
fraud but the perception of a high level of voting fraud. For that
reason, we resist Amendments 6 and
7<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:12:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:12:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012342000178" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012342000178">On
Amendment 9, the question is how confident one is that we will manage
the transition with a degree of success. We all recognise that the
completeness level of the register we have today has fallen and that,
as we go through this process, we will have to work very hard to ensure
that we improve on the levels of completeness. However, the safeguards
that we have provided and the concessions that we have made in the
government amendments in this group are sufficient to give the
assurances that are needed. We therefore encourage the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Falconer, to take confidence in the reassurances
that I have offered and not to move his

may seem a bizarre hypothesis but it was advanced at some length on 14

He must have meant it because he said it with some conviction, although
it would be fair to say that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, had not
previously had responsibility for the Bill. At the time, the Government
had the problem that the Minister who knew about the Bill did not
believe in it as it then was. Therefore, they had to find someone to
take his place. But let us leave that aside because the noble Lord said

is true that exit polls can in certain circumstances affect elections.
The effect is on turnout. There is no British evidence on this. There
is American evidence, although it dates from the 1980s, referring to a
Reagan 
<?notus-xml column=1146?>election. In the event, people on the east coast
voted. The exit polls were reported and voters in California who were
going to vote for Reagan did not bother to vote because they had heard
that on the east coast he was winning easily and so why bother. The
turnout could have been affected by between 1% and 5%. If you try to
apply this to the hypothesis in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, you have the situation of a person who comes rushing back from
work thinking that he can just get his vote in. He rushes to the
polling station and finds to his consternation that there is a queue.
However, thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, he can have a ballot
paper anyway. Provided that he is in the polling station by 10 pm, he
gets a ballot paper. Then he switches on his telephone and learns that
the exit poll is showing that the Tories are going to win. The man then
says to himself, “I have rushed back home, rushed to the polling
station and been prepared to stand around while they finally produce a
ballot paper for me but, having heard what the exit poll is showing, I
am going back home without voting”. It really is a most absurd
hypothesis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:20:43"></hs_TimeCode>. Even

important reasons advanced in Committee last week and briefly touched
on this evening, we should make it absolutely clear that an elector who
has gone to all the trouble of going to the polling station and is
there before the allotted time has elapsed should be given every
assistance to cast their vote. If the citizen is inside the polling
station or in a queue before the deadline, that situation is similar to
when someone is in a shop and wishes to make a purchase, the shop is
open for business and closing time has not happened. Surely, in a

Martin of Springburn:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the fact that
the noble Lord is going to do something on Report. As has been
mentioned, the procedure in such circumstances in Scotland is that a
member of staff goes out and marks the end of the queue. However, we
should not overlook the fact that most polling stations we are talking
about are schools that have a yard, where at least a janitor can close
the gates and have some control. Sometimes, if the polling station is a
church or portakabin, those queues could be out on the street. When
someone is arguing that they are entitled to be in the queue, the
safety and health of the staff concerned must also be
considered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:27:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment, a major responsibility remains with the returning officers
in every city and constituency. After all, the labourer is worthy of
his hire but, none the less, every returning officer is given a one-off
payment, over and above their local authority salary. I looked at the
figures for Sheffield Hallam where, in that constituency alone, 340
people lost out. It is a disgrace that that happened, because I have
rubbed shoulders with colleagues with majorities of less than
340<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:28:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

simple terms: if we were running a fund-raising function, dance, sale
of work or whatever, and we got the catering wrong on one occasion, we
would make sure that we got it right the next time. There is a
responsibility on returning officers, if they got it wrong in Sheffield
Hallam, to get it right the next time. The amendment should not allow
them to sit back and forget that they have a responsibility. By the
way, there were Scottish local government elections last year and only
three people among the whole of the local authority areas in Scotland
were concerned about whether they would get their votes. If a large
queue formed outside a large school in one year, in the next year in
which there is an approaching election, the returning officer should go
about the business of creating another polling station—perhaps
in a nursery or church around the corner. Also, the returning officer
should make sure that communications are good within the city or the
constituency, whichever applies. The staff at a polling station who see
queues forming should be able to phone up and say, “We need
extra help here and you must get that help right
away”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012348000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0001.htm#13012348000020">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:30:12"></hs_TimeCode>

ridiculous. It should be somewhere in the region of 1,000 electors. For
the sake of clarity, I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, that
in Scotland the building or classrooms where voting takes place are
known as the polling place and the designated streets are known as the
polling station. That is a small matter but perhaps the Minister can

the register was challenged in the courts—that there was a case
for changing the Victorian arrangements. In 1999 a Home Office working

Section 9 of the Representation of the People Act 2000,
which created the so-called “edited register”. It was
only when the Government consulted on how to implement the new
principle that they were challenged in court about the old system. In
2001, Brian Robertson from Pontefract won his case when the judge
concluded that the compulsory disclosure to commercial organisations of
data given for electoral purposes was in breach of the Data Protection
Act and of the newly passed Human Rights Act. He won the legal point in
court, but it appears that the political and moral point had
already been acknowledged by the Labour Government in 1999, and here in

of highly reputable, very public-spirited actions by very
public-spirited organisations could be impeded by the removal of the
edited register, or by it becoming ineffective. For example, the
Salvation Army is a particular advocate for its retention. Each year it
finds and reunites some 3,000 families by using the edited register.

be likely to opt in. I imagine that the value of the register would be

Wills:</Member></B> My Lords, a change in public policy on this issue
is long overdue, and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Norton, on his
persistence in returning to it on Report. I associate myself with
everything he said in support of his amendment. In the past, Ministers
have talked about the register being used as an aid for business and
commerce, and we have heard in this debate about its uses for charities
and other organisations. However, in my view, so far Ministers have
advanced no good arguments, either practical or principled, about why
such a public subsidy—because that is what these uses of the
electoral register represent—to particular business sectors
should take precedence over all the arguments for the other side that
have been put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Norton: weakened
protection of personal data, the likely damage to registration rates
caused under the present system, and the introduction of a commercial
element into a relationship that should be founded on fundamental
democratic
principles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:51:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

responsible for this issue in the last Government, I was minded to
adopt an approach very similar to that put forward by the noble Lord,
Lord Norton, both in Committee and today. Predictably, perhaps, I was
vigorously lobbied by representatives of credit agencies who made
fearsome claims about the potential detriment to businesses that would
arise from any changes. Clearly there are arguments on both sides of
the issue, so I asked those who had lobbied me to come back with
detailed evidence of the potential damage: their analysis of what might
be done to replace the electoral register as a source of data for them,
how much the alternatives might cost, and a detailed principled case
for public subsidy rather than their being put into the same position
as other private sector firms that produce goods and services and fund
their businesses from their own resources. I felt that when these
people came back with the information, a proper assessment could be
made of the advantages and disadvantages of different policy
approaches.</hs_para>

have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Neill, that the same arguments apply to charities and other
non-governmental organisations that use the electoral register for
wholly commendable objectives. The argument is not so much about the
usefulness of the electoral register, because that is clear and I think
we all agree on it. The argument I would put is whether this is the
best use of public money. What principled case is there for using
public subsidy in this way, and could the sums involved perhaps be
deployed more effectively in other ways? I have never seen any evidence
to that effect, either as a Minister or subsequently. If there were any
compelling evidence I might be prepared to change my mind, but in the
absence of detailed analysis and evidence it seems that the noble Lord,
Lord Norton, has made a compelling case for change. I hope that the

Norton of Louth:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to those who have
contributed, and especially to the noble Lord, Lord Wills,

have heard as particularly satisfactory. The Minister’s
objection appears to be that electors are not bright enough to
understand the difference between an opt-in and an opt-out. However, 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>we do not know whether citizens are making an
informed decision because they are not making that opt-in choice. It is
notable, as happened in Committee, that neither my noble friend Lord
Tyler nor my noble friend the Minister addressed the core issue of
principle that I raised. The objection was really practical—who
benefits from the edited register—rather than on the core point
about the use of personal data, how they are protected and whether
people make an informed
choice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T18:01:55"></hs_TimeCode>. In many

fundamental point is that we place stress on the protection of personal
data. As my noble friend Lord Tyler said, we had long discussions
leading up to the Act in 2000. I took part in those discussions and
made the case that what we did then did not go far enough in terms of
the protection of personal data. It is definitely something we need to
pursue and return to. As far as I am concerned, the Government need to
think again. As the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill, and the noble
Lord, Lord Wills, have said, the Government need to engage in serious
research on this. It is not something that is going to go away. It is
something we will doubtless come back to; indeed, we will
come back to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012364000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0002.htm#13012364000009">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T18:03:34"></hs_TimeCode>
this occasion, we are clearly not making much progress but at least we
have put down a marker. We will return to it because the protection of
personal data is extraordinarily important. There is a core principle:
people must give their consent. If the edited version is going to
collapse because they do not give their consent, then I am sorry, but
they must give it. In my view, electors are sufficiently intelligent to
understand clear instructions on the point of an opt-in and opt-out. If
the benefits are clearly explained then at least they can make an
informed choice. However, it really must be up to electors rather than
the Government making assumptions on their
behalf<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T18:03:31"></hs_TimeCode>. As I

am convinced that peace and prosperity will prevail in India and

substantially in recent years, in 2010-11 it remained at $2.6 billion,
far below the $40 billion that could be achieved. Estimates of indirect

Singapore, Iran, Afghanistan and others range anywhere between $500

has faced, in some ways, an extraordinary situation over an extended
period, primarily due to cross-border terrorism. The main issue,
therefore, is the continued infiltration of foreign terrorists from

between India and Pakistan have passed through several stages. It was
Pandit Nehru who suggested, within five years of taking office, that
there should be a confederation between the two countries, a proposal
he reiterated on several occasions. Relations have passed through

up their minds on exactly how much to co-operate, at what
pace and in which direction.</hs_para>

institutions and agencies that would like the two countries to get
together; there are others that think differently. Ever since the
military has been a dominant force in Pakistani politics, relations
with India have remained rather tense, although I see that Pakistan is
beginning to show a more ambiguous, nuanced approach. Given the
penetration of the military into the economic sphere, and the fact that
the economic sphere offers the opportunity for Pakistani business to
flourish, there is a great deal of demand for closer ties between the
two countries, including the proposal for giving India most favoured
nation

concern today is not to talk so much about India and Pakistan in

Pakistan and the rest of us from India—but rather to concentrate
on Kashmir. I know that the noble Lord has been preoccupied with
Kashmir for quite a while.</hs_para>

which has not been very popular in the Indian community or
the Indian establishment. I have always argued that to talk about
Kashmir “belonging” to India is an ambiguous expression.
If “Kashmir” refers to land, land can belong to another
country. But if “Kashmir” refers to people—which
it does—no people can belong to another, short of slavery.
Therefore, to say that Kashmir belongs to India is a very dangerous
proposition if it is taken to mean that the people of Kashmir can be
held hostage by the people of
India.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012364000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0002.htm#13012364000036">I have
wondered how best to handle the question. A plebiscite is not the
answer. If I were the Prime Minister of India—which happily I am
not—I would go for it because I would know that I would be able
to organise a plebiscite but Pakistan would not. The 1948 resolution
requires that both sides should withdraw their armed forces. Under
Pakistan’s constitution, Pakistani-occupied Kashmir is already
an integral part of Pakistan and therefore it is not open to Pakistan
to cede Pakistani-occupied Kashmir or allow it to become
separate.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012364000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0002.htm#13012364000037">It
is also the case that in order for the United Nations resolution to be
implemented, Kashmir will have to be whole, which means that the
territory of Kashmir that Pakistan has ceded to China will have to be
restored. In order for the 1948 resolution to go  
<?notus-xml column=1163?>through, Pakistan would have to vacate
Pakistani-occupied Kashmir and regain the land it
has ceded to China. Neither of these conditions can be met, so India
could easily say, “Let’s have a plebiscite”,
knowing full well that the other side would not be able to meet those
conditions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012364000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0002.htm#13012364000038">There
are other reasons why I can imagine India not agreeing,
because if you agree to a plebiscite in Kashmir, you might have to do
that in the north-east and other parts of India, and that is a
non-starter. In addition, if the plebiscite went the other way one
could not be entirely sure how the 148 million Muslims in
India would respond and no Government could risk the
disorder that this might cause. So a plebiscite is not an
option.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012364000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0002.htm#13012364000039">At the
same time, the existing situation is not an option either. It is
absolutely right to say that India has behaved badly in Kashmir in
recent years. Its forces have been responsible for violations of human
rights. However, this has been recognised by the Indian media, as the
noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, pointed out. There are plenty of groups in
India that have campaigned against this. The National Human Rights
Commission of India has campaigned against this. There is a tremendous
amount of Indian opposition—people like myself, Arundhati Roy
and lots of others have written about it. Within India itself there are
enough alternatives available to put pressure on the Government to do
something about it—the kind of thing, I am afraid, that does not
seem to obtain in
Pakistan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012364000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0002.htm#13012364000040">What
should we be doing? India cannot continue as it is doing now. At the
same time, one cannot expect that the two halves of Kashmir can remain
as they are, for all kinds of reasons. For the time being at least, one
must respect the line of control; expect and require the Indians to
behave much more sensibly in Kashmir, as they used to do but have not
done in recent years; and hope that the compulsions of democracy in
India and Kashmir will force a course of events resulting in an
increasingly relaxed climate in Kashmir and India, and between India
and Pakistan, so that the situation can be handled much more
intelligently than it is being handled
now.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_23_PT_1/1CF0EF97DC3376D303A8E77B7B151D988E4C2136" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 January 2013">Wednesday,

another place on a number of occasions during the 1990s, largely
because the issue had been brought to my attention by the sizeable
Kashmiri population in my then constituency of Glasgow Central. Indeed,
the community was so insistent that I should see for myself the
situation in that part of the world that it arranged visits for me to
Azad Kashmir. I visited Muzaffarabad, Mirpur and other places to get a
better feel of the situation than through the imploring of my
constituents, which I assure noble Lords I received much of. There were

commit—as my noble friend said, it is an act of war—but
it seems that while our Government are raising the issue and answer
questions in much the same way today as they did in 1995, and since
then, nothing seems to change. What steps is the Minister prepared to

Question that we are discussing today mentions self-determination for
the people of Kashmir. The original UN resolution, Security Council
Resolution 47, adopted in 1948, mentioned that there should
be a plebiscite. A plebiscite would be for all the people of Kashmir
and, as I argued in the 1990s, should not ask merely, “Do you
want to be under the aegis of Pakistan or do you want to be under the
aegis of India?” but “Are you in favour of an independent
Kashmir?”. That is a perfectly legitimate question which only
the Kashmiri people can answer. Of course, they have never been allowed
to answer that question because it has never been put to them. The
question of self-determination underpins this whole

is no need to regurgitate the history of the issue, which I would
maintain goes right back to the day when Maharaja Hari Singh, then the
ruler of Kashmir, decided to sign the territory over to India. It is
interesting that it was India that went to the United Nations in 1948
for the resolution which eventually emerged and it was then India, as
history tells us, that prevented it happening because of disputes over
Pakistani troops and their withdrawal from Kashmir. I do not seek to
blame one country more than another, because that serves no purpose,
but the question of a plebiscite or any kind of self-determination
seems to have moved right off the agenda. Even the Hurriyat Conference
stated as long as 10 years ago that it no longer saw that as a
realistic possibility. We have reluctantly to accept that, but it does
not mean that we should not seek to offer the people of Kashmir the
right to have their say in some meaningful form, whatever that should
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T18:31:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Kashmir is
today the most militarised territory in the world, with up to 1 million
troops stationed there. I do not know whether it is the longest-lasting
territorial dispute—perhaps Palestinians would say that theirs
is slightly longer, although it dates from about much the 
<?notus-xml column=1165?>same time—but after three major wars, in 1947, 1965
and 1971, and a very tense standoff in 2002 which we thought at one
time might lead to nuclear conflict, the need for intense diplomatic
efforts on the part of our Government is urgent. I just wonder why more
pressure is not put on the Governments of both India and Pakistan. Is
it because India is such an emerging and important economic power now?
Is it because Pakistan has to be an ally in the fight against terrorism
in that part of the world? I do not know, but we should press for some
kind of action. If UN Security Council Resolution 47 is now redundant,
why not make it at least a starting point and go back to the United
Nations to see whether a new one could be framed or some meaningful way

out of this. I remember what happened to my right honourable friend

passport, so Kashmir was not mine to give up. They said, “Forget
about that. You really have Kashmir and you ought to give it
up”. I suddenly realised that India has Kashmir by virtue of the
agreement with the old king, Maharaja Hari Singh. Pakistan’s
sense of nationhood depends on having Kashmir as part of Pakistan.
There is a great asymmetry in feeling about Kashmir in those two
countries. India has the bulk of the valley of Kashmir and Pakistan has
only a sliver and wants all of it. Flying on Pakistan International

the three components of Jammu and Kashmir that we mean. You could not
really hold a plebiscite even if it was possible, except on the

Triesman:</Member></B> My Lords, I join others in thanking my noble
friend Lord Ahmed for instigating this debate. It is a serious matter.
There have been three wars over Kashmir between those two countries,
and that is bad enough, but they are also nuclear powers, which makes
it all the more dangerous. I agree with my noble friends Lord Parekh
and Lord Watson, who in different ways in wise observations made the
point that the blame game is hardly likely to help any part of the
process. We are not immune from it in this House, although I wonder
whether it ever helps.</hs_para>

events of the past couple of weeks have been worrying and threatening.
There have been five deaths, one of them an Indian soldier who there is
reliable evidence to say was beheaded, although there is much doubt as
to who actually did it. Exchanges across the line of control are not
uncommon but fatalities are, thankfully, relatively rare. On 11
January, India described the violations and armed infiltrations as
“matters of serious concern”. India was “on
alert”. Pakistan summoned India’s ambassador to protest
over the death of one of its soldiers, and the tone of India’s
language was also a matter of objection by the Pakistani Government.
Pakistan denied responsibility for any of the attacks, including the
beheading. An Indian opposition leader chillingly called

noble friend Lord Ahmed was quite right to deplore the excesses of
language that have emerged on both sides. At senior levels in both
Governments and military leaderships, more bellicose language is being
used. Pakistan’s Foreign Minister, while calling for calm, also
accused India of “warmongering”. India’s army
chief predicted instability and said that in respect of periods of
relative
calm,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13012371000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-0002.htm#13012371000097">“there

that light, it is perhaps extraordinary that military commanders have
carved out what is at least a de facto truce at the moment.
Cross-border firing stopped, I believe, on 16 January. Since then,
although both sides are bristling with weapons, no one has crossed or
fired across the line of control. How remarkable, in its way, that is.
Two senior generals, India’s Vinod Bhatia and Pakistan’s
Ashfaq Nadeem, made the truce agreement in a 10-minute telephone
conversation, which illustrates what is possible in extreme
circumstances. It is hopeful and it is helpful, but it is fragile.
Peace, just getting back on track after the Mumbai attacks in 2008,
is plainly at risk, and the line of control creates little

relations with India are obviously very strong. It is a powerful

Islamic world more generally. It is, as I said, a nuclear power.

fragility across the line of control becomes sustained conflict.

Commissions in the boundary review and on by when the commissions have

October 2018. Taken in conjunction with the provisions in the PVSC Act,
it would be clear that the electoral register as at 1 December 2015
would be used in this review. The formulation of the amendment makes it
clear that the current review, which is based on electoral register
data as at 1 December 2010 is cancelled as the boundary review under

December 2015. Again, I ask the Minister to confirm that this is his

Commissions would not have discretion to consider inconveniences
attendant 
<?notus-xml column=1173?>on boundary changes as a factor when drawing up boundary proposals for
the review that must report before 1 October 2018. The PVSC Act
provides that the discretion to consider inconveniences would be
disapplied for the purposes of the first review under the changes made
by the PVSC Act. This is because there would inevitably be more
inconvenience attendant on the first review under the PVSC Act as it
reduces the number of constituencies from 650 to 600 and, for the first

drawing up
constituencies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>.

Electoral Commission maintains that it would make no sense to review in
2015 a reduction that would not—in the Bill we have to send to

highway authorities with the means to better manage activities on their
road network, to minimise inconvenience and disruption to road users.
Highway authorities do not have to introduce permit schemes. Where
schemes are implemented, the authority is able to grant permits to
works promoters to undertake works on the highway. This provides
greater control over works in their area, and enables them to promote
better working practices, for example working outside peak hours where
appropriate. A permit scheme also enables improved co-ordination of
works.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012340000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123-wms0001.htm#13012340000015">Once

the administrative burden of future permit schemes, I have recently

benefits to all road users. To give time for local authorities to
adjust to this new approach, I will retain the Secretary of

joint review of both organisations in 2014-15, as part of the
Government’s rolling programme of reviews of non-departmental
public bodies. They will also be asked to co-locate, share
significantly more back-office services and align their strategies.
With this approach, I am confident that both organisations will be able
to reduce their administrative costs over this Spending Review period
and that we can deliver the strategic benefits of closer working
between the two organisations with immediate effect. This fits
logically within the context of the Government’s public bodies
reform programme, which will reduce the number of public bodies
by  a third, directly contributes to improvements in
accountability and transparency, and will cut out waste and duplication
from the system. It will also contribute to government-wide reductions

essential for supporting growth and is a core priority for this
Government. We want to ensure that the financial sector can supply

access to equity finance. That is why the Government are providing a

Growth Accelerator provides bespoke packages of support to businesses
based on their particular barriers to growth rather than direct
financial support. This support includes high quality coaching, master
classes, leadership and management training and peer group support as
well as access to external support that they need (e.g. export advice,
angel investment, access to incubators etc). The initial average value
of the coaching, masterclasses and leadership and management training
is c£5,100. This is expected to increase as European Development
Funding (ERDF) and private sector contributions to the programme are
secured. There are currently five companies in the Basildon area signed

posed by multiple births and the actions that can be taken to avoid
this, in contrast, OHSS is more complex and women can react very
differently to similar drug regimes. As a result, there is no clear
mechanism through which the HFEA can mitigate the risks. The minutes of

faced by religious minorities including the Alevi and Syriac
minorities. The new constitution offers the opportunity to codify this

several United Nations organisations, including the United Nations
Development Programme, to deliver basic services to the poorest people
in Zimbabwe. There are no reliable figures about the number of teachers
who have emigrated from Zimbabwe since 2005. However there is enough
anecdotal evidence to suggest that large numbers of qualified teachers
have left Zimbabwe in the past eight years, thereby adversely affecting
the provision of quality education in Zimbabwe as underlined by an
increase in the ratio of trained teachers to pupils and declines in
levels of learning among pupils. The Government of Zimbabwe have
indicated that around 20,000 teachers have returned to teaching since
the signing of the global political agreement in 2008. It is unclear
how many of these 20,000 had emigrated since
2005.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012366000457" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130123w0001.htm#13012366000457">Between
