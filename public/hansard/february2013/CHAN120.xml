“catastrophic” for the industry, with the new regulations
made in Cardiff likely to add £11,000 to the cost of a
three-bedroom house. At a time when Welsh builders need work and Wales
needs more homes, that cannot be right. I consequently urge the Welsh

for our armed forces, and that will continue to be the case under the

advice, and that is exactly the same with defence careers. However,

rating agency does not matter—that is the right hon.
Gentleman’s argument. His argument is that the rating agency
does not matter and that the answer to debt is to borrow more and not
to take any responsibility for the mess they left. It is this
Government who have cut the deficit by a quarter, who have a million
extra private sector jobs and who have low interest rates that are
vital for the future of the economy. Economies that maintain their
triple A rating are those of countries such as Canada and Germany that
fixed the roof when the sun was shining. Let me ask him again: why does
he not admit that his answer to extra borrowing is to borrow more? Have
another go: admit
it!<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

Miliband:</Member></B> Any time the right hon. Gentleman wants to swap
places, I will happily answer the questions. He talks about borrowing.
I do not know when he last checked, but the deficit is rising, not
falling, this year—and, because of his failure to grow the
economy, he is borrowing £212 billion more than he planned. Now,
let us turn to the reasons for the downgrade. May we take it from his
answers so far that he really believes that this loss of the

rating does matter. It demonstrates that we have to go further and
faster on reducing the deficit. The very fact that the right hon.
Gentleman will not answer the question about wanting to borrow more,
which the country needs to know, means that he will never sit on this
side of the House. If he wants to look at what is happening in our
economy, is it not interesting that he does not mention the other
economic news from last week, which was 154,000 extra people in work
and more people in employment than at any time in our history. Youth
unemployment is down since the election; unemployment is down since the
election—that is what is happening in our economy, but the right
hon. Gentleman cannot recognise it. When is he going to admit that we
should never listen to someone who sold the gold, bust the banks,
racked up the deficit and cannot say sorry for any of

Miliband:</Member></B> I think we can take it from that answer that the
Prime Minister cannot accept the simple fact that he has failed on the
first test he set himself, and it is his fault—it happened on
his watch. Borrowing is rising, even after all the pain of the tax
rises and all the spending cuts because the part-time
Chancellor’s plan is failing. The truth is that they are the
last people left who think that their plan is working and that the
failure has nothing to do with them. We have 1

out, “That’s not true”, so perhaps he believes it,
too, but behind the scenes he is briefing against the Chancellor.
Perhaps they should swap places. We have 1 million young people out of

Gentleman has just made. He says the deficit is up, but it is down by a

about the level of unemployment, but it is down since the election and
we have a record number of people in work. Those are the facts. Now let

pursued by the Government have been embraced by schools in
Bedfordshire, not least, excitingly, by Tony Withell and his great
staff at Wootton upper school in pursuit of a science, technology,
engineering and maths academy. This week, however, there has been a
blip. Fernwood school in Woburn Sands was offered free school status 14
months ago as part of the Barnfield Federation, but last week that
offer was removed without the school knowing why. Will the Prime
Minister use his offices to implore the Department for Education to let
me know the reason as soon as possible, as there are 110

was listening very carefully to what was said about that specific

where we are in the parliamentary timetable, one would have to be
wholly ignorant or severely optimistic to assume that the Bill I
propose stands any chance whatever of becoming law—this year.
Although as a Lib Dem I am equipped by necessity with boundless
reserves of cheery optimism, I have no expectation of seeing the Bill
mature into legislation. So confident am I of seeing it strangled at
birth that I did think of calling it the “Local Government and
Futile Measures Bill”, only to realise that the additional
phrase probably applied to much of the legislation in this place. I am
far from disheartened, however, because such events, apart from seeming
a piece of typically British, eccentric constitutional indulgence, or
useful occupational therapy for Back Benchers, can have an effect, by
putting, or keeping, on the agenda important key themes.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T12:37:15"></hs_TimeCode> last foray in
this role was an attempt to introduce a Bill to enhance, or provide,
democratic accountability for NHS services. The Government have now
actually done that, although I would like to think that my proposals,
which involved the creation of no new institutions or structures,
offered a more elegant, less expensive and less complex solution than
that contrived by the Government in the Health and Social Care Act
2012.</hs_Para>

system is based on the supremacy of Parliament, and my Bill draws
attention to the fraught relationship between local and central
Government. Parliament, Brussels notwithstanding, has unfettered power,
or what Lord Hailsham referred to as elective dictatorship. Local
government also has powers, but they can be increased, decreased,
removed or added to, fettered or unfettered, by us in Parliament.
Governments often promise—I have heard them do so—to
liberate or empower local government, but the liberation of local
government by central Government often resembles Stalin’s
post-war liberation of eastern Europe, as it simply allows discretion
to decide on how to implement unpopular policies, thereby sharing or
deflecting the blame.</hs_Para>

and insistently, central Government retain all their rights to
interfere in any area, at will, with little or no notice. I am not
making a party political point; it is not in the DNA of central
Government, irrespective of who is in power, to give away power that
matters, and one can understand why. Local government deals
with huge areas of national importance—education, social care,
transport, the environment, the economic vitality of
communities—and Ministers simply cannot be uninterested in what
local government does or how it does it, so they keep in
reserve, understandably, a range of powers, regulations and incentives
to influence how local government performs. Parliament will not have
its will crossed—it is, as they say, an elective dictatorship.

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T12:40:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Easington (Grahame M. Morris) has got there ahead of me. It is
illustrated by the exemplary behaviour of our current Secretary of
State for Communities and Local Government. Only someone as gifted as
him in the art of irony could possibly have introduced a Localism
Bill—with over 100 new powers ascribed to himself. Only someone
with a feel for the truly comic could wring £250 million out of
the Chancellor in hard-pressed times in order that statesmen can
interfere with the nation’s bins and council collection times,
or could instructively chastise and threaten councils that have set
their council tax exactly within the limits he himself laid down. As he
himself has said, he takes liberties, but presumably only to
demonstrate through a process of reductio ad absurdum how little power
local government really has and how it can be removed, changed or
denatured by the whim of Whitehall.</hs_Para>

liberties is not necessary a good thing. My Bill seeks to mitigate
that, first by requiring every Government to lay down in advance
through a defined code their understanding of the respective powers of
local and national Government, the areas of genuine autonomy, and
specify devolved powers. That could be done, fully taking into account
national needs, with or without consensus. However, that having been
done, and there having been defined separate spheres of
action—the rules of the game—everyone must stick to them,
with an appeal to a judicial or quasi-judicial body when that
understanding is breached by either party, or ridden over roughshod to
suit the mood of whoever holds the reigns of central or local
government.</hs_Para>

Bill simply aspires to put in place a guarantee of reasonably
predictable behaviour, a self-denying ordinance. The Government could
still dictate and legislate for a different relationship, but they
would not be able to interfere arbitrarily. In fact, having to make it
clear that they are not doing that is wholly to the good. They 
<?notus-xml column=318?>could not act on the spur of the moment. They would simply be denying
themselves the opportunity to create havoc, either financial or
administrative. There is fairness in that, because the previous
Government insisted that local councils, when making major strategic
decisions, give the population ample advance notice and engagement
through publication and consultation—a kind of “no big
surprises” rule. All that I expect through the Bill is that
Whitehall would show similarly helpful self-discipline, particularly
because councils, unlike Whitehall, have to balance their budgets
annually and cannot cope too easily with handbrake turns in
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T12:43:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0001.htm#13022775000215">It
seems to me that having to make clear Whitehall’s interest in
interfering, as it does, with council’s planning policies,
housing targets and borrowing arrangements, which are all contentious
areas, and having to make a case and then abide by it, could hopefully
throw up a plethora of anomalies and unjustifiable restraints and
perhaps expose the dead-weight influence of state bureaucracy accrued
over a fair period, which cannot be a bad thing. It might, in the
process, rid me of an abiding and disturbing image of the Secretary of
State as a languid eastern potentate or sultan governing by mood or
arbitrary decree, and it would hopefully put the fraught relationship
between local and central Government on a business-like footing. This
issue, which has been raised in various parts of the House and in a
number of different places, will not go away, unlike my Bill, which I
commend to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0001.htm#13022775000216"><I>Question

just a few weeks’ time the Government’s notorious

£14 a week, or over £700 a year, the housing benefit of
an estimated 660,000 low-income households who are deemed to be living
in a home bigger than their needs require. The measure is causing
anxiety and anger in equal measure. It follows hard on the heels of
punitive cuts to tax credits that have already slashed the budgets of
low-income families, and it compounds the real-terms cut to the safety
net of social protection for people who are unable to work because of

that the private rented sector is comparable to the social rented

private rector than on those in socially rented accommodation, which is
significantly cheaper. I hope to return to that point later, but it is

the Member for Angus (Mr Weir) about homes that have been adapted. We
estimate that at least 16,000 homes in Scotland that are affected by

in rent so that those in adapted homes do not have to

us do the sums. The additional discretionary housing payment amounts to
only 6% of the total shortfall across the UK. In Scotland, it amounts
to a paltry 4% of the shortfall. That means that even if
Scotland’s entire discretionary housing allocation—not
just the extra bit, but the entire allocation—was focused solely
on those disabled people living in adapted homes, it would not cover

high is that we have had a recession that has pushed people out of
employment. One of the trite suggestions that we have heard repeatedly
from the Government in trying to defend this indefensible tax is that
people should just pick up a few extra hours’ work here or there
to meet the bedroom tax. Since the start of the financial crisis,
underemployment has soared. Millions of people have seen the prospect
of overtime vanish and their working hours cut. According to the TUC,
there are 3.3 million people across the UK who are working part time,
but who want to be working full time. That is twice the pre-recession
level. When we look at the steep rise in housing benefit, we therefore
have to look at the inflation in the housing market in some parts of
the country and at the underlying economic drivers of unemployment and
poor economic
performance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T13:05:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0001.htm#13022775000277"><Member ContinuationText="Stewart Hosie" PimsId="4796" UID="13022775001225" xid="835" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0001.htm#13022775001225"><B>Stewart

half of foster carers do not receive a fee for fostering. The Fostering

pensioners who so far have been excluded from the under-occupancy
rules. That is important because many older people who are technically
under-occupying are extremely anxious about the bedroom tax and
frightened that it will force them to move. We must make it clear that
they will not have to do so at this stage. Once universal credit is
introduced, however, people of pension age who have a younger partner
of working age will be subject to the bedroom tax, and again, they will
be forced to move into smaller, more expensive, and often less suitable

soundbites about spare bedrooms, there has been a failure to
acknowledge the underlying shortage in affordable housing across the UK
and the backdrop of changing population demographics. What makes the
Government’s under-occupancy rules fundamentally unworkable is
the mismatch between available social housing stock and the needs of
tenants and prospective tenants. The scale of the problem varies across
the UK, but in Scotland, for example, only 26% of homes available for
social rent are one-bedroom properties yet 60% of tenants affected by
this measure require a one-bedroom home. According to the National
Housing Federation, 
<?notus-xml column=328?>in England there are twice as many people under-occupying two-bedroom
homes than the number of one-bedroom properties that became available
last year. No matter how we shuffle people around, not enough homes of
the right size are available for affordable rent. That mismatch is
entirely outside the control of tenants yet they are being punished for
a structural problem not of their

what sort or size of house they are offered. Councils and housing
associations already go to great lengths to match tenants with a house
of the right size, but they do not have enough one-bedroom properties

which is the most transparent and fair approach, but they require
considerable flexibility from prospective tenants in terms of the size,
location and type of property they will accept. Demand exceeds supply.

great irony of the bedroom tax is that it will not save any money. As I
pointed out early in the debate, it already costs more on average to
house people on low incomes in the private sector than to house them in
the social rented sector. Last year, the average housing benefit
payment in the social rented sector was £80.71 a week, but in
the private sector it was £107.35. Rent paid to social landlords
tends to be reinvested in social housing, which in my view represents
better value for money for us all. All the bedroom tax will do is cause

the mismatch between the housing stock and tenants’ needs is the
glaring flaw in this ill-thought-through and unworkable policy, the

social landlords who depend on reliable and steady flows of rent to
maintain their credit rating, keep rents low, and reinvest in new and

return to a question posed earlier, social landlords need to be
consistent in how they deal with arrears. I am not sure we can draw a
distinction between someone who falls into arrears because of the

because their tax credits have been reduced, because they lose their
job or because they have fallen sick. The danger is that if some people
have their arrears written off and others do not, that will quickly

people will be at risk of arrears and that they are being proactive in
trying to prevent that from happening, but they are clear that their
ability to provide affordable homes depends on their ability to 
<?notus-xml column=332?>collect rents from tenants. The real problem is that the under-occupancy
penalty is unfair and unworkable. Instead of trying to mitigate its

back on the low-income households in the social rented sector, who can

bedroom tax is a nasty, vindictive and unnecessary measure. The
under-occupancy penalty is manifestly unfair. It puts disabled people
on low incomes right at the front of the austerity agenda, and asks
people on the lowest incomes to pay the price for the structural
problems affecting the supply of affordable housing. However, the
bedroom tax is also unworkable: instead of addressing the underlying
problems, it undermines the ability of social landlords to invest in
the kind of affordable housing that is so badly needed, and it fails to
tackle the excessive private sector rents in London and surrounding
areas that have fuelled inflation in the housing benefit
bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T13:30:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000342" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0001.htm#13022775000342">The

any money, but it will cause chaos for tenants and social landlords

communities, or for those who find themselves grappling with spiralling
debt. It is not too late for the Government to think again. I urge
Ministers to reconsider: scrap this crazy measure, or at the very least
look again at exempting households affected by disability; look again
at the budget for discretionary housing payments; offer local
authorities support commensurate with the identified needs of disabled
people and foster carers; and look again at whether it is reasonable to
consider two-bedroom homes as under-occupied at all. I would have more

in the context of deficit reduction. Given that we have to reduce the

the housing benefit goes up substantially. There will be a charge for
under-occupancy, which might be, say, £14 a week.
Instead of paying £70 to the household housing costs, the young
serviceman or woman will not have to pay anything, so if they value the
room at £2 a day, they could still pay that £2 to mum and

tenants more than we do social housing tenants. That is simply wrong.

point. It is a common misconception that there is a one-way flow of
people in this context. If someone moves from social housing into the
private rented sector, as some do, that frees up socially rented
accommodation, into which someone who might previously have been living
in overcrowded, temporary or bed and breakfast accommodation can move.

recognise that this is a time of change that will present challenges
for tenants and for landlords, and we have to support both. One of the
positive things to come out of the change is that landlords are getting
to know their local authority tenants and social housing tenants far
better than in the past. All too often, housing associations did not
know their tenants well enough; we have now seen an important process
of getting to know individual tenants and their needs. As a result,
some of the more creative housing associations have schemes whereby
half a dozen people have moved accommodation so that there is a better
fit between the individuals and their housing needs. The 1 million
spare bedrooms are a precious resource of our communities and of
vulnerable people in them, and I will not have it said that those who

this policy, but he might be able to protect some people. I think he
accepts that some people will not be able to move because no suitable
property is available. They will not be able to afford the shortfall
and will therefore fall into housing rent arrears and could be evicted.
At that stage, they become “intentionally homeless” and
end up at the bottom of any housing list. Will the Minister look at
that further to see whether he can do anything to ensure that someone
in that position because of housing debt is not deemed intentionally
homeless? Otherwise, such a person stands no chance of getting social

Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)
mentioned. The position on foster families is, I think, shared across
the House. If people need a spare bedroom for a foster child, we want
to make sure that they have one, and we want to support fosterers. The
question is whether that is done better by some blanket exemption or by
what we have done in costing what it would take to meet the shortfall
for those families and giving the money to local authorities so that a
foster family for which this was an issue—it might not be an
issue for all of them—can approach the authority and have the
shortfall made up.</hs_Para>

discretionary housing payments gave local authorities the discretion we

through and is causing anxieties to foster families who do not know
about DHPs, for example, or if local authorities have not communicated
well enough, we would be happy to look at whether this is the most
effective way of supporting families. Where there is a shortfall,
discretionary housing payments for this and other measures are
available. We want to make sure that people use them when they are in

willing to look at whether the discretionary funds will meet certain

think there is a balance to be struck. The attraction of the approach
for foster families would be that the size criteria could be defined
and then categories of people such as a couple, teenage children and so
forth could be added to the list. We could say that a bedroom used for
a foster child is a bedroom, so no deduction applies, people do not
need to go to the council for the DHPs and the Department for Work and

difficulties even within a category, as there might be foster carers,
for example, for whom this is more or less of an issue. It could vary
from case to case. We have to make the judgment: where do we need to
make a blanket exemption or a blanket entitlement to a room, and where
do we say that we will give the local authorities money and discretion?

the Treasury scorecard if it fails. That is the reality. About
£490 million is earmarked to be saved by this policy over the

are hit for £14 a week for 52 weeks a year. That is
how those savings will be delivered. This is not about bringing spare

is particularly troubling to many Opposition Members is the

this tax to move into. The Government have removed any shelter where
vulnerable people can take cover before opening fire. This is a policy
of unique cruelty, therefore. The Government are not seeking to solve
under-occupancy. Instead, they are simply seeking to make the poorest

her question just as soon as the Government Front Benchers simmer down

recession and perhaps worse; they have just presided over a downgrade

the past couple of years, which has made the deficit position far
worse. This Government are going to borrow more in this Parliament than
Labour did in 13 years, so the question now has to be: how is the pain
of paying down the deficit to be shared? Labour has always said that
there has to be a mixture of growth and sensible public spending
cuts—that is how to get the deficit down. What we should not be
doing is having a £3 billion tax give-away for Britain’s
richest citizens while asking 660,000 people to pay an extra £14

McKechin</B> (Glasgow North) (Lab):</Member> I welcome today’s
debate on a serious and deeply worrying issue. I, like many others,
spent last week in my constituency, where almost every conversation I
had—with constituents, DWP local managers, banks, post offices,
housing associations, credit unions and my local citizens advice
bureau—was centred on the so-called bedroom tax. Today, I
listened carefully to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T14:51:06"></hs_TimeCode> Minister of
State, who took great pleasure in referring to the “spare room
subsidy” and the question of equity. It reminded me of the
debates on the poll tax in the early 1990s, when it was considered
“equitable” that the poor should take a heavier burden.
That message resonates today right across the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T14:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000547" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0002.htm#13022775000547">What
struck me about those conversations last week was how unprepared we are
for perhaps the most dramatic setback in decades for our housing sector
and local communities, first, among the tenants. Up to the end of last
year, housing providers earnestly hoped they could persuade the
Government to change their mind; then they started to write to their
tenants, who in turn put the letter in a safe place and hoped the issue
would go 
<?notus-xml column=358?>away too. Only since the start of this year have tenants’ eyes
been opened to the true horror, as housing associations have now
started physically to knock on their door and find out how they intend
to
cope<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T14:52:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000548" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0002.htm#13022775000548">Let
me give the examples of two constituents I met last week. One of the
women looks after her father full time—she gave up her work 15
years ago to act as a carer—and he lives nearby in a one-bedroom
flat, so she cannot move in with him. Because there are no spare
houses, she faces having to move to the opposite side of Glasgow and
then trying to commute every day to look after her father. The other
woman is 58 years old and single; she has lived where she is now for 17
years. She is a good tenant, who keeps the area stable and looks after
her neighbours, but she faces being moved many miles away to an area
she does not know and where she does not know the local
people—even though she does not have the money to move house in
the first place. One question the Government have not asked is how we
will manage moving all those people, many of whom have no spare
cash<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T14:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000549" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0002.htm#13022775000549">Most

Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who is not here to hear the
debate—nor is the Secretary of State for Scotland—the
impact on housing associations’ credit rating. That is not just
a technical point: many experts are talking quietly about the need for
wholesale consolidation of local social landlords, so that they can
avoid bankruptcy as they try to cope with the ruinous increases in
their cost of borrowing at the same time as they face a huge hike in
both arrears and administration costs, with many having only very small
reserves to buffer the losses.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T14:54:55"></hs_TimeCode>That impact will
be worsened by the introduction of universal credit later this year.

Members have commented correctly on the need to build more housing,
both in the social rented and private sectors. How much land in
Scotland, or the UK, is held by building companies as part of their
land banks? It is estimated that perhaps 250,000 houses with planning
permission are still to be built. Has there been an audit of where
those properties are? Can we levy unused plots of land to provide a
stimulus to build, because in many cases builders are just waiting to
get more money for the land on which they sit? Can we control private
rentals? The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan rightly commented that
rental levels in the private sector in Scotland, as in many other parts
of the United Kingdom, are in excess of those in the social rented
sector. According to Shelter Scotland, the taxpayer would on average
pay more than £100 extra in local housing allowance each month
if someone in Edinburgh moved from the social rented sector to the
private sector, and the same would apply in Glasgow and Inverness; in
Aberdeen—one part of the United Kingdom enjoying something of an
economic boom—an extra £200 would be paid per month. The
hon. Lady was incorrect, however, to state that increases in rentals
were a phenomenon only in Greater London. There is a shortage of
housing, and people cannot afford to buy a house or provide a deposit,
so they are moving into the private rented sector, pushing rentals ever
upwards.</hs_Para>

afraid that I am not an expert on the law of leases in England, but in
Scotland long-term secured rentals are still subject to regulated
rents. Very few of those remain in the United Kingdom—the
average age of the residents in such cases is probably 85
plus—because frankly they were not attractive to the market at
the time when the law was changed. In urban communities—the
situation is worst in London, but it is an issue in areas such as
Glasgow as well—transience is increasing, as people move house
at ever more regular intervals, not through choice or for job reasons
but because their landlord thinks he can find another tenant who is
prepared to pay a higher rental. The only way to stabilise the market
and get rentals back down is to improve regulation, and that is why the
law needs to change. The

Scotland has many small housing associations. The Scottish Government,
working with local authorities and housing associations, should be much
more proactive in seeing how they will cope with the additional costs

a landlord but acts as the hub of the local community, providing
community resources and arranging contact with local police or local
schools. It is very much in the control of local tenants and represents
the local community. Should a consolidation of housing associations be

explain the other exemptions that I believe should be included. First,
if it is deemed that two partners have to sleep in separate rooms for
medical reasons or because of a disability, clearly they should be
exempt. Similarly, if a child with a disability is deemed to require a
separate room, they, too, should be exempt. Social housing plays a
different role in the housing mix and is there, in particular, to
support families in that situation who also have a low income. Of
course, that would help with the current issue over the Court of Appeal
ruling. The easiest thing for the Government to do would be to accept
those exemptions.</hs_Para>

Greatrex</B> (Rutherglen and Hamilton West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am
listening to the hon. Gentleman carefully. Obviously, I would prefer
that this change was not happening at all. While he is on the subject
of possible exemptions, does he agree that foster parents should also
be exempt? When I raised that with the Minister at Work and Pensions
questions, he talked about a discretionary fund, but foster parents in
my constituency have told me that, because of the uncertain future,
they might be put off continuing to foster. Would it not be much better
if foster parents whose spare rooms are not a luxury but used to care
for children who would otherwise probably be cared for at greater cost
to the public purse were also
exempt?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000588" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0002.htm#13022775000588"><B><Member ContinuationText="Greg Mulholland" PimsId="4826" UID="13022775001452" xid="861" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0002.htm#13022775001452">Greg
Mulholland:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman pre-empts what I was about
to say, because the next thing on my list is foster carers who are in
between children to be 
<?notus-xml column=364?>cared for. Much of the criticism of the Government has been unfair and
party political, which is in the nature of democratic politics, but the
principle behind this measure, as I have said, is
reasonable. We need to try to address the issue because of the housing
crisis we face and to enable families living in seriously overcrowded
accommodation to find appropriate housing. However, it is important
that the Government do not undermine other key objectives, and clearly
one of those is placing more children with foster families and
encouraging more people to foster. I am afraid that that is what the
measure, without the exemption, threatens to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000589" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0002.htm#13022775000589">The
other category that I believe should be exempted is families who have
sadly split up because the parents have separated, which is always
difficult for every member of the family. In the majority of cases, the
father is the non-resident parent and the parent without care. Whether
they have their child for three days a week or two days a month, for
example, is in many cases not determined by them; it is often imposed
and has to be accepted even though the non-resident parent would like
their child to stay with them more often. The parent wants to ensure
that when their child stays they feel that it is also their
home.</hs_Para>

broken homes, but in reality we are talking about a family with two
homes, or in many cases we are talking about two families. It is
therefore perfectly reasonable for the non-resident parent to maintain
a bedroom and keep it for their child, with their things in it, so that
when they come to stay they know they are staying with their other
parent, at their other home and in their other bedroom. I think that is
very important. Of course, child benefit is paid to the parent with
care, so there can be serious financial pressures on the non-resident
parent, who still has to feed the child, possibly for up to three
nights a week, and indeed they also want to be able to contribute by
buying things for
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000591" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0002.htm#13022775000591"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:19:11"></hs_TimeCode>My

one-bedroom properties around. Members from rural constituencies have

to be local discretion, and it applies even in urban areas. For

hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford) described in her
excellent contribution how this provision is just
part of an accumulative effect that is 
<?notus-xml column=367?>hurting the vulnerable. I want to mention the case of a couple I met
during the recess when I was knocking on doors in my constituency. They
have been hit not only by the bedroom tax, but by other things as well.
They had worked all their lives. The husband used to be a driver, but
he was hit by rheumatoid arthritis and had his driving licence revoked.
He has, therefore, been unable to work, not least because, as he showed
me as I sat in his kitchen, he cannot hold a mug for any length of
time. He was moved off incapacity benefit on to employment and support
allowance, and was then incorrectly put in the work-related activity
group on reduced
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:29:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000612" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0002.htm#13022775000612">The
husband’s benefit and that of his wife were reduced as he waited
for his appeal, which took eight months to come through. He won it,
then two days later he received another letter from Atos telling him to
go back for a work capability assessment. In the meantime, because the
couple’s income had dropped, they were forced to claim housing
benefit and received a letter telling them that they would be liable to
pay the bedroom tax in April. Luckily, the husband had won
his appeal after an eight-month wait, so he thought that that might
help but, on top of everything, his wife, who had worked in a manual
job, was diagnosed with myelopathy. She had hoped to retire this year,
but will now have to work another three years because of the
Government’s changes to women’s pensions. To cap it all,
this couple’s experiences with the work capability assessment
mean that they are now absolutely terrified of the personal

that figure is 46%, with the Department for Work and Pensions

1,794 of its tenants will be affected and Monmouthshire Housing

421 such tenants. What choices do those people face? They can move to a

to smaller social housing—to give an idea of the real impact in
my area—there are 4,220 people on the common housing register in
Newport and 2,500 in Monmouthshire. There is not enough social housing
available. For example, of those affected in Newport, 
<?notus-xml column=368?>916 will be looking for one-bedroom houses or flats, and 823 for
two-bedroom

total, Newport City Homes has only 1,264 one-bedroom properties and
2,600 two-bedroom properties. Today on the common housing register
website—Newport housing options—only 32 properties are
advertised. There are very few smaller properties. The point has been
made that whole estates in Wales have very few one or two-bedroom
properties. In the past we needed larger properties, so that is what
councils built. The scarcity of larger properties may be a problem in
big cities in England, but in Wales there is a scarcity of smaller
properties. There is simply nowhere to move to. As Community Housing

other option is to pay more. As the excellent report by the Bron Afon
housing association in Torfaen highlights—I hope that the
Minister has looked at it—many of those affected consider
themselves to be just surviving already. Many are like the man I met on
an estate last week, who said that he left the heating off until tea
time because the price of food was going up every week and he did not
want to go into debt. A family in the Bron Afon study, which surveyed
all its tenants, concluded that the only solution was to eat two fewer

because they are the homes in which they brought up their children,

have family ties and help with child care. These are their homes. In
Community Housing Cyrmu’s survey of people affected, 13% said
that they would consider downsizing, 8% that they might consider a
lodger and 79% that neither of those options was suitable and that they

There is an extra £30 million of discretionary
housing allowance, and my council has certainly seen a significant rise
in its discretionary amount. It has already put together a co-ordinated
action plan between the finance and housing departments. It has
contacted all potentially affected recipients and customers, and is
beginning to confirm their benefit details. It has set up a helpline to
discuss options to downsize. It is in direct contact with some of those
households. It is also in direct contact with some of the social
landlords to look at where there might be work that they could do. We
heard an interesting example earlier about how social landlords in
Liverpool had come together to try and pool their resources. There are
quite a lot of sensible things that local councils that are planning

the Opposition Benches, it is not a question of shroud-waving, as the
hon. Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison) suggested, but a
recognition of the people we see in our surgeries week in, week out.
The fear of this measure is such that people believe it to be a bedroom
tax, a cruel and counter-productive measure from a Government intent on
punishing the poor. It is cruel because it is likely to lead to more
evictions, homelessness, disruption and despair and because it takes no
account of people’s real circumstances—as we have heard
many times, more than two thirds of those affected are likely to be
people with disabilities—and it is counter-productive because it
is highly unlikely to lead to the outcomes that the Government claim to
want. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:57:41"></hs_TimeCode>Not only
are there insufficient smaller properties for families to move to, but
the measure is more likely to cost money than save it.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:57:49"></hs_TimeCode>Evictions are
not only hugely painful, but hugely costly, estimated at about
£10,000 a time.</hs_Para>

has been revealed in this debate, the truly cynical nature of the
proposal was revealed by the Government’s own impact assessment,
which made it clear that the projected savings will be made only if
tenants remain in their existing homes and make up the shortfall in
benefits themselves. In other words, the money that this measure is
supposed to raise will be raised only if the stated policy aim of
getting people to move house does not actually work. That is immensely
cynical. The truth is that many people are struggling in such desperate
circumstances that they simply cannot find the extra money to
pay.</hs_Para>

bottom line is that we have a major housing crisis, with nowhere near
enough affordable homes. In my own constituency, for example, more than
15,000 households are on Brighton and Hove’s waiting list, but
just 750 properties become available every year. It is successive
Governments who have caused this housing crisis, not the poor who
struggle to cope with it. It is not the fault of people who cannot get
a job, of disabled people, of people who share the care of their
children or of foster parents. The crucial problem—this is where
the fault lies—is the epic failure of both the Tories and new
Labour on council housing. The Tories pushed the decimation of the
stock with the right to buy, ignoring the right to rent, and new Labour
tweaked the enormous discounts but did not grasp the nettle and build
council housing. For example, in 2007-08, only 350 new council homes
were built. It is deeply unjust to penalise people who are struggling
at the bottom of a housing market over which they have little or no
control<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:59:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000683" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#13022775000683">Ministers
give blasé answers to serious parliamentary questions about this
nasty measure. They say, “Get a job, get a lodger or move
somewhere else.” They ignore the fact that, for many people,
those options are simply not possible. On average, five people are
chasing every vacancy—in some places, the figure is much
higher—so how are those jobs suddenly going to appear? As other
hon. Members have pointed out, the rooms in question are often too

suggested that social landlords might want to redefine a property as
having fewer rooms when the spare room is extremely small, but we know

the money for repairs and for servicing the debts they have for
building more stock.</hs_Para>

have not yet heard Ministers deny the existence of the acute housing
crisis, yet they conveniently attack the people who are facing the
worst end of it. They also overlook the cumulative impact of so many
cuts. In Brighton and Hove, practically every household affected by the
bedroom tax will also be affected by the Government-imposed cut to the
council tax benefit budget, and a good proportion of them will also be
hit by the changes to disability living allowance. Changes to the scope
of what is covered under legal aid from April will mean that benefit
issues will not be covered, so there will be less opportunity for
people to receive in-depth advice or to challenge decisions in
court.</hs_Para>

Brighton estimates that the total cost of an eviction process,

eviction. The Government say that it will not come to that, but they
are simply not in touch with reality. Of the 1,000 or so households
affected in Brighton and Hove, the majority are already struggling with
rent arrears of around £2 a week. Where on earth are they

are many reasons why what appears to the Government to be spare space

to find a small number of examples of people who genuinely have more
space than they need, but that does not justify the Government’s
crass blanket policy. The experts are saying that if we want to help
people into smaller properties, we should give them support,
sensitively, to find the right property. We should not force them out
with the threat of eviction.

that the right kind of properties often do not exist. I asked a
parliamentary question to find out whether the Government had carried
out an assessment of how many appropriate smaller properties existed.
They have not done any such assessment, because they do not care. Then,
when we put that argument to them, they will come back and tell us that
the discretionary housing payments are supposedly a magic wand that
will solve all problems. The pot of discretionary housing payment is

Brighton and Hove, for example, the projected housing benefit shortfall
has been modelled by the local authority as over £12 million,
including shortfall from cuts to local housing allowance, bedroom tax

policy that will lead to bad debts and eviction, and will dramatically
undermine the financial stability of the social housing model. If we

universal credit, we genuinely have a recipe for the end of social
housing. As landlords are faced with the lose-lose situation of either
accumulating bad debt as people simply cannot pay the tax, or facing
the even higher cost of debt collection and eviction, the long-term
future of social housing looks bleak. How unjust this will look in the

irresponsible, coming from this Government who have now led us into the

Labour Front-Bench team will say on this issue, but I have no
compunction about saying that it is absolutely right to borrow to
invest in affordable housing and in the kind of infrastructure that we
need in the 21st century. The idea that, as a Government, as a nation,
as a European Union of nations, the best way of addressing the deficit
is by everybody cutting spending and draining demand out of the economy
has been proved to be wrong over and over again. More and more
economists are saying that, too. I hope that, for the sake of us all,

lot of passion, which I can understand. People’s homes are very
important to them, and none of 
<?notus-xml column=379?>us wants to feel that the possession of our home is threatened or is
subject to high-handed control from above. The morality of the
argument, however, is not all on one side as the Opposition seem to
suggest it is. Indeed, I would find their moral outrage more convincing
if their Front-Bench team firmly pledged to repeal this measure if they
were ever returned to office. I would also find it more convincing if
when they were in office they had not taken the steps they did on
private sector rented accommodation, probably as a prelude to going
further.</hs_Para>

the basis of what the more moderate Opposition Members have said, they

free or subsidised accommodation is made available through the public

we have obligations to all those people who want that subsidised or
free accommodation but who cannot get it on the size and scale they
need. There are two different groups here, and we need to look after
the interests of both groups as best we

course there are visionaries on the Opposition side who say that the
answer is easy: we just need to build hundreds of thousands of more
homes at public expense so that everybody can have the accommodation
they want. The issue then becomes why that did not happen when we had a
Labour Government who knew how to do those things. The truth is that
for anyone who sits on the Government Benches, such housing will always
be a scarcer resource than people would like. If we offer something
free or subsidised, there will be more demand than provision, even when
we are trying to be very generous, so we must have rationing and
allocation. All Governments, in good times and bad times, have had to
allocate and ration public
housing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000703" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#13022775000703"><Member ContinuationText="Julie Hilling" PimsId="5581" UID="13022775001507" xid="1017" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#13022775001507"><B>Julie

Government did indeed honour their pledge—and that was many more
homes than the Labour Government were building each year—but,
even in those days, why did they need to do it? They needed to do it

under-occupation is a problem, and I think that the Government have
come up with one part of the answer, but I urge Ministers to listen
carefully to all those who are saying that the positive way of

people a better answer than the one they currently have, which may be a
larger property that may not be
suitable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000708" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#13022775000708">The
Government have excluded everyone of pension age from the proposals,
and I welcome that. I think that it is smart politics, and very
sensitive to the elderly population. However, in my constituency, where
most people own their homes—elderly people tend to own them
without mortgages, and younger people tend to own them with rather big
and difficult mortgages—a good many elderly residents decide to
sell the family home because it has become too big and unmanageable,
and to buy a smaller property such as a flat or bungalow. Many then
sell again when they are becoming more frail, and move to
semi-sheltered or supported accommodation.</hs_Para>

natural process of trading down in the private sector, but there is
sometimes too much of an obstacle for elderly people in social housing
to be able to do the same. Perhaps not enough of the right properties
are available; perhaps they are not offered in the right way; perhaps
there should be some incentive. I think it perfectly acceptable to try
to create an atmosphere in which there can be the same sensible
mobility in public sector housing as occurs naturally in areas with
rather more private sector housing, so that elderly people can have
housing more suited to their needs.</hs_Para>

Ministers will consider the question of elderly under-occupation, which
I think is very much part of the story, but will do so in a positive
way that encourages, promotes and helps, rather than removing benefit
or imposing a tax. I wish that the Opposition understood the meaning of
the word “tax”. Imposing a tax means taking money from
people who are earning it for themselves; it does not mean paying them
less benefit. I hope that Ministers will work out an answer to that
soundbite. I have heard soundbite arguments before, but I congratulate
the Labour party on thinking up a brilliant and misleading one. I am
afraid that it is better than the soundbites we have heard so far from
this side of the House, and I urge my hon. Friends to come up with a
soundbite that represents the truth. This is not a bedroom tax, but a
reduction in the amount of benefit paid, which is very
different.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000711" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#13022775000711"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13022775001511" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#13022775001511">Several

and I think we all feel a little nervous about how far we should go. I

be the aim. Why would somebody move if their new home is going to be
worse than their current one? If it can be shown that there would be
better, more appropriate and better supported accommodation, however, I
might be more willing to accept that we should follow the proposed

next topic is how to tackle the problems of insufficient housing and
excess welfare spending. The issue of eligibility is key. My
constituents tell me that they feel much more inclined to pay taxes to
make sure that people who have been settled in this country for many
years, or who have been born and brought up here, can get access to
proper housing than to provide housing for people who have only just
arrived and seem to know how to work the system to get access to
housing. The Government could productively focus on that. I am sure
there will be European Union rules, but we need to negotiate on this
with our European partners, and make a stand if necessary, because
there is a strong feeling in our country that public housing will be
limited—more limited than some would like—and if we are
to make choices, the priority must be those who have been here for some
time and who have made a contribution 
<?notus-xml column=382?>and are part of our settled community. That does not always seem to be
the case. I hope Ministers will see the issue of eligibility as a

are difficult waters. Anyone who looks at the situation rationally will
agree that there is under-occupation and we need to tackle it
sensitively. They will also agree that we need more housing provision
overall, and we need to do what we can to tackle that. I hope we can
all agree that the best answer is to find a way to enable more people
to enjoy what every MP takes for granted. We take it for granted that
we have a well-paid job and that we can afford to buy a house. I think
that every MP owns a property. Indeed, some of them own rather more
than one property, I believe, and that has sometimes become a matter of
comment. It is normal for an MP to own a property—to be an
owner-occupier—and to enjoy a good income, and I am sure most
MPs own a spare room or two.</hs_Para>

Hosie</B> (Dundee East) (SNP):</Member> I have been struck by a number
of things said by Government Members today. First, I noted the
mechanical usage of the almost robotic mantras of, “1 million
spare rooms”, “under-occupancy” and
“utilisation” and an almost 
<?notus-xml column=383?>frighteningly casual disregard of the fact that they were talking about
people’s family homes. These are places where people have
brought up children and may have lived for decades, and, as a result,
have created the stable, safe and supportive communities we all want to
see. Those are now to be torn asunder for the sake of a money-saving
measure—that is what it is—which will not work. The
extraordinary thing is that the bedroom tax works only if the policy
fails. If everybody could move to what the Government consider to be a
“properly sized property”, the housing benefit costs
would probably be identical to what they are today—not one penny
would be saved. The tax will work only if people cannot move and they
give the Government this extra money, over and above what they already
pay to stay in their family

more facts and less scaremongering. That is very sensible; I am all in
favour of evidence-based policy making. What he and others have then
done is to say that a discretionary payments system is available to
help. That confirms that those who live in specially adapted accessible
housing are not exempt and that foster carer families are not
automatically exempt. By asking for more facts and less scaremongering,
and then talking about discretionary payments, which, by their nature,
may not be available, particularly if the pot runs out, these people

Greatrex:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is making an important point
about the discretionary nature of this policy, particularly in relation
to foster parents. I have been contacted by a foster parent who was
contacted by their housing association to say that rooms where people
are cared for are counted as spare rooms, but they did not know
anything about the existence of the discretionary payment. Such people
are reliant on at least two or three levels of communication to get the
discretionary payment, so surely it would be much better if foster
parents were completely

meanwhile—until that happens—communication should of
course be better and foster carer families should be encouraged to
apply now, in advance, if that is possible. He rightly says that this
policy should simply be scrapped because it will not work and, as far
as I can see, it is only punitive. That is certainly also the view of
the Scottish Government, who feel that it will have an appalling impact
on families throughout Scotland and, indeed, the rest of the
UK.</hs_Para>

know that the Minister for Housing and Welfare in the Scottish
Government has warned the UK Government of the impact of this change.
The Scottish Government have highlighted to the Government the
disproportionate effect on disabled people and have asked them to
rethink their policy. We understood before the start of the debate that
the Secretary of State had instructed a rethink on part of the policy,

£20 a week, or more than £1,000 a year. They could be
£2,000 down before the Government’s review reports back
and says that those rooms are not really spare at all, because one of
the sons is serving in Afghanistan. Alternatively, he will not be able
to come back to the family home because they will have been forced to
move. That is the kind of issue the Government are failing to take into
consideration—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> The Minister
is still muttering, but he will not get to his feet to say anything. I
am sure that when he was at university, he was more than happy to go
home to his family house. Why should working-class children whose
houses are part-funded by housing benefit not be able to go back to

groups are affected, of course, such as tenants who are willing to move
to smaller properties and are waiting for one to become available, but
who will lose out in the meantime; the parents of foster children; and
parents who live separately and look after their children. The final
category concerns me greatly. I have already been contacted by a
constituent—one of many. He is separated from his wife, which is
sadly not uncommon, and has two daughters in their late teens. This
gentleman is so careful that he does not switch the heating on in his
very modest apartment unless there are guests. He counts every

I said earlier, not only disabled people but many others will be forced

is that of a woman—a pensioner who will not herself be
affected—who cares for her severely disabled adult son. He lives
in his own apartment, which has two bedrooms. That is not his fault; it
is the one he was allocated. He has a severe psychological condition
and needs to be cared for every day, and his mother carries out those
caring responsibilities. If he is forced to move, the trauma will be
extraordinary. If he manages to get through that, the fact that his
mother has medical conditions of her own means she will be unable to
carry out her caring responsibilities if her son is forced to move even
a few streets away.

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) put it rightly when he
said that we have to think about our constituents who want social
housing because they have a family and need an extra bedroom, but whom
we cannot help because there is a house being lived in by one person,
who has too many rooms, and there is no pressure on that person to
move. We hear a lot from Opposition Members about fairness for one side
of the equation, but nothing about fairness for the other side, which
is avoided and cast aside. When housing is controlled by the state, we
must be fair to everybody, whichever side of the equation they are on.
There are those who have large families, live in small accommodation,
or are living in the private rented sector, and cannot get into social
housing or council housing because of the problem of under-occupancy,
which, we have discovered from the Government, amounts to 1 million
bedrooms. Just think how many of our constituents could have better
housing if only those bedrooms were freed up.</hs_Para>

Government’s position is also measured, because they have put in
discretionary powers to look after people who will be in particularly
difficult circumstances. 
<?notus-xml column=387?>Discretion is very important; the Government have got that spot on. If
we were to say that every house that had been adapted in any way for a
disabled person were to be exempt, we would find that a property with a
little ramp, or one handrail, was suddenly exempt, and the whole policy
would be removed. By applying discretion, however, we get the
overwhelming majority of the benefit of the policy, without putting a
heavy burden on that small number of people who genuinely ought to be
exempt and protected. The same applies to the £5
million that has been made available to families who foster. If
fostering had a general exemption, everybody in receipt of social
housing benefit would suddenly go off to the council and say that they
wanted to be on the fostering lists, so that they would not have to
give up their extra bedroom, but would then refuse any child who was
sent to them. If broad exemptions are used, people will try to fit the
categories of exemption provided, whereas using discretion ensures that
people must bring forward a reasonable case to encourage those who have
the discretion to accept that they ought to be allowed to receive the
extra funding to maintain their current position.</hs_Para>

in the three or four-bedroom property might move back into the private
rented sector, which has a higher cost, but there would be a bigger
saving because the other person had moved into the social rented

the inflexibility of the housing market. It has been said, for example,
that there are not enough one-bedroom properties in the social rented
sector for people to move down to, but there are plenty of properties
across the country as a whole. People will move more freely between the
private and public rented sectors and will continue to have their rents

pockets of individuals and communities. We all know that there are
communities in which significant numbers of people are reliant on the
benefits system, whether they work or not. They work and live in areas
with low-wage economies, such as North Ayrshire and Arran, which has a
glorious industrial past. In the 1970s, 14,000 people were employed at

On the face of it, the Government’s proposals sound logical.
There are apparently 1 million bedrooms going spare in this country.
The argument is that people should not be able to carry on living in
homes that have too many bedrooms, but should be moved to smaller
homes. That sounds sensible and practical, but it does not reflect the
reality on the ground. Few homes fall into the category of a two or
three-bedroom house that is lived in by a healthy, fit person but is
under-occupied. Most of the so-called spare bedrooms are needed by the

discretionary issues and other ways that 
<?notus-xml column=393?>the bedroom tax will impact on people. At the moment, this is a
compulsory scheme and a matter of law so if people have a spare
bedroom, they will end up paying money unless they can argue for
discretionary help. As has been said, on 1 April people will be faced
with a choice of what happens and will end up with bills. They will
then have to go to their local housing association or council and see
whether they fit the criteria required to get some help. If they do not

Will more money be put into the fund so that people continue to benefit
from it? Instead of a statutory scheme, would it not be better to work
with councils and housing associations to try first and foremost to
work out whether housing need can be reorganised and people placed in
the homes that are appropriate for them? At the end of that process
there may be some people who wilfully do not want to move, some who
live in a massive home or there may be a single person of good mental
and physical health living in a two or three-bedroom house and they

this is an unusual idea, but the way to tackle the problem is to
consider a home-building programme. It is all very well hon. Members
saying that one Government did not do that, another Government sold
council houses and another should have done more, but we are where we
are now. Instead of looking back at what could have happened five, 10
or 20 years ago, why not deal with our current problem of acute housing
shortage? Doing that will not involve subsidised housing because, as
everybody knows, the cost of building a house on a piece of land is not
as much as the value of the property once it is put up for sale. Bricks
and mortar do not cost as much as a house, the value of which can be
over-inflated. When groups of people or associations and voluntary
bodies get together and start building homes, they can pay for those
houses so that the Government or state do not have to subsidise them.
We must encourage local authorities and such groups to invest and allow
house-building programmes to provide housing and help to regenerate the
economy.</hs_Para>

is a multitude of reasons for that, but by far, one key factor is the

by an average of 37% compared with

increase by an incredible 35% in the next six years. More and more
employed people will become eligible for housing benefit. Indeed, last
summer, the housing benefit claimant count surpassed the five million
mark for the first time, which means that around 20% of households are
claiming the benefit to help them meet their housing costs. Between
January 2010 and December 2011, the total number of housing benefit
claimants increased by 301,000. In the same period, the number of
non-passported claims—those in employment—increased by
279,000. Therefore, households in employment account for 92.8% of the
overall increase in housing benefit claimants. Unless we are able to
ensure that the pace of rent increases broadly reflects incomes, then

There are solutions for dealing with the housing benefit bill without
resorting to the sort of initiatives preferred by the current UK
Government that are having such a detrimental social impact. In 2004,
the Government of the Republic of Ireland introduced the Residential
Tenancies Act. A private residential tenancy board was set up to
deliver reforms. Its aim was to regulate the private rented sector by
extending the length of tenancy towards a more European model, clearly
defining rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants,
providing access to inexpensive dispute resolution, safeguarding bond
payments and, crucially, capping rents.</hs_Para>

placing a cap on rents and driving down artificially high rental costs,
the Government would have direct control over their housing benefit
bill. The UK Government could then reduce their liabilities without
penalising some of the most vulnerable people in society. It would also
mean that working people would have a better chance of affording rent
costs in affluent areas. Rent caps have been a fixture in New York
since the 1940s, and New York is the home of global capitalism. Rather
than targeting social housing tenants, the UK Government, and devolved

months and compared with children in the bottom 25% of cognitive
ability from upper middle class backgrounds, we see that the upper
middle class children will have overtaken the working class children by
the age of 10. That is a result of speech, language and communication
issues. I suggest that the dislocation of working class families and
communities that these housing benefit changes will cause, through the
eviction of parents because their children have grown up, is

children. Their children grow up and perhaps go to university or get
married, and we end up with the couple in an under-occupied house. What
happens then? They die, and we recycle those houses. It is no surprise

Government want people to get some training, get a job and get some
stability. Well, that is absolutely ridiculous. The social, economic
and practical impacts of the measures are completely unthought out. The
reason is that the Government do not care, and they do not care because
they think that those people do not vote. Why is it that people over 60
are excluded from the list? It is because they vote. What does that

their rent by the margin that is being cut. If I am in the local
authority with a portfolio of two or three-bedroom houses, but with
hardly any one-bedroom ones, I will say to the people that are not
paying all their rent, “We will evict you, but we do not have
any one-bedroom houses”. They will go to the private rented
sector where the rents are higher and are escalated by the pressure on
the market, and that will cost me more as a manager. What is more, as
more people join the private rented sector, others in that sector will
pay higher rents, so it will be difficult for people to build up a

to me from conversations with more than one set of foster parents in my

payments, and that people find out about them only by dint of good luck
and interventions of other kinds. I am well aware that the constituents
who come to me may be just scratching the surface, and that there are
likely to be many others in a similar position who do not visit their

that time she has fostered more than 50 children, sometimes on
long-term placements—a couple who are with her at present have
been there for a number of years—but sometimes on shorter
placements. Sometimes there is a gap. She was recently told by her
housing association—her social landlord—that she had
three spare rooms. She does not. She has three bedrooms in her
property, which are used to provide care for children who would
probably cost the taxpayer even more otherwise, and would probably be
receiving a less constant form of social care. She is providing that
care because it is something that society wants and values. Only this

discretionary. That means that they may or may not be applied. That

gone. That means that it is added to a bigger fund to deal with a whole
range of different circumstances, and there is no 
<?notus-xml column=402?>guarantee that it will be sufficient. My constituent lives almost on the
border of two local authority areas; she fosters for one local
authority and lives in another. She is fortunate in that she contacted
me and I was able to join things up, but we do not know that that will
happen in many cases. All those points make the case for foster parents

out again they would think again about whether to foster. They have

If such people are to be put off because of this imposition, and
because they will be caught up in a payment that is discretionary, that
will send a poor signal to society in general. I implore the Minister

with to buy their food after 1 April. That figure of £18 is
entirely based on the experiences of my constituents, in particular
women on employment and support allowance who are about the same age as
me, but who had to stop working owing to chronic health conditions,
perhaps after 20 years of working life. Out of their £71.70,
they have to find £10 for electricity, £20 for
heating—gas or coal—£6 for water rates, £4
for bus fares in the case of those who live in villages and have to get
to the main town, and £10 for the bedroom tax, which left them

Research has shown over and over again that people see it as a
transitional part of their life—they use it when they are
younger and they hope to move on. It is true that in the past few years
it has become more difficult for people to move on—it is
difficult to get a mortgage and move into the owner-occupied sector,
and there is a shortage of social rented housing. Nevertheless, people
do not see the private rented sector as a long-term home.</hs_Para>

social rented sector provides long-term, low-rent homes. The people who

that work. The people who will be affected will often have lived in
those houses for many years. Some have compared this situation with the

My hon. Friend comes from Edinburgh, as I do, and he will know that the
problem is not always about hard-to-let areas. As far back as the
1980s, single people in Edinburgh have been housed in two-bedroom
houses in some circumstances. That is partly to do with the nature of
the stock, as there are not enough one-bedroom houses to match the
number of people, and it also acknowledges the fact that
people’s lives are not static.</hs_Para>

have heard a lot from the Government about dynamic benefits, but
people’s lives are pretty dynamic and they change. The single
person housed in a two-bedroom house might well have a child. If we
insist that they can never be in a two-bedroom house, they might have
to move later. The same happens in reverse, as people’s families
do not stay static. Even grown-up children, as many of us know, do not
necessarily simply go and stay gone. They take a job and move away, but
the job or relationship might not work out and they come back. Families
also want to visit. Part of this change is about saying to the not very
well-off, “You cannot have the normal elements of family life;
we are not going to let you.”</hs_Para>

many hon. Members have said, if people move to the private rented
sector, the housing benefit bill may actually increase. In Edinburgh,
the local housing allowance, which is not especially generous, is
£114 for a one-bedroom house. Some of my constituents have asked
me about moving into the private rented sector. If they move from their
two-bedroom council house, for which the rent is £91 a week,
into a private rented property, it will cost more. Rather than a
saving, there will be an increase in

around in big houses with three or four bedrooms. We are asked,
“Doesn’t that seem unfair? Why shouldn’t they move

this tax are not living in especially big houses. It is suggested that
people take in a lodger. I visited a constituent—a woman in her
50s who is on ESA, although she has always worked previously. Her home
has two bedrooms, although the second is pretty small, and the kitchen
is off the living room. Having a lodger is not just about having
someone in the spare bedroom; it involves sharing all those quite small
facilities with somebody else. While my constituent is sitting in the
living room, perhaps enjoying watching television or whatever she
enjoys doing in the evening, the lodger will come through the room, go
into the kitchen, make a cup a tea and come out again. Hon. Members

we are seeing a substantial reduction in the building of affordable
homes. In Scotland, the number of such homes was boosted briefly, but
it has gone down from 7,900 two years ago to only 3,400 this year. Some
of those homes are for mid market rent, which has its role but is
expensive, so it could lead to higher housing benefit payments. The
outcome of more mid market rent housing is similar to what is happening
in England. We have heard people on the Government Benches saying that
the Government will ensure that more affordable houses are built, but I
thought they had made it clear that those so-called affordable houses
were going to be at up to 80% of market rent, which is expensive. In
Edinburgh, a council one-bedroom property is £275 per month, but
a mid market one-bedroom property is currently being advertised at
£439 per month. Mid market is no substitute for low-cost

that they need. It is no use saying to them, “You can apply for
a discretionary housing payment.” In a Westminster Hall debate
recently, the Minister said that discretionary housing payments might
have to become permanent in such cases, but that couple will still have
to apply every year, and will have uncertainty, and that is not fair to

rented from registered social landlords, and 65% are within the age
range that is subject to the bedroom tax. The vast majority receive
between £25 and £100 a week in local housing allowance to

the test of promoting economic growth. Indeed, by diminishing demand
among people who will spend the money, the least well-off, they will
have a deeply contractionary effect. Keynes’s paradox of thrift
will 
<?notus-xml column=409?>sadly become a death knell for local shops across the country as people

assessment on these changes also reveals the truth: if people are able
to change their behaviour, as the Minister vainly hopes they will,
these plans will save little or no money for the Exchequer. His other
policies to cut the benefits bill are failing, because unemployment is
340,000 higher than the OBR predicted in 2010 and living standards are
falling in a low-growth economy. He can generate the savings he is
seeking with this policy only if people cannot move or work longer

these proposals are a byword for absurdity. The Minister believes that
people can simply uproot themselves from homes they have lived in for
three decades or more, and from friends, family and jobs, to go and
live in parts of the country where there are smaller houses and perhaps
fewer opportunities to work. He says that alternatively, people should
take in a lodger—a step that is actively discouraged in the
registered social housing sector in Scotland, where stock is allocated
on the basis of need. The sheer absurdity is further heightened by his
refusal to admit until this afternoon that his plans will potentially
remove money from up to 96,000 members of the armed forces, nearly
8,000 Army trainees, carers and foster parents in Glasgow, while nearly

there is a lack of available properties for people to move into. Some

because there are no one-bedroom properties in their areas. According
to Glasgow Housing Association, there is a waiting list of 13,000 in
Glasgow for one-bedroom properties because housing associations, and
the council before them, responded to local housing demand by building
homes with two or more bedrooms. With a social housing shortfall of
156,000 properties for Scotland’s housing needs, there is no way
the required properties could be built so that people can avoid
destitution through having to pay this tax from April.</hs_Para>

£1.4 million for the adaptation of new homes for the

Members like to throw out the accusation that the previous Labour
Government introduced the same policy for the private rented sector
with the local housing allowance, but they should stop listening to
their own spin. The LHA was tested for four years before it was
introduced and did not apply to existing tenants but just to new
claimants or people moving house. It did not specify how many bedrooms
people should have, but allocated a sum of money based on the median
rent for properties of the relevant size. Therefore, if a family found
a house with more space for a lower rent, they could move in.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:20:27"></hs_TimeCode>The size of the

nature of the Government’s policy. A family with two children

one-bedroom home, but what about if one child wants to come home?

those who will receive discretionary treatment. They have often been

families who need them, but that cannot be done overnight. People have
sometimes had to accept those homes because they are the only ones
available. In recent years, housing associations have built one and
two-bedroom properties, and Carmarthenshire county council, my local
authority, is building some small bungalows, but they are already in
great demand, and there is no way that local authorities can suddenly
build enough new properties to accommodate all those who will be

even without incentives, many people want to downsize when their

us look at the reality of what will happen. Let us be clear: people on
low incomes just do not have extra money to cover the extra rent. As is
explained in the House of Commons briefing, the amount of money that
people receive in benefits has never been based exactly on need. There
has always been a compromise between need and what could attract
political support, but the fact remains that people on benefits live on
scarcely enough to cover basic needs. There is already a massive
squeeze on household budgets, with relentless price rises for essential
items such as food, energy bills and bus fares. Those on the lowest
incomes suffer the most, because they have no spare cash and have
already cut back on anything that is not
essential.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000933" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#13022775000933">Many
people will try to stay where they are to avoid disruption to their
family and their children’s schooling, or the increased bus
fares they would have to pay if they moved away. They will desperately
try to pay the additional rent from their meagre budgets. That will
mean people turning off heating and cutting back on food, and trying
their utmost not to spend anything extra. However, 
<?notus-xml column=416?>the chances are that, despite their best efforts to keep their secured
council house tenancy, because they value that and realise how
difficult life is in the private sector, where they are pushed from
pillar to post, they are likely to fall into arrears. That will have a
negative impact on council housing and housing association budgets and
cash flows, and leave less money for maintenance and new
build.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022775000934" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#13022775000934">Once
a family falls into arrears, their problems will spiral. They will be
prey to loan sharks as they try to make ends meet. What happens if they
are evicted? The council will have to re-house them. They could end up

would be more expensive than the amount saved by imposing a bedroom tax
on the extra room in their house. The trouble is that some private

some, the new rules will reduce their existing housing benefit by

afford that, they will have to find a new house. The scenario I would
like to put to the Minister is this: a divorced mother has two
children, a son of nine and a daughter of eight. The new rules say that
the children can share a bedroom and the family therefore have to
downsize their home. However, that will apply for only a year because
the children will no longer have to share when they are 10 and nine,
and the rules state that they will then need an extra bedroom. Would it
be economical to expect the household to move, or will the housing
benefit section have the discretion to waive this tax in those
circumstances? How far does this discretion extend? Does it allow for
the disabled couple who cannot sleep together and need a carer to sleep
in the house at times to help with their care needs? Are they expected

either morally or physically. We lambast absent fathers for not playing
an active role in their children’s upbringing. We then tell them
that they are not allowed to have a bedroom for their child to stay in
when they are trying to build a relationship through their visitation
rights. We tell people who are married and working, “We have no
houses for you in the housing executive, so you will need to rent
privately and we will help you with the payments.” We then say,
“Well, your private rented house is one bedroom too large, so we
won’t help you with this payment anymore, and we can’t
rehouse you so you can find a smaller home close enough for your child
to walk to school. As you have no car, there is nothing that can be
done for you.” Hon. Members—on both sides of the House,

their age, they are restricted in how much housing benefit they can

them to develop their quality of life, get a job and so on, is being
taken away from them.</hs_Para>

low-income families will be hit in the pocket. It is a tax on the poor.
It means less money available for food, groceries, school trips and
school uniforms, heating and transport. It is a policy of the madhouse

purpose. He also said, to some surprise, that these were Labour cuts. I
thought that it was the Conservative and Liberal parties that were in
government, and that Labour was in opposition, but there we are. That
is what he said. He also said that there was a spare room subsidy. We

I said, we have heard 26 speakers. However seductively the Minister
will present her arguments, it is clear to the House this afternoon
that the Government’s main aim is to cut the housing budget,
taking money from the pockets of some of those least able to afford it.
As has been said, two thirds of those affected are disabled or have
disabled partners, and I point out that half the people affected have
been tenants for 10 years or
more<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:47:25"></hs_TimeCode>.
Conservative Members are fond of complaining about crime and disorder
on estates. These longer-term tenants are the sort of people we want to
stay on estates to give leadership to the local communities, but they
are the people who will be moved on by this

has been mentioned, 46% of housing benefit claimants will be affected
in Wales compared with 31% for Great Britain in general, showing that
this is a particular problem for Wales. My own local authority of
Gwynedd is a case in point as 1,378 families will lose between
£8 and £24 a week. If they try to follow the
Government’s advice and move within the housing stock, they will
encounter difficulties, especially if they try to move into the private
sector. People wanting to move within the stock in Gwynedd will face
competition from the tourism industry, which has proper needs that
should be addressed by the local housing stock. In the city of Bangor,
the people wanting to move will be competing with many thousands of
students. What are they looking for? They are looking for one-bedroom
or two-bedroom properties—for small places. Those will be the
local effects stemming from this change.</hs_Para>

going to find the £700 to pay this penalty when they are not
able to move. I do not think that the Government have thought that
through; and if they have thought it through, they do not care. I can
tell the Minister that it is not just a matter of taking up a few hours
of extra work serving in a shop or working in a care home. Taking more
work is not a possibility when hundreds of people are chasing every
job, and when disabled people always come at the end of the queue when
the jobs are being handed

we should be charitable to the Government. They say that they are
introducing this change to improve occupancy, and—as the
Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Preseli
Pembrokeshire (Stephen Crabb), said this morning—to alleviate
homelessness. However, there are currently 19,000 homeless people in
Wales, and I think that this measure will merely add to that total.
Some people will say, “We will pay.” Some will say,
“We will do without, and we will pay.” Some will be

not be able to pay.”</hs_Para>

considerable lack of social homes, because very few have been built in
recent years. The Secretary of State has referred to a complete
collapse in the building of social housing under the last Government.
Housing benefit has doubled in the last 10 years. We all agree that we
will have to manage the bill for that, but how are we going to deal
with it? How are we going to find a solution to such a large problem?
We all probably agree, too, that fairness must be at the heart of that
solution: fairness to those who are in overcrowded homes, fairness to
those who are under-occupying, and fairness to the taxpayer.</hs_Para>

begin, however, with the removal of discrepancies in the rented sector
between those who are privately renting and those who are socially
renting. An arrangement whereby people living next door to each other
are renting under different systems is innately unfair, and must be
addressed. I think all Members will be pleased to hear that I shall be
taking Labour’s lead in this instance. Labour introduced the
local housing allowance for private sector tenants who did not receive
housing benefit for a spare bedroom, which seems a good point at which
to start. We are doing the same, in that we are introducing equality in
the system for everyone who is renting.</hs_Para>

issue that we must tackle is the problem of people who are living in
overcrowded accommodation. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State
said, a quarter of a million people are in that position. My hon.
Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg), my right

agree that we are talking about family homes. They are not just houses;
people have lived in them. That is why we have exempted those who are
above the state pension credit age. We recognise that pensioners would
be particularly affected by these changes. My hon. Friend the Member
for City of Chester (Stephen Mosley) reminded Labour Members what they
had repeated time and again. They must get a grip of the housing
benefit bill. They never managed to do that in government, but they
must do it if they are to be even a credible

discretionary housing payments, many Members raised specific issues and
complex cases. Specific groups 
<?notus-xml column=424?>were identified, such as foster carers and people who live in houses
with major disability adaptations. Rather than central Government
defining exactly what should happen in every case, we have allocated
the money we think is needed and given it to local authorities so they
can respond on a case-by-case basis. Such local discretion is right. We
might think that many different individuals should be exempt, but it
would be impossible to write that into regulations and statutory
instruments. That is why we have allocated discretionary housing
payments of £60 million this year and £155 million next
year to local authorities.</hs_Para>

most significant failings of the previous system for regulating
financial services was the lack of clear responsibility for financial
stability. It has been all too easy for the identification and
management of risks to financial stability to fall in the cracks
between what those organisations believed were their respective roles
in protecting and promoting stability in the financial sector. That
confusion was a key contributing factor to the emergence of the
financial crisis in 2007. None of the institutions involved was
effectively horizon-scanning to identify macro-prudential risks to
stability across the financial
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000579" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000579">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:19:51"></hs_TimeCode>
the light of those failings, the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended
by the Financial Services Act 2012, gave the Bank of England
clear responsibility for financial stability. To support that
objective, the Act creates a new committee of the Bank, the Financial
Policy Committee, with the role of identifying, monitoring and managing
systemic risks to the UK financial system. In order to carry out that
role, the FPC will need macro-prudential measures to mitigate the risks
to stability it identifies. The FPC will act through the regulators,
which work directly with financial
institutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:20:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000580" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000580">The
FPC will do that in two ways: first, through recommendations, which can
be made to the regulators, to industry, to the Treasury, within the
Bank and to other persons; and, secondly, through directions that can
be given to the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial
Conduct Authority. The FPC’s direction power is governed by the
measures set out in the order before the House. The regulators must
comply with a direction, but they will have discretion over its timing
and implementation
method.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000581" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000581">Before
discussing the measures that will be granted to the FPC, it is worth
noting that there is an international consensus on the need for
macro-prudential regulation. International regulations such as Basel
III and the capital requirements directive IV go some way towards
establishing minimum standards while retaining room for national
discretion, although areas such as the leverage ratio remain under
discussion. The UK strongly supports the ability of national
supervisors to exercise discretion where
appropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000582" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000582">In
February 2011 the Government and the Bank established an interim FPC to
undertake, as far as possible, the work of the statutory FPC ahead of
the passing of the relevant legislation. One of the tasks set for the
interim FPC was to analyse and recommend macro-prudential measures over
which the statutory FPC would have direction-making

Andrew Tyrie</B> (Chichester) (Con):</Member> The Minister has just
mentioned the leverage ratio. There are two crucial issues: first, the
leverage ratio should be firmly in the hands of the FPC, not the
Government; and, secondly, the UK should be able to act unilaterally,
rather than necessarily having to wait indefinitely for international
agreement—we should not move at the speed of the slowest.
Indeed, the United States demonstrates how necessary that is. Does the

Clark:</Member></B> As my hon. Friend knows, that has been a matter of
much debate in the Treasury Committee and the Banking Commission, both
of which he chairs. It is appropriate to have regard to the
international debate on this. There is a difference between the debate
on the leverage ratio and the two other tools that we will move on to
talk about, the sectoral capital requirements and the counter-cyclical
buffer, over which, it has been established internationally, there
should be domestic discretion. We are not at that stage with the

me discuss briefly the other macro-prudential tools that the Government
intend to give the FPC: the role of setting the UK’s
counter-cyclical capital buffer; and, as we have briefly discussed, the
power to intervene to limit leverage ratios. These are not covered by
the draft order, but it might be useful if I provide a bit of context
to the debate. The counter-cyclical capital buffer is part of the Basel
III agreement, and it will be implemented in Europe by the capital
requirements directive, commonly known as CRD 4. The directive aims to
ensure that banking sector capital requirements take account of the
macro-financial environment in which banks operate. It will be deployed
by national jurisdictions when excess aggregate credit growth is judged
to be associated with a build-up of system-wide risk to ensure that the
banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it against future
losses. Banks, building societies and larger investment firms will be
required to build up capital during upturns. This will help to increase
the resilience of the financial system and might also dampen the credit
cycle. Unwinding these requirements in the downturn once the threat has
passed might help to mitigate contractions in the supply of
lending.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000591" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000591">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:27:13"></hs_TimeCode>
is clear that with its macro-prudential focus, the FPC will be the body
best placed to determine the level of the counter-cyclical capital
buffer. This was supported by the results of the Government’s
consultation. As the counter-cyclical capital buffer is expected to be
provided for in CRD 4, on which discussions are continuing, the
simplest way to incorporate it into UK law is via regulations made
under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 to transpose
into UK law the provisions of CRD 4 which relate to the
counter-cyclical capital buffer.</hs_Para>

is vital that the FPC’s decisions in relation to the
counter-cyclical capital buffer should be subject to comparable
procedural and reporting requirements to the FPC’s other tools.
Therefore, in addition to the requirements imposed by the EU
legislation, the Government intend to ensure that the counter-cyclical
capital buffer will be subject to the same transparency requirements as
other FPC decisions, with a summary of the FPC’s discussions
when taking decisions on the buffer set out in the FPC’s meeting
records, and the FPC’s use of the buffer covered in the biannual
financial stability report. The Government will make any necessary
changes to achieve this in the regulations that incorporate CRD 4 into

tool for the FPC. The unweighted nature of the measure 
<?notus-xml column=433?>would guard against risk weights underestimating the true riskiness of

Firms’ leverage ratios were a useful indicator of failure during
the last crisis, and the period immediately preceding the crisis was
characterised by sharp increases in leverage. The Government strongly
support the inclusion of a backstop leverage ratio in the EU prudential
toolkit and consider it an essential measure to ensure that leverage
remains at sustainable levels. It is clear that there is some way to
go, but the review in 2017 will address that, and it will not be

Leslie</B> (Nottingham East) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> The jargon in this
order may deter not just members of the public but—dare I say
it?—hon. Members from rolling up their sleeves and getting
involved in this debate. I contend, however, that, in layman’s
turns, the order involves an incredibly important set of issues. We are
talking about giving the regulators of the unelected Bank of
England’s Financial Policy Committee incredible powers that will
enable them to tell people the level of deposit required for their home
loan purchase and, potentially at a moment’s notice, that
minimum repayments on their credit cards will need to rise from, for
example, 2% to 5%. They will also be able to tell businesses that loans
and overdrafts that they may have already arranged with their banks are
no longer feasible. We are talking about the significant potential
impacts that macro-prudential policy making could have downstream on
the economy and
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:32:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:32:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
As we have said many times, although prudential regulatory theory is
fine—it is difficult to disagree with the concept—the
practical reality and serious questions about how it will work merit
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:32:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000598" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000598">We
support the creation of the FPC at the Bank of England. An important
lesson from the global financial crisis is that we need better systemic
oversight, not just firm-by-firm regulation. We have to see the wood
for the trees. However, as was said last year during the passage of the
Financial Services Act 2012, questions linger about the FPC’s
accountability and the rationale  
<?notus-xml column=434?>behind the choices it will make. Asking very clever people to gaze into
a crystal ball and predict the economic future is a big thing for
Parliament to do. We are asking them to improve their foresight when
most people find it easier to draw conclusions in hindsight. There is,
therefore, a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of the Bank of
England and, of course, this provides a perfect vehicle for it to be
landed with the blame by politicians if things go wrong. Members of the
FPC will no doubt be well aware of those
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:33:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000599" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000599">As
the Minister has said, the order is relatively straightforward. It
gives the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is an arm of the Bank
of England, the power to make banks and investment firms increase their
capital holdings—in other words, their additional own
funds—in relation to their exposure to residential property,
commercial property or the financial sector. It will also give the PRA
the power to make those banks and investment firms treat exposures to
other financial services companies, residential property or commercial
property as riskier ventures than they might otherwise have
done—in other words, to raise the risk weightings on those
holdings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:34:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000600" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000600">It
was interesting to hear the Minister say that, after the consultation,
the Government changed things so that the PRA-regulated firms would be
those that are systemically important. That throws up a question that
has just occurred to me. I had assumed that all residential mortgage
loans and commercial transactions would be affected by a turn of the
dial by the FPC. As it turns out, the Minister is saying that only
transactions undertaken by systemically important organisations or the
larger banks will be affected. Will he tell the House what proportion
of residential and commercial transactions will not be affected if the
FPC decides to adjust the availability of finance in those sectors or
the capital requirements affecting those sectors? I assume that the
vast majority of the firms in those markets are systemically important,
but it would be interesting if the Minister gave a breakdown. If he
cannot tonight, I would be happy if his team wrote to me on that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:35:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000601">There
are other macro-prudential tools. The Minister mentioned the
counter-cyclical capital buffer. That is part of the Basel III

so forth. I want to ask him about some of the other macro-prudential
tools that were discussed in a long document by the
FPC.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000602" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000602">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:39:30"></hs_TimeCode>
am pretty sure that the Minister is saying that, by and large, the
sectoral capital requirements are those that are dealt with in the
order, but I am not entirely clear about that.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:36:49"></hs_TimeCode> one wanted to
be very theoretical about macro-prudential policy, one could argue that
history shows, whether through the South Sea bubble or the tulip boom,
what has happened to various sectors that nobody predicted would become
overheated. I do not necessarily see all sectors coming under the
potential purview of the FPC. I assume that the Government would simply
vest the FPC with other sectoral issues if they felt that there were
emerging pressures or credit bubbles in other sectors. It does not seem
that the Minister is today allowing the FPC to intervene across the

the Minister wants to wait until 2018 for that. He says that he hopes
there will not be slippage, but he has been around the European 
<?notus-xml column=435?>policy-making circuit for long enough to realise that a commitment to do
something in 2018 means that it may well not materialise until 2022 or
even later. One just has to look at the solvency II discussions, which
seem to be generational. I regret that the Government seem reluctant to
take a British approach to regulating on the leverage ratio. I do not
think that we should simply wait for Europe to determine such matters
for us. It would be better if the Minister gave a commitment that he
would at least consider including in the Financial Services (Banking

have a number of other points that I want to ask the Minister about
briefly. On the enforcement of prudential regulation, will he elaborate
on the penalties or disciplinary steps that the regulator will have at
its disposal if an investment firm or bank contravenes the imposed
requirements of the FPC? If we have a body that is making policy, we
must ask how it will be enforced. So far, a lot of the penalties in the
Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill seem to involve an individual
seeking redress through the civil courts, which seems quite weak. What
will happen if a bank steps across a
line<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000605" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000605">Members
will recall the debate that we had during the passage of the Financial
Services Act 2012 on the stability rules that the Government originally
proposed to give to the Bank of England. They wanted to emphasise
stability, which of course is vital, but they left out the importance
of getting the economy growing and creating jobs, especially when times
are tough or when there is a deflationary environment. Eventually, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to relent and an amendment was
inserted in the House of Lords to ensure that the FPC has regard to the
economic objectives of Government
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000606" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000606">Are
we in danger of repeating the same lopsidedness in the regulations, or
of an asymmetrical approach to attempts to control the heat of the
economy? The measures in the order specify that banks must hold
“additional” funds if lending to households or
businesses, with a view to slowing things down and taking the heat out
of the economy. That, of course, is a necessary part of the toolkit,
but what happens if things slow down too much and the economy needs
more lending to businesses and households, or more inter-bank and
financial services mutual investment? The order does not seem to
contain corresponding or parallel powers to dial things down, relieve
capital requirements or remove “additional own funds”
provisions if they prove in retrospect to have gone too far. Is that a
problem with the order? Should not the power be symmetrical? I would be
grateful if the Minister would consider that point.</hs_Para>

the specific requirements on residential or commercial investment

Treasury wanted the Bank of England to do the deed, but the Bank said
it was a political decision and wanted Ministers to make decisions
restricting LTV ratios. Will the Minister say where things currently
stand, because such things do matter? As Adrian Coles from the Building
Societies Association has rightly said, a change to the loan-to-value
ratio may not matter much to those wanting to get a foot on the
property ladder who have already got access to deep pockets or the bank
of mum and dad, as it is known, but rapid decisions to increase the
amount of deposit a home buyer needs will hit the least well off in

final two points are on geographical regulation and business lending.
Will the sectoral powers be available for the Bank of England to use
area by area, region by region, and locality by locality? In other
words, will the Bank be able, or is it seeking, to take heat out of
certain geographical housing markets and not others? I do not advocate
this, but if it so wished could the Bank use these powers to make it
harder to buy a house in London than in Cornwall, or vice versa? Will

to the House. First, I object to the statutory instrument on a matter
of principle, which I will outline. Secondly, I want to ask the

commercial, and, obviously, investment and financial

I object to how we are dealing with discussion, debate and decisions on
the macro-prudential tools. I have constantly raised the matter in the
Treasury Committee and the Independent Commission on Banking, and I
have raised it on the Floor of the House with the Chancellor. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:45:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) said, these can be seen
as boring matters, but it is accepted that they could lead to decisions
that affect the standard of living of many of our constituents; affect
the future of industries such as the construction industry; and affect
the economy. The decisions will be taken by non-elected individuals and
tonight appears to be the House’s only opportunity to debate and
challenge the
measures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000615" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000615">The
matter is being dealt with by statutory instrument. In other words, we
have 90 minutes to discuss the measures and cannot amend them. We can
only vote against the whole measure if we disagree with it or feel
strongly about any part of it. The measures are proposed by the
Government. If Opposition Members have strong feelings, they have only
one chance to influence the decision, and they must turn down the whole
order. That is a nonsensical
procedure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000616" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000616">I
have raised the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the
Chamber. He indicated that he understood the measure’s
sensitivity and importance and that he had an open mind. He accepted
that the usual channels would deal with it. I pay tribute to him for
placing the order on the Chamber’s agenda rather than dealing
with it upstairs in Committee in the normal way. That is a step
forward. The FPC is made up of unelected individuals, but they set
policy, so the statutory instrument is a pretty disgraceful way to deal
with the matter. Statutory instruments and secondary legislation are
not supposed to deal with policy or principle—they deal with
measures that need to be adjusted as time passes. They are not a way to
decide things of such
importance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000617" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000617">The
Treasury Committee raised the matter with the Minister when they
discussed macro-economics. He seemed to accept what we said and I have
a quote if he challenges me. However, his approach to the

Treasury Committee yesterday heard evidence from the Monetary Policy
Committee, including officers and non-executives from the Bank of

Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), and see the

so-called independent bodies to accept the sensitivity of some of their
decisions. It is an impossible task. The bodies shelter under their
independence. Both Chancellors have experienced this, and if they want
bodies to do something they feel is necessary, the issue of
independence is thrown back in their face: “You gave us
independence and therefore you should not interfere”. I am
worried about this issue, which is why I am taking the opportunity to
put it on the

residential matters, to which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:50:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham East referred, one of the macro-prudential
tools discussed in the Financial Policy 
<?notus-xml column=438?>Committee and dropped was loan-to-value mortgages. Most of us were
pleased when that was dropped, but it was a runner and was being
discussed in Financial Services Authority circles for some 18 months. I
am certain, from watching the industry, that that had a great effect on
the industry’s decisions—it was trying to second-guess
the FSA. The business of 90% and 80% mortgages had a
devastating effect on individuals and couples who were trying to buy a
house and begin family life. They were unable to take that step because
the regulator was signalling to the regulated that they should be going
in the direction of 90% and 80% at a time when the economy was dying
for the construction industry to pick up and start building houses,
which would have had a roll-on effect of people buying
carpets, furniture, curtains and so on. The regulator was
conditioning the decisions and behaviour of the
regulated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:52:19"></hs_TimeCode>—it

a higher level, we are going through this business with the Monetary
Policy Committee. As someone said—maybe in a crowded House this
might have an effect—when an individual or a couple cannot get a
mortgage, they do not blame the
building society. When the building societies say it is the
Monetary Policy Committee, they come to see us and we say it
is the Monetary Policy Committee. The ordinary person in the street
will ask, “Who set up the Monetary Policy Committee? Who is it
answerable to?” It is answerable to us, but it is not really
answerable to us because there is no real opportunity to make things
happen. A yearly remit from the Chancellor is hardly a procedure for
democratic accountability, and we are prevented from dealing with these
matters on the Floor of the House in order to indicate our displeasure
and unhappiness. I see

am—probably more than I am—to see houses being built and
sold and the whole procedure started. There is no question of any
systemic risk in the foreseeable future. Even when the problems were at
their worst, there was no systemic risk, just an industry with
problems. I accept that some banks that had over-extended on their
loans had real problems. I accept the point about the commercial side
and the likes of RBS and HBOS—it was on a greater scale and of
greater concern than on the residential side—and the point about
investment and financial houses. However, for the MPC to start
worrying—in shades of the FSA—about systemic risk in the

made some thoughtful points about the House’s ability to
scrutinise the powers that will be available to the FPC, particularly
those relating to residential mortgages. Their comments went to the
heart of the dilemma behind the setting up of these institutions and
powers. The purpose of macro-prudential policy is—to adopt the
analogy often used—to take the punch bowl away from the party
just when the guests are getting over-exuberant. For the first time,
there will be a group of people with the explicit task of monitoring
conditions and taking a considered view of what is in the interests of
financial stability but which might not be at the forefront of the
minds of the people participating, either as practitioners, commercial
players or politicians.</hs_Para>

particular measures that could be debated. The hon. Gentleman has
anticipated one 
<?notus-xml column=440?>such possibility. He was correct in suggesting that, if we had been
proposing a power over the loan-to-value rate, the House would have

secondary objective of the Financial Policy Committee has been
mentioned. Through the scrutiny of the House and of the hon.

means that the FPC’s duty to support the court of the Bank of
England in achieving its financial stability objective is subject to
supporting the policy of Her Majesty’s Government, including
their objectives for growth and employment. That is significant. That
power is there for a reason, and we expect it to be used. It requires
the Chancellor of the day to write annually to the FPC to set out what
he expects it to have regard to in making its decisions. The House will
have the ability through that mechanism to scrutinise and take a view
on whether Ministers—in this case, the Chancellor—are
giving the right directions to the Committee in terms of what it should

is worth noting that the measures we are talking about relate to

It has been pointed out that all these matters have a bearing on our

recent financial crisis—and, indeed, of financial crises around
the world—would note that housing bubbles are often associated
with the kind of over-exuberance and excess that contributes to
financial instability, which the arrangements that we have in place are
designed to address. It is appropriate for the powers to be there.

loan-to-value powers, which is not part of the proposals. It is no part

me deal with some points raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:05:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Nottingham East. He forcefully made the point that we need an
explanation from the Financial Policy Committee of why it is using its
powers. This should not take place in a vacuum or in secret. I
completely agree, and this is provided for in the Financial Services
Act, as the hon. Gentleman, a veteran of the Committee, knows. Section
95 requires the FPC to give an explanation of the reasons for its use
of direction powers, and the explanation needs to be published in the
financial stability report and it needs to account to Parliament for
its use of the powers.</hs_Para>

me pick up one of the hon. Gentleman’s earlier points, which was
not quite right. He mentioned credit card repayments, for example. The
powers provided for in the statutory instrument do not go into that
level of detail, and the FPC will not have those powers and they are
certainly not in this order—and neither are the loan-to-value
powers available.</hs_Para>

secondary objective addresses the hon. Gentleman’s point about
the necessary symmetry of these arrangements. Macro-prudential
regulation is certainly about damping down excessive exuberance when it
takes place, but on the other side of the cycle, by retreating from
some of the provisions by varying requirements downwards, it also has
the power to reverse the dampening of those
sectors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:07:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:07:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000638" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000638"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Leslie" PimsId="1471" UID="130227101001254" xid="354" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101001254">Chris

PRA, in the form of regulatory sanctions, constrictions on

hon. Gentleman raised a geographical point, asking whether the sectoral
powers could be used to specify a particular area. The answer is that
they could, if there were evidence of a particular problem in a
particular area. However, as he will recall, there is a general
requirement for the FPC to act proportionately, and one of the
principles that has been agreed is that it should not become involved
in the micro-management of these matters or in close detail. I consider
it unlikely that it would make recommendations on a narrow geographical

properly enforced. She is right to highlight the key importance of
enforcement. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:31:51"></hs_TimeCode>It
is important to make it clear that because of rulings by the European

wholeheartedly agree with him. Under current consumer protection
regulations, it is a criminal offence to present false information and
deliberately mislead consumers. The key test is whether the information
encourages consumers to make a purchasing choice that they would
otherwise not have made, and it includes misleading or false
information on the origin of goods, however it is provided. That law

Members to speak to their local trading standards teams. I know that
the council in Stoke-on-Trent is run by the hon. Gentleman’s
Labour colleagues, who, I am sure, will be willing to listen
attentively to his representations on the matter. I urge him to take up
the matter with them, as they have powers to deal with misleading
information that encourages consumers to make a different decision on

the issue of the misleading of consumers, it is important to understand
what matters to the consumer. In a Eurobarometer survey in autumn 2010,
75% of people questioned said that origin did not affect their
purchasing of textiles and clothing; for electronic products, the
figure was 68%. I am not sure whether ceramics were included in that
study. We need to be clear about how consumers prioritise different
pieces of information in their buying behaviour: price, design, brand
name and origin. In making any purchasing decision, consumers will
consider a variety of such factors. Of course, it is true that some
consumers are very concerned to ensure that they support British or
locally made products and will want information on their
origin.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000699"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:39:47"></hs_TimeCode>I
will turn briefly to the European Commission’s 2005 proposal for
a regulation on compulsory labelling of imported consumer products. The
Commission intends to withdraw the proposal, as I am sure the hon.
Gentleman will be aware. I know that the UK’s ceramics sector
has been a consistent supporter, but the Government have strong
reservations, as was outlined in the Adjournment debate secured by my
hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Gavin

reason the Commission gave for withdrawing the proposal was
the lack of agreement in the Council and
developments in the interpretation of World 
<?notus-xml column=451?>Trade Organisation rules that make it outdated. We expect confirmation
on that in April. The proposal received a mixed response from member
states. Many saw it primarily as a protectionist measure that
discriminated between imported and EU-produced goods. Consumer
information is important, but we do not necessarily want to go down a
protectionist
route<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:40:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130227101000701" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227101000701">The
Government obviously share the concerns about the
need to tackle counterfeit goods and provide accurate information and
the genuine concerns about trademark and design breaches and
the mislabelling of imported goods from some sources, as the hon.
Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central has outlined, but it did not seem
that the Commission’s proposal would add anything to the debate
except additional administrative and cost burdens, so it is right that
it is likely to be withdrawn. There was also a customs issue relating
to the cost that would be imposed, particularly in the context of the
public expenditure constraints we face. If that is not the best way to
achieve the outcome the hon. Gentleman wants, which is to allow
companies in his constituency a level playing field and enable
consumers to be well informed, alternatives such as the ones I have
talked about and better enforcement are a better way

to the specific questions the hon. Gentleman asked towards the end of
his remarks. He asked what funding the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills might be able to bring forward. The Department
does not fund individual enforcement actions, but it does fund the
National Trading Standards Board. As he might be aware, the trading
standards landscape has been changing, because there were concerns that
trading standards were too dispersed. The board will have greater
power. We can bring the issue to the attention of the Office of Fair
Trading, but it is up to it to consider whether an investigation is
merited.</hs_Para>

regard to the “turnover club” and the mugs in the
Department with no back-stamp, I must say that I brought my own mug to
the Department when I arrived. It commemorated the suffragettes and I
enjoy drinking my tea from it. I have never turned it upside down to
see what stamp is on it, but I will do so, although not when it is full
of tea—as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, it is not always an
appropriate moment to do that. I was intrigued to hear about the
“turnover club” and will endeavour to take up his
challenge to see where the goods in the Department come from and pass
on his concerns to others.</hs_Para>

blind to a child’s immigration status—in fact, the
Government are supposed to be blind to a child’s immigration
status full stop. We are signed up to the UN convention on the rights
of the child, and it seems to me that the UK Border Agency
differentiates between children whose parents are currently in the
system, or whose asylum case has failed, and children who have
permanent
residency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000029">The
rules on education in the UN convention are absolutely clear: children
must be provided with education regardless. However, the financial
support for which they are eligible is an issue. Does it allow children
to grow and flourish as the UNCRC expects? It is not adequate to
provide children with barely enough to survive on; the UNCRC is clear
that we must provide enough to allow them to develop to their best
potential. I argue that the system is inadequate even to allow
children’s bare survival. It certainly fails miserably to meet
our duties under the UNCRC.</hs_Para>

moment, a surprisingly large number of children live within the asylum
support system. A significantly smaller number of those—probably
only about 800—are supported under section 4, but the effects on
that small number are disproportionate. We in Government know well what
impact poverty has on a child’s life chances. All Ministers have
accepted that child poverty significantly damages children’s
potential for development, and that idea has cross-party support. That
is why so much effort has been devoted to ensuring that we get the data
right for counting child poverty, understand the indicators and focus
on the causes and impacts of child poverty. I know that well from my
time as a Minister at the Department for Education, where the issue was
one focus of my work. However, we seem not to be able to take the issue
as seriously for children whose asylum cases have not been
decided.</hs_Para>

is significantly worse for those on section 4 rather than
section 95 support. Section 4 support is intended to be short-term. It
has been described by previous Ministers as an austere regime intended
only for those whose applications have failed but who cannot

children spend years on section 4 support. Although it might be
intended for adults to live on for a matter of weeks, many children
spend substantial portions of their lives on it—we met families
whose children had spent almost all their lives on section 4 support.

Teather:</Member></B> I absolutely agree. Parents said to us that the
restrictions on where they could shop meant that things were often more
expensive, particularly items such as buggies, which were completely
impossible for many families to buy. They would have been much happier
to go to the second-hand shop, but of course they cannot use the Azure
card there; they are required to go to Mothercare or similar shops. To
reflect on my sister-in-law’s experience, buying a buggy at
Mothercare costs practically as much as buying a car. I hope that I am
not libelling the shop by saying so; I shall probably get letters from
Mothercare now. Nevertheless, I think that most people would recognise
that such items are extremely expensive. For anyone trying to survive
on  £5 a day in a cashless system using an Azure card,
it makes no financial sense whatever.</hs_Para>

want to buy food more in keeping with their own culture find themselves
unable to shop in suitable shops. It is particularly difficult for some
families that they are expected to walk, sometimes up to 3 miles, in
order to go shopping. The idea that a lone parent with several children
should walk several miles to use an Azure card to go shopping, carrying
the children and luggage back from the supermarket, is completely
unreasonable.</hs_Para>

money on the Azure card cannot be saved from one week to the next, at
least in more than very small amounts, so unless all the money is spent
during the week, it is effectively wasted. People said that if they are
ill and unable to shop, they run out of money and are unable to refill
the fridge the following week. If they need a winter coat, they have no
possible means of saving up for one. During a winter such as this one,
that seems completely
unreasonable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000036">Families
also spoke to us about the stigma associated with using the Azure card,
which identifies them immediately as asylum seekers. Many spoke
distressingly about their experiences of being abused in supermarkets
when they produced the card in order to buy their shopping. Sometimes,
even after the card had been topped up, it still did not work. It is
unreliable, as well as bringing great stigma with it.</hs_Para>

available in exceptional cases. Those cases seem to be phenomenally
exceptional, because my constituency office has had great difficulty
accessing the money when it is needed. That man walked miles across
London every day to visit his wife and child, a situation that put
intolerable pressure on the child and family. We certainly heard of the
reverse situation, where the woman was separated from the father of her

Maternity Action and the Refugee Council submitted evidence to us
during the inquiry. They have subsequently produced their own report,
“When maternity doesn’t matter”, which I will say
more about in a moment when I turn to housing. The organisations cited
a case in which a woman with no money for a buggy or transport was

further question about whether such punitive treatment actually has any
purpose. It does not make desperate families who fear for their lives
return home; it simply leaves them in poverty, jeopardising their
health and their children’s long-term development. We saw a case
in which somebody left on section 4 support for a very long time was

that if we raise benefit levels, it will encourage more people to seek
asylum here. There is simply no evidence for that. When vouchers were
introduced, the number of asylum applications rose. When cash was
re-introduced, it fell. There has been plenty of research, which I am
happy to share, looking at why people choose a particular country. In
most cases, it has much more to do with historical ties between
particular countries than with any expected benefits that people might
receive 
<?notus-xml column=72?>when they get to the country. Given the complexity of section 4 and
section 95 support—it took us some considerable time to produce
the spreadsheet to work out exactly what families in different

over time. The previous Government agreed that they would peg asylum
support to 70% but almost immediately broke that agreement. The problem
with this type of issue is that, because it is politically contentious,
successive Ministers in different Governments have found it difficult
to tackle, which is why it needs to be done in such a way that they do
not have to face the headlines every time something happens. Drafting
the legislation so as to allow the support to be uprated automatically
would surely take the political headache away from Ministers, allowing
them to do the right thing. I do not believe that Ministers from any
party would wish to see children pushed into severe poverty. It is a
question of ensuring that the administration is such that it can be
done easily. I strongly encourage the Minister to take that

of it, because the change would almost certainly save money. I made a
point a moment ago about how people could be housed with their
relatives if less restriction was applied than in the section 4 system,
which requires people to be housed in different accommodation. The
change would also save money on administration, and I strongly

the Government are really looking to save money, an obvious way would
be to allow asylum seekers to work and to support themselves if they
have been waiting in this country for some time for their case to be
decided. That is what most asylum-seeking families want: they want to
be able to support themselves, they do not want to be on benefit. We
have spent a lot of time talking up the importance of the work ethic as
a salvation for all. One of the mantras of the Government is that work
is an important route for supporting oneself, for dignity and for
children’s prospects. We know that, and we devote a lot of time
trying to get people back into work when they have been out of work for
a long time—in all cases except this group, who are often highly
educated and talented people with a lot to give to this country. During
the time they spend on asylum support, they are deskilled and
demotivated, and their children have to survive in high levels of
poverty. Again, the Minister could make a political virtue out of that

able to get back into a regular pattern of work, so that they can
support their family and themselves and give themselves some dignity
and a sense of contributing to the country that they have chosen to
make as their home albeit under difficult circumstances, the better
that is for everyone concerned. Furthermore, the quicker they can

perspective it will cost the country a good deal less to support them.

inquiry, we intended to look specifically at support rates, which is
what I have spent most of the time discussing.
Before I finish, however, I want to say something about some of the
other things that we found that were equally shocking, such as the way
in which families are treated by their housing provider. The families
have multiple moves, not only dispersed once but moved repeatedly, with
appalling living conditions and cases of disrepair, as well as a lack
of privacy and of hygiene. The multiple moves, as I said at the outset
of my remarks, affect not only family budgets because of the need to
buy a new school uniform every time but children’s school life,
and their ability to make friends and to settle. We must remember that
the children have fled their own country; they have fled war, violence
and persecution, with all the trauma involved, and yet, when the family
arrive here, we move them over and over again, often with little notice
or little information to allow parents to prepare their child
emotionally. What family would want to be moved and uprooted with
little notice and without some information so that they can discuss
with their child what is to happen? They get no information in advance
about where the local schools are or about the area, and no support to
allow them to register at a new school or with the doctor. They are
basically plucked from one place and dropped into another with no
support whatever to allow them to integrate. It is no wonder that
mental health problems are so high among this group. It would not be an
expensive problem to fix. We could provide support for families if a
move is necessary, and we could try to move families with young
children less often.</hs_Para>

and her four-year-old daughter told us that they moved 11 times in five
years. She explained that, as a consequence of what she fled from in

first within her own country, then in this country, effectively fleeing
from house to house, being moved by the UKBA. She said,
“I’m tired.” I am not surprised she is tired, and
I am not surprised that it is so difficult for her children. Moves are
often made with no appreciation of the impact on children. Families and
local authority representatives told us that contractors do not always
turn up when they say they will, so belongings, such as a
children’s cots, are packed up and no notice is given of when
the contractor will eventually turn
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000056">The
impact on pregnant women is even worse. I have referred to the deeply
upsetting report, “When Maternity Doesn’t Matter”,
which the Refugee Council and Maternity Action produced this week. They
submitted evidence to our inquiry that the impact of dispersal on
women’s lives is catastrophic if they are pregnant. The four
weeks’ protected period that UKBA agreed to introduce is an
advance, but still woefully inadequate. Women are moved away from their
partners so they may have no one with them when they give birth and no
one to look after their other children. A single mother in the study
reported that she was separated from her partner so she had no one to
look after her children and she considered leaving her children with a
local shopkeeper before she went into labour because she had no other
options for child care. Midwives told us that it makes their lives
incredibly difficult because they are unable to provide continuity of
care.</hs_Para>

flashbacks when giving birth. They have a much higher rate of maternal

it is not expensive to fix the problem. There is no reason for
repeatedly moving these women, and that could be stopped. I strongly
encourage the Government to examine the matter to ensure that women are
treated decently and that their children have a chance to thrive. We
know that what happens in the first few weeks and months after
childbirth is important for their children and attachment. That is why
the Government are putting health visitors in Sure Start
children’s centres. We know that post-natal depression and so on
have an impact on attachment, and a long-term impact on
children’s ability to thrive and what happens to them in later
life. Other Departments know that, so why does the Home Office not
accept the evidence that is driving Government policy everywhere else?
It must work with the Department of Health and the Department for
Education. The situation is simply not good enough, and it could be

final point, which is perhaps the smallest and the cheapest to fix, was
the most shocking for the panel. Almost every family told us that
housing contractors routinely enter properties without knocking. We
heard not just from one family, but from all of them independently that
people just turn up and use keys to let themselves in. People may be in
the shower and if they are Muslim women they may not have adequate head
covering. It causes terror for children, and is an epithet for the lack
of respect with which they are treated. They are treated as luggage
rather than people who deserve some dignity and respect. The Government

It is our duty to provide assistance to those in need, especially to
young children and families who have already suffered through war and
persecution. Unfortunately, there are many tragic examples of asylum
seekers in this country living in terrible conditions due to the low

cross-party parliamentary inquiry on asylum support, of which I was a
member and which was chaired by the hon. Lady, produced a comprehensive
report that examined support for asylum-seeking children and families
and made recommendations. One key concern outlined in the report is the
discrepancy between support for asylum seekers and families receiving
mainstream benefits. Asylum seekers are not permitted to work, and the
support that they are entitled to under section 95 of the Immigration
and Asylum Act 1999 is considerably less than current income support,
which is a minimum level to meet essential living needs.</hs_Para>

is detrimental to the well-being of asylum seekers, leaving families
hungry and struggling in atrocious conditions. Some children on asylum
support are living on as little as £5 a day. As part of the
inquiry, we heard tragic stories of parents going hungry, so that they
could feed their children, and having to choose between buying food and
buying warmer clothes for winter. Parents should never have to go
hungry to feed and clothe their children because they cannot afford to;
income support for asylum seekers is clearly insufficient if that is
the

situation is even more difficult for families with a child or a parent
with a disability. Without access to mainstream benefits, families
seeking asylum are also not entitled to benefits such as disability
living allowance, carer’s allowance or mobility assistance. That
leaves asylum-seeking families with disability significantly worse off
than families who are able to access mainstream support. Some families
are only getting about a quarter of what they would get under the
mainstream system. As it may cost up to three times more to raise a
disabled child, it is unreasonable for such families not to receive an
allowance to meet those extra costs, especially when they already have
difficulty making ends meet.
Parents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T09:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> raising
a disabled child will also require extra support to help them with

mother. It was not unusual for her to have to miss school to take her
mother to hospital appointments and help with the 
<?notus-xml column=77?>shopping and cleaning. Sadly, as her mother was unable to sign in for
her support every single week because of her disability, they would
sometimes have to go without any money. Had that mother and daughter
been given additional support, they would not have had to struggle in
that way and the girl would have had an uninterrupted

lack of support for refugees with additional needs is particularly
evident and worrying for children affected by HIV. Such children need
warm, clean accommodation and high-quality food and health care, which,
in most cases, they will not have access to through their asylum
support, leaving them vulnerable to serious illness. In addition,
mothers who are HIV-positive should not be breastfeeding, but are not
given supplementary funds for formula milk, putting their babies at

who are fleeing war and persecution should be given an extra layer of
protection, but in such cases, some of the most vulnerable are those
who receive the lowest support. It is clear that the particular needs
and additional costs of living for families where there is a disability

for asylum seekers. It is unacceptable for parents and children with
disability to be left without the support that they desperately need.
Asylum-seeking families should be able to access disability living
allowance, carer’s allowance or mobility allowance, so that they

recent Refugee Council research shows, many families will be refused
asylum but may still have protection needs, and they will be too afraid

general, if a temporary obstacle prevents them from leaving the
UK—for example, if they are too sick to travel or if there is no
viable route of return—under the section 4 system, they may only
live in designated accommodation, and instead of cash, they only
receive money to cater for essential living needs on the Azure payment
card. As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T10:18:03"></hs_TimeCode> the

want to focus my remarks on the card. It can only be used at designated
retail outlets, so people cannot get the best value for money. I think
that every hon. Member is committed to systems that allow the delivery
of the best value for money, so it is ironic that we have designed
something that militates against that. People can only purchase food,
essential toiletries and other items up to the value of £35.39
per person per week. We heard from families who reported experiencing
frequent technical faults with the card—something that, as the
hon. Lady pointed out, can be embarrassing and degrading—and
they were not allowed to buy certain items such as condoms or sanitary
towels.</hs_Para>

example, one mother, who had been trafficked for sexual exploitation
when she was young and who was living on section 4 support when we
spoke to her but has since received refugee status, told the panel how
she had been spoken to by another shopper while using the Azure card.
The shopper said, “You black monkey, go back to your own
country.” These horrific experiences have a profound impact on
parents and their children. None of us feels that that racism should be
tolerated, and we should not put systems in place that risk that racism

place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000077">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T10:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>

the cost implications of maintaining a two-tier system under section 4,
aimed at persuading people to leave the UK, are such that it is not a
cost-effective approach. Ultimately, increasing asylum support to bring
it in line with mainstream benefits to ensure that children’s
needs are met would mean additional costs. However, abandoning the
parallel section 4 system could and probably would save money, because
it would get rid of an unnecessary and clumsy

children were facing. We have a regime that does not work to the
imperative of the protection of children and their rights. It is a
system that, in many ways, possibly by ensuring the degree of
destitution for parents and children, puts
parents—mothers—at risk of ending up in undue
transactional circumstances, including prostitution. It creates many
degrees and levels of risk for children, which we should, of course, be

course, the lack of choice over disposable means is not the only

choice in relation to accommodation and being forced into UKBA
accommodation. As well as that being restricted and unsuitable living,
it can lead to intrusive situations—officials can just arrive

parts of the country will make different responses to the issue of
asylum, because some parts have more refugees and a longer history of
refugee 
<?notus-xml column=82?>communities than others. I used to be a curate in High Wycombe. Many
refugees had come from Poland to High Wycombe in the 1940s, and it was
an accepted part of Buckinghamshire society that there was a strong
support for asylum and for refugees individually.</hs_Para>

asylum and a desire to protect refugees are essential parts of our
British decency. They are things we feel proud of because of our
response not only in the 1930s and 1940s, but after that. People in the
United Kingdom looked at oppressive dictatorships in Spain, Portugal,
Greece and parts of eastern Europe and were proud when we were able to
provide others greater freedom and liberty than they were able to have
in their own countries.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Brent Central was absolutely right in
saying—though this is not often the version portrayed in the
<I>Daily Mail</I>, the <I>Daily Express</I>, <I>The Daily
Telegraph</I>, <I>The Guardian</I>, <I>The Independent</I> or just
about any national newspaper—that there is little evidence to
suggest that asylum seekers choose a country because of its benefits
system or whether they would be able to work. That, incidentally, is
also true of other forms of migration.</hs_Para>

important that we keep asylum and immigration separate and that
Government rules do so, too. If someone has suddenly to leave their
country, it is far more common for them to go to a country where they
already know someone; that stands to reason. If this country suddenly
had a dictatorial Government and people suddenly had to leave, they
would probably go somewhere where they had family or friends, whose
house they might be able to stay in. Alternatively, people might go to
a country whose operation of the rule of law they truly respected. Our
historical respect for the rule of law is another reason why Britain
has sometimes been a place where people seek refuge.</hs_Para>

but in different circumstances. Does my hon. Friend agree that, when
people leave their country, they go to a country where there is a
history and tradition of tolerance and where they feel they will get a
sense of justice? That is also part of why they move—not the

Bryant:</Member></B> I absolutely agree. That does not mean that we
should throw out all the rules on benefits in this country. It is a
simple point to make—the vectors of asylum are oppression and
dictatorial regimes, not the attraction of some kind of benefits system
in this country. That is not to say that we should build palaces for
every single person who comes to this country—no refugee expects
that—but it is important to realise why people come.</hs_Para>

important to realise that no one wants to be a refugee; everyone
prefers to live in their own country. The whole Old Testament is about
people who are refugees because they had to leave their own country and
the oppression that they lived under. The Israelites went off into the
desert because of the oppression  they were suffering under the
Egyptians. That is a fundamental—theological, if one
likes—understanding of the role of the refugee.</hs_Para>

a great deal more, where we can, to ensure that our aid budget is
deployed to try to ensure that fewer people around the world have to
seek refuge. The number of people seeking asylum in this country and in
many other parts of the world rose dramatically in the 1990s for the
simple reason that there were many more dangerous places from which
people had to flee.</hs_Para>

claiming that they were asylum seekers came for other reasons? In fact,
the attraction of easier travel and better media meant that, in
addition to the rising numbers, understanding whether the basis for

Bryant:</Member></B> That may be true, but part of my critique is that
we have been very ill-prepared to make such decisions over the past 20
years. If a long time is taken to decide on someone’s asylum
application—that happened under Labour, but also in the early
1990s—the danger is that we end up with people who have become
stateless and without any real
existence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000112">Among<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T10:41:18"></hs_TimeCode>

is vital that we make swift decisions, and it is important that the

very careful. In particular, I hope that the Minister will look at the
new evidence about Sri Lanka. When we return people to Sri Lanka, where
they face oppression and persecution, we need to be careful in our
relations with the Sri Lankan Government, let alone with
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T10:42:13"></hs_TimeCode>. There
can be no greater instance of the trauma involved in someone’s

Minister for Immigration (Mr Mark Harper):</Member></B> It is a great
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,  Mr Davies. I
congratulate the hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather) on
securing this debate. As she said, she and I met to discuss the report
put together by her group of parliamentary colleagues, and I had the
chance, both before and after that meeting, to consider it carefully.
It will certainly go into the Government’s review specifically
on asylum support rates. I thank her for her work and for the evidence.
Two of the Members who took part in that
work—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T10:48:58"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Members for Ealing, Southall (Mr Sharma) and for Scunthorpe (Nic
Dakin)—are here
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T10:49:04"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
time available, I will deal with both her points and those made by
other Members who spoke or
intervened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T10:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000132">Let
me first deal with the financial support. One point made by the hon.
Lady today, and one of the key points in her report, is that the amount
of money given to both asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers is very
low and does not meet families’ essential living needs. It is
worth setting out for the House exactly what is available. The legal
test is whether it meets people’s essential needs, which are
food, toiletries and clothing. A family of four receiving section 95
support, which is that given to those who have an asylum application
that has not yet been decided, would get £178 a week to cover
those essential costs. A family on section 4 support, which is where a
decision has been made and they do not have a right to remain in the
country, get £151 a week. It is worth remembering that they have
furnished housing with no bills to pay. I accept that it is not
generous, but I do not think it is ungenerous. It is lower than the
income support equivalents, but people who are in asylum support
accommodation do not have to pay any utility bills, buy furniture or
meet some of the other costs associated with running a
household.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=86?><hs_Para UID="13022755000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000133">The hon. Lady
touched on the relationship between the section 95 support and income
support levels, which is worth mentioning. For children, the rates are
much higher than the 70% she talked about. For children, the rates
range between 81% and 89% of the income support levels. It is true that
the rates are less generous for adults. If we look at how we compare
with other European countries on families—and therefore on
children—we are rather more generous than most of our equivalent
European
neighbours.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000134"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sarah Teather" PimsId="4227" UID="13022755000254" xid="664" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000254">Sarah
Teather:</Member></B> The Minister will perhaps recognise that the
rates vary according to the children’s age and tail off
significantly at 16, where it would be expected that those children
would be in full-time education, especially given the
Government’s own policy to encourage everybody to be in
education beyond 16. I have discussed the German constitutional court
case with him in private. I do not know whether he has had a chance to
look at it, but I am happy to send him the details. The support rates
there were deemed to be inadequate to meet a family’s basic
humane needs. It is difficult to compare our asylum support rates with
those of other European countries, because they partly depend on how
long someone is on them. It is worth noting that one of our neighbours
has had to review its asylum support
rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000135"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="13022755000255" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000255">Mr
Harper:</Member></B> I accept that point. It is worth making the point
on the German case that our rates for families are rather more generous
than the German rates. The hon. Lady is right that there was a court
challenge and the Germans have had to make their rates more generous.
Ours are significantly more generous. The point she makes about 16 and
17-year-olds is correct, but it is still worth noting that her report
and, I think, others have referred to the rates being at least 70% of
the income support rate. That is still the case for young people of 16
and 17, where it is 71%. It does fall below that for adults. She will
be aware—she and I have discussed this—that we are in the
process of reviewing the asylum support rates to confirm that they meet
essential living needs. The initial work that we have done suggests
that they do, but that work is under way. When we have completed it, we
will make an announcement in due
course.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000136">The
hon. Lady and others, particularly the hon. Member for Ealing,
Southall, referred to individuals who have higher living costs,
especially those with disabilities or complicated medical problems, who
might need particular extra care or equipment. The correct way that
they are supposed to be supported is through local authorities using
their powers and duties under both the National Assistance Act 1948 and
the Children Act 2004 to provide that extra support. It sounds like the
hon. Gentleman has encountered some cases in his surgeries with
constituents, and there were also some in the evidence given to the
panel producing the report, where that does not always happen.
Obviously I am happy to look at specific cases, so that we can ensure
that local authorities are following up on their legal
obligations.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022755000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000137">Once people
have made an asylum claim, if that claim is accepted and they are given
refugee status and are permitted to stay in the UK, they have access to
the full range of public services and benefits on the same basis as a
British citizen. There are some issues about 
<?notus-xml column=87?>the transition from asylum support to those mainstream benefits, and the
UK Border Agency and the Department for Work and Pensions are looking
at those to see whether we can smooth that move from asylum support to
mainstream benefits for those who are granted refugee status.</hs_Para>

mentioning at this point the speed of decision making, which is
important both from a human perspective and to ensure that people do
not use the asylum system as a method of economic migration. I agree
with the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant): both our parties have
been clear when in government that there is a distinction between
providing refuge for people fleeing persecution and for people who
move, perfectly understandably, for economic reasons. My hon. Friend
the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller) alluded to that. We now make
50% of asylum decisions within 30 days and 63% are made within a year,
and we continue to apply pressure to maintain that
progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000139">Several
hon. Members talked about whether asylum seekers should be able to
work. Our view is that they should not be able to, to keep that clear
distinction. However, under our obligations under the relevant EU
directives, if we take more than a year to make a decision, an asylum
seeker is able to apply to work, and we will usually grant them the
ability to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000140"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Virendra Sharma" PimsId="5258" UID="13022755000256" xid="928" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000256">Mr
Virendra Sharma:</Member></B> Does the Minister agree that when asylum
seekers are not entitled to work, they sometimes find illegal work,
which furthers the black market and disadvantages people who work in
that
field?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000141"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="13022755000257" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000257">Mr
Harper:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman’s point would be correct
if we were prohibiting people from working and not providing them with
any support. While we say they cannot work, so as to maintain that
important distinction, we do provide them with housing where the bills
are paid and a basic level of subsistence to support them in the period
before we make a
decision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000142">In
the four minutes I have remaining, I will say a little about the
difference between asylum seekers and those who have failed in their
claim. That is important and I have made this point to the hon. Lady.
If we are to maintain the proud record that the United Kingdom has in
giving people refuge from persecution, it is important that those who
have gone through the appeal process through the tribunal system, where
we will have looked at their cases carefully, and been found not to
require that support leave the country.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T10:56:55"></hs_TimeCode> is important
to distinguish that those on section 4 support are those who have been
found not to require our protection. They should be leaving the
country. We support those cases where there 
<?notus-xml column=88?>is a temporary barrier to them doing so, but frankly they should not be
here. I know that that is a difficult message for people sometimes, but
we have looked carefully at their cases and they do not need our
protection. They should return
home.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000143"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sarah Teather" PimsId="4227" UID="13022755000258" xid="664" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000258">Sarah
Teather:</Member></B> I am aware that the Minister does not have much
time, but does he recognise, particularly in the case of Zimbabwe, that
people were left in a situation where the courts would not return them
because it was unsafe, and for a prolonged period of time they were
left on very tiny amounts of
support?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000144"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="13022755000259" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000259">Mr
Harper:</Member></B> As I have said, if there are temporary barriers to
their removal—I do not know the particular cases that the hon.
Lady was talking about—we will support them, but if they are
found not to require protection, it is right that they leave. That is
why we have a different regime for those who have no right to be here
from that for those seeking
asylum.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000145">We
do not think that the Azure card is more expensive than administering
cash payments. It can be used in major supermarkets, chemists,
children’s and clothing retailers, and some charity shops, which
deals with the point made by the hon. Member for Scunthorpe. The hon.
Lady made a point about purchasing birth control or sanitary products
with the Azure card, which she raised when we met. I have checked it,
and there is no restriction on purchasing those products, although
there are rightly restrictions on purchasing alcohol and tobacco. I
agreed to look into those cases and have checked them, and there is no
restriction on birth control or sanitary products, which is
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000146">I
will deal with some of the points raised in the debate. On
accommodation and people moving around, we have specific restrictions
in our new Compass contracts on how many times people can be moved.
People will normally go into initial accommodation when they first make
a claim and then will be moved into their dispersal accommodation. They
will be moved from that only if there is a good reason, such as if the
property becomes unsuitable or if they request it. Under the contract,
they are only allowed to be moved twice in an 18-month period. We
should not see people being moved about frequently, because that raises
a range of
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022755000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022755000147">The
hon. Lady also referenced the recent report by the Refugee Council
about the dispersal of pregnant women. We changed our policies last
August, which she acknowledged, and 19 of the report’s 20 case
studies were prior to our policy change. That change should have dealt
with some of the issues that have been raised. This has been a good
debate, and I am sorry that I have not had time to deal with all the
issues.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_27_PT_1/B3E8F10FA9A232E18F35E69885920C6C04A2C813" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="27 February 2013">Wednesday

this month, the City of London hosted a day of activities designed to
boost County Derry’s visibility as a place to invest in among
businesses and investors here in London. That day included an inward
investment seminar, organised under the auspices of Derry city council
and Coleraine borough council and their respective chambers of
commerce, with valuable help from Invest Northern Ireland. The seminar
was addressed by a series of business representatives, as well as by
Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland’s Minister of Enterprise, Trade
and Investment, and the mayors of both Derry city council and Coleraine
borough council. It highlighted the potential of the growing
technological and digital sectors in the region, as represented by the
dedicated digital development projects of Digital Derry and Digital

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T11:05:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for East Londonderry (Mr Campbell) mentioned, the seminar at
the Guildhall was followed by an absolute first for the city of
Londonderry: a dinner at the Guildhall hosted by the City of London
corporation and facilitated by Invest NI, on the theme of inward
investment. At that dinner, 
<?notus-xml column=91?>Northern Ireland’s First Minister, the Deputy First Minister, the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the lord mayor of the City of

Belfast constituency, I am proud to say that I was born in Londonderry
and lived there for the first 11 years of my life, so I want to see it
do well and succeed. Does he agree that with the initiatives that he
has referred to—the dinner and the special events, particularly
this year—it is important that there is follow-up and
follow-through on the part of Invest NI and others? I say that because,
wearing my hat as a former Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
in Northern Ireland, the thing that I learned very strongly is that the
follow-up to any action is absolutely key, as I am sure that the hon.

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T11:06:56"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Gentleman is absolutely correct in that regard. Achieving follow-up is
an inevitable problem of government, and not just within Northern
Ireland. For example, one can look at the important initiatives that
the UK Government are making in India. Without following those
initiatives through, there is a difficulty. It is not simply a matter
of a whole lot of politicians putting on a good dinner and everything
else, and thinking that the problem is solved. There needs to be
concerted action. I very much hope that all members of all parties in
Northern Ireland will play their part in that action, and I also hope
that, within the City of London, we ensure that we take on this
responsibility, too.</hs_Para>

memorandum of understanding between Digital Derry and the Tech City

sitting in Westminster Hall today would be keen to point out, Northern
Ireland’s education record is actually fantastic; it is the best
of any part of the United Kingdom. It is perhaps the flipside of having
such a strong public sector that teaching as a profession is rather
more highly regarded in Northern Ireland than is possibly the case in
other parts of the United Kingdom. As I say, Northern Ireland has a
fantastic record on education. However, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T11:09:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
rightly points out, ensuring that that education is built upon with
skills that are relevant for the 21st century, particularly in the key

the signing of this memorandum of understanding, a number of angel
investors and media outlets have already expressed a serious interest

of this agreement is just the first part of a long-term business plan

hope this will culminate in developing deeper connections to funding
networks in and around the City of London, with the intention of
creating an investment fund for businesses, supported by Digital Derry,
and the development of Digital Derry’s Culture Tech festival and

hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark
Field) on securing the debate. In the short time I have been in
Northern Ireland, one thing I have witnessed is people’s warmth
and enthusiasm for moving on, particularly when I went to Londonderry
for the first time. Actually, there was a bit of enthusiasm and warmth
for me, which was interesting—people were very welcoming and
friendly. More importantly, however, people were saying, “The
past is the past. We can’t remove the past. The past is there.
But we have to go forward.” The positive way in which
Londonderry or Derry/Londonderry—if I get into the semantics, I
will get told off again, but there we are—has dealt with the
past, and is dealing with the future, could easily be replicated in
more parts of the community, and it is important that people do
so.</hs_Para>

business; it is a place where people can come and do business. Only
three weeks ago, I met the seven biggest Japanese business men in the
UK, who had come to Northern Ireland with their ambassador to see how
they could invest. I do not want to pre-empt some of the announcements
that will come from the county of Londonderry and Londonderry itself,

£220 administration fee, a £50 if there was a
guarantor and a £120 additional charge on contract completion,
totalling £390. There was then a month’s deposit up

culture of fees being charged—as I said, the fact that it might

a category 1 or 2 hazard, as defined by the Housing Act

of the reasons why people do not move out of such properties is that
they cannot afford to. The managing agents know that, and they will

landlord carries out work, many months will have passed. The landlord
might then propose to carry out the work but not do it, and so it would
not be atypical for more than a year to go by before any definitive
action is taken. We have to look at how to clamp down on that

landlords will act pretty quickly, because most landlords want high
occupancy in their properties. If they were told that they will not get
their money for a month or two and that the work only costs up to
£1,000 or so, they would pretty quickly carry out the work. If
the agent did not receive the rent on behalf of the landlord, we can be

Collins:</Member></B> I understand the hon. Lady’s point. The
mechanism of making direct payments to landlords could be seen as an
incentive to landlords to meet their obligations, because it is
massively in their interest to have direct payment of housing benefit:
they have sitting tenants; there is massive demand for property; and
they are given a guaranteed income, which effectively comes from the
Government, one way or another, rather than from a tenant. I can
understand how that works in the existing system. With the reforms,
however, we can tell tenants, “You will receive the benefit. You
can make that decision, but perhaps you need more understanding of your
rights and what protection in law you
have.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022765000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0001.htm#13022765000054">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T14:57:28"></hs_TimeCode>
do not want to use this opportunity to make up Government policy on the
hoof, not that I am in a position to do so anyway, but I have a
suggestion. If extra protection is needed, should there be a rent order
or something that a local authority can issue to say, “We do not
believe that any more rent should be paid on this property by the
tenant until the work is completed”? It could also state,
“We believe that the tenant in this case is protected in law and
cannot be evicted. No legal action can be taken against them until the
work is completed. We will inspect it.”</hs_Para>

how can we use the mechanism of the money that we control to encourage
them to invest in their properties more promptly? If they do not, they
might otherwise risk losing the benefits. If housing benefit was not
paid out, I would prefer tenants to able to use the money instead for a
deposit on a new property that they might wish to rent and to pay for
some moving costs. They would then be empowered in the market, so that
they could pick up and go elsewhere. At the moment, they are restricted
from doing that; they cannot afford to move out of their rented

they are being ripped off or being made to live in slum conditions that
are not tolerated and that are in breach of the 2004 Act? That could be
a more empowering mechanism for the tenant, and much easier to deliver,

first-year students is just after they have started their course. They
are asked to make choices nine months or so before occupying the
accommodation, which leads to a range of issues with disrepair because

little that can be done to restrict the actions of the unscrupulous. It
is an extraordinary omission that letting agents are not covered by the
same requirement to be part of an approved redress scheme as estate
agents under the Estate Agents Act 1979. Professional bodies for
letting agents provide complaints procedures, but those agents who are

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:11:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

all acknowledge that there is a problem. For a variety of reasons,
there is an increasing number of new landlords in the private rented
market. Some people go in for buy to let. Two of my daughters, who are
married, are coincidentally temporary landlords by virtue of not being
able to sell their houses—one in Wales and one in
London—and they could not let them without using a letting
agent. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:11:42"></hs_TimeCode>There is
also increasing demand for rented property as people fail to stump up
the deposit and the finance to purchase their first home.</hs_Para>

all leads to an increasing reliance on letting agents, and there is no
dispute that that is a problem. In terms of service, a great deal is
left to be desired by the letting process and by the way in which
repairs are conducted and deposits are handled. People have illustrated
quite forcefully that there is not the same transparency in the system
as we would expect from a reputable business.</hs_Para>

is reflected in the high level of complaints we get. At the top end of
those complaints are issues of downright theft and sharp practice. We
are looking at  
<?notus-xml column=110?>an unregulated market, and everybody—the OFT, Shelter, charities
concerned with homelessness and the political
parties—acknowledges that. The Liberal Democrat conference
passed a motion emphasising its concern.</hs_Para>

Government acknowledge the problem. In a recent debate on the subject
in the main Chamber, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr Foster),
made it clear that they would keep the regulation of letting agents
under review. When he was in opposition, the Housing Minister spoke
favourably of such a proposal.</hs_Para>

all agree, therefore, on the problem. There tends to be a difference of
opinion, however, when we come to the solution. One solution staring us
in the face is simply caveat emptor: basically, let us have a smarter
set of customers. However, that is clearly an inadequate solution and
an inadequate hope. Many players in the market—landlords and
tenants—are novices. They are making critical decisions, they
are short of cash and they are often going through the trauma of moving
home, which, as we all know, is one of the major traumas in
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:13:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022765000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0002.htm#13022765000090">The
second solution, which is favoured by some, is voluntary registration.
That leaves out what the hon. Lady called the cowboys. Of course, they
are not immediately identifiable: they do not all have stetsons and
holsters so that people can pick them out straight away. Even if they
did, voluntary regulation has been tried, and it has not been found to
be a sufficient solution, because complaints have not gone down. It was
a laudable move, and we have to support it, but it is obviously not
sufficient to deal with the
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:14:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022765000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0002.htm#13022765000091">Then
we come to the thorny issue of whether we need more regulation,
legislation or compulsory registration of letting agencies. The
Government are right to be sceptical about over-regulation, but it is
not obvious what such a proposal would result in. It is not obvious
that the burden will in any way be increased for good letting agents,
who already pay for voluntary schemes of one kind or another and accept
the administrative cost of that. Any scheme we embrace will also
presumably be self-funding and therefore not a call on the
Government’s sorely stretched coffers.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:15:16"></hs_TimeCode>It is not clear
in any case why regulation is inappropriate. How would we answer the
question: why should estate agents be regulated, but not letting
agents? There is no really good answer. Furthermore, if we have a
better regulated market, we will deliver some sort of social good.
Despite<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:15:34"></hs_TimeCode> the fact
that there is a threshold to be crossed, and despite the fact that this
environment is not utterly lawless—there are sensible pieces of
ordinary civil law legislation that apply to it—there does seem
to be a case for effective market intervention, which would presumably
start with some sort of compulsory regulation of letting
agents.</hs_Para>

decisive issue is this. We all accept that the issue is in the balance:
it is not one on which people have dogmatic or doctrinaire ideas, or
which they resist out of an ideological preference. Equally, the issue
will not go away, and the problems are on the increase.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:16:32"></hs_TimeCode> introducing
regulation, the Government will not reduce the supply of property. The
more likely market effect is that they will drive landlords, who one
assumes will be just as numerous as ever, to use the
services of reputable agents, not agents who are unworthy of effective
registration.</hs_Para>

regulation is supported by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors

necessarily sufficient. Whether or not we have regulation, the elephant
in the room is enforcement. We need to draw attention to the fact that
most local authorities have quite a lot to do managing their existing
budget and delivering the formal commitments the public expect them to
deliver, without venturing into a territory where the public may not
notice whether they are delivering. Such things would be an easy hit

many hon. Members present, I was confronted with something of a dilemma
over whether to speak in this debate or the debate in the main Chamber
on the bedroom tax. Unfortunately, that highlights the fact that those
who are not in a position to own their own home face increasingly
serious problems, which this Government seem unwilling to address,
because they have failed to build more affordable housing and left
tenants and landlords to fend for themselves in an unregulated lettings
market. Unfortunately, the Government are willing to make the situation
even worse through their unfair and unworkable changes to housing
benefit. With more than 6,000 households in Nottingham affected by the
bedroom tax, more and more families on low incomes will be forced out
of their council or housing association homes and into the private
rented sector.</hs_Para>

Nottingham who would love to buy their own home, but who cannot get a
foot on the property ladder, and there are more than 10,000 people in
Nottingham waiting for a council home. But the Government are not
building enough of those desperately needed affordable homes. If we

we have heard, there is no legislation covering letting agent
practices. It is still possible to set up as a letting agent with no
qualifications. There are no requirements as to conduct or for the
safeguarding of consumers as there are for estate agents, and no
obligation to register with a redress scheme. Letting agents simply
operate outside any legislation. Agents can voluntarily join a
regulation scheme, but it is estimated that fewer than 60% do so. There
is no shortage of evidence that supports the need for action. As my
hon. Friends have said, an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading
found that the lettings market generates a high level of complaints,
and the main areas of concern for tenants set out in its report
published earlier this month included surprising and high charges,
confusion about holding deposits, misleading advertising, repairs not
being carried out on the property and non-refund of security deposits.
Crisis, the charity for homeless single people, reported similar areas
of concern. The property ombudsman reported a 26% increase in enquiries
or complaints about letting agents between 2010 and 2011 and, as we
have heard, Citizens Advice found that 73% of tenants whom it surveyed
were dissatisfied with the service.</hs_Para>

from my constituency, consistent with those findings, highlights the
need for action by the Government to regulate the private rented sector

Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) I represent a constituency with many
students. Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:22:09"></hs_TimeCode>
neighbourhoods, particularly Dunkirk, Lenton, Radford, the Park,
Wollaton Park and Lenton Abbey, which are close to the campuses of the
university of Nottingham, have high concentrations of private rented
sector accommodation and especially homes in multiple occupation. Some
years ago residents established the Nottingham Action Group on HMOs,
because they shared a concern about the way their neighbourhood was
being affected by the changing use of local housing. The group has vast
experience of the impact of the private rented sector in the city. When
I asked for views on letting agents I was told that the most common
complaint is agents failing to sort out repairs or carry out regular
maintenance. Of course that does not affect only the tenants of the
property in question; it often affects neighbours and the wider
community, either directly or indirectly, because the local environment
becomes run down, the street looks uncared for and further problems
flow from that.</hs_Para>

NAG also had regular reports of other problems, such as agents sending
prospective tenants round to view a property without making an
appointment, or simply telling them to call round on the off chance.
When the current tenants complain they are told to put up with it
because the sooner the property is let the sooner people will stop
dropping round unexpectedly. There are also reports of agents failing
to give prospective tenants sufficient time to look at the property,
and pressuring them to sign tenancy agreements and property inventories
on the spot. It has been found that agents do 
<?notus-xml column=113?>not return deposits readily. There is evidence of agents who do not
know, or wilfully disregard, legislation. One recent example of that in
Nottingham was an agent who has now been fined twice for letting HMOs
that required a licence but did not have one. NAG also raised concerns
about agents hiring contractors to put up “to let” boards
without overseeing the work. Boards have been fastened to fences
belonging to neighbours’ properties, and to trees. Thanks to the
persistence of NAG, working alongside Nottingham city council, and with
the support of landlords and tenants, there are now local controls on
the use of letting boards. However, some agents are still acting
inappropriately and using every means that they can to circumvent the
controls.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022765000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0002.htm#13022765000105">The

hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) on securing this
important debate. I shall not attempt to repeat any discussion of the
many important issues raised so far, particularly about the experiences
of tenants in the private rented sector. I just want briefly to focus
on that sector in
Newcastle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:27:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022765000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0002.htm#13022765000111">Since
I was elected, housing has been the No. 1 issue, week after week, that
constituents have brought to me. They tell heart-rending tales—I
will not recount them here. It is clear to me that a secure roof over
one’s head is incredibly important not only for the security of
family life, but for mental well-being, for being in a fit state to go
out to try to get a job and for the quality of life to which we should
all have a basic right. That is why I have launched a campaign in
Newcastle to improve the availability of affordable housing, focusing
on bringing empty private sector homes back into use and encouraging
the building of new affordable housing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022765000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0002.htm#13022765000112"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:28:39"></hs_TimeCode>It
is clear, however, that new affordable housing cannot be built fast
enough and that the private rented sector is increasingly important. I
should like the Minister to say that he recognises that the private
rented and social housing sectors are directed at different markets.
Frequently, in response to questions on the bedroom tax, the
Conservative party seems to say that, because certain measures may
exist in the private rented sector, similar ones are acceptable in the
social housing sector. There seems to be no recognition of the fact
that there is a key difference, because many of our more
vulnerable constituents live in the social housing sector.</hs_Para>

is important that there should be a strong private rented sector. In
Newcastle, the average rent in the private rented sector is £120
a week, whereas it is £67 for council housing. That is beyond
the reach of many of my constituents.

the last 12 months that data are available from Shelter, 1,055
landlords started the process of removing tenants in Newcastle. In the
same period, only about 350 new homes were started, so the importance
of a properly regulated and working market in the private rented sector
is clear to me as the local
MP<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:30:21"></hs_TimeCode>. That is why
I support the measures that we are proposing to regulate private rented
sector letting agencies. In addition, it is clear that good letting
agents, of which there are many, often support that as well. They do
not want to be tarred with the same brush as those whose behaviour, as
we have heard today, is invidious and heartless.</hs_Para>

Members have spoken about the private rented sector as a market, and I
was very interested in some of the points that they made supporting the
fact that we are seeing market failure. It is therefore incredibly
difficult to understand why the Government, recognising that there is
market failure in the private rented sector, do not feel that
intervention is appropriate. These clear market failures have an impact
on many areas of our society. For example, in Newcastle, where we have
high deprivation and poverty, unexpected charges can push families in
the private sector into debt and into a spiral of credit and loan
sharks, with little possibility of escape.</hs_Para>

debate, and I want to remind the Minister of the context in which we
have it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:32:48"></hs_TimeCode>. We can
all think back to a period in British history when the vast majority of
people were in private accommodation. We had tenements and Rachman-like
landlords, and Charles Dickens, for example, was able to illustrate
coherently and fantastically just how grim it was for many people,
particularly in the capital city. Since then, we have had the welfare
state, slum clearance and the Addison Act of 1919. There was a
wonderful balance, with subsidised, affordable housing, and where
people could afford to buy their own home, as my father did in 1956 for
£6,000. People could get easy credit at the bank and could get
on to the housing ladder, or they could seek to get private
accommodation.</hs_Para>

Minister should be deeply concerned that we have returned, in Britain
today, to a context in which the vast majority of people are in private
rented accommodation. We are going backwards as a country, not
forwards. We are not building sufficient houses. He will know that
because of the decision to generate a right-to-buy scheme, while not
building housing to replace the right to buy, we have now lost our
social housing, and that is leading to a dire state in
London.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:33:54"></hs_TimeCode> We have
come to a new market in which, frankly, many—this does not apply
to all—cowboys are operating. They have seen a gap in the market
and vulnerable people, and they have rushed in with a whole set of
practices that have been well illustrated in this debate.</hs_Para>

is now time for the Minister to deal with a situation in which
complaints against the sector have risen by 123% since 2008, and where
we recognise that there is conning and fraud by these cowboys. People
are losing deposits and extortionate fees are charged that are hard to
understand. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:34:43"></hs_TimeCode>
need a statutory code and legislation in this area. We need to
consolidate fees in one structure and publish clearly what those fees
are. We need a compulsory public membership scheme, so that we know who
our landlords are and what their practices are. There is market failure
in this area. This is something that traditional Conservatives should

Friend the Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) rather than to speak,
which given the time, is probably just as well, but I am prompted to
make three points. First, there is a problem and it is growing.
Secondly, there is a solution and wide support. Thirdly, there is
really no excuse for the Minister not  to act.</hs_Para>

the problem is clear. This is a field with no legal requirements or
legal restraints for people setting up and running a letting agent or a
managing agency. There is no legal requirement to belong to a trade
association or to conform to standards of conduct; nor is there a legal
requirement to offer some sort of redress 
<?notus-xml column=116?>scheme or safeguards for consumers. The stories of problems with
up-front, unjustified, unfair fees are growing, as are the problems
with misleading ads, and with repairs not being done or visits not even
being made. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:36:02"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) mentioned
the Citizens Advice research and the scale of dissatisfaction with
letting agents. Which? has done a similar survey, showing that letting
agents, out of 50 different consumer markets, came second bottom for
dissatisfaction—below train companies and even insurance
providers. Of course, the private rented sector, for the first time in
half a century, is larger than that of public and social housing. Some
8.5 million people are renting privately, and 1 million families with
kids are in private rented accommodation. This is a growing
problem.</hs_Para>

on the solution, a regulatory framework is in place for estate agents;
as suggested by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:36:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Southport (John Pugh), why not have it for letting agents and
managing agents as well? Following the Rugg review in 2009, proposals
are on the stocks, with wide support. The formal consultation that the
previous
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:37:50"></hs_TimeCode> held
and published in February 2010 confirmed that the majority of
respondents were behind a legal, mandatory framework of regulation for
letting agents. The chair of the Residential Landlords Association told
the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government in evidence
this month:</hs_Para>

Fair Trading has made recommendations, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:37:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rotherham has said, and it must be borne in mind that,
with its restricted remit confining it principally to competition
issues, it is normally constrained from offering a wide-ranging and
full set of recommendations, but it has done so in this
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022765000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/halltext/130227h0002.htm#13022765000123">Thirdly
and finally, I say to the Minister that there is no excuse now for not
acting. The need is clear; the support is there; and the proposals have
been independently recommended by the Rugg review. Public consultation
has been formally conducted on those proposals. The legislative
vehicle—the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill—is in
the other place at the moment. A coherent change to the legislation has

constituencies of the problems that people face in the private rented

the future, but absolutely not on the current terms. There are problems
of security. Letting agents encourage churn, which leads to insecurity
in the sector. There are problems of affordability. There are problems

has been a useful debate, because there is a substantial question and
substantial interest from a much wider group. Of course, the number of

reason and that is certainly not an assumption that I make or any other
member of the Government makes, although I did particularly enjoy the
idea that the only reason why the Labour Government did not do anything
was that the Opposition spokesman did not make a strong enough
argument. That is an entertaining argument. It does not quite wash.

the question of agents. People have talked about the question of
supply, the interaction with the housing benefit elements 
<?notus-xml column=120?>and so on, but let me just look at the private rented sector
particularly. As I said in the debate that we had only last month, we
are very committed as a Government to ensuring that this is a bigger

a genuinely good choice of decent, reasonably priced accommodation.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:49:49"></hs_TimeCode> stand first
and foremost on the basis that many—not all—of the

historical perspective, but I do not necessarily wish to go back to
Dickens; we will stick with the past 25 years. What we have seen in the
past  25 years—something on which we have agreed over
many years—is that demand has substantially outstripped supply.
As a result, the supply available to tenants, and the quality and
standards of accommodation, have simply failed to keep up. That has

the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 protect tenants

In Oxford, a letting agent had to pay
£300,000 in fines and costs for consumer protection-related and
money-laundering offences after failing to return tenants’

We need to make sure that we use existing consumer protection

dissatisfied with their agent. That is still too high, but I think that
if it is one in five, people will realise that the vast

that they get. The <I>Which</I>? report is a pretty independent and
extensive survey in that context. However, there remain too many agents

view has been that regulation should not be the first option. Although
we recognise that there might be a case for it, the challenge is to
make sure that existing law works properly. There is a temptation among
all of us as politicians to believe that passing new legislation will
deal with people who currently ignore existing regulation. I am
sceptical that the changes we make, of a statutory nature or otherwise,
will actually catch the rogues that Members of all parties have
highlighted. That is the challenge.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:59:37"></hs_TimeCode> am open to
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:59:50"></hs_TimeCode>.
We are looking carefully at what the Office of Fair Trading has said.
There are some strong and positive elements there. However, if we are
to do this properly—if we are to catch the rogue agents and
landlords who perfectly happily flout every other law—we need to
make sure that if we change the rules and change the law, we do so in a
way that will deal with the individuals in
question.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_27_PT_1/32AD1CD7D62348ABDF4C14A3639B76EFDC87B693" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="27 February 2013">Wednesday

off the map, but the only country that has been wiped off the map in
the middle east is Palestine—go to your atlas, Mrs Brooke, and
you will see. The Palestinian people were scattered to the four corners
of the earth—stateless, paperless and passport-less, hunted from
pillar to post and regularly subject to massacre and attack of one kind

times in the tent. The LSE or Libyan School of Economics—the
London School of Economics—was encouraged to take large

goals that I have ever seen and the best that I was ever any part of.
The hon. Gentleman’s generous notification of that, in
publications or this sort of debate, has always been touching. The

his passion and commitment can cloud his judgment. He said a number of
things today that I shall endeavour to correct, as I think that he took
a particular point and extrapolated it to a position that is genuinely

relationships in the Arab world, because they are difficult and
complex, before dealing with some of the specific points. As the House

policy challenges faced by the world—nuclear proliferation, the
middle east peace process, the appalling war waged by the Assad regime
against its own people, ungoverned spaces providing havens for
terrorists and extremists—are found in the

United Kingdom’s security and prosperity are intertwined with
the Arab world. A mere nine miles separate Europe from north Africa at
the Mediterranean’s narrowest point. Many countries in the
region are important partners in tackling terrorist threats. Hundreds
of thousands of British jobs are linked to trade and commerce with the
wider middle east. It is fundamentally in our national interest that
the region becomes more stable, more open, more free and more
prosperous over time, and we have a part to play in that.</hs_Para>

with the middle east are designed to further Britain’s security

UK and to ensure the safety of British nationals overseas and at home.
That is the heart of our foreign policy, but we seek to do it in a way
that upholds and promotes our values—our belief in universal
human rights, in justice, and in equality for women and for
minorities—at all times. We do so as a matter of principle, but
we also know that it reinforces our other interests.</hs_Para>

two years, the region has seen momentous change with the Arab spring.
That change has been led at its core by the region’s people in a
demand for dignity, a voice and a fair prospect of employment. That
change was always going to be a long process, yet much has already been
achieved. Tunisia has its democratically elected parliament; Morocco
has its free elections; and Yemen is undergoing a political transition.
All those are genuine achievements. In a region where almost 60% of the
population is under 25, the Arab spring has demonstrated the
aspirations of the region’s 
<?notus-xml column=128?>citizens for a voice and a right to share in the prosperity of the 21st
century. They share that aspiration with their peers in other parts of
the world. Arab exceptionalism has

UK has been clear in its support for those strengthening the building
blocks on which inclusive, accountable societies are based. We are

partnership initiative in Egypt and Libya, we have supported free and
fair elections by assisting domestic observer missions. In Tunisia, we
have strengthened legislative protection for the freedom of expression;

deliver lasting stability and security for the region and for us all.
However, bringing together our values and interests can at times be a
difficult balancing act. Conflicts sometimes arise. Although we have
many mutual values with countries of the region, there are also
differences between us. We have different cultures, histories and
traditions and we cannot underestimate the significance of that.
All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:21:33"></hs_TimeCode> that has

we do not agree on values, however, we need to work that through,
dealing with the differences honestly and frankly. We do not see eye to
eye on all our values with countries of the middle east or in any part
of the world. In an increasingly interconnected world, security
concerns pay no regard to borders. We speak of the global economy and
British nationals live in all parts of the world. Although we may be an
island, isolation and disengagement is not an option. We need to work
with countries, in spite of their different beliefs, faiths and value

being a friend of others in the region as well. When I was last with
the president of the Palestinian Authority, he said that he knew of no
other politician who was pursuing the case of the young man killed by a
tear gas grenade in Nabi Salih at the hands of the Israeli defence
force a couple of years ago and that my visits to the family had meant

indicating. I was pointing out that one of his colleagues had held the
job without such a qualification. The reason why we did not support the
vote, which was not for membership but to advance the cause of
statehood for the Palestinian Authority, was that we had explained that
what we believed was most in its interest was not a vote at the United

wishing to stay on that subject, I will briefly cover the others. On
Iran’s nuclear programme, Iran is still acting in defiance of
multiple International Atomic Energy Agency resolutions, including the
most recent resolution adopted last September, and no fewer than six UN
Security Council resolutions. The IAEA has expressed its serious
concerns about the possible military dimension to Iran’s
programme. Anyone who mistakes what is going on in Iran and believes
that it is purely peaceful is missing the point. If it is purely
peaceful, that is not difficult for Iran to demonstrate. We still hope
that it will take the opportunity to do so this year. The IAEA has made
reference to the possible military dimension of that
programme.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman again went too far. It is not true that the United
Kingdom is supplying al-Qaeda with either money or weapons. I do not
believe that to characterise what is happening in Syria as an attack on
the Christian minority is accurate. There are jihadists involved. It is
the wish of the United Kingdom and our partners to ensure that they are
not supplied with weapons. That is why we are so determined to see the
success of the Syrian national opposition coalition, so that it has
legitimacy and an opportunity to represent the future of Syria in its
political transition. We are more than well aware of the danger of
jihadists becoming involved in what was originally a clear expression
of reform and opinion against the Assad regime. That has turned into
something different, because of the length of time that the situation
has been unresolved, which is not through lack of effort by the United
Kingdom with the United Nations. We are extremely concerned for the

Members may know that the Environment Agency is just 16 years old; in
many ways, it is a juvenile. Many of my constituents who are still
mopping up after the recent floods regard the agency’s lack of
action as—dare I say it?—almost juvenility in itself.
There is not the time today to highlight every single human tragedy
that has happened or the appalling damage that has been done; I cannot
do that. It is also not possible today to give a completely accurate
account of the total cost of floods on the levels. However, it is
plainly ridiculous  to put what has happened down to a quirk of
nature, or to an overdose of the “wrong type of rain”, as
Lord Smith of Finsbury, the agency’s chairman, informed us all.

of the overflow of water was manageable, if not preventable. Dare I say

black death than for engineering excellence, people managed to drain a
large part of the moor by building elaborate embankments and causeways.
Parliament became heavily involved from 1791, when it needed to pass an
Act to dig King’s Sedgemoor drain in order to let excess
water flow out into the Bristol

the floods can still be seen today. I obviously do not blame the
Environment Agency for the rain, but I wonder what it failed to do
before the cloudbursts started. It is surely an essential task of a
body such as this one to keep the waterways running freely. Rivers have
a nasty habit of silting up—that is why we dredge them. However,
the Environment Agency no longer dredges rivers such as the Tone and
the Parrett, both of which flow through my constituency and that of the

we are seriously in the business of protecting the environment, the
cost of regular dredging should never be regarded as a capital expense,
because dredging has to be done; it is not an option but a necessity.
Moreover, dredging is not even expensive, given the reality of what we
are looking at. The Environment Agency itself calculates that the cost
of desilting the risky bits of both the River Tone and the River
Parrett every year for the next 20 years is less than
£5 million. In my view, that is chickenfeed. The Environment
Agency’s own calculation of the cost of emergency pumping and
road closures during this year’s flooding alone was £4
million, and that was just in my area. The agency has done its
homework. The price of flooding over 20 years in
Somerset—in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:35:17"></hs_TimeCode>

million. It is an absolute no-brainer to dredge, but the agency keeps
telling us that it has not got the
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:35:22"></hs_TimeCode> to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:35:21"></hs_TimeCode>. I must say

am also slightly worried about the way that the views of my hon. Friend

it was not worth dredging the Tone and the Parrett because they will

to extract the water and they paid the fee to the Environment Agency,
filled in the forms and waited. Weeks turned into months; no licence
came. Then the Environment Agency awarded a water extraction licence to
another applicant and told the owners of the mill that there was
“no water available”. The owners went to judicial review,
went to court, won the case, proved that the Environment Agency had
deliberately withheld information and the judges made the agency pay
all the costs—our money. A happy ending hon. Members may think,
but not quite. It is almost a full year since the judges ruled against
the agency and ordered it to issue a water extraction licence, but it

First, I should like to emphasise and get on the record how much I

that point, but I also live in the reality of the financial climate in
which we live, and I have to ensure that every penny that we spend on
flood defences and flood protection is spent as professionally and with

the margins of a vote one night. The scheme at Steart is an example of
seeking to gain value for money. I understand that the defences around
the peninsula were in poor condition and coming to the end of their

the former, Research Ministers debated the Commission’s annual
growth survey (AGS), one of a series of debates in sectoral Councils
that will feed into a presidency report to the spring European Council.
Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn (Research and
Innovation) argued that growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, which
maintained or increased the share of public investment in research,
education and energy, was essential and that national research funding
could also be delivered more effectively. Member states broadly
welcomed the AGS. The UK noted the importance of ensuring that the
wider regulatory environment was conducive to innovative activity, and
the need for a state aids framework for research and innovation that
recognised the increased risks and costs associated with these
activities (without undermining the internal
market).</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13022758000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/wmstext/130227m0001.htm#13022758000017">On
the latter, the Commissioner emphasised the importance of open access
as a principle, noting that she felt that national approaches were too
fragmented and that this was holding European researchers and industry
back. Member states were united in agreement on the importance of open
access to research publications, although there were clear differences
in respect of levels of
implementation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13022758000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/wmstext/130227m0001.htm#13022758000018">Under

main internal market and industry issues discussed on 19 February were:
the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH),
the entrepreneurship action plan and the European semester. A number of

began with a policy debate on the review of REACH, the
EU’s regulation on chemicals and their safe
use. I and many member states intervened to stress the importance of
adapting the system for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and
the importance of reducing fees and cost-sharing. I also highlighted a
number of examples where REACH had negatively impacted UK business. In
addition to the review of REACH, the Council also discussed an
accompanying paper on nanotechnologies. There was general support for
the Commission’s approach to handle nanotechnologies within the
REACH framework, although some countries suggested there might be a
need for a separate regulatory structure in future. In line with
several member states, I supported the Commission, stressing
the importance of a risk-based
approach.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13022758000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/wmstext/130227m0001.htm#13022758000022">The
next substantive item concerned the entrepreneurship action plan. Shan
Morgan took the seat for this item. Generally, member states welcomed
the action plan, with many stressing in particular the importance of
access to finance and encouraging a more entrepreneurial spirit within
Europe. The UK agreed with the initiatives presented, particularly
those relating to access to finance and digital services, but
highlighted that most activity in this sphere was for member states to
undertake with the Commission’s role being to support and share
best
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13022758000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/wmstext/130227m0001.htm#13022758000023">The
lunch discussion focused on state aid modernisation. The discussion
focused on the question of regional aid and on the Commission’s
proposal for a ban on aid to large enterprises in certain disadvantaged
areas (“c” areas) in particular. Most member
states, including myself, argued that a ban was unnecessary and would
damage member states’ ability to promote growth. The Commission
(Almunia) responded that he would no longer pursue a ban but that new
compatibility conditions would have to be rigorously enforced if this
aid was to be allowed to continue. I also expressed concern
that the state aid approval process was too slow, unnecessarily
delaying much needed Government
interventions.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13022758000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/wmstext/130227m0001.htm#13022758000024">Following
lunch I, along with another 23 states, signed the unified patent court
agreement. This international agreement is the final piece of the

final substantive agenda item was a discussion on the European
semester, including the annual growth survey. Again, Shan Morgan took
the UK seat. There was a full round-table on the subject with most
member states (including the UK) focusing on the need for improved
governance of the single market, the full implementation of the
services directive and improved access to finance. The UK highlighted
the creation of a single market centre in the UK to tackle problems
here, and also suggested the Commission define a proportionality test
to ensure that implementation of the services directive was more
uniform across the
EU.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13022758000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/wmstext/130227m0001.htm#13022758000026">Several
AOB items were discussed at the Council. The first concerned the
European steel industry, an item requested by the Belgian delegation.
Several member states intervened to stress the need for, and importance
of, a native steel industry in Europe—with some going as far as
suggesting state aid rules could be relaxed in this area. This
suggestion was strongly countered by other member states. I
intervened to stress that restructuring in the industry should be
industry-led, and any role of Government should be in stimulating
demand.</hs_Para>

next AOB point was an item on the tobacco
regulation, as requested by the Polish delegation. Some states were
concerned that the proposal, to be discussed by Health Ministers, did
not take sufficient account of the negative impacts on competitiveness.

trade/industry missions that he had recently undertaken. In this
context, he had invited hundreds of EU companies to meet with
presidents/senior Ministers of third countries and had signed
56 “non-binding” memorandums of understanding

do this, DECC intends to introduce a degression-based approach similar
to the regime adopted for the feed-in tariffs scheme. This will involve
tariffs available to new applicants being gradually reduced if uptake
of the technologies supported under the RHI is greater than forecast.

series of “triggers”. Monthly updates on progress towards
triggers will be published online and one month’s notice will be

scheme continues to provide value for money. DECC also intends to
review the scheme in 2014 and 2017 to ensure the tariffs continue to be

ONS produces estimates of Long-Term International Migration (LTIM),
primarily based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS). The IPS is
a continuous voluntary sample survey conducted by ONS and is the prime
source of long-term international migration data for the UK providing
estimates of both inflows and outflows. The IPS collects data on
immigrants' main reason for migrating to the UK which does not
necessarily align to the classifications under the Immigration (EEA)
Regulations 2006. Data on self-employed and self-sufficient people are
not collected by the
IPS.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13022794002994" tab="yes" url="13022794002994">Table
1 shows the IPS estimates of non-British EU citizens migrating to the
UK between 2006 and 2011 whose main reason for migrating was work
related, to study or to seek work. These are the latest estimates
available and were published on 29 November 2012. Estimates for 2012
will be published on 28
November2013.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13022794002995" tab="yes" url="13022794002995">(ii)
The Annual Population Survey (APS) provides estimates of UK
residents by nationality. However information on year of arrival is
only collected for those born outside the UK, so the country of birth
measure has been used to determine people born within EU member
countries. Additionally it is not possible to measure the status of EU
born people under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006
classifications, although the APS can provide estimates based upon the
International Labour Organization (ILO) measure. The categories
requested have been answered under the ILO measure where possible, with
students defined as those currently enrolled on an education course,
Data on self-sufficient people is not collected by the
APS.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13022794002996" tab="yes" url="13022794002996">Table

indicated in the

write in response to Parliamentary Questions regarding the number of
occasions that senior retired officers have visited the MOD over the
last few years and information on third parties who have passes to
access the Ministry of Defence (MOD) main building. The Minister of
State for the Armed Forces, Hon. Andrew Robathan MP, informed you that
we would provide this information once the Permanent Secretary had
reviewed the access that six named retired military officers maintain
to Defence, the rules around such access, compliance with those rules,
and the level of transparency adopted by the Department. Following my
announcement in the House today, I am pleased to confirm the details of
our
review.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13022794003007" tab="yes" url="13022794003007">This
review has taken some time to complete, as a central record, of
meetings between MOD staff and retired personnel is not kept. The size
of the Department and the natural turnover of staff would make this an
impossible and disproportionate task to record routinely. However, the
review exercise has gathered an extensive amount of information about
the level of access that the six named individuals maintained to senior
civilian and military staff. It found no evidence to indicate that
retired or former employees have, or are able, to influence any MOD
equipment
contracts.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13022794003008" tab="yes" url="13022794003008">A

challenge’ focused on boosting diagnosis rates, improving
research and creating dementia friendly communities. In support of the
PM Challenge on Dementia, 
<?notus-xml column=431?>the placeholder indicator 2.6 ‘Enhancing the quality of life for
people with dementia’ was updated in November 2012. For 2013-14,
the NHS Outcomes Framework includes a two-part indicator, the first
part of which measures diagnosis rates for people with dementia, there
being evidence that receiving early diagnosis is an important outcome
for people living with dementia and their carers, enabling them to
better cope with their condition and improving their health-related
quality of
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022794000691" tab="yes" url="13022794000691">As
diagnosis rate is not a direct measure of the outcome sought, a second
complementary measure is being developed which will measure the
effectiveness of post-diagnosis care in sustaining independence and
improving quality of life. This indicator will be shared with the Adult
Social Care Outcomes Framework. The data and methodology that the
indicator will be based on are currently being assessed for their
robustness as part of a Department of Health-funded research programme.
Preliminary results are expected in mid 2014, so the date when the
indicator will be available is not yet known at this stage.</hs_Para>

fluoridation of drinking water. In our view, fluoridation offers the
best option for reducing inequalities in oral health, but it has been
the policy of successive Governments that decisions on fluoridation
should be taken locally. We do not wish to impose fluoridation
centrally but, through the Health and Social Care Act 2012, we have
made arrangements for public consultations and decision on fluoridation
to be undertaken by local authorities with effect from April 2013.
There 
<?notus-xml column=438?>have been water fluoridation schemes in operation in England for over 40
years, even longer in the United States of America, and the only risk
to health that has been identified is dental fluorosis, a white

monitoring relevant research, the Department is to publish reports on

means-testing in assessing an applicant's eligibility for a particular
benefit, such as a disabled person's concessionary bus travel pass, or
exemption from Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). The Department provides
guidance which takes account of the applicant's receipt of other
relevant state benefits. For example, a disabled person would be
eligible for a bus pass and exempt from VED if in receipt of certain
mobility allowances, such as the higher rate mobility component of
Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or War Pensioners Mobility Supplement

Finland as the designated host country for the Middle East WMD Free

as facilitator for the conference. Since then, the co-convenors have
regularly met with the facilitator and the states of the region to
discuss progress towards the conference. Foreign and Commonwealth
Office (FCO) Ministers discussed the conference with counterparts in
the middle east, and our officials travelled to the region to promote

Heath:</Member></B> In the last six months, the Animal Health and
Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) have issued two verbal warnings
on transporters undertaking live animal exports from Ramsgate Port. The
reasons for the two verbal warnings were (1) a transporter not having
the means to measure the water level in the tank containing the animals
drinking water; however, the AHVLA inspector could see there was
sufficient water for the journey: and (2) one ventilation fan was not
functioning at the time of inspection, but was fixed by the driver
before the journey continued. No further action was taken against the
two transporters, although the warnings have been recorded and will be
taken into account if further infringements of the legislation are made
by the same transporters.

goods, facilities and services, the exercise of public functions, and
the running of private clubs and associations came into effect on 1
October 2012, when the relevant provisions of the Equality Act 2010
came into force. The ban is designed to catch only those actions or
omissions that result in genuinely unfair discrimination because of
age. It does not stop service providers offering age-specific goods and
services which are beneficial or justifiable, such as priority flu
vaccinations and age-related concessions, such as cheaper rates for
using leisure
facilities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302284003241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/text/130227w0002.htm#1302284003241">We
have established a Women's Business Council, an advisory body for
Ministers, which is looking at ways of maximising women's contribution
to economic growth. The council is considering the needs of older women
in the context of extended working lives, recognising that older women
require targeted support to stay in the workplace and to develop their
skills to meet new challenges. The Council will make recommendations to
Ministers in the

determine its priorities and work plan, and these are set out in the
EHRC's annual business plan.</hs_Para>

prisons named have been located together on the same wings thereby
enabling them to mix during periods of association. However, where the
available prison cellular accommodation is designed to hold two
offenders, young adults (ie aged 18 to 21 years of age) and adults do
not share cells. Both young adult and adult offenders are able to
access equally all facilities and services offered by the individual
prisons such as education, work opportunities, health services and the
Chaplaincy. This also includes periods of access to the open air and

state aid clearance by the Broadband Delivery UK State Aid National

at the start of this year. The delay in receiving the umbrella state
aid clearance from the European Commission last year may mean that the

Data relating to work experience and sector-based work academy
referrals are not available; the data shows the number of claimants
that started on these schemes.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>2.
Values are rounded to the nearest
10.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. The numbers refer to the number
of claimants referred or started (Official Statistics publishes the
number of referrals/starts, i.e. for some schemes there maybe multiple
referrals/starts for one claimant).</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>4.
Some claimants may have been referred or started on more than one work
placement scheme.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>5. Work experience
started in January 2011. Sector-based work academies started from 1
August 2011 in England and from 30 January 2012 in Scotland. They are
not available in Wales. Some testing took place in Scotland prior to
the official launch date and the figures are included in the
table.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>6. A work experience start is
defined as the date the claimant accepted their work experience
placement with the employer. This is input by an adviser to the
Jobcentre Plus' Labour Market
System.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>7. A start on sector-based work
academy pre-employment training is defined as the first date the
claimant attended sector-based work academy pre-employment training.
The number of starts was based on the individual claimant level data
supplied by further education colleges or training providers and
entered by an adviser onto the Jobcentre Plus' Labour Market System.
Further education colleges and training providers may submit data on
starts some time after the actual event
occurred.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>8. The Community Action
Programme (CAP) was part of a randomised control trial to test support
options for the very long term unemployed. A “referral”
to CAP is defined as a random allocation to the programme.
Randomisation took place 13-15 weeks before claimants started the
programme.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>9. A referral to Mandatory
Work Activity is defined as the date the claimant is referred to the
placement, recorded within their adviser interview. This was inputted
by the adviser to the Jobcentre Plus' Labour Market
System.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>10. Between 16 January and 31
March 2012 the Department trail-blazed an extension of Mandatory Work
Activity across five Jobcentre Plus districts in London, Wales and the
West Midlands. The trailblazer tested how the scheme works for
claimants who have received more than one labour-market sanction or
disallowance within the last year. Numbers for January 2012 and
February 2012 therefore include referrals to the ‘MWA
Trailblazer’.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>11 .Work programme
referrals shown are ‘net’ referrals which do not include
rejections, cancellations or referrals to ESA information
sessions.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>12. Work programme mandatory
referrals are classified as referrals to the following customer groups:
JSA 18-24, JSA 25+, JSA NEET, JSA Claiming 22 of 24 months, JSA ExIB,
ESA (IR) WRAG 3/6 Month Mandatory, ESA (IR) WRAG 3/6 Month Mandatory
ExIB and JSA Ex-offender Day 1 Mandation. More detailed information can

groups are assigned by Jobcentre Plus, on the basis of a claimant's
circumstances, and benefit they receive. A small number of claimants
appear in an incorrect group caused by the way information is recorded

If a participant fails to attend an appointment, the provider will
first discuss the reasons with the participant and seek practical
solutions to any problems that have prevented attendance. It will be

Kingdom-wide, 1964—present. Following advice from the Committee
on Safety of Medicines in 1983, the indications for phenylbutazone

The majority of the ADRs were therefore reported prior to restriction

Soubry:</Member></B> Phenylbutazone can cause aplastic anaemia in
humans but there is not a clear link between the amount consumed and
the subsequent risk of the disease. As such it has not been possible to
identify a safe limit and therefore phenylbutazone is not permitted for
use in food producing animals. However, it can be prescribed for humans
in severe cases of one specific condition (ankylosing spondylitis)
where other treatments have been found
unsuitable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022717000001" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/text/130227w0004.htm#13022717000001"></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022717000002" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/text/130227w0004.htm#13022717000002"><B>[Continued
