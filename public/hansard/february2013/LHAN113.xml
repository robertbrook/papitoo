as the noble Lord said, a convention. I am sure he recalls that it was
developed in the 1780s as a way to protect the Cabinet as a whole
against the monarch, who wished to call Cabinet Ministers in one by one
to ask them what they personally thought; it was not originally
concerned with Parliament at all. There is a very useful document with
which noble Lords may not be familiar, which accompanied the coalition
agreement, entitled the<I> Coalition Agreement for Stability and

two parties agreed that on certain issues they might not be able to
vote together. I have two points. First, does the noble Lord not
acknowledge that the coalition agreement has had no endorsement from
the British public and that it is very odd for the current Government
just to set aside what the <I>Ministerial Code</I> says, of their own
volition? More specifically, can he tell the House where in that
agreement there was a specific set-aside on the issue of the vote that

out that the strongest mandate in the 1997 Labour manifesto was a

there are disagreements that are accepted. In a grown-up society, it is

we take account of that, nevertheless that does not mean that these
potential limitations would apply to other organisations wanting to set
up a voluntary register. Our view is that that avenue should be

is the competence and training of the individual involved. We are not
oblivious to the concerns in this area. That is why we have already
announced a number of further measures to support healthcare
assistants. For example, we have just created an innovation fund of
£13 million for the training and education of unregulated health
professionals. The Care Quality Commission will undertake a review of
inductions for care staff to make sure that nobody can provide
unsupervised help without an appropriate level of training, and we have
the work currently being done by Skills for Health and Skills for Care.
Their report has now been received and embodies suggestions for a code
of conduct and induction standards for health and social care
workers.</hs_para>

The voluntary register does not necessarily cover the total safety of
patients unless they are supervised. There is an issue about the
minimum levels of registered nurses who can supervise support workers.
When will the Government look at minimum standards for the registered
nurses to enable sufficient supervision? The evidence base is that
effective care and cost-effective care are reliant on the number of
registered nurses who can supervise support
workers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000035"><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13021361000214" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000214"><B>Earl

important issue. She will know that the code of conduct for nurses
specifically covers supervision where necessary. My department has
instigated a number of measures to support local decision- making to
get skill mix profiles right. They include the QIPP programme, which is
a key driver for getting the skill mix right through producing tools
and programmes in that area. The NHS Institute for Innovation and
Improvement supplies case studies and other resources to help NHS
provider organisations deliver their QIPP strategies, and NHS employers
also deliver guidance and support to help employers better plan their

recommend, it is unlikely to be an alternative hub airport somewhere
else in the near future—at least in the next 15 or 20 years.
Therefore, would it not be wise to allow Heathrow fully to prepare for
the likely decision to go ahead with a third runway, even if only in
the short term, because otherwise we will be shutting ourselves out of
the global economy? Will the Minister take that back to his department?

All parties now agree with us that handing further powers to an already

the regulatory body being set up by the press and the verifying or
overseeing body for which we suggest a royal charter is used. Let us be
clear: the charter does not create a regulator, rather it establishes
the body that will oversee it. The regulatory system that the royal
charter body will oversee will be tough and the regulator will have the
power to: investigate serious or systemic breaches of the press code;
impose up to £1 million fines; and require corrections and other
remedies, including prominent apologies. The royal charter
body will provide tough oversight and ensure that the new regulatory
body is efficient and

implement Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendations, 82% believe

proposes is fair and reasonable, as it protects free speech as well as
protecting people from abuse and harassment by the press, and that
there is no justification for watering it down? What we want is
Leveson, not Leveson-lite. Does he also accept that the most
straightforward way of implementing Leveson is by statute rather than
the rather archaic and cumbersome proposals we have before us today,
which are neither fish nor fowl—a royal charter plus
parliamentary safeguards and a separate statute? Does he agree that
Leveson has given Parliament the opportunity once and for all to clean
up the practices and behaviours of the press that have made a misery of

out that there seems to have been a mistake in the timing of the Urgent

after the contributions from the Front Benches on both sides. On this
occasion that was not the case, and a number of Back-Benchers who
wanted to get in were not able to do so. Will the Leader of the House
confirm that after the Question repeated by the Front Bench and the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and

Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2013. This is
the first of our debates this afternoon on a series of welfare reform
regulations that together will bring forward fundamental changes to the
welfare
state.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000100">First I
will say how grateful I am to the many Members of this House who have
taken a close interest in these reforms. Many noble Lords have attended
various briefing sessions intended to explain and debate key policy
details, keeping up the dialogue that started during the passage of the
Welfare Reform Act 2012. This House has been, and will continue to be,
invaluable in shaping our reforms, whether on PIP or universal
credit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000101">While
some areas of the regulations are necessarily quite technical and
detailed, at the core of our reforms we are creating a new relationship
between the individual and the state. These regulations will introduce
the universal credit that lies at the
heart of our welfare reform programme—a single, income-related
benefit for working-age
adults.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000102">Universal
credit is intended to be radically simpler than the complex web of tax
credits and benefits that it replaces. We have made a deliberate choice
in this. It would be all too easy to replicate the current system in 
<?notus-xml column=665?>all its complexity. Some noble Lords have criticised us for relying too
heavily on a rational model of human behaviour. We know that incentives
work only if people can understand them and can see that with each and
every hour of extra earnings they will be better off. Therefore, these
regulations deliver a single taper of 65% instead of multiple and
sometimes overlapping tapers, and an end to people cycling between
different benefits and tax credits when their circumstances
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000103">Given
the undoubted importance of these reforms, when draft regulations were
ready in June last year, my right honourable friend the Secretary of
State invited the Social Security Advisory Committee to undertake a
special exercise to scrutinise them. The committee undertook a public
consultation exercise as part of its review and produced a very helpful
report. In our response, published on 10 December, we accepted most of
the committee’s 36 recommendations and welcomed the
acknowledgement that the Government’s proposals for simplifying
the benefit system have the broad support of a significant number of
consultation

the same time, the department undertook extensive stakeholder
engagement in workshops and smaller meetings with individual bodies. As
a result of this valued input, the policies expressed in these
regulations take account of the views of many interested parties. I
will give a couple of practical examples of where we have
listened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:00:46"></hs_TimeCode>. We
discovered that claimants found the phrase “earnings
disregard” incomprehensible, so I can announce that this phrase
has been abolished. I suspect that the only people who understood it
are in this Chamber today. Noble Lords will be pleased to note that the
regulations now provide for “work
allowances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:01:10"></hs_TimeCode>”.
With regard to self-employment, the Government have decided that where
a claimant has been self-employed for fewer than 12 months, a start-up
period will be granted. This means that claimants will not be required
to satisfy work search or availability requirements, and the minimum
income floor will not be applied, giving them time to concentrate on
developing their business. The Government have also decided to allow
further start-up periods for self-employed claimants —one new
start-up period every five years. I can further announce
today that when we migrate people over to universal credit who are
already running their own business, we will provide a similar six-month
grace period before they need to make any adjustments under universal
credit. In addition, the regulations now provide that 100%
of contributions to an occupational or personal pension scheme will be
disregarded when calculating
earnings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:02:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

(Transitional Provisions) Regulations will enable the universal credit
pathfinder to be launched from 29 April 2013. That is six months
earlier than we previously said universal credit would start, so we are
not just on time but, in this case, ahead of time. However, it is
important to stress that the pathfinder is a deliberately limited first
step. Its purpose is to enable us to test basic processes and systems,
and to make sure that the core around which universal credit is built
is working effectively before being rolled out nationally. That is a
sensible approach to such a 
<?notus-xml column=666?>large-scale programme of change. It is an approach that we have planned
for and have always intended to take. Many noble Lords have urged that
we do not rush into implementing reforms on this scale, and
organisations such as the Child Poverty Action Group have made a
similar point. I am pleased that we all agree on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000106">During
the pathfinder, a restricted group of people will be able to apply for
universal credit, limited to the more straightforward cases. The
Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations specify those
cases in detail. Broadly speaking, we will accept claims from
jobseekers, including people with very low earnings, who are single and
fit for work and who have no children, are not homeowners and do not
have any awards of existing benefits or tax credits. The pathfinder
will operate in four local authority areas in Greater Manchester and
Cheshire: Oldham, Tameside, Warrington and Wigan. Noble Lords will have
noticed that the regulations do not include those locations. That is
because the order commencing the relevant provisions of the Act will do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:04:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

will accept around 9,000 claims for universal credit during
the pathfinder. That will be our first step towards our phased approach
to the national rollout. From October, we will see the scope of
universal credit extending beyond the pathfinder in three ways. First,
a wider group of people will be eligible to apply. We will also extend
incrementally the geographical scope of universal credit, and we will
extend and enhance the capabilities of the online service. We will make
adjustments and refine our plans as we learn lessons from each stage of
the rollout from the pathfinder onwards. That means that we will make
further sets of transitional regulations as we move through the
delivery phases. Later this year, therefore, regulations providing for
the national launch will be laid in good time before it starts in

Universal Credit Regulations 2013. These set out provisions for
universal credit including entitlement, elements of the award,
calculation of income and capital, and claimant responsibilities. For
claimants in paid employment, the automated link to the real-time

innovation. DWP and HMRC officials have worked closely together on the
requirements and delivery of RTI and its support for universal credit.
The RTI pilot is going well. HMRC is on track to expand the pilot and
expects to have around 6 million individuals’ records reported
in real time by March 2013.</hs_para>

in December 2012. An estimated 3.1 million households will be better
off by an average of £168 a month under universal credit. This
includes an expected improvement in the take-up of benefits where
people do not currently claim all their entitlements.
Potentially, the equivalent of up to 300,000 additional people will be
in work from the improved financial incentives. The extra investment
with childcare costs to people working fewer than 16 hours
per week is now expected to help 100,000 additional families at a cost
of £200 million. We are investing £2 billion
upfront on the development and delivery—for example,

the House. On 31 January, I placed sections of the draft guidance in
the Library of the House. These cover key aspects including childcare,
the claimant commitment, good reason, hardship payments, and exempt and
temporary accommodation. My officials have worked with stakeholders to
produce the guidance and, having consulted the Social Security Advisory

main route to accessing universal credit will be through digital

department has worked closely with HMRC and local authorities to
develop these arrangements, and on 11 February we published details of
the local support services framework.
Universal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:08:34"></hs_TimeCode> credit
will generally be just one monthly payment per household, making it
easier for people to understand their entitlement and to take
responsibility for managing their own finances, but in order to support
people in vulnerable situations we have developed a payments exception
service. This service includes budgeting support and the facility to
pay some people on a fortnightly basis, with a view to moving over time
to monthly payments. I know there is a good deal of interest in this
House about how the arrangements will work for claimants with the most
challenging circumstances. Let me reassure noble Lords that the

believe that this is probably one of the most important set of
regulations your Lordships will debate this Session. The main Universal
Credit Regulations operationalise the workings of the new system
of means- tested benefits for most working-age people. This
is huge. They constitute the framework which supports the huge tent
that is universal credit, into which millions of people will be moved
over time. The Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations
provide the detail of how people will move into the tent. In working
through this considerable amount of material, I have been impressed by
and grateful for the detailed work done by many stakeholder
organisations, including the Children’s Society, Citizens Advice
and many others. We on these Benches also broadly support the principle
of a single structure for working-age support, but we have always said
that the design and implementation are all. These regulations are
too important to the many citizens who depend on the money
that the state provides to them for us not to go over them in
detail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000116">Now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:14:31"></hs_TimeCode>
that we have most of the regulations and some, but not all, of the
guidance, what was a pile of canvas on the floor is starting to take
shape as a tent. It raises some very significant concerns, the first of
which is money. In the Second Reading of the Welfare Benefits Up-rating
Bill on Monday, we heard of the huge losses already being faced by many
low and middle-income families, with more to come. We are about to find
that significant numbers of people are going to be worse off as a
result of universal credit. The impact assessment states
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13021361000148" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000148">“3.1

now; but that 2.8 million will have a lower entitlement and that
300,000 households will lose more than £300 a month. These are
significant sums. There is of course transitional protection at the
point of moving across if someone is actively moved on to the new
system. However, if someone claims universal credit because they have
lost their job or had a baby, they will not get any protection. As the
Welfare Reform Bill went through both Houses of Parliament, we were
repeatedly assured that the new system would make sure that work always
paid and that more work would pay more. I have been struggling to
reconcile those assurances with the views of many experts outside the
House who have made representations to most of your
Lordships.</hs_parafo> 
<?notus-xml column=669?><hs_para UID="13021361000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000117">Regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:14:31"></hs_TimeCode>
22 sets out the way in which income from work will be treated for the
purposes of withdrawing universal credit.
To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:14:31"></hs_TimeCode> understand
what that will mean in practice, we have to go through the impact
assessment, which contains details of what are called
“participation tax rates”—which reflect how much a
claimant would gain from moving into work—and “marginal
deduction rates”, which reflect how much better off they would
be from increasing their earnings once they were in work. When I read
this, I was astonished to find that more people will see their marginal
deduction rates rise than fall; so some people will get to keep more of
every pound that they earn than now, but more people will get to keep
less of every pound that they earn than now. Some 1.8 million first
earners will have higher marginal deduction rates under universal
credit and 1.3 million will have lower ones. Similarly, most second
earners will face higher marginal deduction rates than now, and couples
with children are generally likely to see an increase rather than a
decrease in those marginal deduction rates. How can this be in a system
that is designed, surely, to make work pay? I think the culprits are
found in different
places.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000118" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000118">First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:14:31"></hs_TimeCode>,
there is childcare. Currently, the childcare element of working tax
credit covers up to 70% of childcare costs for children in working
families. However, many low-income working families can currently get
up to 96% of their childcare costs covered through the tax and benefits
system. The extra 26% comes through an allowance within housing benefit
and council tax benefit. Around 100,000 families—about
20%—who get help with childcare through the system get this
extra money. But under universal credit, that will not be around. The
Children’s Society estimates that this will leave some of the
lowest-income working families paying more than seven times as much out
of their own
pockets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000119">Barnardo’s
did some detailed figures and discovered a whole series of
circumstances in which parents could be worse off by doing more
work—precisely what the system is not meant to do. For example,
a lone parent with two young children ends up in effect paying to work
once she starts having to use paid childcare rather than free
childcare. Does the Minister accept that there is a problem in making
work pay for parents who pay for
childcare?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13021361000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000166">4.15

area is mortgage interest. The regulations provide for claimants to
receive help with mortgage interest in certain circumstances. But
paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 states that once that claimant does
any paid work at all, all help with mortgage interest stops
immediately; at present they can get help if they do up to 16
hours’ work a week. Aside from being rather ungenerous, this
creates a huge cliff edge for someone wanting to move into work and
goes against the grain of making sure that under universal credit
work—even a few hours—will always pay. The new work
allowances are little or no help if you want to do only a few
hours’ work.</hs_para>

issue for rich people who own houses. I spent some years running a
charity working with single parents, which has now merged with
Gingerbread. Over the years I met many women who 
<?notus-xml column=670?>had to give up their jobs when their partner left because all the
childcare arrangements had been predicated around having two people to
look after the children. They were usually desperate to stay in the
marital home for a time to try to give the children some stability when
they had just lost one parent, but when that single parent began to try
to get a foot back into work she would instantly lose all the help with
her mortgage, which could put her home at risk. Surely that does not
make any sense. Can the Minister tell us whether the Government will
think again on that? In particular, can he reassure the House that in
those circumstances somebody would be deemed as having what is called
“good cause” in the regulations not to take a job if the
result was that, for the sake of a few hours’ work, they could
lose their
home?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000122">The
third area is the self-employed. I believe that my noble friend Lady
Donaghy will once again take up the cudgel on behalf of the
self-employed people of Britain, for which I am sure they are
enormously grateful. We have been very impressed by her in this. I will
not linger, given that she will do that. I am very grateful that the
Minister has made some concessions but it is still the case that the
way universal credit treats the self-employed is really very
problematic. It could create serious disincentives to starting a
business. Given the lack of growth in the economy, we should not be
doing anything to discourage anyone from starting a business or trying
to develop
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000123">The Social

Their Families</I>, the report of the inquiry chaired by the noble
Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson. Now that the regulations have given us
the final details of the levels of entitlement, it is clear that a
great many disabled people stand to lose often significant sums. I am
sure that other noble Lords will comment on this, but does the Minister
accept the figure in the report by the noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson, that 230,000 severely disabled people who do not have
another adult to assist them could lose up to £58 a week as a
result of the abolition of the severe disability premium and the
failure of universal credit to provide a counterpart to
this?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021361000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021361000125">Then
there is housing. Regulation 26 and Schedule 4 contain
details of the new size criteria for social housing—the much
criticised bedroom tax, which will penalise some 660,000 households,
two-thirds of which have a disability. Despite the Government claiming
that this 
<?notus-xml column=671?>was about freeing up larger housing, we all know that smaller properties
do not exist, a point underscored by the original impact assessment,
which made clear that the Government were assuming that most people
would stay put and just take the hit in their benefit. People could
lose an average of £14 a week. I know that this is something to

reading the regulations, I was disappointed to find that the Government

is impossible to know whether anybody will be better off until we know
what will happen to passported benefits in universal credit. The
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions indicated at the start of
proceedings on the Welfare Reform Bill in another place that he would
announce proposals on eligibility for free school meals before that
committee finished its work. We are still waiting. Can the Minister
tell the House what is happening with passported benefits and can he

there is conditionality. The regulations seem on the face of it to
contain a serious tightening of the conditionality rules applying to
single parents. I shall give just a few examples. At present, a single
parent with a dependent child aged 13 or over can limit the hours that
he or she is available for work according to their caring
responsibilities. Under the regulations, they can do so only if they
can show that they have reasonable prospects of finding work. How will
that work? If I were a single parent in that circumstance and the only
jobs in my area were night shifts in a petrol station, would I be
required to take that job? Or would the fact that I could not leave my
13 year-old at home alone be definitely good cause for my being allowed
to turn that job down? What would happen to a single parent whose child
was excluded from school or who was made the subject of a parenting
order? At the moment, the regulations provide that a lone parent is
allowed to limit her work-search requirements in those circumstances in
the interests of the child but, again, there is no such counterpart in
the regulations. What if she could not afford or find suitable
childcare? Again, the current regulations could give her protection;
the new ones do not. A single parent who refused to take a job for any
of those reasons could be sanctioned for three or six months, or even
three years, of her
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:21:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that are against the spirit of the regulations. Will, even at this last
moment, the Minister reconsider this? If not, will he confirm for the
record that no single parent will be sanctioned for the reasons that I
have cited? Will he agree to guarantee that all the flexibilities

you have to be between 18 and 60.5, single, British, and not pregnant

have children or young people living with you; not be liable to pay

earnings; not be in education or training; not be awaiting a decision
on entitlement to a relevant benefit; not be deemed not to have mental

£6,000; your earned income in the next month must not exceed
£270 for those aged under 25 or £330 for those aged over
25; you must not be homeless and you must be living at your normal

I have a specific question. Regulation 13 covers what happens if a

tax credit, but the new system is very ungenerous on backdating. I
understand that DWP will deem the claim as having been made on the date
that the universal credit claim was made, provided that it is not more
than a month later. Will the claim definitely be processed in a month?
Although that sounds a small point, if for some reason it takes longer

support that we as Liberal Democrats give to the introduction of
universal credit is constant, but the architecture now being put in
place raises a large number of questions about much of the detail. I
appreciate that much of it has been in guidance rather than in the
regulations themselves. We do not have all the guidance at present and
some of it is stamped “Not official” but is guidance for
guidance that may well become official in days to

end of the regulations, which is monitoring and evaluation. Noble Lords
who sat through the process of the Welfare Reform Bill becoming an Act
will know that that is an issue with which we vexed ourselves greatly
at the time. I am pleased to have received the programme produced by
the Government, which tells us that we will be engaged in what is
called the theory of change model. How far does that proposal vary from
the traditional route for evaluation methodologies used by the
Department for Work and Pensions—in fact, used by the Government
as a whole—particularly in respect of
behavioural change? If there 
<?notus-xml column=674?>is one thing that we must learn from the
regulations, it is that they need to be continually reviewed and
changed. I am pleased that the guidance on some of the sets of
regulations that we are debating today says that they will be
continually updated. However, we need to know what the process is for
that and particularly to have some sense of a timeline and of how
Parliament can be engaged with the outcomes, and not just in the
set-piece debates and milestones that have been the fairly traditional
route for this Parliament to deal with these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:30:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

starting at the rear end but there are a number of very important
questions, some of which were raised by the noble Baroness, Lady
Sherlock. I start with the question of the claimant commitment. I must
ask my noble friend what the effect is on universal credit of the new
regulations that were laid last night and the court ruling which
preceded them. It seems that on the regulations which the court ruled
to be not in accordance with the primary legislation, that was not
about the content but rather in respect of the primary legislation to
which they related. I should be grateful if my noble friend could
reassure us that these regulations in no way impact on that court
decision or on the new regulations which were laid last night by the
Government and are now in effect.</hs_para>

respect of the claimant commitment and the worked examples, which I
found very useful indeed, is there not clearly a difference between
commitment and a contract? They do not appear as a contract but do
appear to be very much a commitment by the claimant, without any
recognition of what level of support Jobcentre Plus, and the Government
as a whole, will provide for that claimant. I wonder whether there
might be an element of expression of the sorts of services that a
claimant could rightly expect to receive to assist a claimant through
the process laid out in the claimant commitment.</hs_para>

regime, on which we have now had some detail. The guidance we have
received refers to “good reason” as opposed to good
cause. The guidance on good reason says that it is not defined in law
but that good cause has been considered in case law. I wonder whether
there is a deliberate reason for choosing those different words because
that might then avoid the case law, which has already been gone
through, in order to provide what might cause a reasonable person to
act as they did. The guidance itself seems to draw heavily on the good
cause experience as provided through the courts. I wonder whether there
are significant differences within the guidance provided on how good
reason might be shown and how good cause can be shown under the current
legislative procedures.</hs_para>

awards has concerned many Members of your Lordships’ House as
has the issue of direct payments to landlords. On the monthly awards,
there is clearly a need for extensive money advice. I looked at the
guidance we were given on the local support services framework. It
states in outline only that it starts to draw up a programme for a
relationship between central and local government on welfare issues. I
wonder how far that debate has gone and what the 
<?notus-xml column=675?>Government’s intentions are in order to be able to deal with, and
react swiftly to, difficulties which individuals may have. We could
think of many examples where it might be necessary either to shift
payment between one claimant and another in a household or to move to a
more frequent system on a time-limited basis. I wonder whether there is
pressure in the guidance on the decision-makers to be able to implement
that fairly rapidly.</hs_para>

a set of criteria that are the factors to consider for alternative
payment arrangements. There are tier one, which is headed with a red
bar, and tier two, which is headed with a green bar, but no weightings
are given to those factors. For transparency purposes, I wonder whether
my noble friend would like to outline some of the weightings
that are to be given to those factors
so that people would know when it might be appropriate for them to be
able to find exceptions to the monthly awards and direct payments

noble friend made strong play, and I think he was supported very
widely, of finding new financial products to be able to help people to
manage their money on a monthly basis. We have frequently talked about
jam jars and jam-jar accounts, and about the difference between
prepayments and direct debits. The evidence at paragraph 57
in the response from the Government to the SSAC was that 1.3 million
potential new universal credit claimants do not use a transactional
bank account. I should like to hear some more today on what is going to
happen to these new products. Are we going to see them in time for the
pathfinders, and certainly for the rollout in October, to be able to
take advantage of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:36:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021364000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021364000010">On
direct payments to landlords, an issue that I know many social housing
associations are concerned about, the pilot studies so far show that
92% of the due rent has been collected on time—but of course
that means that 8% has not been collected on time. When the pilots end
in June, which is not far short of the October introduction and full
rollout, will my noble friend be publishing the final arrangements as
close to the June date as possible so that there will be some speed of
engagement with individuals’ difficulties? Will he be indicating
how third parties, such as landlords and so on, will be able to make an
intervention as swiftly as possible to ensure that rent is
paid <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:37:06"></hs_TimeCode>and

his introduction, my noble friend mentioned compatibility with the
European Convention on Human Rights. This relates, of course, to the
additional bedroom for a disabled child and overnight carer, and to
paragraphs 10, 25 and 36 of Schedule 4 to the Universal Credit
Regulations before us. Guidance will be relied on to supplement these
regulations, but the guidance states that local authorities under the
current regime, which is the one where the legal case stands, may wish
to consider suspending the part of the housing benefit relating to the
additional room. Does my noble friend accept that that puts people in a
very difficult position as some local authorities may decide, as it is
purely advisory and it is a consideration that they can make, that they
should pay for an additional bedroom for a disabled child? That is what
is being challenged by the Government but it is the current legislative
position that they find themselves in. Some local
authorities 
<?notus-xml column=676?>may provide the cash and others may not, but they are obliged to
consider it. Therefore, it might be in the award but not paid or it
might be in the award and
paid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:38:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021364000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021364000012">I
notice from the Explanatory Memorandum that new guidance is to be
issued, with the Government saying that all this will not be decided
for some time. With regard to the timescales that my noble friend often
provides to your Lordships’ House, when late autumn often
becomes Christmas and early spring often becomes summer, the words
“decided for some time” mean that it may be some years
before the courts reach their final conclusion on this matter. I wonder
whether we need to have that certainty now in regulations, or certainly
in the guidance, to support those
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:39:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021364000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021364000013">I
shall conclude with the issues about digital. The Government are
persuaded, of course, that “digital by default” is where
we should be for applications and submissions regarding universal
credit. I understand that only
14<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>% of main
benefit claimants currently put in a new claim online—that is in
the local government briefing—but 45% said that they would need
help or support to apply online in future. That is a very substantial
number of people. The arrangements for supporting people are crucially
going to be conducted through agencies, including local government. I
notice that the Government have been working with the Local Government
Association, the Scottish local government association and the Welsh
Local Government Association to find a route forward on these matters.
The document that the Government have provided us with, <I>Universal
Credit</I><I>—</I><I>Local Support Services Framework</I>,

my noble friend say when the conversation is likely to end and when
local government is likely to know how much money it will get in order
to be able to provide those services? It seems to me that those
supportive services need to be in place in advance of a rollout so that
people know where to turn. For example, on online applications, where
libraries will be the obvious place for undertaking such work, I wonder
whether the conversation needs to come to a rapid conclusion. Will my
noble friend indicate when that might be? There are also data transfer
and data protection issues because people will need to be able to share
information between one group and another.</hs_parafo>

negative, but the thrust of these regulations is in the right
direction. However, when we are having such an enormous change to the
structure of our welfare system, it is crucial that the necessary
architecture is in place. I hope that my noble friend will be able at
least to provide us with some indication of how Parliament can engage
in the journey that is likely to take place over the next two years to
ensure that we get the best out of the universal credit. That is the
ambition we all want to
achieve.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_13_PT_1/07B5E09B96FF362D82B5796582D2862DD0D44EB1" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 February 2013">Wednesday,

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, like my noble friend, I thank
the Minister and the Box for the papers and seminars that we have found
so helpful. I congratulate my noble friend on her powerful scrutiny of
some very extensive regulations that effectively took 17 days in
Committee to debate.</hs_para>

Freud, admitted that the regulations assume economic rationality. As a
result, they are heavy on sanctions—in my view, appallingly
heavy sanctions in Regulation 102 lasting for up to three
years—believing that they can sanction people into the behaviour
they want. However, as abundant research shows—I am sure that
the Minister is familiar with it—and as the Trussell food bank
network confirms, most people do not know why they have been
sanctioned. It is as though it has happened to them. They live chaotic
and confusing lives, to the intense irritation of the benefits staff.
The CAB says that the claimant does not understand the responsibilities
and the adviser does not understand the claimant. The personalised
claimant commitment will, we hope, introduce an essential flexibility
and headspace into the regulations, but I fear that the very clarity
produces a yes/no, either/or approach to regulations and guidance that
is not reflected in real life. Some of these issues have been raised by
the noble Lord, Lord German.</hs_para>

that we face major delivery problems, an issue perhaps associated with
transitional arrangements. I want UC to work. I fear that on delivery
we will be heading for a train crash. At one and the same time, the
Minister is rightly introducing a new benefit architecture that will,
however, confuse most people with its new rules, new conditionality,
new sanctions, new tapers and new backdating rules and that has most
benefits in, but some, from DLA to council tax benefit, out. That is
the first thing that is happening.</hs_para>

come the cuts. Some benefits, such as HB, will be cut because of the
bedroom tax. Claimants will think that it is DWP error and will go
frantic trying to correct it. Thirdly, in the past they will have
received their benefits weekly or fortnightly, but now it will be
monthly in arrears. As nearly half of those in the bottom two quintiles
are in work paid weekly, many will not cope and debt will
grow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:45:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

time, they will find their housing benefit paid to them and not to
their landlord. Inevitably, on a monthly basis, it will be raided
before the month is out to meet other bills. The DWP’s
demonstration projects show that 40% of tenants will find it difficult,
and a quarter will need substantial, long-term support. The chief
executive of Wakefield, one of the pilot areas, is reported to have
said that people are now ceasing to pay their rent at all. That is from
a pilot area where tenants have had considerable
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:45:51"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
worth reminding ourselves that this demonstration project showed that
40% of tenants were in debt, already excluding rent arrears. Over 90%
had no savings as a buffer. Over a third had sought help from the
CAB<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:46:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

arrangements come as a single electronic payment, paid probably to him,
leaving her and the children potentially vulnerable, when claimants
have been used the past to separate flows of benefit, particularly to
the one with children, and to a cash economy for food. And all the
claims are online, although 30% of the poorest have no access to IT at
all. Citizens Advice, which would have helped them, has lost nearly
half its grant thanks to coalition Government cuts. Claiming benefits
online would certainly terrify
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:46:52"></hs_TimeCode>. However, 
<?notus-xml column=678?>in exceptional cases, there will be face-to-face support.
Will the Minister tell us what percentage of people he expects to take
up that proposal? As these tenants do not have and cannot afford a word
processor at home, their benefit claims cannot be interactive. They go
to a community centre and fill in their forms online with the help of
someone present, and then they go home. And then what? How do they get
any interactive dialogue going should there be any query over, or error
in, their submission? How will DWP manage

greatly welcome the local support service, but the obvious hard
questions are how many centres there will be, how many claimants there
will be and how much new money there will be. Or is it another slice
off the HB under-occupancy test for someone else? It cannot be left to
district managers to decide, as is
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:47:50"></hs_TimeCode>. As it
is, my housing association will be employing and paying new staff out

of these seven major changes to benefits would need careful

folly. I think that we are setting up UC to fail, and causing much

of claimants. I fear that most of the delivery changes which I have
listed will destabilise it and are for the benefit of the department,
making UC harder for claimants to embrace and understand. I have been
through ambitious change programmes, but nothing as ambitious as this.
I beg the Minister to sequence these seven changes properly—to
introduce them incrementally on an agreed timeline so as to take people
with him. Yes, claimants will come across in manageable cohorts; that
is entirely right. However, once in UC, they face all these seven
delivery changes simultaneously. Those changes need to be phased in, as

consider, even at this late stage, a transitional year for claimants to
be able to opt for fortnightly payments, split payments within couples

claimants get their heads around UC and learn to work IT—itself
a big enough challenge over the course of a year. At the very least, we
should ensure that those who are treated as exceptional or vulnerable
for the purposes of housing benefit payment are passported to the
exceptional payment grounds within UC and vice versa. What estimate has
the Minister made of the percentage of people who will be protected in
this way under the heading of “exceptional or
vulnerable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:50:07"></hs_TimeCode>”?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021372000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021372000011">Finally,
the regulations that worry me most are sanctions, hardship and housing.
First, as regards sanctions and Regulation 102, if you are economically
rational, as the Minister surely is, you also surely reward people who
become compliant. You reward them for good behaviour. With three-year
sanctions, what is the point of the claimant changing his behaviour if
nothing happens as a result and he continues to be sanctioned? What
message does the Minister think he is sending? The concession on
holding down a job for six months is empty in this situation. Will the
Minister 
<?notus-xml column=679?>at least follow the SSAC recommendation that when a claimant has
complied, the sanction should be suspended? That is the message to get
across. It then can be reimposed if the claimant breaches his
conditionality subsequently. Otherwise, I expect this to be judicially
reviewed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:51:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Will
the Minister also ensure that when one person in a couple—for

I should like to make a few comments on hardship and Regulation 116.
The guidance is really helpful and very worrying. I believe that there
are three problems. At the moment, you are automatically entitled to
hardship payments if you are vulnerable—for example, if you have
children—but you will not be entitled in future. All expenditure
is to be scrutinised to see if the family is truly and deeply in
hardship. Should they return the TV? What about smokers, Christmas
presents, or train fares to attend granny’s funeral? None of
those is covered in the four basic criteria of health, housing,
hygiene, food and so on that the Minister has put into regulations and
guidance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:52:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021372000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021372000013">Iain
Duncan Smith, I think, believes that poverty is primarily a moral
failing. Like the Victorians, he is insisting that the poor must always
live in the light and display their income and behaviour for scrutiny
by their betters; that is, young, local office staff with often little
experience of difficult lives. The intrusiveness of it all appals me.
What is worse is that the hardship handouts will be, as far as I know
for the first time ever, clawed back. A hardship handout now is a loan
and not a reduced benefit entitlement secured for the vulnerable.
Paying it back will in future cut the UC a claimant gets and will
further increase debt, which is one of the major problems that all
claimants will
face<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:53:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is that under Regulation 116 (1)(b), households get hardship payments
for the vulnerable only if they have met compliance conditions. So why
are we still sanctioning them? Why do they need to claim hardship
payments at all? We have never made hardship payments conditional in
this way, nor should we. Hardship payments meet needs—above all,
those of children. They are a safety net. Instead, in these
regulations, they are being treated as another lever to make sanctions
and compliance bite. It is ugly and indecent. Are we going to refuse
hardship payments to a lone parent where she and the decision-maker
disagree about her availability for work given the age and
vulnerability of her children? That is the sort of example that my
noble friend Lady Sherlock described so effectively. The lone parent is
sanctioned and is not compliant. She is refused hardship money. I hope
and expect that this will also be judicially
reviewed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:54:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

benefit and Schedule 4, we now find that the bedroom tax may affect
one-third of working-age tenants. They will be fined—because
they cannot move—£14 a week for accepting the home which
was offered to them in good faith a decade previously, which is where
they have brought up their family. As a result, unable to pay that
£14—they have no savings—they will go into debt,
arrears, be evicted, bed and breakfasted, children traumatised. Then
they will be rehoused, either in the private sector at higher 
<?notus-xml column=680?>housing benefit costs or back again in the same size accommodation that
they left, since that is all that we have. This is simply because the
DWP and the coalition have so decided. The issue of overcrowding, which

irrelevant because they are in different places.</hs_para>

hope—we will not know until December—what estimate have
they made of the numbers who will then be protected? What are the
implications for middle-aged couples, whose ill-health requires
separate bedrooms, or do we need to judicially review that as well?
Will the Minister tell us what level of disability aids and adaptions
have to be fitted into a property and at what approximate cost before
the Government accept that it makes no sense for the household to move
and to refit another, but smaller, property in its place? Housing
bodies need to know to make sensible forecasts. Foster carers have been

to another issue, following bereavement the Minister is allowing only

was wiped out. The distress of a forced, speedy move from

noble Lord for the work done by him and his team in providing us with
so much information. It is only right to draw your Lordships’
attention to the 17th report of the Joint Committee on Statutory
Instruments, which has reported these regulations for four instances of
defective drafting. Although the DWP acknowledges each of those
defects, as I understand it, it did nothing to put them right before
these regulations came before both Houses of Parliament. I am told that
that is
unprecedented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021364000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021364000046">My
second general point was made by CPAG—I declare an interest as
its honorary president—in its evidence to the Work and Pensions
Committee and concerns simplification. That goes back to the point made
by the noble Lord. This is a raison d’être of universal
credit, as the Minister made clear in his introductory remarks. CPAG,
having acknowledged that of course simplification is a worthy goal
which we all support, warns that it is very difficult to achieve in a
heavily means-tested and conditionality-based system such as universal
credit. Noble Lords who have been grappling with these draft
regulations will no doubt nod wryly in recognition of that fact. CPAG
points out that many complexities will remain and new complications
will be introduced with the advent of universal

draft regulations reveal that many of the rules that currently cause
great confusion will simply be imported into universal credit, despite
what the Minister said earlier. The group warns that without good
advice, many claimants will struggle to comprehend either their
entitlement or the new obligation that universal credit places on them.
As a result, the Government’s expectation that universal credit
will be taken up more widely than the existing benefits could be
misplaced, which also means that its estimates for the number of
gainers could be inflated. The group argues that it is essential that
the Government provide support for the advice sector as an integral
part of the design, piloting and rollout of universal credit. That
point is emphasised also by the Work and Pensions Committee, which
calls for sufficient additional resources to be available to the advice
sector to support a successful transition to the new
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021364000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021364000048">During

course, no one ever wants a tick-box approach. Gingerbread’s
response is that the current flexibilities in the regulations are not
cumbersome to administer, and that multiple evaluations by
the DWP have never suggested that they are anything but appropriate.
The persistent problem has been a lack of adviser awareness, as well as
inadequate training and performance. Again, that refers to points made

increasing uncertainty and weakening decision-making standards further.
There are enough examples already of those safeguards being

be many more examples when the safeguards no longer constitute clear
rights. Although Gingerbread is pleased that the draft guidance has
been strengthened in response to feedback, in order to provide greater
clarity with regard to restricting work availability for lone parents
with children aged between five and 12, it considers that the situation
for those with older children, as set out in paragraphs WR064 and WR066

well as the relegation of certain safeguards into guidance, there are a
couple of examples of new regulations being more restrictive than the
current ones. My noble friend Lady Sherlock referred to one of them,
which concerned lone parents of children aged 13 or over who have no
reasonable prospect of finding work. The second example is that lone
parents will be allowed only 48 hours to attend a job interview, taking
into account alternative childcare arrangements, whereas at present
they are allowed up to one week, which does not seem unreasonable. Will

we are unable to amend regulations, so we must look to the Minister to

parents with caring responsibilities; that these safeguards are written
into the claimant commitment for lone parents; that advisers are
properly trained to administer the flexibilities; that their ability to
do so is included in the performance management framework; and that
there will be adequate monitoring of the impact of the loss of
regulatory flexibilities on the ability of lone parents to adhere
successfully to the conditionality regime, and to find and remain in
paid work. I would welcome the Minister’s assurances on these
matters, in the hope that they will be more meaningful than those with
which he provided me on 23 January last year. It is all the more

relation to this, I want to raise three points, building on the
powerful arguments that my noble friend Lady Hollis has already made.
The first concerns a claimant commitment and couples, and it is a
slight variation on her argument. There is a tension between the
personalised individual conditionality, which requires 
<?notus-xml column=686?>both members of a couple to sign and adhere to a claimant commitment,
and the refusal to allow both members of a couple to receive some
benefit in their own right. We will no doubt return to the latter point
when we debate the claims and payments regulations, when we would no
doubt pray against them. In the mean time, I wish to raise my concerns
that, according to the Explanatory Memorandum,</hs_para>

celebrating other religious festivals, and he seemed to find this
perfectly acceptable. I do not. I would remind the Minister of what
Seebohm Rowntree wrote back in 1937 in <I>The Human Needs of
Labour</I>. Rowntree is of course associated with an absolute
understanding of poverty, yet he showed a greater understanding of
human needs than do the present Government, who profess to accept that
poverty is relative. He asked why poor people spend their inadequate

agrees or disagrees with Seebohm Rowntree. Could he also explain
exactly how this pernicious rule will work in practice? Having read the
guidance I am not clear as to what proof will be required. Will
claimants have to provide receipts for everything they have bought in
the previous week? Will they be visited by officials to check on what
is in their cupboards and the fridge? While food is allowed, will there

careful study and I am sure that colleagues will do that. I yield to no
one in the pleasure I get from reading social security regulations.
Nothing makes my weekend more than a wet towel around my head and a
glass of malt whisky in my hand, but I will make my first plea to the

supportive of the general political direction of these reforms, but
they are very ambitious, so we have to be careful about how we
implement them. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, was also correct to
say that whether we like it or not, the financial austerity we are
experiencing may prejudice the outcome of what I think is an essential
and necessary architectural change. We have to be careful that we do
not spoil the public’s understanding of what is trying to be
achieved here in the short term. I know the Minister is alive to that

there are still quite a lot of known unknowns. The question that I
really want to ask more than anything else this evening is a process
one, about how we can be sure that we use the expertise in this House
and, indeed, some of its self-confessed non-expertise. The latter is
just as effective, as the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, said, and the
speech of the noble Lord, Lord Eden, was very refreshing and welcome in
that regard. We in this House need to be sure that we have an ongoing
and positive relationship that allows us to encourage the Government to
continue to be flexible in the roll-out of this programme. It will take
10 years to get to a steady state in universal credit and for it to be
really bedded in so that people are comfortable about it. We must

more comfort than I would otherwise have had, so I thank him for that,
as I do for some of the other flexibilities he has introduced. He has
to persuade his ministerial colleagues, some of them in other

is quite difficult to get the balance right with the next thing I want

that the Government’s position is that the digital

deployed in this case, which is new, innovative and gives us better
functionality, in theory—is all on track and that everything is
under control. I have to say to him that that is not the signal that I
am getting from sources close to the development of the project who are
not Ministers. It is so important to make sure that we get the
computer-based system—not just the digital application process
but the underlying framework of ICT provision—to work. I believe
it can be done but am very nervous about the timetable—a point
that I think was made by the Delegated Legislation
Committee—because I bear the scars of the Child Support Agency
and many other horrors. There have been one or two successes but the
experience has not been great. I hear the assurances that I am getting
officially, but would just like to make sure that if things start to
become unstitched, or the timing slips, that adult ways will be found
to deal with that. If things start to go wrong, we need to know about

suggesting for a moment that that is being done, but if things go
wrong, my plea is that the Minister comes and looks me in the eye and
says, “Look, there’s a glitch here, we’re going to
lose six months”, or whatever it is. I would much rather have
that than find suddenly that the whole project is in jeopardy because
of the computers going wrong. I hope that he will take that message to

satisfied with that. However, there is always a risk that it falls down

not want to spoil it, so I shall not detain the House for more than a
few minutes. As the Minister knows, I am supportive of the whole idea
of universal credit, but have concerns about the IT system
that will be essential to make it work. To be fair to the Minister, I
have had some very helpful conversations with him about universal
credit and I have tabled a number of Questions which he has

implementation of universal credit has been described by Margaret
Hodge, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee in the other place,
as a train crash waiting to happen, a point made by my noble
friend Lady Hollis a little earlier. Having served on the
Public Accounts Committee when I was in the other place, I can testify
that no major government IT project in 20 years has been
successful. Every one has gone massively over budget and or been years
behind in its date of implementation.</hs_para>

the IT system to support universal credit. As I understand it, it will
require two separate IT projects to piggyback on a third. That is a
real challenge if ever there was one. I am also given to understand
that, to make universal credit work, at least 80% of claims have to be
made online. When I discovered this, I also discovered that the only
benefit that was then claimable online was
jobseeker’s allowance, which only 17% of claimants were claiming
online.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021372000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021372000023">As my
noble friend Lady Hollis pointed out, 30% of the poorest families in
this country do not have a computer and I presume that these are the
people who need benefit support. What happens if 80% of claimants do
not access the system and claim online? What happens to those who are
unable to access the system on the computer? To make the system work
effectively, it will require every employer to inform HMRC every month
of how much they have paid every single employee and how much that
employee has paid in tax. If any of those employers’ staff are
on benefits and the employer 
<?notus-xml column=692?>fails to file the information by the due date that universal credit
requires, there will be real problems for that person’s benefit
because it is paid in real time.</hs_para>

are then widespread concerns about the cost of the IT project for
universal credit. We are told that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has
put it on the Treasury’s “at risk” list. That
“at risk” status is given to projects that will go over
budget or be late in delivery. I have asked a number of questions on
this. Perhaps I may ask the Minister three brief questions about the
cost of the IT project. First, of the £105 million
total cost of universal credit in 2012, how much supported information
technology development? I cannot seem to get answers to that point.
Secondly, can the Minister give us exact figures for expenditure on
developing universal credit’s information technology for the
years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15? Finally, how does the current total
cost estimate for universal credit’s information technology
project compare with the Government’s original estimate? All
these questions are relevant to making universal credit work. All
across the House, people want it to work, but if the IT project is
wrong, it simply will not and people will lose out as a
consequence.</hs_para>

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall share some concerns
with your Lordships about the regulations but, first, I underline my
support for the principle behind the introduction of universal credit.
I recall, when I first entered this House, the work of Louise Casey,
who was then the rough sleepers’ tsar, appointed by the then
Prime Minister. A key part of her successful programme in reducing the
number of rough sleepers on the streets was to find purposeful activity
for those who had been homeless. It seems to me such a curse that many
people are not finding useful things to do with their time and are
allowed to fester, sometimes for generations, without being actively
involved and engaged in productive work on a daily basis. I welcome the
fact that the legislation will make that more possible for more
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T17:46:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021372000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021372000027">My
concern is about vulnerable families. I recall for your Lordships what
my chemistry teacher used to say to me. He talked about dynamic
equilibriums. I suggest that vulnerable families are subject to a
dynamic equilibrium. If they are given the right support, they can
thrive and do well. We saw that recently again with 
<?notus-xml column=693?>the work of Louise Casey, who has been tasked by the right honourable
gentleman Iain Duncan Smith, I think—or at least by the
Government—with looking at the 120,000 most troubled families
and making a difference in their lives. Through her work supporting
those 120,000 families, she has managed to decrease significantly the
level of domestic violence in their homes and to increase significantly
the number of their children attending school on a regular basis. It is
possible to act on the positive side of that equilibrium and make a
difference to
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T17:47:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021372000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021372000028">On
the other hand, one can see that if one puts those families under too
much stress, they can fail. I was reminded recently of that experience
when I visited Feltham young offender institution and spoke to prison
officers. I had not visited for 10 years, but the same theme came
through: so many of the young men with whom they were dealing had never
known their fathers—had never had fathers—and the
officers found that they had to adopt that role for those young

is critical to support those vulnerable families in the best way that
we can. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Eden, for his speech. In this
extremely difficult time, when local authority funding is being cut by
28%—and there will be further cuts to services—which is
impacting very heavily on services for vulnerable families and their
children, a complex change such as this has to be carefully considered
to minimise any adverse impact on those
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021372000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021372000030">So I
welcome the principle, but I have concerns about various issues. They
have all been raised this afternoon, so I need not go into detail. I
was grateful for what the Minister said about the monthly payment of
housing benefit to families. There is the payment exemption scheme,
which he described, and he is paying particular attention to drug and
alcohol misusing families and those with gambling problems. I welcome
that, but I share the continuing concern of the noble Baroness, Lady
Hollis, that that may well not go far enough. I found what she said
very persuasive: there is a danger of underestimating the chaos in many
of those families and their inability to manage their finances in the
way that we and the Minister would
like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T17:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021372000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021372000031">With
regard to childcare, important questions have been raised about
significant increases in the cost of childcare to families. The changes
to housing benefit and the limit on the number of bedrooms that
families can have is clearly putting a lot of stress on some of our
most vulnerable families and may cause some of them to have to uproot
and move to new areas and communities in which they know no one. They
may easily feel isolated and, again, are at risk of collapse. I am
particularly concerned about the ability of foster carers to keep a
room open for a fostered child. In the past, the Minister has gone
quite a long way in reassuring me on that point but I would be grateful
if he could go further in reiterating that today.</hs_para>

reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester and others alluded to the
concern raised by the Children’s Society, and by my noble friend

children with a disability. He was concerned that these are often the
poorest families, struggling to 
<?notus-xml column=694?>make ends meet. Given that 100,000 of these children will be up to
£28 worse off under the new arrangements, that is a very real
cause for concern. I hope that the Minister can say something about how
he will monitor the situation for these children carefully and that he

point.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021372000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0001.htm#13021372000033">To
conclude, in my experience vulnerable families exist in a dynamic
equilibrium. Given the right support, many of them can do a lot better
and their children may perhaps break through the generational failure
that that family may have experienced. Without the right support,
however, particularly in such difficult times, one will often find that
their children will fail and possibly end up at Feltham young offender
institution, costing the public purse well over £40,000 or
£50,000 a year to maintain them there. It is crucial that we get
this right and I look forward to the Minister’s

me deal with the amendment proposed by the noble Lady, Baroness
Sherlock. There are some serious misconceptions in it about what
universal credit will do. First, on work incentives, the fact is that
universal credit will change them out of all recognition—and
manifestly for the better because it will reduce participation tax
rates and take away some of the scandalously high rates under the
current system, which may be 91% or even 100% in some cases. There are
some losers but they are losing, on average, a rather modest 4
percentage points. In many cases, the increased marginal deduction rate
is because people are being brought into entitlement for UC, so they
are actually better off. They may have a higher marginal deduction rate
but have become better off because they have been brought into
universal credit.</hs_para>

universal credit penalises savers. In practice, it corrects an
overgenerosity in the current tax credit system. It must be right to
focus our resources on those households with the fewest resources.

£6,000 without any impact on their entitlement, in contrast to

<?notus-xml column=695?>they can and will be able to gain—as they can under universal
credit. I cannot agree that universal credit is bad for women and lone
parents. We know from the experience of tax credits that, in practice,
lone parents are among the groups most likely to respond to the
financial incentives in the system. In any case, even on a static
analysis, in the 3.1 million households that gain there are 2.6 million
women. Lone parents will on average gain around £5 per
month.</hs_para>

two-and-a-quarter-hour debate over one set of regulations with so many
powerful speeches from every set of Benches in this House. I understand
it is complicated, but we are running out of time. This is not simply a
rough sketch of the architecture; these regulations describe what will
happen to real claimants when the system starts operating in April. I
understand that the Government are doing something that will
revolutionise payments to all working-age claimants. We support that
principle, but we cannot experiment on the lives of ordinary men and
women in this country and on their children. The Minister has been
unable to answer, despite his best efforts, concerns from all around
the House about the impact on disabled people, childcare, free school
meals, vulnerable people, of forcing people to claim online and so much
more. We have to let these regulations go through because that is the
nature of our House, but we do not have to allow them to go through
without making a very clear signal to the Government that they need to
get these things right. To that end, I wish to test the opinion of the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and
Pensions (Lord Freud):</Member></B> My Lords, I can confirm that, in my
view, the statutory instrument is compatible with the European
Convention on Human Rights. These regulations are designed to work
alongside the introduction of universal credit by removing all the
existing income-related provisions from jobseeker’s allowance.
They also work alongside the Welfare Reform Act 2012, which removed the
existing income-related provisions from other Acts.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021376000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021376000002">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:32:05"></hs_TimeCode>
JSA, there are currently two elements—namely, a
contribution-based element and an income-based element. The first
element is for people who have paid sufficient national insurance
contributions. The second element is for people who have low or no
incomes. From this April, the income-related elements of JSA will
gradually be phased out for any cases where universal credit has been
rolled out. The new regulations 
<?notus-xml column=703?>will remove the income-related elements and make
provision for an award of JSA based solely on national insurance
contributions.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021376000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021376000003">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>
addition, to further align with universal credit,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:32:40"></hs_TimeCode>the regulations
will introduce revised conditionality and sanctions regimes into JSA.
We have of course already largely aligned the JSA sanctions regime with
the universal credit sanctions model. Noble Lords will recall that last
October, we introduced a number of changes to JSA, including sanctions
of up to three years for those who persistently fail to comply with the
most important job-search requirements. The changes we made last year
have helped staff and claimants to prepare for the introduction of UC
and for the revised JSA regime. These regulations now complete the
alignment with universal
credit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021376000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021376000004">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:33:22"></hs_TimeCode>,
beyond these changes people will find that the effect of the existing
JSA benefit regime is unaltered. Noble Lords may find it helpful if I
provide more detail on how these changes will be applied. As noble
Lords will know, JSA is a benefit payable to people who are
out of work and seeking employment. The work-related requirements in
these regulations will apply where the claimant claims only
jobseeker’s allowance. Where a claimant receives both
jobseeker’s allowance under these regulations and universal
credit, the work-related requirements provided under the universal
credit regulations will apply. That will ensure that even where a
claimant is in receipt of the two benefits, they will have only one
clear set of requirements placed on them at any time. As
these regulations align JSA to UC, there will be little
difference between the respective conditionality regimes if they move
between the two
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021376000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021376000005">People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:34:26"></hs_TimeCode>
claiming JSA under these regulations will, as with UC claimants,
generally be expected to be available for full-time work immediately,
depending on their commitments and capabilities, and to treat their
day-to-day work search as if it were a full-time job. This means that
they will be expected normally to demonstrate that they are spending 35
hours per week finding a job. However, requirements can be tailored to
meet a wide range of circumstances. For example, their requirements can
be reduced if the claimant is a carer or disabled, or has recently been
a victim of domestic
violence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021376000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021376000006">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:35:00"></hs_TimeCode>
these regulations there will be three levels of sanctions in the JSA
regime—high, medium and low level. These sanctions will broadly
work in the same way as equivalent sanctions within the universal
credit regime. The universal credit sanctions regime, which is mirrored
in these JSA provisions, is designed to provide greater clarity for
claimants and to ensure that there are proportionate consequences for
failing to meet requirements, especially repeat failures. For example,
to act as a deterrent, the sanction periods escalate where a claimant
repeatedly fails without good reason to comply with a reasonable
requirement.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:35:42"></hs_TimeCode> more robust
but proportionate model is designed to be more effective in encouraging
claimants to engage with the requirements which help them to move into
or to prepare for work.</hs_para>

is important to remember that our focus will not be on imposing
sanctions but on ensuring that claimants meet the requirements that
will support them into or 
<?notus-xml column=704?>towards work. The requirements expected of claimants
should be reasonable and will help claimants to understand and meet the
requirements so that they can move into work as soon as they are able
to do so. Using the claimant commitment, we will clearly communicate
both requirements and the sanction consequences of not meeting them.
Only if they fail to meet a suitable requirement without good reason
will a sanction be
imposed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021376000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021376000008">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:36:31"></hs_TimeCode>
regulations were subject to statutory formal consideration by the
Social Security Advisory Committee. The committee decided that formal
referral was not necessary but raised a number of points, all of which
were considered, and changes were made where appropriate. As the
sanctions and conditionality rules for JSA were being brought broadly
into line with universal credit, these regulations were included as

the views expressed during the consultation period regarding the

also applied to the reform of JSA. Those views were considered and
changes were made. For example, we decided to remove a reference to
long-term impairments in Regulation 9 of the JSA regulations. This
change takes into account a range of physical and mental impairments
that a claimant may have when considering any limitations that may be
placed on a JSA claimant’s work-related

Donaghy:</Member></B> The Minister will remember that I raised a number
of issues in the debate on 17 January concerning the
self-employed and the quasi self-employed. These were mainly around the
requirement for monthly reporting, the burden of different systems
being applied for tax and benefit purposes, and the need to recognise
that not all self-employed people were in a position to choose their
employment status. If I had had time, I also would have raised the
problems caused by the different criteria used by HMRC and the DWP for
claiming reasonable expenses, as well as the need to recognise seasonal
variations for those working in agriculture and preparation periods for
freelance

under generally accepted accounting principles, a true and fair
statement of how a business is doing involves accounting for business
receipts and expenditure over a period to which they relate. The huge
advantage of working tax credits was that this principle was also
adopted, enabling claimants to draw up one set of accounts that keeps
administration costs down and matches the support given by the benefits
system to the actual state of the business. The universal credit
regulations have departed completely from these generally accepted
principles by requiring a month by month reporting system and not
allowing any carryover of a previous month’s loss. This
artificially short period does not present a true and fair
picture and does not allow for events beyond the
claimant’s
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021376000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021376000014">No

regulations for the self-employed. The Government see the need for this
facility, but have not made any changes, because the IT system has not
been designed to allow carry-forward. In reply to the point about

Minister’s statement that, “It will be in time for when

the Government have the luxury of the six months’ grace or the
year’s lag. What happens if the wife or husband of the
self-employed person puts in a claim for universal credit first? Surely
the information on the self-employed person’s earnings will be
required straight away. Secondly, the regulations could have a damaging
impact on particular industries. I use the example of farmers and the
farm industry, although other examples could be writers and actors. A
farm could have a negative cash flow for eight or nine months a year,
as cited in the Social Security Advisory Committee’s recent
report, and its entire income could be concentrated in a three or
four-month period when the farm’s produce is sold. Even a
quarterly reconciliation would not work in these cases, let alone
monthly
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021376000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021376000016">There
are also a range of factors beyond the farmer’s control, such as
the weather and inability to move stock, which would affect the
profitability of a farm. In answer to a Parliamentary Question on 28
February last year, we find that in excess of 90% farmers in England
and Wales are self-employed; and between 31% and 43% of all farmers
earned less than the national minimum wage over the past five years.

the farm worker, possibly self-employed or technically self-employed,
is sitting there and told by the assessor that his way of life is not
“the best route for them to become self-sufficient” and
that he should go back and look for work. Remember that 60% of
farmers’ income already comes from taxpayer subsidies. That is
the self-employed in the farming industry down the pan for
starters. Obviously we should not accept that a third of all farmers
should seek alternative work without considering a number of factors,
many of which I have mentioned. How qualified will the assessors be in
making these judgments, and how detailed will the guidelines need to be

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> It is still a pleasure to follow the
noble Baroness because she made a point that I was going to make. I
want to make two remarks 
<?notus-xml column=708?>on which I would like the Minister to reflect. The first is about the
contributory system—the national insurance system. In the middle
of last year, I remember listening with great attention to a lecture
given by a valued friend, Malcolm Wicks, who sadly died recently. He
was a great defender of the national contributory system. He gave a
lecture on how he melded the concept of citizenship with the
national insurance principle. He said that this involved a lifetime
longitudinal commitment both ways between the state and the individual,
with people paying in and people taking out, and that people understood
that. He was an exponent of that all his life and I certainly miss his
good counsel and wisdom. I share his view. We cannot allow these
regulations to pass without remarking that this is another notch down
in the diminishing of the national insurance principle. I regret that.
I understand why the Government are doing it because otherwise the
misalignment would be confusing. If you are introducing universal
credit, I understand the rationale and it makes perfect sense. However,
universal credit does not have the advantage that the national
insurance contributory principle had of giving a longer-term
relationship between the state and the individual. I want to put that
on the record in
passing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:52:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000004">Secondly,
conditionality for people who are paying national insurance
contributions suggests to me that people should perhaps pay less
because they now have to submit themselves to sanctions. I have a
strong view on sanctions and earlier today the noble Baroness, Lady
Hollis, reflected some of that. I take the Paul Gregg view that
sanctions are positive only if you can get the full commitment of the
individual who might be potentially taking on a jobseeker’s
commitment that will lead to sanctions, and if they feel that they are
in charge of the process. That is not the case with the system of
conditionality as it is currently cast, although with a bit of
flexibility it might be amended in that direction to put people in a
position where they feel they are more in control of what is going on.
They are then much more likely to understand the rationale of a
sanction being applied to them. That is work in progress. I hope it
will be part of the careful evaluation that the Minister explained to
us earlier this afternoon the Government will
undertake<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:53:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000005">My
points really comprise two moans about national insurance that I am
getting off my chest. I do not expect the Government to do anything
about it. However, these regulations change things in a way that is
significant for the future of the national insurance system. Indeed,
perhaps in the long term, once universal credit gets into a steady
state, the Government of the day—whoever they may be—may
want to ask themselves whether it is sensible to continue to have a
residual diminishing national insurance contributory principle set of
benefits running alongside universal credit. I am agnostic about that

the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that, given the 
<?notus-xml column=709?>increasing demise of the contributory principle, it is important to
consider how we re-establish that in this context, if we can. Of
course, there has been an accelerated demise in various benefits. We

Minister explained that these regulations refer just to contributory
JSA and not to earnings-related JSA. I believe that he referred to my
next point in introducing the regulations but, to be clear, I
understand that as regards the entitlement under these arrangements,
the national insurance contribution rules remain exactly the same as
they are at the moment. In respect of national insurance credits, under
current circumstances these can be obtained when the claimant satisfies
the qualifying conditions for JSA, when he or she is not in work and
earning. Will the Minister remind us what the credit and entitlement
will be under universal credit when JSA is no longer with us? The

others, I am grateful to Gingerbread, which briefed us on this matter,

that again except to say that I think the Minister said in response to
the debate that 10 out of the 12 lone parent flexibilities are being
carried forward, albeit in guidance rather than in regulations. I
apologise if he covered this point earlier, but will he remind us which
two are not being carried forward? We are aware that he has been
pressed on flexibilities and that these should be set out clearly in
the claimant commitment so that both the adviser and the single parent
claimant can share the same understanding of what the regulations and
guidance say about balancing work conditionality with caring
responsibilities. It is understood that the noble Lord’s
colleague in another place was sympathetic to this. Perhaps the
Minister can say whether he agrees. It seems an ideal way of ensuring

Lords for a somewhat briefer debate although the quality remained high.
Clearly, I do not have to remind the House what these
regulations do. They remove the income-related element and make
provision for an award of JSA based solely on national insurance
contributions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:58:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000010">I
will touch on some of the questions that were raised. I
start with the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy. She
brought some matters to the discussion which are entirely irrelevant to
this set of 
<?notus-xml column=710?>regulations, thereby rather skilfully avoiding the shorter answers that
I suspect would have been given in the previous debate, given the
pressure of time. I therefore take my hat off to her. She made one or
two very valuable suggestions, which I have stolen from her, as she
knows. I shall go on doing that. There are some interesting issues on
timing. For example, do we have the luxury of time with the
self-employed? I am very conscious that we may get the odd one or two
people coming in, who I suspect are probably not on the pathfinder,
because one of the things that the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock,
teased me on as regards our exclusions was that they made this
provision difficult for a self-employed couple to
obtain.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:06:01"></hs_TimeCode> We
therefore have a little time plus the six-months’ grace. Given
that we are starting with people probably even in the next phase who
are coming in and will find a self-employed job, we would give them the
year. All I am saying is that I am absolutely conscious of the noble
Baroness’s main point relating to the one-month period and the
need for a carryover. I have been looking at that closely, and what she
said gave me a good hint about how long that carryover should last,
which in her view should be a year. Noble Lords will be pleased to know
that that is the kind of period that I am currently
exploring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:00:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:06:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000011">I
am talking to Defra, which is working with the NFU, on how all this
works for farmers generally, and so I am very conscious of that issue.
As regards the point on the construction industry, which is one of
the more interesting industries, what I heard from the noble
Baroness was, “Don’t get a Catch-22 situation here about
people because of the way we define things”. That is a good
point and one of the benefits of guidance is that we can quite flexibly
get that in. I commit here to making sure that in that guidance we do
not have a Catch-22 situation for this industry which I know has some
odd things. If you are working, it should not matter how the position
is actually defined if people are making the effort. I will look at

irrelevant stuff and I will now move on to the points made by my noble

that of the approximately 1.5 million on income-related JSA or UC, only
200,000 receive the contracted amount that we are talking about, based
on their contributions. Of those, only 70,000 receive it on its own,

not get a response of the kind that you want if people do

work as well and create the right behavioural response. That is what
the claimant commitment is doing. Interestingly, the early trials of

having a contributor on a different platform, the reality is that any
Government looking ahead would want to have as few platforms as
possible. One will probably end up with the same platform but approval

with the JSA regulations we have just considered, these provisions are
designed to work alongside the introduction of universal credit by
removing all the existing income-related provisions from ESA. From 
<?notus-xml column=712?>April 2013, the income-related elements of ESA will gradually be phased
out for any cases where universal credit has been rolled out. These
regulations will introduce new conditionality and sanctions regimes
into ESA benefits to align them with universal credit. The ESA
sanctions regime is, following reforms made last year, already
significantly aligned with the UC sanctions model. However, beyond
these changes, people will find that the effect of the existing
employment and support allowance regime is unaltered.</hs_para>

helpful if I provide more detail on how these changes will be applied.
ESA is a benefit with which all noble Lords will be familiar and is
payable to people on the basis that they have a disability
or health condition that affects their ability to work. As with the
changes that we are making to JSA, these regulations provide new
claimant responsibilities and sanctions for claimants who fail to

on ESA claimants are also based on the universal credit model. For
example, where appropriate, ESA claimants can be required to prepare
for work and attend work-focused interviews. These requirements are
broadly equivalent to those placed on claimants in the
universal credit work preparation and work-focused interview-only
conditionality groups. Therefore, ESA claimants will not be required to
look, or be available, for work. I should also stress that ESA
claimants can be subject only to the lowest levels of sanctions. These
sanctions have an open-ended element that stops building when the
claimant complies, so the quicker the claimant engages the shorter the
sanction will be.</hs_para>

sanctions broadly work in the same way as the equivalent sanctions for
universal credit claimants in the work-preparation and work-focused
interview requirement groups. The high and medium-level sanctions in
JSA and universal credit, which are for longer, fixed periods, do not
apply to ESA claimants. Our aim is not to impose sanctions. We want
claimants to comply with the reasonable requirements that will prepare
them for work. Therefore our focus is on ensuring that the requirements
expected of claimants are reasonable and clearly communicated to them.
Only if claimants fail to meet a suitable requirement without a good
reason will a sanction be
imposed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000024">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>
with the JSA provisions, these regulations were subject to statutory
formal consideration by the Social Security Advisory Committee. The
committee decided that formal referral was not necessary, but raised a
number of points, which were all considered, and changes were made
where appropriate. For example, the committee questioned Regulation 46
of the ESA regulations, which originally provided that the purposes of
a work-focused interview included the five things in the list. The
committee questioned whether this meant that the interview had other
purposes that were not included in the list. We decided that the list
should be exhaustive, and therefore amended the wording of the

with the Minister the issue of appeals and appeals mechanisms. Where I
live, I am often approached by people for advice, particularly by those
on DLA. Of course, DLA will be transformed into the personal
independence payment under the new system. At present, when people come
to me to complain that they do not have the amount of DLA they thought
they ought to have, I always advise them to appeal. I tell them what
they ought to do, and I advise them to consult the local authorities
and to proceed accordingly.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:19:44"></hs_TimeCode> notable

that the private firm doing the assessment is capable of doing the job
effectively? I have doubts about the way in which the present system
operates when so many people are dissatisfied and so many people are
successful at appeal. That is very unsatisfactory. From the point of

my noble friend Lady Donaghy in the earlier debate. How will this work,

credit? Currently, universal credit is payable fortnightly in arrears,

regards claimant obligations, the Explanatory Notes at paragraph 7.63
record that the UC model requires more of the claimant than ESA does.
In particular, the paragraph suggests that claimants may be required to
look for and be available for work that they are capable of doing,

Government are clear that they are committed to continuing to support
disabled people to play a full role in society. The reform of DLA and
the introduction of the personal independence payment are central to
this. We recognise that DLA plays an important role, but it is simply
not working in its current form. In the past 10 years, the number of
people claiming DLA rose by more than a third, from around 2.4 million
to 3.2 million. That level of growth is not
sustainable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000047">We
could have reduced expenditure by simply cutting money across the
board. Instead we chose the principled but more difficult option of
modernising the benefit and focusing support where it is needed
most—on those who face the greatest barriers to independent
life. I accept that this reform will mean that we spend less money on
PIP than we would have spent on DLA, and that fewer people will receive
the benefit—300,000 fewer by October 2015 and 600,000 fewer in
steady state. We have not hidden from this. However, this has to be put
in context. The UK remains a world leader in protecting the rights of
disabled people. We currently spend almost £50 billion a year on
support and services for disabled people. We will still be spending
more on DLA and PIP in 2015-16 than we did in 2009-10 or
2010-11.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000048">Importantly,
this reform has also allowed us to ensure that the money we are
spending is used effectively and fairly, and will go to the people who
need it most. More people will receive the highest rates of the benefit
than at present, both in terms of the proportion and the actual number
of people receiving the benefit. The proportion of individuals who
receive the top rates of both DLA components is 16%. Under PIP 
<?notus-xml column=717?>this will rise to 23% and will be worth £134.40 a week, based on
April’s rates. More individuals will receive the enhanced rate
of the daily living component in PIP than receive the highest-rate care
component in
DLA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000049">The
Government’s reforms present an opportunity to start afresh and
make the benefit fit for the 21st century while keeping the best
elements of DLA that disabled people value. Throughout the development
of PIP we undertook extensive stakeholder engagement to ensure that
disabled people and their organisations were able to feed in their
views and concerns. We listened, and in many cases acted on
what we were told. Our commitment to consultation was recognised by the
Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. We are continuing this
engagement as we move into the delivery phase of

area where we listened to and acted on people’s views
was the timetable for reassessment of the DLA caseload. We announced in
December that this would take place more gradually, allowing more time

period of reassessments will now not start until October 2015. This
will also allow time for the first independent review of PIP to be
carried out and any required changes to be implemented before

also made a wide range of changes to the assessment criteria, following
two extensive consultations. For example, we heard the concerns that we
had not taken great enough account of the ability to read in our second
draft of the assessment criteria. To rectify this we have introduced a
new activity so that we can separately assess the ability to read and
understand written information and the ability to communicate verbally.
In addition, we have broadened our approach to aids and appliances,
recognising that disabled people can be reliant on non-specialist aids
to complete everyday activities, which can create costs and
barriers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:31:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:30:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000052">I
know that there is some continuing concern around the assessment,
particularly in relation to the physical mobility activity—that
is, moving around. We have already discussed the issue in this House.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to reassure noble Lords
once again that we have not tightened the rules regarding physical
mobility. I must stress that, under the second draft of the assessment,
being unable to walk 50 metres did not automatically entitle claimants
to the enhanced rate. The policy intent behind this activity has always
been that being unable to walk more than 50 metres should lead to
entitlement to some rate of the mobility component. Within this, we
intend that the enhanced rate should go to those individuals who face
the greatest barriers to mobility and the standard rate to the
remainder<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:31:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000053">In
the second draft, we differentiated by looking at the type of aid and
appliance that an individual used; but we did not do it well. We used
terms such as “up to” certain distances, which meant that
it was not clear which descriptor applied. As such, people received
variable outcomes. The strong response from our consultations and
meetings with disability organisations 
<?notus-xml column=718?>was that the criteria were very unclear. Many organisations told us they
believed that only people who needed to use wheelchairs could receive
the enhanced rate. We heard this from the Disability Benefits
Consortium, the MS Society, Parkinson’s UK and Leonard Cheshire
Disability, among others. In the final version of the criteria we
differentiate by distance, which we feel is much clearer. This means
that, in the final draft, individuals who cannot walk 20 metres can be
certain that they will receive the enhanced rate, regardless of whether
they need an aid or
appliance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021378000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021378000054">I
must also stress that this has to be looked at in the context of
whether individuals can complete activities safely, to an acceptable
standard, repeatedly and in a reasonable time. So, if individuals can
walk more than 20 metres but cannot do so in a safe and reliable way,
they should receive 12 points and the enhanced rate. Our analysis shows
that, when you compare the second and final drafts of the assessment
criteria, the projected number of people who will score 12 points under
the moving around activity will remain broadly the same, despite a
reduction in the overall mobility

would also like to address some of the concerns that have been raised
about the impact that these changes will have on carers. Informal
carers provide an invaluable service to some of the most vulnerable
people in our communities. The Government absolutely recognise and
value their contribution, and enabling carers to fulfil their potential
remains central to the Government’s carers strategy. That is why
we believe that welfare reform must support carers’
independence. Under universal credit there will be a carer element to
support carers on a low income who provide care for a severely disabled
person. Additionally, such carers will have improved opportunities to
maintain links with the world of work by being able to keep more of
their income from working than under the current
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:35:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

approach, the Government also announced that carer’s allowance
will continue to exist as a separate benefit outside universal credit,
providing carers with the support of a dedicated benefit; and we will
continue to uplift it with inflation. We also made it clear more than a
year ago that both rates of the daily living component of PIP will
provide access to carer's 
<?notus-xml column=719?>allowance. This was welcomed by Carers UK, and we
will enshrine it in primary legislation—indeed, we
have shared the draft provision that does so with Carers UK. The latest
available information shows that there were more than 1 million people
with an established entitlement to carer’s allowance. Of these,
some 269,000 have a carer’s allowance claim in payment, linked
to an award of DLA in respect of someone of working age.</hs_para>

we will have completed 560,000 DLA reassessments, the overall change in
the carer’s allowance workload where benefit is in payment, will
be a reduction of just 5,000 awards. It is important to put this in
context. Expenditure on carer’s allowance continues to rise. On
average, it has increased by 5% in real terms over the past four years
and will continue to increase every year up to 2015. We currently spend
£1.9 billion on carer’s allowance, and this is expected
to rise to more than £2 billion by
2015<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:37:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Our

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, the regulations that the
Minister has introduced come at the end of a protracted process whereby
the Government, in their early tenure, signalled their intention to
abolish disability living allowance and substitute it with the new
personal independence payment. The proposal has not been without
controversy ever since. The abolition of a benefit 
<?notus-xml column=720?>that aimed to support disabled people by making a contribution to the
extra costs of disability has failed to gain full support among
disabled people and their organisations. Nevertheless, we acknowledge
the positive changes that have been made at various stages along the
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:38:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021380000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021380000002">The
fundamental problem was the starting point of this process—not
how best to design a new benefit that meets the needs of disabled
people but a crude attempt to reduce the benefit bill. The change
was then promoted in the context of suggesting that DLA was
an easy touch for so-called cheats and scroungers, when the
reality was that the fraud rate was only around
0.5%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021380000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021380000003">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:39:43"></hs_TimeCode>
first time we heard that there were going to be changes to DLA was in
the 2010 Budget when the Red Book said that there would be a reduction
in caseload and expenditure of 20%. That figure, I think we now
realise, was plucked out of the air; no analysis, but a nice round
figure that sounded
definite<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:39:33"></hs_TimeCode>. We now
know that DWP’s latest projection indicates that the reduction
in caseload and expenditure as a result of these changes will be 27% to
28% by the time the PIP assessments are completed in 2018. There will
be more of this later, but we should acknowledge the hard work by
officials during this process and the extensive consultations and
engagement which have ensued. The Government have been pushed back on a
range of important issues, whether through the Bill or the various
rounds of consultation: the required period condition is now three
months rather than a six-month qualifying period; the mobility
component for care home residents has been retained; and they have
introduced two-year linking rules, as well as substantive changes to
the assessment activities. Furthermore, the agreement to switch into

certainly a reassurance for some, as is the extended reassessment
process. These are all to be welcomed. Whether the Government should be
congratulated on their sensitivity in responding to these points or
berated for the insensitivity of their starting position is perhaps a
moot point. I shall put it down to the good sense and power of

after consideration in the other place, we have what part of our Motion
calls for: an assessment of the impact on carers of the replacement of
DLA. This is hardly the time to subject it to proper parliamentary
scrutiny, but it seems clear from the DWP’s own analysis and the
Minister’s introduction that the projected eligible PIP number
for 60 to 64 year-olds in May 2018 at 1.6 million will be
600,000 below the number who would have been eligible for DLA. Of the
reassessed DLA caseload, some 450,000 out of the 1.75 million will
receive no award at all. In total, almost 1 million will receive a
reduced award or none whatever. Is it the contention of the Government
that these individuals who are to miss out on PIP have no significant
additional costs associated with their disability? One of the quoted
reasons for the change from DLA to PIP has been the Government’s
wish to increase support for those with the greatest needs; we have
heard it again this evening. How, therefore, does that oft-repeated
assertion chime with the statement that the new PIP
benefits rates will be exactly the same as 
<?notus-xml column=721?>those for DLA? The Government claim that a higher percentage of
claimants will receive the highest rates of PIP than would be the case
under DLA, but because the caseload under PIP is much lower, this
amounts to approximately the same number of individuals. That is not
helping the most severely disabled more; it is helping them
at the same rate while taking away financial support from
many other disabled people who also have additional costs to meet as a
result of their

disability premium in universal credit; and concerns over

did his colleague at the other end. Perhaps we can be given an update

that their carer can undertake some work. The Minister will doubtless
be aware of the reaction of Carers UK to the latest figures released

is now cutting financial support for carers by £31 million,
meaning that thousands of families now face the devastating double blow
of disability and carers’ benefits. This comes on top of cuts to
social care services, cuts to Housing Benefit support for carers who

overnight carer. This is currently allowed on the basis of need,

to be many disabled people who have limited capability for work or

circumstances where the universal credit rules will operate to create a

equivalent to the length of two buses. There is very little a disabled
person can achieve outside of their home without a wheelchair if they
cannot walk for more than 20 metres. Since most wheelchair
users can walk a qualifying distance of only 20 metres, it is likely to
lead to wheelchair users using adapted cars or very expensive converted
wheelchair-accessible vehicles. This could include those whose
conversions have been part funded by a grant from the
Government’s Specialised Vehicles Fund which is only available

Thomas of Winchester:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a long
journey, with many bumps and scrapes along the way. We are grateful to
my noble friend and his team for listening to many representations on
the whole issue of replacing DLA with the new territory of PIP—I
declare an interest in that I receive DLA— and I am
very pleased that the timetable for PIP’s implementation is
being slowed down to ensure that it is got right. We all know that the
DWP is determined to reduce the number of people eligible for PIP, but
I am not going to talk about the numbers, because I am not sure anyone
can really forecast with any accuracy how many people will be found to
be eligible and how many ineligible. However, I would ask my noble
friend whether the DWP has taken fully into account all those disabled
people, like me, who receive DLA and who are now well over pension age
and still going. The last thing anyone wants is for disabled people
whose way of life depends on being eligible for the higher rate of
mobility allowance, which opens the gate for a Motability vehicle,
suddenly to have that gate slammed shut by a rigid new PIP
ruling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021384000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021384000002">I

may find that their determination counts against them in being eligible

money has been put into it, but it only helps people to a certain
extent in getting to and from work, and it does not help all those

yesterday I found the PIP assessment guide on the DWP website, which we

whole matter is how the assessment is done and what part JCP
decision-makers play in ultimately making these decisions. A lot of
successful appeals will mean that the assessors and

to take a “tiered approach” to the PIP assessment. This
would mean that instead of people with conditions such as autism having
to undergo a stressful and often inaccurate face-to-face consultation,
assessors would first consider existing medical and other evidence

whether a face-to-face consultation would be necessary. We are all keen
to learn the lessons of the work capability assessment for employment
and support allowance, which, as the Public Accounts Committee in the
other place confirmed recently, continues to be problematic at best. A
tiered approach to PIP would help make it fairer and more accurate for

also makes it clear that the end-to-end assessment process should be
completed within 30 days. I understand that contracts between the DWP
and the providers make it clear that there is a financial incentive to
work towards this timescale; indeed, if fewer than 85% are completed
within 30 days the providers are at risk of losing their

assessor who may not be in possession of all the relevant evidence. A
one-hour face-to-face assessment will not enable the assessor to gain a

demographic changes relating to the cost of the care of the

people out of mental institutions and integrate them into the community

living in the community it was only too evident that they had become
institutionalised because they had basically been locked up for
decades, and that the vast majority of them should never have been
there in the first place. We do not do that any more. We do not lock
people away. Equally, a changing trend that I am very pleased to see is
that particular groups of disabled adults no longer live into their
middle or old age with even more elderly parents. There are many who

way that a previous generation would never have countenanced. That is

noble friend said at the Dispatch Box just now that the costs of DLA
have gone up greatly in the past decade. I suspect that a lot of those
costs are associated with the very welcome news that people are now
integrated into independent living, sometimes supported but sometimes
fully independent, where previously they would either have been locked
up or sitting on the sofa at home with elderly parents. There would
have come a point with those adults when their parents were no longer
able to look after them and when, usually in an emergency, they
suddenly became dependent on the state at much higher cost than those
small amounts of money needed to support them in independent living.
Unfortunately, despite what any Government say, Governments work in
silos, so I appreciate that what my noble friend has to look at is the
budget of the DWP, when a lot of people who are now moved into
independent living are dependent not just on disability benefits but on
health and local authority services. It is that package that helps them

learning disabilities and mental health problems, do not always present
initially as people with deep-seated problems and needs. Rather like
icebergs, they very often present with a third on the surface and
two-thirds under it. When they run into difficulties with independent
living or taking their place in society it is not only devastating for
them personally but very expensive on the public purse. It is therefore
a false economy if that particular group, many of whom may be
intelligent and do not present as the most needy or the most
vulnerable, lose their DLA after achieving independent living. I say
that on behalf of many autistic people whom I have known and on behalf
of autistic young people whom I can think of who have committed suicide
because they simply could not cope with day-to-day living. It may have
taken a long time to get them to independent living and if you pull the
rug from under them, the whole structure collapses around
them like a pack of cards. It is not the case with learning-disabled or
autistic people that, once they have achieved a level of
independence you can walk away and say, “Okay, they’ll be

be worse off. That 5,000 is nearly 7%, which is a minority but still a
significant number. It is based on a static analysis. The Minister is
always telling us that we should do dynamic analysis. Well, Carers UK
has done what I would consider to be a more dynamic analysis of the
figures in the impact assessment, and it suggests that by 2015 10,000
fewer carers will be eligible for carer’s allowance. Will the
Minister comment on those figures? Will he also tell your
Lordships’ House whether the Government will offer any
transitional protection to carers losing carer’s allowance as a
result of the introduction of PIP? Also in the spirit of the dynamic
analysis, by 2015 I think that we are only about one-third of the way
through the introduction of PIP. Do the Government anticipate further
proportionate losses to those eligible for carer’s allowance as
the process continues after

that taking regulations of this nature in the course of a debate on
eight sets of regulations is perhaps not the best way to do business.
Given the speeches that we have already heard, especially about the
effect on mobility and the allowances that people with disabilities
cling to in order to ensure their freedom of movement, these
regulations are so crucial that I am surprised that they have not been
uncoupled from the others so that we could consider not just the
regulations as they stand but the amendment that the Minister referred
to earlier, which he intends to lay in due course anyway. It might have
been better if they had been uncoupled from the other regulations
before us today so that we could have had a separate debate on that

German:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to raise the issue of
sufferers of Crohn’s disease and colitis, who may not have been
able to put their case as strongly as they might have in
this whole arena of the development of PIP. There are around 240,000
people in the UK who are sufferers of Crohn’s disease or
ulcerative colitis—collectively known, of course, as
inflammatory bowel disease. They are lifelong conditions that most
commonly present first in the teens or early 20s, and the
intestines become swollen, ulcerated and inflamed.</hs_para>

sufferers have is around Activity 5 in the descriptor list, which is
about managing toilet needs or incontinence. The
“continence” descriptor is limited. It fails to take into
account the impact of the frequency and urgency experienced 24 hours a
day by people living with conditions such as inflammatory bowel
disease, as well as difficulties in reaching a toilet, both at home and
outside the home, cleaning up after using the toilet or an episode of
incontinence. The descriptor is phrased around the need for prompting
or assistance to manage continence. Although this reflects the barriers
imposed by people who have learning disabilities and
musculoskeletal difficulties, it does not account for the severe
difficulties faced by some people with inflammatory bowel disease in
relation to controlling their bowels, who are otherwise physically
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T20:42:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021383000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021383000032">People
with inflammatory bowel disease may experience additional costs
associated with buying food and drink, which are currently
ignored by the descriptor. These may include the need to buy expensive,
nutrient-rich foods to address deficiencies, the need to modify their
diet to avoid other foods or additives or the need for frequent and
urgent access to a toilet, while the fatigue associated with
IBD may require a taxi to and from the shops or the use of
online shopping facilities. Consideration is not currently given to the
additional cost of utilities for people who may be forced, because of
this disability, to live more frequently within their home, and laundry
or high utility costs are often incurred by people with IBD who have to
wash or replace their clothes more frequently due to soiling or extreme
fluctuations in weight. Can my noble friend the
Minister explain how IBD sufferers are currently handled within DLA and
whether the descriptor as it now stands can be looked at again to

Hardie:</Member></B> In rising to speak in support of the amendment
moved by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, I have to declare an
interest as honorary president of Capability Scotland. Capability
Scotland is a charity which provides services, education and
accommodation for people with disabilities, both mental and physical,
of varying degrees of complexity and severity. It provides services at
more than 25 locations in Scotland for 1,000 people who are afflicted
in one way or another. It is in that capacity that I became aware of
these regulations and of the concerns of people who use the services of
Capability Scotland. Those concerns have already been alluded to by the
noble Lords, Lord McKenzie of Luton and Lord Alton of Liverpool, the
noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, and other noble Lords in eloquent
speeches highlighting the difficulties surrounding these regulations. I
cannot improve upon the points they made. I simply look forward to the
Minister’s response to the detailed questions posed by noble
Lords who were seeking the justification for the reduction of the
distance from 50 metres to 20 metres.</hs_para>

personal independence payment was asked in the House on 24 January. In
reply to an intervention by the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson,
about the 20-metre point, the Minister referred, at col. 1181 of the
<I>Official Report</I>, to the various groups mentioned by the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie. I was surprised to see them mentioned because the
implication I took from it, wrongly, was that they had suggested that
the distance of 20 metres was appropriate.</hs_para>

from the Minister’s reply was that there is no effective change
in the number of people receiving higher rate mobility allowance
because of this change. I challenge that statement. I am sure that the
Minister did not intentionally mislead the House in making it, but I
shall cite an example from Capability Scotland’s experience. A
41-year-old lady who suffers from cerebral palsy is in employment in
the National Health Service and currently receives higher rate DLA at
£54.05 per week. She uses that to cover the cost of her
Motability vehicle, which is essential for her to get from home to
work. She can walk with a frame a distance slightly in excess of
20 metres, but she cannot walk 50 metres, and that is why
she gets her current benefit. If this regulation passes with the
20-metre limit, she will receive the basic mobility award, not the
enhanced mobility award. The effect of that is that she will get
£21 a week, losing £33.05 a week, or £132.20 a
month. She will not have enough money to replace her car or to take
taxis to work, and she will be unable to remain in employment. How is
that compatible with the Government’s policy of encouraging
people back to work and encouraging people with disabilities into work?
This lady has done that, and yet because of this regulation, she will
lose that
independence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021383000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#13021383000036">I
do not share the optimism of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of
Winchester, about the flexibility of the regulations. Regulation 6 sets
out the structure and one then has to look at the schedule for the
assessment. When one does so, one has the various activities: 
<?notus-xml column=738?>“Planning and following journeys”, and
then “Moving around”. There is then the detail of what is
required of “Moving around”. If

get four points, and so on. These points are maximums. It would not be
possible for an assessor to give any more than the points in the table.
Therefore, in the case that I have cited, the lady in question will
qualify for 10 points. She needs 12, but unless she can get points from
“Planning and following journeys”, she will never get 12
points. She is perfectly capable of planning and managing her journeys.
I am confident that she is not the only person in this category. Lots
of people will lose out because of this change. They deserve an answer
to the question: why has this change been introduced? Why has it been
reduced to 20 metres? Who suggested it? What is the scientific basis
for it? What consultation was there? Did any disability organisation go
along with 20 metres? I think not, but I look forward to the

is that the regulations do not make provision for people who need
occasional supervision to prevent them being a danger to themselves. I
again cite as an example someone who gets support from the organisation
of which I am proud to be honorary president. A 36 year-old man has had
schizophrenia for nine years. He receives a low-rate care component of
DLA because he has been assessed as requiring occasional supervision to
prevent him being a danger to himself. He uses his payment of
£20.55 a week for his sister-in-law’s bus fares to and
from his home on a daily basis. Seven days a week, she travels by bus
there and back to check on him. To give him some structure in his life,
she checks that he is up in the morning, and that everything is all
right. She knows instinctively if he is not well, and then alerts the
mental health team. Take that allowance away, and she will not be able
to visit as regularly as she does and the tell-tale signs of his
increasing illness will be missed. He may then be a danger to himself

Freud:</Member></B> Once again, I thank noble Lords
very much for their thoughtful and moving contributions to this debate.
Clearly, as PIP is being introduced as a new benefit, it is right that
it is subject to a very high level of scrutiny. I shall try to address
as many questions as I can. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie,
asked about case loads and the steady state, which we
estimate will be around 2018. Our current estimate is that the
percentage getting the top rate of both elements will rise from 16% in
DLA to 23% in PIP. As I have said, the actual number goes up as well,
although not by a lot, from 354,000 to 357,000. But the number of
people who will get the top rate of the daily living component will go
up to 674,000 compared to the 539,000 who currently receive
DLA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T20:56:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0002.htm#1302141000002">My
noble friend Lady Thomas wanted me to clarify the meaning of
“repeatedly”. Currently, it means as often as the
activity being assessed is reasonably required 
<?notus-xml column=739?>to be completed, which makes the point that it will
not be on a daily basis necessarily but will depend on the
type of activity that we are talking about. The noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson, referred to what might happen to the 20-metre mobility
criterion in the future. Clearly, I am absolutely conscious of the
strength of feeling around that criterion and I assure the House that
we will keep it under very close review both within and outside the

regards the carers’ case load and the steady state figure, the

claims in payment to carers, which is running at around 600,000. I make

an hour. As the noble Lord knows, DLA recipients are exempted from the
benefits cap and this will also apply to PIP. We do not have an
analysis on who might be affected by not getting any benefit at all.
The noble Lord asked why, given the concerns, we do not just revert to
the 50 metres. We are stuck with the fact that the previous criteria
did not work well. They were unclear and would have led to inconsistent
outcomes. Twenty metres is not an absolute distance because of the
words “repeatedly, safely, and in a timely manner”. Some
individuals capable of distances over 20 metres will therefore qualify

introducing PIP. We are actively exploring what extra support we can
give to disabled people to ensure that they can still get to work. We
are looking at whether we can use access to work as that particular
vehicle. We want to ensure that mobility support remains in place
during any transition between the Motability scheme and access to work.

Grey-Thompson and I put to him about the numbers of people who will be
affected by these regulations? Before asking the House to agree them,
it is surely not unreasonable for us again to put the question to him,
not for the first time, of whether he disputes the figure of more than
40%—perhaps as many as 200 people in every parliamentary
constituency in this country—standing to have their vehicles
repatriated or sequestrated. Does the noble Lord agree with those
figures? If he disputes them, what figure would he give the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:11:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

higher mobility component, a figure that will clearly be fewer under
PIP than under DLA. I have provided those figures but, just for the
record, the figure of roughly 1 million people on the DLA component in
a steady state will reduce to roughly 600,000. That is the decline.
What we do not have, and therefore find it difficult to comment on, is
a read-across from how many people are on the full mobility allowance
to those who have a Motability contract, because that is a private
matter. Motability runs its operation separately from us; it is a
charitable operation. It is therefore

address the process of holding this important debate at this hour, with
little prospect of a vote. We probably bear some responsibility for not
pressing hard enough through the usual channels to make sure that this

should just say that further regulations will at least give us another
chance for a debate around the issue. We would not want to defeat them
because we would want them, but the House would be able to express its
opinion, which I hope would be some comfort to all those people out

risks around delivery. We understand that Atos will use subcontractors.
I am not sure whether we should feel more comfortable; we will have to
see. My noble friend raised an issue about a 30-day period and that was
deemed to be enough. I am still struggling to see how long, on average,

question about the range of people likely to be affected by that. My
noble friend Lady Lister asked about the number of carers. I think she
posed a question about the assessment at 2018, when the reassessment
process will be complete, and at 2015. The Minister is nodding that he
did, in which case I apologise to him. We have had some specific
questions about colons and colitis. We have also heard about the impact

the end of the day, there is no doubt that major concerns are
articulated in relation to the 20-metre and 50-metre proposals. I
remain confused. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, was comforted and
thought that the 20-metre proposal was an extra; and that if you could
not walk 20 metres you were assured of the enhanced rate and that did
not preclude you from getting the enhanced rate if you could not walk
50 metres. I am struggling to see the difference. If the
number of people affected by the 20-metre/50-metre proposals are going
to be broadly the same under the existing arrangements, why is that?
What is the purpose of the 20-metre rule? I am not just talking about
the process by which that has come about, but why is it there and what
difference does it make?</hs_para>

the noble Lord is saying that the current 50-metre rule is creating an
inconsistency because some people who are not able to manage 50 metres
are getting the higher rate when perhaps they should not, we need to
understand that a bit better. That seems to be the implication from
what the noble Lord is saying. Unless there is clarity on that issue, a
climate of fear will persist among many disabled people

focus on those issues that I believe will be of most interest to noble
Lords because they are both new and of significance. The first relates
to mandatory reconsideration, provided for in Section 102 of the
Welfare Reform Act 2012. Currently, a claimant can ask for a decision
to be reconsidered by a decision-maker, and this process may result in
a revised decision. In practice, however, many people do not do so and
instead make an appeal from the outset. This is more costly for the
taxpayer, is time-consuming, stressful for claimants and their
families, and, for a significant number of appellants—some 40%
of all appellants are successful—unnecessary. I say this because
this success is on the back of new evidence presented at the
tribunal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000031">We
need a process that enables this evidence to be seen or heard by the
decision-maker at the earliest opportunity. It is accepted that this
will not mean that all decisions will be changed and appeals will be
unnecessary, but we should at least have a process that allows this to
happen. Mandatory reconsideration does just that. It will mean that
applying for a revision will become a necessary step in the process,
before claimants decide if they still wish to
appeal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:24:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000032">Importantly,
another DWP decision-maker will review the original decision,
requesting extra information or evidence as required via a telephone
discussion. If appropriate, they will then correct the decision. When
this happens, there will be no need for an appeal—an outcome
that will be better for the individual and better for the department.
Claimants will of course be able to appeal to the tribunal if they
still disagree with the decision, which will be set out in a letter
detailing the outcome of the reconsideration and the reasons for it. We
hope that because of the robust nature of the reconsideration and the
improved communication that our reforms will result in, some claimants
will decide that they do not need to pursue an
appeal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000033">We ran
a formal 12-week consultation on the proposals between February and May
2012, and published the Government’s response in September 2012.
We received 154 responses, which included a range of suggestions on how
we could continue to improve decision-making across all benefits. A
number of respondents suggested that there should be a time limit on
the reconsideration process. As set out in the Government’s
response, we are not making any statutory provision for this.
Some cases 
<?notus-xml column=745?>are more complex and require additional time—particularly, for
example, where extra medical evidence needs to be sought. However, we

will mention another change linked to the mandatory reconsideration
initiative. It will see all appeals being made directly to HMCTS and
not, as now, to this department. The change brings the DWP in line with

turn now to the payment of benefit pending reconsideration and appeal.
Noble Lords should be aware that there is no change to the current
policy. Under existing provisions, if someone is refused benefit and
requests a revision of that decision, benefit will not be paid pending
the consideration of that request. It will be the same for mandatory
reconsideration. Again, there is no change in relation to appeals.
Under existing provisions, if someone appeals a benefit—save for
ESA, which I will come to—no benefit is paid pending the appeal
being heard. This must be right. It would be perverse to pay benefit in
circumstances where the Secretary of State had established that there
was no entitlement to it. As a principle, this will not be changed by
the welfare
reforms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000036">I turn
now to ESA. At the moment, if someone appeals a refusal of
ESA, it can continue to be paid pending the appeal being heard; this is
not changing. What is changing is that there can be no appeal until
there has been a mandatory reconsideration. So there will be a gap in
payment. In that period—and I repeat that applications will be
dealt with quickly so that this is kept to a minimum—the
claimant could claim jobseeker’s allowance or universal credit.
Alternative sources of funds are available. Of course, he or she may
choose to wait for the outcome of the application and then, if
necessary, appeal and be paid ESA at that

change in these regulations relates to the payment of universal credit
being made on a monthly basis. Reflecting this monthly payment, the
effective date rule for change of circumstances will follow a
whole-month approach—that is, that a change will be effective
from the start of the monthly assessment period in which it occurs.
Claimants will be expected to report any changes immediately. This will
be made clear in their claimant commitment and in the decision
notifications that they receive. Any change that is advantageous to the
claimant must be reported within the assessment period in which the
change occurred. Where the change is reported late—for instance,
if the change occurred at the end of an assessment period or
if there were special circumstances that caused the delay—our
guidance and regulations on special circumstances will allow the
decision-maker discretion to treat the late report as being in time.
However, if the change of circumstances is reported late and does not
meet the guidelines for accepting a late application, the change will
only be applied from the beginning of the assessment period in which it
was reported. This policy will ensure that the reporting of changes of 
<?notus-xml column=746?>circumstances is done in good time, that there is no incentive to delay
reporting, and that the monthly universal credit award accurately

something very big is missing that was not missing when the 1999
decisions and appeals regulations were operated in practice. It is like
the elephant in the room; we do not discuss it, but it is there. Has
the Minister spotted it? Have his officials spotted it? Has the
Secretary of State spotted what I am talking about? The enormous
difference between 
<?notus-xml column=747?>the operation of previous appeals regulations and the ones before us is
this. For those few with enough money to pay to appeal or challenge
decisions, the position has not changed very much, if at all. They will
be able to pay for legal advice and that advice will tell them whether
they have a case or not. However, after 1 April, for those who do not
have the means to pay—the vast majority, I would suggest,
including many disabled people—where will they get the legal
advice they need? They can get it now, but they will not be able to get
it after 1 April. How will they receive advice on whether to start or
not to start an appeal process? Who will advise them on the intricacies
of the social security

not escaped the Minister, his fellow Ministers in the department or
indeed the department itself, that legal aid for welfare benefit advice
will be abolished. However difficult the case, however much it may rely
on points of law, there will be no legal aid either before or at a
First-tier Tribunal, let alone an application to the Secretary of State
for reconsideration. I would ask this question of the Minister: does he
think that that is fair or that it represents a just system of
reconsideration and appeals? I hope that he will not suggest in his
reply that somehow welfare benefit law is so easy and unlegal that
legal advice is never justified. He knows better than that, as does the
House. Nor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>, I
hope, will he use the argument that it will save some precious public
money. Everyone agrees that abolishing social welfare law will cost the
state, and particularly his department, much more money when early
advice is not available. People’s legal problems, whether they
are to do with welfare benefits, debts or employment, will get worse
until one day, of course, the state will have to pick up the pieces
from the broken lives that follow. It will be his department, not the

reputation for being considerate and caring, so I shall ask him the
following questions which I will be grateful for a response to, however
late it is. First, how can there be an acceptable decisions and appeals
system when a large number of those affected will not be able to
receive legal advice? Secondly, does it not follow that many hopeless
appeals will be begun because no sensible advice will have been given;
or alternatively, that proper, winning appeals will never be commenced?
Thirdly—I hope that the Minister agrees with this—does it
not make a farce of our reputation as a country with equal access to
justice as a major part of our legal system that no such equal access
to justice is available to millions of our fellow citizens who are in

just ignorance that had led Her Majesty’s Government to abolish
legal aid in welfare benefit cases. Now I am forced to the view, as I
think are many fair-minded people from outside, that it is too much of
a coincidence that these legal aid cuts come at exactly the same time
as radical welfare reform. These things are connected—it must be
a deliberate government policy to bring in radical and damaging welfare
reforms at the same time as making it impossible for the vast majority
to appeal against the decisions 
<?notus-xml column=748?>that affect their daily lives. I feel strongly about
this, that it is a disgrace and a scandal and that it is something that
has not been talked about enough. Not only is there the blow for people
of losing benefits—if that is what happens to them—or of
having their benefit reassessed so they do not know whether it is right
or not; they have the added blow of not being able to go and get
simple, quality and cheap legal advice to advise them whether they

Lister of Burtersett:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to focus on monthly
assessment and the treatment of changes of circumstances
under the whole-month approach adopted for universal credit. First,
however, I will take a step backwards to our earlier debates during the
passage of the Bill, when some of us raised our grave concerns about
the implications of the move to monthly payments. These concerns
remain. Indeed, they have been heightened as a consequence of research
published subsequently. Given the late hour, I will spare
noble Lords the details, but every piece of research
reinforces our argument that we are not simply talking about a small,
exceptional group of people with budgeting difficulties, which appears
to be the premise underlying the guidance on personal budgeting that we
have been
sent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000048">This is a
systemic issue, born of the difficulty of budgeting on a low income. I
still do not believe that it is a problem that can be solved with an
elaborate panoply of exceptions to protect so-called vulnerable groups.
That has in effect been recognised by the Northern Ireland Assembly ad
hoc committee which recently recommended that claimants should have the
right to opt for bimonthly payments in order to minimise the potential
adverse impact on women and children. We will return to this issue when
we debate the claims and payments regulations—I am sure the
Minister cannot wait—but given that guidance has been
circulated, I would like to ask the Minister two questions
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000049">First,
what are the department’s working assumptions about the number
and proportion of recipients who will require personal budgeting

back to monthly assessment and the whole-month approach to treatment of
changes of circumstances, I start with a mea culpa. When we debated
monthly payments, I argued that we could separate the question from
that of monthly assessment. However, I think I was wrong. As the
Women’s Budget Group—I declare an interest as a

tribute to the tenacity of Fran Bennett of the Women’s Budget

on what she has written on the

now strikes me, reading what has been said about this by the
department, is the extent to which monthly payment, motivated by the
desire to change behaviour to monthly budgeting, is the driver behind
monthly assessment. In other words, the two issues are in fact closely
entwined. In the same way that I argued during the Bill’s
passage that monthly payments risked undermining universal credit as a
consequence of the Government taking what the Social Market Foundation
calls a “sink or swim” approach, so I fear now its
underpinning by monthly assessment could do the same, not least because
it has limited the options for dealing with changes of circumstances
and with more frequent
payments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000053">It
seems that the key to understanding the whole-month approach to a
change of circumstances is that a whole month’s entitlement will
depend on a recipient’s situation on one particular day just
because it happens to fall at the end of the assessment period. If a
baby is born at the end of the month, the extra benefit will
be paid for the whole month, which of course is to the
recipient’s advantage. But if a teenage child turns 18 and
leaves home towards the end of the month, the universal
credit recipient will lose a whole month’s credit for that young
person even though she had been feeding her throughout the month. This
strikes me as somewhat arbitrary, as I suspect it will to recipients as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000054">I
acknowledge that this is how the main out-of-work legacy
benefits—ESA, JSA and IS—operate already but
they do so on a weekly rather than monthly basis, which is
totally different. Moreover, these legacy benefits typically
represented only part of a recipient’s income as they would also
be receiving, for example, housing benefit and child tax credit,
whereas with universal credit nearly all their benefit eggs
are in one basket, with the exception of council tax support and,
thankfully, child
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000055">This
approach to changes of circumstances also seems to be out of tune with
all the talk about universal credit being more responsive to a
recipient’s immediate circumstances. In fact, it is going to be
less responsive than income support because instead of
following changes of circumstances week by week, it does so only month
by month. The Explanatory Memorandum
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1302141000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000131">“This

it also means that claimants may not reflect the circumstances that

course, since the SSAC report, the Government have announced that
supported housing costs would be administered separately from universal

Although we very much welcomed this concession when it was announced, I

concerned that the definition of supported housing in the regulations
will leave many survivors of domestic violence within universal credit

taken place, and will he undertake to think again about how supported

Government’s recent response to the Work and Pensions Select
Committee report on universal credit stated that there would be a
process of consultation with stakeholders later this year on the
long-term future of supported housing costs, which will affect refuge

past. But in reality underpayments and overpayments in relation to
actual circumstances will still exist. They will simply be hidden by

the department now thinks monthly and thus in its eyes changes of

convinced that that is how recipients will think. I think they will be

seems that the Government want to change not only behaviour but how
people think about their everyday lives—and that is not

will pursue, mirroring those discussed in the other place: mandatory
reconsideration and the payment of benefits in the interim. Noble Lords
will recall the debates that we had in Committee and on Report on the
Welfare Reform Bill on what has ended up as Section 102 of the Act, and
a degree of scepticism about why it was necessary to have two powers
when a power was already available to decision-makers to revise a
decision prior to the determination of appeal. However, we are where
are, with two time limits within the system. If a claimant disagrees
with a decision, they have one month to ask for a reconsideration. When
the result of that is known, they will have one month from the date of

the Minister has identified, there is no statutory time within which

today. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether its envisaged remit

seeking a benefit for the first time, they will be left without benefit
if and until the claim is settled positively. For those claiming ESA
and going through a reconsideration process, this would appear to
herald the change. Is it not the case that an ESA claimant will
currently be paid at the assessment rate equivalent to the JSA rate
pending a reconsideration and appeal? Will the Minister confirm that
this will not be the case in the future? The remedy in the short term,
as has been suggested, appears to be a claim for JSA in due course
where contributory ESA is involved, presumably a claim for universal
credit. This appears to be what the Minister still advises. How does

Freud:</Member></B> Again, I thank noble Lords for some very good
contributions. This is not the easiest or most digestible set of
regulations. They very much replicate the existing decisions and
appeals provisions but, just as the welfare reform agenda has provided
an opportunity to reduce the complex range of income-related benefits,
with the introduction of UC, it has also provided an opportunity to
rationalise the rules 
<?notus-xml column=753?>governing the administration of these new benefits. This consolidated
set of regulations does that by ensuring that the rules underpinning
decisions and appeal rights are clearer and more accessible, benefiting
both claimants and, indeed, the

the detail of mandatory reconsideration, I reassure the noble Lord,
Lord McKenzie, in particular, that we will closely monitor the impact
on claimants, the quality of decision-making and appeal rates during
the early stages of implementation. It is a key change that will
improve claimants’ experience of the appeals process if we get
it right. We will also monitor appeal volumes more broadly,
particularly with the introduction of the new benefits, UC and PIP. We

following my noble friend’s contribution on legal advice. It
would be extremely valuable if the local support services, which are
there helping people to move from paper forms to online forms for a
brand-new benefit structure, et cetera, were able to give claimants the
sort of legal or welfare advice steer that they would have got
elsewhere in the past. For example, I remember vividly cases in which
parents were trying to claim DLA for children under the age of two,
which is of course simply not possible. That sort of advice and

Once you get to the appeal, you will get ESA at the assessment

difference is that we are moving from a voluntary process that some

there is a gap. That is where concern has been expressed, and my
response to that concern is that we need to keep it under control and

regulations support the powers introduced by Section 101(1) of the
Welfare Reform Act 2012 to make payments on account of benefit. Two new
types of payment on account are introduced by these regulations. First,
short-term advances of benefit for universal credit and legacy benefit
claimants will replace interim payments and social fund crisis loan
alignment payments from 1 April 2013 for legacy benefits and 29 April
for universal credit. Secondly, budgeting advances will replace Social
Fund budgeting loans for eligible universal credit claimants from 29
April 2013. Short-term advances will provide an advance of benefit
against a new claim or a change of circumstances which significantly
increases the amount of the benefit award. Budgeting advances will help
finance intermittent or unforeseen expenses, such as essential
household items or expenses related to maternity or obtaining or
retaining employment. These are advances of a claimant’s
benefit. They are not additional money provided through a budget-capped

some of the reasons for these changes. The existing Social Fund has
been part of the benefit system since 1988. The fund was designed to
help people meet exceptional costs that were difficult to budget for
out of mainstream benefits. However, it has not kept pace with wider
welfare reform which has led to complex administration. Parts of the
scheme are poorly targeted and open to misuse. In future, claimants
will have access to financial support through advances of benefit and
local provision.</hs_para>

draw a couple of aspects of the regulations to the attention of the

in order to receive an advance. Regulation 7 defines this as a serious
risk of damage to the health or safety of the claimant or a member of
their family. This is a high bar to pass but rightly so considering
that these advances are paid using public funds. However, it is not a
new test within the benefits system. This has been the test in Social

multiple loans up to the maximum debt limit. These loans can be

can result in the claimant remaining in debt and on reduced benefit for
several years. As I have just said, budgeting advances are
limited to one at a time, with one repaid before another can be
considered. This new approach is intended to encourage improved
budgeting and personal financial responsibility and should help
claimants make the transition to work by preparing out-of-work

I am advised by CPAG that in the existing system the “serious

which budgeting advances replace. So, yes, staff are familiar with it
but in another part of the system. By introducing the test for
budgeting advances, the bar is being set higher for this part of the
system, and yet another part of social security is being made available
only in situations of dire need. Surely, the point of budgeting loans
is in part to help prevent ever getting to a situation where there may
be a serious risk of damage to health or safety. Will the Minister
explain why this particular change has been made? To be honest, I think
that he slightly conflated crisis and budgeting loans in his
introductory explanation. Will he also confirm that, as with regard to
crisis loans, health will include mental as well as physical health,
and that safety relates to potential as well as actual danger? Does he
agree that the lack of adequate cooking, heating or sleeping facilities
could constitute a risk to health? I would feel happier about this

maximum amount under the Social Fund budgeting loans scheme, which is
£1,500. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain the

that suggests that such a big reduction in the maximum amount is
unnecessary from a public spending point of view while a small number

this one moment only, I am glad that I am standing here and not sitting
in the Minister’s seat. As has been explained, these regulations
come in two parts. I will first look briefly at the payments on
account. The Minister has explained the circumstances in which these
will operate and my noble friend Lady Lister has already tried to tease
out the reason why the Government have gone for this strict test of
being available only to those in financial need. It is even slightly
stricter than that. They will be available only for those in financial
need as a result of having applied for a benefit, but not yet received
a payment, when it seems likely that they will do; or when an award of
benefit has been made, but the date on which it would be paid has not
yet been reached.</hs_para>

budget with monthly payments; 80% of these said that they were likely

find themselves in this stiff test of financial need, as a result of
the circumstances I have described.</hs_para>

to become much more significant in future with the move to monthly
payments. Even if the test is the same as now, will the Minister
concede that there may be a different set of needs resulting from a

it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302141000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302141000113">Regulations
11 to 15 cover budgeting advances. My noble friend Lady Lister has gone
through the reduction in the maximum amount available, so I do not need
to revisit that but I will be interested to hear the Minister’s
answer. I would be interested, though, in the following information, if
the Minister can provide it. His department has inquired about what has
been happening with regard to the replacement for the Social
Fund in different parts of the country. How many of those schemes will
offer cash to claimants? What has his department found out

example, their washing machine breaks down, there is a flood or the

stolen. They then need a significantly larger loan. What is the

the Minister address the interaction between the new low ceiling, the
fact that the adviser will be required to establish that the claimant
can afford to repay the loan and the fact that the maximum period over
which it can be borrowed has been reduced from two years to one year?

with a tighter borrowing period and will have to prove that he or she
can afford to repay it. Is there not a danger that that will make it

access to heating would clearly be considered a risk to health. The
budgeting advances are exactly the same as for the current budgeting
loans in terms of the maximum. The current budgeting loan is lower than
the available maximums because that counts for the whole of the Social
Fund debt—the £1,500 figure—which includes
budgeting loans and crisis loans. Because the Social Fund will no
longer exist and we are sending elements of it to the regions and the
devolved areas, we are not comparing like with like. The actual

approach that the department is taking. On the one hand, the
money-lending teams, which are obviously doing well, are seeking to
exterminate illegal loan sharks and so on, but they exist because there
is a demand for cheap credit, otherwise they would not be in business
at all. We obviously respect what the Minister is trying to do with
credit unions, which are an appropriate alternative—if, of
course, you have first saved—but given that he has now agreed
that the maximum figure for single people is £348, £464
for couples and £812 for families with children, why not use
those figures as the maximum cap that people can borrow against for
their payments on account, rather than be confined to one loan?
Thereby, if you have taken out £70 or £120, you cannot
take any more until you have paid that back. If you are going to have
those caps, regard them as the caps against which money can be borrowed
on several occasions and you will therefore teach people how to manage
credit as well as income. I suggest that that would be much more

the changes introduced by the Welfare Reform Act 2012 which allow for
the toughening and strengthening of loss of benefit penalties for those
who commit benefit fraud. These regulations also deal with how these
penalties will apply in universal credit. The reason why we are
bringing forward these regulations is straightforward. From the
research that we have carried out, 41% of claimants think that benefit
fraud is easy to get away with, while one-third think that the
penalties are not that bad. We need to change the perception that it is
okay to steal from the state. It is stealing from taxpayers; it is
stealing from fellow citizens; and it is stealing from other benefit
claimants.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1302143000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302143000008">We
accept that the vast majority of people are honest in their dealings
with the department. But for those who are not, we need to try to
change their behaviour so that they think twice before doing it again.
The consequences of their actions must therefore include losing their
benefit for a period of time. The more serious or repeated fraudsters
should face the harshest treatment. Such behaviour should not be
tolerated when you consider that £1.2 billion is lost each year
as a result of fraud against the benefit system. It is clear that we
have a need to address this undesirable behaviour. This measure is
therefore just one of the many we announced in the wider fraud and
error strategy. Introducing these changes will help reinforce the
message to fraudsters that their actions will not be tolerated and that
it is never clever to defraud the benefits system. It will act as a
forceful deterrent and encourage a positive change in future behaviour.
The regulations before us—the details of which I will now
explain—support that
aim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302143000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302143000009">We debated
earlier the details of the regulations which cover universal credit
sanctions and hardship provisions. I will not dwell on those provisions
because they are largely replicated in these regulations. I am sure
that noble Lords will recognise that there is a similar need to provide
for the appropriate reduction in payments of universal credit during a
period of fraudulent loss of benefit. The regulations mean that
universal credit claimants, subject to a loss of benefit for a fraud
offence, will be paid a reduced rate of universal credit for the
penalty period rather than having their universal credit completely
withdrawn. This follows the current approach that modifies the effect
of the loss-of-benefit penalties imposed on those who are receiving
means-tested
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302143000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302143000010">We
have set out how we will penalise and treat universal credit claimants
who have acted fraudulently while ensuring protection for those
claimants who are pregnant, not subject to work-related requirements,
or who are responsible for a young child. Those offenders subject to
the highest rate of reduction will have their payment reduced by an
amount equivalent to the universal credit standard allowance. Where
they are in a couple, the reduction will be equivalent to an amount of
half of the standard allowance applicable for a couple. In all other
cases, it will be reduced by an amount equivalent to 40% of the
standard allowance, or 20% of a couple’s claim. This will help
ensure that payments for housing costs, for example, are
protected.</hs_para>

provide for hardship payments of universal credit to be made in
appropriate cases. They prescribe the amounts of such payments and the
requirements for information that must be fulfilled before they are
paid. They also provide for the repayment of hardship payments in
certain circumstances. This is in line with existing provisions for
other benefits, which we discussed earlier. No one will escape facing a
penalty, but safeguards are in place to take into account a
person’s conditionality group when the penalty is
imposed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302143000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130213-0003.htm#1302143000012">We
have also made changes to the loss-of-benefit penalty to be applied to
income-related employment and support allowance claimants. In future,
such payments may be reduced by 100%. However, this tougher approach
will not apply to all employment and support allowance claimants. For
example, those who are pregnant, seriously ill, or who are not subject
to work-related requirements will retain their payments—but at a
reduced amount, depending on their circumstances. Hardship payments
will also be available in appropriate cases. These provisions will
ensure a similar and consistent approach for universal credit and
employment and support allowance claimants in relation to the
reductions and hardship arrangements of those benefits that are to be
applied where there is either a loss-of-benefit penalty or a

will agree that those who deliberately defraud the taxpayer of benefit

understand why, for universal credit, the measure of any sanction will
be related to the standard component and that amounts, for example, for
children and housing will continue to be paid, together with any
hardship payment. The concern is that when these situations arise, the
whole household, including children, will suffer, not only the
individual who has committed the fraud. Amounts allocated for children
and housing, for example, could be used in whole or in part for daily
living expenses, with the increased risk of rent arrears and
homelessness. It seems to us that there is an argument that, where

Assistance Force (ISAF) combat operations are due to be completed by
the end of 2014. The Government have announced that UK troop numbers in
Afghanistan, currently at around 9,000, are due to fall to about 5,200
by the end of 2013 with further significant reductions planned for
2014. MoD has begun to plan for the recovery of some £4 billion
of inventory deployed to Afghanistan. On current estimates, this could
amount to the equivalent of about 6,500 twenty-foot containers of
equipment, together with about 2,500 vehicles. The drawdown operation
is made even more challenging by Afghanistan’s remote
geographical location, difficult terrain and potentially unstable
regional security conditions.</hs_para>

surface option for the recovery of UK equipment from Afghanistan is by
the southern transit route through Pakistan. We are in the process of
opening this reverse transit route with the Pakistani Government.
However, this route will be hard-pressed to meet the capacity demands
that ISAF drawdown will generate. We have therefore been seeking to
diversify our potential equipment recovery options by establishing
reverse transit routes (surface and air) through the Central Asian
Republics and Russia—collectively known as the Northern Lines of
Communication (NLOC).</hs_para>

Command Papers Cm 8522, 8523 and 8524 and are today being laid before

Statement of 23 February 2012 (col. 83WS) set out the broader context

underpinning the UK’s growing prosperity and security interests
in the region is our commitment to promote core values of the rule of
law, human rights and democracy. As part of our 
<?notus-xml column=46?>promotion of regional security and stability, we will continue to engage
with the Republic of Uzbekistan on these core values and on a range of

Uzbekistan has already played a constructive role in helping to secure
Afghanistan’s stability but will face increased security
challenges once ISAF has withdrawn from Afghanistan. We have therefore
been examining options for gifting surplus UK equipment to help meet
those challenges. The departmental minute which I have today laid
before Parliament describes a gifting package to the Republic of
Uzbekistan of surplus Leyland DAF trucks and Land Rover spares that is
intended to contribute to this. Both items have been examined and
cleared against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing
Criteria, which includes an assessment of whether the equipment might
be used for human rights violations or internal repression.

<?notus-xml column=163?>The EU funding awarded will be paid out over the course of a project
that will typically last three to four years. The Government do not
have access to this payment data and therefore cannot at any point in
time say how much has been received by a beneficiary. The periodic
release of grant agreement data by the European Commission also does
not lend itself to easily identifying awards by calendar year, which
means that more analysis than can be done in the time available would
be needed to identify the last five years of grant awards from the six
years FP7 has been running. The data we do have for grants awarded from
the launch of FP7 on 1 January 2007 up to 18 October 2012 (the latest
