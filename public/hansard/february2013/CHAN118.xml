</B>The defence budget for the financial year 2015-16 will be set in
the current spending round, which is expected to conclude in the
summer. The budget for subsequent years will be set in the next
spending review. The Ministry of Defence has an agreement with Her
Majesty’s Treasury that we may plan on the assumption of a 1%
real-terms annual increase in the equipment budget—about 40% of
the current defence budget, rising to 45%—from 2015-16 to

the National Audit Office report carefully. To put it into context, she
probably needs to read some previous NAO reports on equipment plans.
For example, in its 2010 report the NAO discovered that in a single
year under Labour just two programmes—Typhoon and the Queen
Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier—rose by £3.3 billion in
cost. In 2009, it said

that attempts to rebalance the defence budget had represented poor

defence budget was set for this Parliament in the spending review
conducted in 2010. As I have set out, the budget for financial year
2015-16 will be set in the current spending round, which is expected to
conclude in the summer. The MOD’s planning assumption is that
the non-equipment element of the budget, about 55% to 60% of the total,
will grow in line with inflation—that is, will remain flat in

by the Cabinet Office, but the Ministry of Defence is heavily involved
in the programme. The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the
increasing frequency and severity of attacks on industrial and civilian
infrastructure targets not just in the UK but throughout the western
world. The arrangements the Government have put in place for a
quinquennial strategic defence and security review give us a framework
within which to review our responses to cyber-threats and to make any
adjustments in priority that we need to make for the next five-year

parents of children with a special educational need find that they must
face, day after day. Those parents are having
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>to provide
duplicate information and tell their story time and again, and rather
than working in partnership with local authorities, the health service
and schools, they often find themselves in conflict with them. The Bill
is designed to tackle that head-on, and to ensure a much more
child-centred, family-orientated SEN system, with a single assessment
and planning process for those aged nought to 25, to make sure that
those difficult transition periods are dealt with in a much more smooth
and co-ordinated way. There will be a much reduced probability of many
of the problems that people such as my hon. Friend’s constituent

important to say at this juncture that we are not changing the
definition of special educational need. It is clear from the Ofsted
report of 2010 that there has been over-identification of many
children, who have been labelled as needing School Action or School
Action Plus, but for whom that has not addressed the core concerns
around their presentation and their inability to progress at school
satisfactorily. We want a greater emphasis on outcomes, and we want to
personalise the support that children get at school—if
necessary, through a plan, if they meet the criteria. We are not
changing the definitions; we are ensuring that the rights that parents
and young people enjoy under the SEN system will be protected under the
new system. In fact, they will be enhanced, as they will apply beyond

education, health and social care. That is why, in the Bill, there is
for the first time a statutory duty to ensure joint commissioning of
services relating to education and social care; there is a duty on the
different agencies to co-operate. Through the local offer, they will
all have to publish—through a common framework, which we will
set out in the code of practice and in regulations—what services
they have on offer locally for children with a disability or
a special educational need, so that there is much more transparency,

have just set out the principles that remain in place, and it is worth
noting that the concept of fostering for adoption is not new. A number
of local authorities already use fostering for adopting very
successfully, for example East Sussex county council. That is in no way
trying to undermine the principles in law that already exist whereby
local authorities must look at potential future placements within the
family before considering a placement outside the family, and that will
pertain as a
consequence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022511000416" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0002.htm#13022511000416"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:01:32"></hs_TimeCode>We
also know that black children take, on average, one year longer to be
adopted than white children or children of other ethnicity.
Again, that is totally unacceptable. As Birmingham city
council’s recent report illustrated, potential adoptions are
still being blocked by misplaced and misguided efforts to find the
perfect ethnic match over and above all other considerations. I want to
make it absolutely clear, for the avoidance of any doubt, that we do
not intend that ethnicity will never be a consideration. However,
ethnicity should not block a placement that is in the best interests of
the child and that can provide them with the loving and stable family
home they so badly need. The Bill will remove the explicit requirement
to have regard to a child’s religious persuasion, racial origin
and cultural and linguistic background when matching them with
prospective adopters. In doing so, it will ensure quicker and more

a 20% reduction in their prospect of being adopted. By ensuring that

following family breakdown. One survey suggests that between a quarter

that the court will judge not the parents’ dispute, but what is
in the best interests of the child. The presumption will be that having
both parents involved in the child’s life is the right course
where it is safe and in the child’s best interests. That is
particularly important given the huge number of children who no longer
have any contact with one parent after a separation. We need to try to

far too long. As the Minister has said, on average, it takes more than
two and half years for an adoption to be completed. For children who

staying safe; enjoying and achieving; making a positive contribution;
and achieving economic well-being. Our ambition was then, as it is now,

Committee that disabled children should be included in the provision of

difficulty. Education, health and care plans should codify and bring
together the current entitlements for disabled children and young
people. The statutory rights that disabled children and young people
have in terms of both assessment and provision are already laid out in
disability legislation. Including disabled children, therefore,

shall now discuss adoption and children in care. Clearly, one of the
state’s most important duties is to care for children who, for
whatever reason, are without a safe, loving family to care for them. In
recent decades, the system has seen step changes in the fulfilment of
that duty, but we know only too well that failings have let down some
of the most vulnerable members in our society and, in the most extreme
cases, have cost children and young people their lives. I welcome the
emphasis that has been placed on reducing the time for completing an
adoption and increasing the number of adoptions, where that is in the
child’s best interests.</hs_Para>

will lead to misunderstandings about the right to particular amounts of
time for parental contact because of the use of the word
“involvement” without any definition and because of the
use of presumption. A similar measure in Australia created an
expectation that shared parenting meant equal time and led to courts

attempt to address this issue and to learn from the Australian
experience. Labour’s judgment, as I have set it out today, has
taken into account not only what the hon. Gentleman and other
Government Members have said, but what has been said by organisations
working in the sector, including in the field of children’s law.
They tell us that there is a gap between the Government’s
intention and what might happen in practice. We have to anticipate
those unintended consequences, so although I absolutely agree with his
final comments about the importance of both parents being involved,
provided there is no threat to the safety or welfare of children, the
paramount principle has to be the best welfare of the child—that
has to come first. The concern is that what the Bill proposes could
take us down the road that the Australians went down. We should explore
this issue further in Committee, because there is a real difference of
opinion on it. I urge Ministers to listen to those who are

wait for an average of 55 weeks for a decision about their future. The

expense of getting it right for children. We want safeguards to be

that the 26-week time limit should be specified in secondary

done by local authorities before care proceedings is extremely
important. That is why we have placed more emphasis on family group
conferences, and on the need to ensure that as much as possible of the
evidence that is required for a case to be dealt with as quickly as
possible is available at the inception of the application. Does the
hon. Gentleman agree, however, that we cannot maintain a situation in
which the average time for a case to be dealt with is 17 weeks in one
court and 89 weeks in another? The tri-borough pilot in London has
produced a reduction to 24 weeks, less than the 26 weeks proposed in

assurances that they will not cause knock-on effects, such as extra
costs to parents. Ministers will also need to clarify what they will
mean for local authorities, how often Ofsted will inspect agencies, and

concentrate on the clauses that deal with family law. The core issue is
the need to deal with the long-standing failure of the legal, judicial,
social services and educational systems in order adequately to
safeguard those of our children who need to be taken into care. The
present arrangement is costing the taxpayer some £950 million a
year, but is straining to keep up with increased demand. In 2007 it
involved some 19,650 children, but by 2011 the number had risen to
29,492. In 1989 the average case took 12 weeks, but by 2011 the figure
was 54 weeks. I know that by last year it had fallen to 48 weeks, and I
was pleased to hear the Minister say that it has fallen
again to 47 weeks—that is a great improvement—but there
is still a very long way to go.</hs_Para>

the reform approach supported by most parties was that adopted by the
Norgrove family justice review, which finally reported in November
2011. We owe sincere thanks to David Norgrove and his team for their
sterling work. As the report pointed out, there have been at least
seven reviews of family justice since 1989, and more money would not be
the answer even if it were available. What we need is fundamental
reform.</hs_Para>

the Norgrove report attempts to pull together the disparate strands of
the overall service. It aims to ensure that the best interests of
children are met and to provide them with a voice, to unify the service
into a family justice service sponsored by the Ministry of Justice, and
to provide effective leadership. When I was a Minister, I encountered
as poor a managerial situation as I have seen in any field and in any
sector, complicated by regional variations and the lack of any proper
measurement of performance. In some regions of the country, the judges
were being blamed for delay on the part of the lawyers; in others, the
Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service was being blamed
for delay on the part of the judges. However, that was
mainly anecdotal, as we had no reliable measurements of success or
failure and no recording
mechanism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022522000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0002.htm#13022522000005">It
is important to emphasise that the implementation of family justice
reform has not waited for this legislation, which forms only part of
the overall picture. Indeed, I note that the vital aspect of the
introduction of a single family court is proposed in the Crime and
Courts Bill. It provides for an applicant to have, in future, a single
entry point, avoiding what can currently be a complicated choice
between the different family courts. It should also mean
that the right level of judge is allocated to the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022522000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0002.htm#13022522000006">As
the Minister noted, much of the framework of the family justice reforms
has already been put in place over the past two years. For instance,
the Bill’s key 26-week time limit for the completion of care and
supervision proceedings would probably mean little if we had not
already set up a national Family Justice Board to orchestrate a
cross-agency strategy at the centre and local family justice boards to
review performance at court level, backed up by new performance
figures—starting from last year—for each and every court.
The key point is that if the 26-week limit is not reached, we will know
where and by how much it has been missed, the reasons for the delay and
the patterns of poor performance in an area. In other words, it should
result in more positive action and less of the old blame culture. I
would be interested to hear from the Minister whether that is happening
on the
ground<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022522000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0002.htm#13022522000007">I

the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), who I am

good working relationship with the judiciary is key to the
implementation of these measures, but we must also appreciate that the
Norgrove review proposed, and 
<?notus-xml column=71?>the Government agreed, that CAFCASS should be moved to the MOJ or Her
Majesty’s Courts Service within the MOJ. Will the Minister
advise the House on the timing? From my experience, although he might
not agree with me, I would recommend that the Children’s
Minister should be moved to the Ministry of Justice from the Department
for Education in contemplation of that operational shift. Government
must fall into line with everyone else and unify policy and delivery

26-week time limit represents the iconic change that family justice
must undergo, which will involve nearly halving the average time. Even
our best courts are nowhere near meeting the target. I note that some
judges and practitioners are saying that the limit is unfair or
unachievable for one reason or another, but we must stay
resolute—I say that in the knowledge that pre-legislative
scrutiny has already marginally diluted the time-limit clause. We need
more effective management and better joint working by agencies backed
up by targets and monitoring. We must drive the delay down; the
children deserve no less. It was therefore entirely appropriate that
the Government insisted on keeping the 26-week limit in the Bill and
that is why I strongly support other aspects of part 2, including the
measure to ensure that timetabling is child-focused. There can always
be another report, but we must ask whether a delay is in the
child’s best interest.</hs_Para>

26-week limit is a target to be worked towards. It will not be reached
overnight, but we need tough targets if the courts are to get down to

judges’ working practices carried out by Mr Justice
Ryder.</hs_Para>

should also note that for too long family law has been the poor
relation of criminal law, and the lack of time given to family cases
has meant that judges have had to go back to their criminal work.

the service has been worse as a result.</hs_Para>

on the subject of private family law, I have long been a great
supporter of mediation and I therefore wholeheartedly support the
mediation information and assessment meeting requirement in the Bill.
Although that has been supported by a pre-action protocol for more than
a year, I hope that placing it in statute will mean that those parts of
the country where the courts have overlooked the need under the PAP to
go to mediation first will now have to take note. In my view, the
Government were correct to be cautious about the proposal by the Select
Committee on Justice that judges should make decisions based on the
merits of compliance. Mediation is an alternative to judges and I am
delighted that its use is increasing. It is cheaper and quicker than
court, and as both parties need to buy into the process, its
settlements are often better observed and less divisive than court
judgments.</hs_Para>

services and health Departments to experiment with these questions and
those who are worried about the obligations or otherwise of the health
service should consider whether joint funding arrangements might be
needed in some places. Barbara Castle invented that approach and it was
a good thing. Our approach often goes in waves and we often come back
to things that we have abolished. Such an approach would have a lot to 
<?notus-xml column=73?>offer, but would be accessible only when all
services were prepared to collaborate and work together so
that the money could be drawn down to meet the plans.</hs_Para>

me say a word about the welcome commitment to nought-to-25 provision.
My experience of residential school started at the age of four, and
although I would not recommend that, over the years I have been won
over to a strong belief in the principle of integration. As with other
provisions in the Bill, we must ensure that the child’s needs
are paramount. We need a system that works within a local authority
area, collaborates across local authority boundaries and uses a degree
of regional planning—if I can use that term, as it is not
fashionable any more—to provide real options and choices and,
when necessary, a national perspective. That is particularly true in
post-16 provision when residential care and support is needed. Above
all, the emphasis should be not just on education and skills but on
skills for life that enable people to live independently on equal terms
and to be self-reliant. That takes more for some people than simply
going, as I did when I left residential schooling, to the local college
of technology.</hs_Para>

need an approach that means that the colleges which will be called
section 41 colleges know that they have secure funding. I do not
understand why the Skills Funding Agency cannot be used for that
purpose, rather than relying on a lottery of very expensive care from
local authorities, as I said at a recent reception. I also said that
funding for prisoners was greater than that for which we were asking
for post-16 residential provision, and that in terms of location, food
and discipline, my school was a bit like prison sometimes. One young
man who was at the reception to support college principals waggishly
suggested that it was the same in the school he went to—I do not
think he had a very good welcome after that. It is not the same; things
have moved on. We live in an entirely different environment, thank

and there is not support from both health and local government, we will
end up spending far more down the line, both in terms of mental health

shall refer briefly to the family justice elements of the Bill. The
Justice Committee report on the draft family justice clauses has been
cited several times this afternoon. It was published on 14 December
2012, and we had previously reported on the issue in July 2011. We
broadly welcomed the draft clauses, which covered a wide range of
public and private family law, and largely followed the Norgrove
recommendations. However, we had significant concerns about the clause
on “parental involvement.” Those words represent a
change; the original term was “shared parenting”, which
we disapproved of because it implies the carving up of the
child’s time in the interests of the parents. That point is
fundamental to our arguments about the Bill, and I shall return to it
in more

breakdown and the family justice process are highly emotive topics,
producing strongly held views, many based upon personal experience. We
bore that in mind during our inquiry, and in addition made sure that we
considered the proposed changes in the light of other changes that are
taking place in the family justice system. I should place it on record
that the Government accepted a number of our detailed recommendations
on the drafting of the Bill, and I much appreciate the work of the
Committee’s legal adviser and the Government’s ready
response.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022522000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0002.htm#13022522000028">On
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:22:50"></hs_TimeCode> public law

delay in the care process, which is absolutely essential. Lost time is
lost opportunity in a child’s life, and cannot be returned or
repaid. We praised the work being undertaken by some local authorities
and courts on a shorter timetable. We were impressed by the changes we
heard about in social worker training and management, and by the work
being done in Hampshire and the three London boroughs engaged in the
tri-borough project. We welcome the Government’s involvement,

Government have committed to considering whether further guidance on
the importance of kinship contact is required in advance of the
legislation, and to review the general impact of the clause on an
ongoing basis. We are also pleased that clause 15 on care plans now
makes express reference to section 34(11) of the Children Act 1989,
which considers parental contact with children in care. These are often

are glad that the Government removed the word
“exceptional” from the test for extensions to the 26-week

Government disagreed with the Committee on only a small number of the
recommendations, but particularly on whether the 26-week limit should
be set out in primary or secondary legislation and how flexible it
should be. I welcome the support we heard today from the Opposition
Front Bench on that issue. The big disagreement was about how the
parental involvement principle is applied. It is not really about the
principle, as there should be no disagreement that it is in the
interests of the child to remain in contact with both parents, unless
the risk of harm seriously outweighs it. We fully support that
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:26:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
adoption of the Committee’s recommendation to change the title
of the relevant clause is welcome. It represents a change from
sharing out parenting to recognising parental involvement, and we want
wider and more careful consideration of those parts of the Bill. The
Government have expressly stated that the courts already
operate on the basis that both parents should be involved
in a child’s life, unless of course it is not safe or
not consistent with the child’s welfare. They say that
they do not intend to change outcomes, and cases will
not be judged differently as a result of the
legislation, so why is the provision there? What is it intended

perhaps the Government will have to make it rather clearer that it is
wrong. On dealing with the perception, even if it is false, that there
is a bias in the court system, there is another issue that figures much
more largely in the concerns of many non-resident parents,
predominantly fathers, and that is enforcement. Court orders are made
that appear to give them reasonable involvement in the life of their
son or daughter, but they are not observed, and the process of
enforcing them is long, time-consuming and ineffective. We
urged the Government to produce proposals on enforcement. They
concluded that, on balance, it would be premature to legislate now to
give courts additional enforcement sanctions. What they hope to do is
bring cases quickly back to court—preferably to the same judge.

deals with many important issues, but I want to focus on child care.
The muddle of Government child care policy is not helped by the child
care clauses. They make nothing clearer; in fact, they make the chaos
worse. First, the Bill repeals the local authority duty to assess child
care provision. I am against that, because it is important that we
provide an accurate assessment of the availability of, and demand for,
child care in an area, and it is reasonable to expect that to be done
locally. I am greatly in favour of local authorities having more say on
the subject, but if we remove that statutory duty, in areas unlike
mine, where there are not that many children, that may be something
that falls off the edge of a local authority’s area of
responsibilities. That is another example of the Government’s
small-state-is-good 
<?notus-xml column=77?>ideology, this time on a local level, and with working parents as the
victims. It does not square with the Government’s

is also a huge issue to do with the proposed ratios between children
and their nursery carers or childminders. The policy is unworkable. It
beggars belief. It does nothing to reduce costs, but if one were to

quality. So that Members are absolutely clear, let me explain that the
Government propose that the adult-child ratios for nurseries should go
from one adult per three children to one adult per four children for
one-year-olds and younger—for the baby room in a nursery, as
most of us would know it—and from one adult per four children to
one adult per six children for two-year olds. They propose changing the

might mean one thing to the Minister who made the proposal, and another
to others. Is it a children’s centre or a local authority
effectively acting as an agent for Ofsted and professional
development locally—something that I could support, with the
right safeguards—or is it the relentless march of the private
sector, supported by the Government, who are enabling it to turn a
profit from the relationship between child- minders and
parents? We have had no further clarity on that from the
Minister today. Will the agencies be able to allocate any childminder
to any family, or will the parent have a say? The local, very specific
negotiation about a child is vital to the relationship between parents
and
childminders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022522000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0002.htm#13022522000047">Will
there be the recreation of what we could laughingly call the paradigm
of the agencies that manage domiciliary care for older people? As
someone who has been a carer for two older people, I would hate to see
child care go down that route—to see agencies creaming off a
profit while providing inadequate care—when we have a very good
childminder sector that has improved immensely thanks to the Ofsted
badge of quality, which is prized by childminders and valued by
parents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022522000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0002.htm#13022522000048">That

challenges arising from Ofsted inspecting such a range of childminders,

we have no great desire to make a political battleground of an issue as
important as the future of our children, but where are the safeguards

redress, and that is a big challenge in areas such as mine. Parents
with deep pockets who care for their children can find the money to
challenge the provision that is made—or not made, more

families in my constituency—the majority—cannot afford to
pay for their own private support through the SEN minefield. Although
there is a lot of good talk about the new provisions, there is no
detail on how they will work. A single point of redress is very
important if there is to be a level playing field for all

interest in the Bill lies in the area of special needs
education—an area in which my county of Herefordshire has,
despite very low levels of public funding, built a significant body of
expertise owing to excellent school leadership, teaching and parental
engagement. I refer to schools in my constituency such as Blackmarston
primary school and Barrs Court secondary school, both of which do
extraordinary work with disabled young people, 
<?notus-xml column=79?>and both of which have coped magnificently with the need for expansion
as numbers have grown. One of my early experiences as a

welcome the new duty on local authorities to set out a local offer of
suitable schools and institutions for each individual with special
needs, but I want to draw the attention of the House and of Ministers
to the fact that this carries with it a risk that the new duty will be
interpreted in a purely local and parochial way, cutting out national
providers with specialist expertise in particular areas. In Hereford,
the Royal National College, for example, has superb facilities for the
blind and partially sighted and is dedicated both to the skills of
learning and of living. It combines these with a track record of
innovation over several decades, ranging from special new Braille
technologies to flexible learning methods for the visually impaired to
the development of blind football and other sports at an international
level. If any Member of the House has not seen a blind football match,
I strongly encourage them to do so. It is a magnificent sport and full
of extraordinary
skill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:40:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0002.htm#13022524000007">No
local provider could match the Royal National College for expertise and
deep understanding of the highly complex special needs
associated with visual impairment. The students’ experience
bears this out. I think of the student at the RNC with a passion for
information technology who arrived, having been bullied for having a
teaching assistant and special support at a mainstream school. He took
his GCSEs three times and struggled to do a standard IT course because
of his visual impairment. After two years not in employment, education
or training, he was finally referred to the RNC by the local Jobcentre
Plus. He now takes specialist IT training for the visually impaired and
courses in art, and is back on track for the IT career he always
dreamed of. I invite the Minister to meet me and the Royal National
College to discuss its expertise and these issues in more
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:41:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0002.htm#13022524000008">In
closing, let me say that there appears to me to be a straightforward
solution to the problem of parochial local offers. This is to require
that local authorities include national specialist providers as well as
regional and local ones in those local offers. This has three benefits:
it maximises choice, promotes competition and preserves the national
providers’ deep reservoirs of 
<?notus-xml column=80?>skill and expertise. It also perfectly fits with the Bill’s
distinctively Conservative emphasis on excellence and institution
building. I ask Ministers to give this idea their close consideration

young witnesses receive support from registered intermediaries, and
also that at least half of young witnesses reported being unable to
understand some of the questions that they were asked in court. I agree
with the NSPCC that children who have been the victim of abuse should
always be supported by a registered intermediary, as they have been
shown to improve the administration of justice, ensuring that
questioning and cross-examination practice maximises the quality of
victim evidence. Furthermore and very importantly, the court experience

Graham Stuart</B> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</Member> It is a

on their contribution to the Bill. In particular, I congratulate
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:51:52"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Education, my hon. Friend the Member for
Crewe and Nantwich (Mr Timpson), on the way in which he presented the
Bill today, on how he dealt with pre-legislative scrutiny by the
Education Committee and on his general willingness to listen.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:59:36"></hs_TimeCode> Ministers
have the right attitude, the pre-legislative scrutiny approach is
exactly the right way to go about creating legislation. With reference
to another issue, I think that Ministers who listen to suggested
changes and then change tack accordingly should be seen not as weaker
as a result, but as stronger. It is about doing the right thing in the
long-term interests of children, rather than trying to avoid political
embarrassment on the day. Fortunately, pre-legislative scrutiny allows
no such embarrassment
anyway<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:52:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022524000027">Although
I broadly welcome all the provisions in the Bill, I will focus today on
special educational needs, which the Education Committee has looked at.
The

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:53:07"></hs_TimeCode> regulations

local offers, which will be critical. I think that I speak on behalf of
the whole Committee when I say that we have no doubt that for those
with education, health and care plans the framework set out in the Bill
will definitely lead to an improvement, although not perfection.
Getting it right for those on school action and school action plus
schemes—in other words, not the 3% who have a statement now, but
the 17% who are on other types of support—is critical, and that
comes down to the local

from the pilots that would allow us to understand what local offers
would actually look like. The regulations relating to local offers
need to address our recommendation on the need to clarify what
will be available for pupils with low to moderate SEN, particularly
those with speech, language and communication needs, who make up a
substantial group within the category. That is dealt with in paragraphs

role of health remains unclear in the Bill, but not because Ministers
are not trying their best; it touches on the issue I raised earlier
about the NHS constitution. On the positive front, we are encouraged by
the Minister’s clear determination to find ways to hold the NHS
to account for how well it meets the needs of children. The Bill makes
provision for time scales—they apply, for example, to responding
to requests for assessments of SEN, and to carrying out the
assessments—to be included in regulations, including provision
for aligning time 
<?notus-xml column=84?>scales between local authorities and health. That is to be welcomed,

implemented.</hs_Para>

Committee’s recommendation that the detail in an education,

“set out”, was accepted by the Government and is in the
Bill. The Committee’s recommendation on mediation being advised

regulations to set out how local authorities should involve young
people and their parents in preparing and reviewing the local
offer. The Bill now provides for more choice for young people with SEN
and their parents about where they will receive their
education. In response to the Committee’s recommendation
on independent specialist colleges and independent special schools,
provisions have now been included, so the Secretary of State can
approve individual institutions for which parents or young people
express a preference in their
plan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022524000037"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:57:37"></hs_TimeCode>The

The Committee expressed concern about SEN pathfinders failing to
involve colleges adequately in trialling the approaches to nought-to-25
provision. The Government’s response explains that pathfinders
will redouble their focus on the post-16 sector, along with
additional funding for well-performing pathfinders to advise others on
implementation, but I ask the House to note that the Association of
Colleges is concerned about the implementation of new funding a year

disappointing. I accept that they made a cogent case as to why that
was, but I hope that they might be able to look at that again. The

includes complex legislation on welfare reforms and health system
reforms, as well as massive cuts in local authority funding. It remains
to be seen how well those local authorities will cope with
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022524000052">I
want to conclude with a reference to one of my constituents: the mum of
an eight-year-old son with Down’s syndrome. She says that taking
him to all the various appointments he needs, whether for physiotherapy
or speech therapy, or even for accessing an appropriate shoe service,
given that he needs to wear corrective boots, has proved to be a
full-time job in itself. Such demands on her time meant she was forced
to give up work. As the household income has dropped with her loss of
earnings, her husband has taken a higher-paid job in Scotland to make
ends meet. Now the family is together only for the occasional weekend.

was one of the pre-1981 report children whose parents had to fight to
get me into a special school, and then fight again to get me back into
a mainstream school a few years later. The special school was not far
from the Minister’s own constituency, in Hebden Green. When I
was in the mainstream school, my parents had to fight to get the speech

school.</hs_Para>

special educational help they needed from their schools. Thirty years

Bill, as it starts to introduce some level of change. I pay particular
tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Brent Central (Sarah
Teather)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:09:17"></hs_TimeCode>, who is
sadly no longer in her place. What she did with her Green Paper was to

know not just from my own life story, but from what I see on the ground
in Blackpool, how important this issue is.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:19:17"></hs_TimeCode> one of our
council officers—the head of inclusion and access—gave
evidence during the Education Committee’s pre-legislative
scrutiny process, she explained why this matters so much in Blackpool,
where we have such a high transient population, with four times as many
young people than the national average entering the town already having
a statement—9.8% versus 2.8%. Yet Blackpool manages not to make
it an adversarial experience; in fact, it has fewer tribunals than the
national average. I can see that situation working itself out in my
constituency surgeries and in my casework.</hs_Para>

always with legislation, the temptation is to focus on the elements
that one is not completely happy with. I will try to resist that
temptation and look at the wider picture. I am very privileged to chair
the all-party group on young disabled people. What strikes me in that
role is that society no longer puts a lid on expectations for our young
disabled people and tries to limit what they can achieve. If anything,
the only lid that is placed on their expectations is the bureaucracy in
the system. Society is changing, but the structures of governance need
to change as well to enable them to keep pace. That is why the Bill is
so

I meet groups of these people, I am struck by the fact that so many of
them do not just want to go into work when they reach 18—they
want to go on to university, to go and live their lives. I welcome what
the Education Committee and the Minister have said about those who are
in apprenticeships or are not in education, employment or training
having access to EHC—education, health and care—plans.
However, I have a twinge of disappointment about the fact that
apparently those who want to go on to university will not have access
to those plans. I share the Committee’s concern that we 
<?notus-xml column=88?>need greater clarity over what this provision should look like for the
19 to 25 age group and how the local offer should be structured in this
regard. We have made great efforts in the draft Care and
Support Bill to ensure that those who wish to attend university
can take their social care package with them from their home local
authority to where they seek to go to university. That was a bold and
ambitious move that excited many young people, and I want to make sure
that what we do in this Bill has the same level of
sophistication.</hs_Para>

I urge Ministers to look again at the issue I raised in an
intervention—how we treat disabled young people who have a
health need but no specific educational need. I realise that it is very
difficult to place duties on the NHS. None the less, having had such a
revolutionary Bill that is going to change the landscape, it would be a
shame if we missed this opportunity to get it right for all our young
people.</hs_Para>

of the big things that excited me about the Green Paper was that it
finally tackled the issue of transition—the cliff edge that many
young people, and their families, come to when they transfer from child
services to adult services, whether they be wheelchair services,
community and mental health services, or so many other services. As
people reach the age of 16, child services start to tail off and there
is never any confidence that adult services will then kick in. People
get very concerned about that. I urge Ministers to embrace this
opportunity to resolve that cliff edge. Families have a fear of the
unknown because of the threat of uncertainty and fragmentation. On my
reading of the Bill, children with health needs but not educational
needs will not get an EHC plan. That is wrong given the spirit of the
Green Paper.</hs_Para>

is right. We must recognise that the Minister has moved substantially
on the issue, but it is still important that clause 69 specifically
recognises this group. Communication delays and speech and language

much of what I am highlighting can be teased out, made clear and made

However, there is concern inside and outside the House about some of

at the request of the provider, but there is deep concern at opposition
to plans to create new childminder agencies. Providers, the third
sector, parents and the Government’s own advisers also have deep
reservations about measures to change child-care ratios. Indeed, an
unpublished report being sat on by the Secretary of State apparently
says that changes to ratios will lead to a deterioration in the quality
of care and will not help parents reduce their costs. I have previously
asked for that report to be published and I repeat that request

are concerned that agencies could charge them high fees for registering
and that plans for Ofsted to cease inspecting agency-registered
childminders could confuse parents. Indeed, the Pre-School Learning

Government say that this Bill is about supporting vulnerable and
disadvantaged children and families. However, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) has said, one
group is conspicuous by its absence. Young carers do an
amazing job caring for relatives such as parents, siblings or
grandparents who have a disability or a mental health issue or who
suffer from substance misuse. Although new rights for adult carers are
proceeding in the draft Care and Support Bill, the Children and
Families Bill does not include equivalent provisions for young carers.
Many are concerned that this is a missed opportunity. The Bill is a key
opportunity to consolidate and simplify the law for young carers and to
provide them with rights equivalent to those given to adults. I hope
that the Government will take note of the many representations that are
being made on the issue and introduce proposals to ensure that young
carers will be covered by the Bill. I look forward to debating

want to discuss the role of the virtual school head teacher. Virtual
school head teachers are a tried and tested method for improving the
attainment of looked-after children. They have been shown to have a
positive impact when they are well resourced and focused. The Bill
contains a new statutory requirement for local authorities to appoint
at least one individual to promote the educational attainment of
looked-after children, and it is intended that such people will be the
virtual school head teacher. As the chairman of our local
charity in Calderdale, Together for Looked-after Children, and of the
all-party group on looked-after children and care leavers, I welcome
this important step forward, because although the attainment plight of
looked-after children has been acknowledged in the past, this Bill
finally puts accountability for such attainment on a level
playing
field<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:27:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022524000089">The
local authority duty to promote the education of looked-after children
does not cover young people over 18, but local authorities continue to
have some duties to support the educational achievement of care leavers
up to the age of 25. This support is especially important as care
leavers are less likely than their peers to achieve traditional testing
points throughout their educational life. Research by Catch22’s
national care advisory service and the Who Cares? Trust shows that it
is vital that the education of care leavers benefits from the same
strategic overview provided by virtual school head teachers as that of
looked-after
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022524000090">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:27:56"></hs_TimeCode>
that reason it is important that the Bill Committee looks carefully at
doing one or two additional things to strengthen the role of the
virtual head teacher. It should either extend the duty on local
authorities to promote educational achievement to include care leavers,
or include a new clause to require a strategic overview of duties
regarding the education of care leavers between the ages of 16 and
25<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:28:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022524000091">Such
an amendment would have several benefits. It would provide a strategic
oversight of educational provision for all looked-after children and
care leavers, and a framework to link education to broader career
planning and the employability responsibilities of schools and local
authorities. It would provide efficiencies in service delivery by
linking, not duplicating, existing pre-16 and post-16 provision. It
would provide a framework to monitor systematically the effectiveness
of educational provision for individuals and cohorts beyond the age of
16, supporting local authorities to deliver on the extended performance
indicators that will be introduced next year. It would also provide a
framework for capturing and supporting the educational needs of
looked-after children who enter care post-16, such as the homeless 16
and 17-year-olds under the Southwark ruling and unaccompanied
asylum-seeking children, as well as care leavers.</hs_Para>

proposal would improve joint working and information sharing with
further education, higher education and other employment, education and
training providers. It would also provide educational expertise to
train, advise and support social workers and personal advisers who work
with care leavers to deliver EET support, including through input into
pathway plans and post-16 personal education plans. The proposal would
also avoid gaps in the educational support provision of local authority
children’s services. For example, one local authority reported
recently that young people were unsupported during the summer holidays
post-GCSEs until the 16-plus service took over their case.</hs_Para>

proposal would meet the improved standards of accountability under the
forthcoming revised Ofsted framework, which will require local
authorities to demonstrate how they would support the education of care
leavers until they are 25. Ofsted has already had an impact, with one
local authority reporting that the remit of its virtual school head
teacher had been extended in response to criticism in a previous
inspection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:30:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022524000094">The
beauty of these tweaks is that they are achievable with little
additional resource. Many local authorities already deliver an extended
service, but I accept that there are concerns about the resource
implications of an extended statutory duty. Local authorities would be
free to decide the extent to which they used the remit of the virtual
school head teacher to provide enhanced services to care leavers. The
Who Cares? Trust and the National Care Advisory Service envisage that
virtual school head teachers will provide strategic oversight of the
educational support that local authorities must provide to care
leavers, rather than direct casework, unless local authorities find
that that would improve
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022524000095">More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:31:35"></hs_TimeCode>
importantly, the proposal would protect the investment in leaving care
support by providing a framework to monitor systematically and review
the effectiveness of educational support post-16 and providing the
evidence needed to evaluate services in order to enable better targeted
support and to eliminate ineffective interventions. It would protect
the investment in young people’s educational achievements at an
earlier age by ensuring that they were supported to complete further
and higher education and given the tools to achieve and maintain future
economic
well-being<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:31:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022524000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022524000096">The
proposal would also provide a framework for establishing better links
with other EET providers, including further and higher education
providers and training providers. Local authorities would be able to
make better use of the resources for vulnerable groups. For example,
they would be able to negotiate effective systems to access bursaries,
support services and other schemes that support educational

has acknowledged that the integration of education, health and care
plans is widely approved, but I wish to raise a question about
how it will work in practice. How will the role of health be captured
and delivered in the process? That question was put to me by the head
of Woodeaton Manor special school in my constituency, which I recently
visited. She doubted that the joint education, health and care plans
could be delivered without a statutory duty on health services. 
<?notus-xml column=97?>That was a great disappointment to her, because she
was very much in favour of them and wanted to give them a good
run<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:45:29"></hs_TimeCode>. I
understand that the constitution of the NHS and the way in which it
operates mean that that has not yet been possible to achieve, but I
encourage Ministers to continue their dialogue with their NHS
colleagues to find a way of sorting this out. Unless they do that,
there will be no certainty that the education, health and care plans
can be delivered, and that will be an enormous
shame<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:46:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000006">I
urge Ministers also to ensure that one person is appointed to look
after a child’s interests. My experience is that when more than
one agency is involved, the need for a person to look after the child
often falls through the cracks and we end up with nobody looking
after the child. In some cases the relevant person will clearly
be the education sponsor, but that will not necessarily be true in
other cases, particularly when we are dealing with those who are not in
education, employment or training. It would be extremely useful to have
a provision along those lines in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000007">The
education, health and care plans replace statements. The accusation has
been made that too many assessments are a bad thing and that they are
time-consuming, and I agree with that, but the more fundamental
point is that statements are a very blunt instrument that can be open
to misuse. I pay tribute to the staff of Woodeaton Manor school for the
fantastic work that they are undertaking there. When I visited, they
were preparing with some children with difficult autistic conditions to
take cakes to a cake stall at a local market. The head made the point
that the concentration on statements leads to too many children being
statemented as autistic. That not only inhibits the best use of
resources but dilutes the focus on those who really need
help. The misdiagnosis of SEN, or of the level of SEN, leads to the
easy solution that everybody ends up with a statement or
with SEN
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:48:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000008">Autism
is an important issue in both the south and north of my constituency,
where there are two organisations. The problem always comes when the
child leaves school. They come to a cliff edge at 16, or perhaps at 18
when provision is taken up to that age, when it is left to individual
organisations such as Thomley Hall in my constituency to help shape
that young person’s future. That is why I am particularly
pleased that the Bill’s provision extend to the age of 25 so
that that cliff edge can be smoothed out. Will the Minister confirm
that that will be the case for children with
autism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000009">The
new special educational needs code of practice will be important. It
will give statutory guidance on the provisions in the Bill, and I hope
that it will also set out how those who do not require education,
health and care plans will be
supported<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:49:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:49:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
Providing funding for that is important. Oxfordshire now has a good
range of high-quality cost-effective local provision for young people
aged 16 to 25 across special schools and colleges, but that is in stark
contrast to many other areas. Although it has developed local provision
that has significantly reduced expenditure on out-of-county placements,
there still seems to be disagreement on how the SEN block grant should
be treated and I urge Ministers to look at that.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:50:01"></hs_TimeCode>It is simply not
acceptable that so many families struggle to get the help and support
that their child needs to receive a first-class education. Every child
has the right to fulfil their potential, and I believe this Bill will
ensure that that happens.</hs_Para>

research by Bristol university estimates that around 173,200 children
are being raised by family members or friends of their parents because
their parents cannot look after them. That equates to one in
every 77 children in the UK, and in Bristol rises to one in
every 59 children. These children have often experienced tragedy or
trauma in their life due to the death or imprisonment of a parent, or
to a parent’s alcohol or drug misuse or
mental health problems. Sometimes, the parent has simply walked out on
them and disappeared. Most of those children are being raised by
grandparents, but sometimes siblings, aunts and uncles, and
even friends and neighbours or a parent’s ex-

arises. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>Children
benefit hugely from remaining within their wider family
units and with people they know and who love them. That helps them to
maintain contact with family members and sometimes, where appropriate,

are as safe as and do as well if not better than children in
unconnected foster care in terms of health, school performance and
attendance, self-esteem, and social and personal relationships. There
is also a marked improvement in emotional and behavioural problems.
Family and friends carers are more likely to be highly committed to the
children in their care than unrelated foster carers, as well as more
likely to match their ethnicity, leading to more stable
placements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:52:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000015">Only

sisters taken into care and put into foster homes before the courts
accepted that he was the best person to look after them. I was
fortunate to meet him in June 2011 when I introduced a ten-minute rule

extraordinary love and determination he has shown towards his younger
siblings,

1 of the Bill states that that when a local authority is considering
adoption for a child in the care system but is not yet authorised to
place them for adoption, it must consider placing that child with a
local authority foster carer who is also approved as a prospective
adopter. The local authority will no longer be required to give
preference to placing the child with their parents or a wider family
network. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:54:11"></hs_TimeCode>The
Family Rights Group has undertaken detailed research into the impact of
the proposals on family and friends care, and set out some careful and
reasoned amendments that I hope the Government will consider.
Clause 1 could apply to any looked-after child, even those in care by
agreement with the parents, despite there having been no due legal
process by which the threshold for the state to remove a child from
their parents and/or place the child for adoption is fully established.
In voluntary accommodation and pre-birth cases there will have been no

court’s final decision on whether a child should be removed from
their family will be pre-empted by the child forming attachments to the
prospective adopters. Any court that later considers the case would not
be able to resist the status quo argument—that it would be
better for the child to stay with the adopters than return to their
parents. That problem is further compounded by the lack of any legal
duty to work with parents to help them resolve their problems before or
after the child is looked after. It has been suggested that the measure
might squeeze out potentially suitable family and friends carers
because again the status quo argument would militate against moving a
child from prospective adopters to a relative’s

is vital that court decisions on whether to remove children permanently
are not pre-empted. In addition, the Government’s proposal to
limit the time frame for care proceedings to 26 weeks as set out in
clause 14 might be imposed at the expense of getting it right for
children. I am aware that that aspect of the Government’s
changes to adoption has not received a proper airing because so far the
debate in the media has been on efforts to reduce the emphasis given to
ethnicity, culture and so on when matching a child to an adopter
parent. However, given that this Bill makes provision for children to
be removed from their families without due legal process being
observed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>, I am
slightly surprised that it has not caused more alarm among Government
colleagues, who are normally quite exercised by the concept of an
overbearing state interfering with people’s lives. I hope that
the Government will reconsider clauses 1 and 6, and that they will take
the opportunity to introduce amendments set out by the Family Rights
Group that could support kinship care arrangements. I hope that such
matters are considered in Committee.</hs_Para>

Paul Beresford</B> (Mole Valley) (Con):</Member> I congratulate
Ministers and ex-Ministers on this Bill—the way it has proceeded
and been put together—and on their willingness 
<?notus-xml column=100?>to discuss it. Ministers will be aware from the
discussion this evening that much of this Second Reading debate has
turned into a Committee stage. I do not intend to continue that and
will say merely that this broad Bill is about looking after
children—something I have been interested in since the early
’80s when I was on a social services committee in an
inner-London borough.</hs_Para>

point I want to pick up briefly and congratulate Ministers on concerns
adoption. The social services committee was looking after a broad
spectrum of issues—everything one could possibly expect in
inner-London, with all its problems—but one point that struck
some of us was that an awfully large number of looked-after children
were in homes. Although those homes were good and tried hard, there was
a turnover and no parental influence, and the opportunities for
children to progress were not good. Some of those children were not
suitable for adoption, but the whole council attitude changed and we
pushed towards fostering and adoption with huge success.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022528000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000023"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:58:03"></hs_TimeCode>As
I have said, that took place in the early ’80s in the days
before political correctness came in. We saw some extraordinary and
beneficial changes and I will relate a small story as an example. As
councillors, we met all the adoption and fostering people regularly,
including one young couple who had adopted two boys—they were
pre-school age, just. The father was English and the mother Australian,
and one of the two boys was white and one black although both were
exactly the same age. The success of the family was striking, and by
that I mean even the extended family. The grandmother in Sydney knitted
pullovers for both boys, each with his name across the front. On the
first visit to grandma, they flew into Sydney. The boys decided that
they were going to fool grandma so they swapped their pullovers which,
if you think about it, is actually about a big smile.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:59:08"></hs_TimeCode>What I am really
getting at is that the change and opportunity for those kids once they
were adopted were striking.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022528000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000024"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:59:14"></hs_TimeCode>Through
my constituency actions and going back to that local authority,
I was staggered at the way the system had gummed up and how children
and those who wished to adopt were not getting the opportunity to do
so. Progress had stopped. As speaker after speaker has pointed out,
that space of time is short for us but long for those children.
Therefore, succinctly, I congratulate Ministers on going ahead and
taking on those problems, and on having the courage to tackle the
political correctness while recognising an element of truth in what
people
say.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_25_PT_1/ADA747EC5BF9EC18D919165B79DA2E8515DEB217" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 February 2013">Monday

Cunningham</B> (Stockton North) (Lab):</Member> It is vital for our
children and young people that the Bill delivers the change that they
want and need, with the necessary resources, safeguards, directions and
clear lines of accountability. Failure to deliver on those factors will
mean that the Bill will not be worth the paper it is written on. Worse,
it could lead to deterioration in service provision and huge variations
in the quality of service offered to children and young people in
different parts of the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000026">I
do not doubt that Ministers have every good intention with the Bill,
but good intentions are not enough to satisfy the needs of our
community. Government cuts have caused a lack of specialist services
and professionals since 2010. It is for Ministers to explain how the
reforms 
<?notus-xml column=101?>will work in that context. The Education Committee carried out
pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill’s SEN provisions, but the
sector still has concerns that funding cuts in different areas will
undermine the positive impact that elements of the Bill could provide
to those who need
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000027">The
SEN clauses have created deep-seated cause for concern in the sector,
possibly because of the lack of detail in the Bill. They include
measures that will shift us from statements to health and social care
plans. The key difference between the outgoing system and the new one
is that the new plans will extend beyond the mandatory school age,
which I welcome. However, the system of education health and care plans
does not include a greater degree of legal entitlements than the system
it
replaces.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000028">Parents
with children who have SEN are rightly concerned that current problems
will not be solved without a single point of accountability for parents
seeking redress. That must be put right. For example, Ambitious about
Autism proposes changing the Bill to include a duty that requires local
authorities to conduct a review of support available to young people
aged 19 to 25 when they fall out of education. That would give them the
best possible chance of re-engaging in learning and accessing future
employment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000029">I
am pleased that the Government have responded to the Education
Committee’s suggestion for an extension of such entitlements to
apprentices and, in specific circumstances, to young people who are not
in education, employment or training. However, the Government have not
taken that promising first step to its logical and desirable
conclusion. We should support each and every young person with an EHC
plan up to the age of 25, including those in supported employment.
Under the current provisions, young people at university will cease to
be eligible for EHC plans as soon as they begin their courses. Surely
the Government do not want to abandon such young people when they are
facing the biggest change in their lives. I would like to hear what the
Minister has to say on that. Is that a simple oversight that will be
corrected? Campaign groups such as Every Disabled Child Matters and the
Special Educational Consortium have observed that disabled children
without learning difficulties will not have access to the new
plan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000030">Scope
says that the Bill represents an important opportunity to alleviate
some of the strain on families with disabled children. I agree with
Scope’s objective of amending the Bill to include a guarantee of
better support for disabled children and their families in their local
area. The Bill requires local authorities to publish information on the
services they expect to be available in their areas to children and
young people with special educational needs and
disabilities—both with and without education, health and care
plans. However, the Bill does not say what they must provide. Why are
the Government reluctant to provide a national framework of minimum
standards for local offers? A greater degree of guidance from the
Government would improve accountability and set higher standards for
local councils to fulfil their obligations under the new
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000031">We
need assurances from the Government that the new SEN system does not
evolve from an informal postcode lottery to a formal one. The National
Union of Teachers has concerns that, although local authorities retain

am pleased that the Government—I seem to be very pleased with
them tonight— accepted the Education Committee’s
suggestion during pre-legislative scrutiny that the new code of
practice should be laid before Parliament, but the Bill requires that
it is laid under the negative resolution procedure. It is not
clear why the code will not be subject to the positive resolution given
the importance of its contents. I am also concerned that the Secretary

Members agree that it should not be necessary for parents to feel
constantly that they have to battle the system, and/or that the only
way they will make progress is by enlisting the help of their Member of
Parliament. Everyone welcomes the fact that the Government want to put
in place a radically different system to support better life outcomes
for young people, and to give parents confidence by giving them more
control and transferring power to professionals on the front line and
in local communities. It is good news that the Government clearly want
to bring about better life outcomes for young people from birth to
adulthood by helping professionals to identify and meet
children’s needs early; by ensuring that health services and
early education in child care are accessible to all children, and that
those services work in partnership with parents to give each child
support to fill their potential; and by joining up education, health
and social care to provide families with the package of support that
reflects all their needs. But there are still many questions, to which
I am not sure that I yet have all the answers—and actually in
this regard I see myself just as a typical constituency MP wanting to

combined education, health and care plan? How will schools prepare
themselves for when parents are much more in control of the SEN
budgets? What will happen to those children who do not quality for the
EHCP and those children whose difficulties are often not diagnosed
until later on in their school life? Among the health and social
service professionals needed in some instances to support children with
special educational needs are educational psychologists and speech and
language therapists. Do we have enough and how do parents access them?
Are we sure we are giving teachers adequate training to teach children
with a whole range of conditions, particularly those on a wide scale
such as autism? How can we ensure a more consistent approach is taken
across all local education authorities? How do we improve the
transition from primary to secondary education? How do we improve the

of children with special educational needs raise two further issues
with me. First, they feel all too often that their children are being
bullied at school. I hope that we can do more to explain to students,
perhaps in year 7, about the various neurological disorders and other
disabilities that they might find among school friends, which I hope
would then reduce bullying by increasing

other concern is the number of exclusions of children with special
educational needs. I think I am correct in saying that pupils with a
statement of special educational needs are at present nine times more
likely to receive a permanent exclusion than those without. Of course,
SEN is not some sort of label that can be used to excuse bad or unruly
behaviour in schools, but I would have thought it sensible that, if it
was thought appropriate for any child to have either a temporary or, in
particular, a permanent exclusion, very serious thought be given to

recently held an Adjournment debate on the SEN provisions in the Bill,

remind colleagues that this is not a marginal issue. There are some
700,000 disabled children in England and some 1.7 million children are
said to have special educational needs. However, far too many of these
families feel they live close to crisis point, and MPs are all too
familiar with the cases of parents who are forced to fight through a
seemingly endless bureaucratic nightmare in order to get the support
they so desperately need for their
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000054">At
the heart of the struggle faced by families with disabled children and
those with SEN is the unacceptable lack of support for these families
close to home. Recently, a report by Scope found that the biggest issue
facing families with disabled children is a lack of local support
services. More than six in 10 parents of disabled children say they are
not able to get the services that they and their child need in their
local area. Child care, respite care and therapeutic services, such as
speech and language therapy, are often just not readily available. This
lack of local accessible services can have a devastating impact on a
family’s quality of life. Research has found 80% of families
with disabled children who cannot access the services they need locally
report feeling anxious and stressed, and more than half said they
missed out on doing family activities together as a
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000055">This
situation is getting worse, not better, with local authorities now
facing cuts of up to 30% of their budgets. Many councils are therefore
being forced to cut services for disabled people, making an already bad
situation worse. For example, more than half of councils have cut
spending on respite breaks for families, and 77% of local authorities
are either making cuts or efficiency savings in services for people
with a learning disability. The fundamental question underlying
today’s debate is where the money will come from to make the
improvements promised by the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000056">The
Government have said that that their reforms to SEN provision will
reduce the adversarial nature of the system, putting an end to the
frustration of parents having to fight to get the support their
children need. I welcome the Bill’s intentions,
particularly the requirement 
<?notus-xml column=106?>for local authorities to publish a “local offer”, to
better enable families to find the education, health and care support
they need. I also welcome the duty on local agencies to jointly plan
and commission services for disabled children—something long
overdue in a system that tends to compartmentalise children and their
families. But I cannot help but feel that while the Government’s
proposed reforms are well intentioned, they very much lack the ambition
to truly improve the support available for families with disabled
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000057">Clause
30, for instance, requires a local authority only to produce
information on the education, health and care services “it
expects” to be available locally. Many organisations in the
field do not believe that this will reduce the battle that families
face in getting the support they need. Unfortunately, the local offer
stands as little more than a directory of services, with no legal
compulsion on the part of local agencies to actually provide what is
set out in the offer. Furthermore, if the local offer is to work, it is
vital that families with disabled children and children with
SEN are able to hold local agencies to account for the delivery of the
services contained in that offer. Without that accountability, families
with disabled children will have no way of ensuring that the services
they need are available. However, the Bill is totally inadequate in
this respect, with local authorities being required only to publish
comments by parents and young people on the local offer. That will not
be enough for parents to hold local agencies to account, nor will local
agencies be under any obligation to improve the services contained in
the offer, and the chances are that parents will continue to battle
with local authorities as they have in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:20:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000058">It
is even more important for the local offer to be strengthened if
Parliament consents to the clauses that abolish the school action and
school action plus programmes, as children under those categories will
be totally reliant on the services contained in the local offer.
Currently, almost 1.4 million children with SEN do not have a statement
and will not qualify for the plan under the proposed reforms—87%
of the total number of children with SEN. Those children are currently
supported under the school action and school action plus programmes.
Often they have distinct needs, such as speech and language
difficulties, which will have to be met solely by services contained in
the local offer. If that offer is weak and unaccountable, those
children could miss out on the support they currently receive or will
need in the future.</hs_Para>

Aldous</B> (Waveney) (Con):</Member> I shall concentrate my few words,
before my voice gives out, on special educational needs. The Bill is to
be welcomed, because while there are examples of good practice, the
current system of SEN is not fit for purpose. I have been
advised of examples where young, vulnerable people and their families
have been let down; there are cases in which children have been
excluded from activities, such as sports days and swimming, and in
which schools have failed to provide support for a child until a
medical diagnosis has been received, despite accepting that the child
was struggling to access the curriculum. In contrast, there are other
schools where completely the opposite service is being provided, with
schools being super-supportive despite no diagnosis. There have been
cases where parents have had to attend schools themselves to provide
one-to-one support for their child, and where parents have been asked
to take their child home at lunchtime due to staff
shortages.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000063"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:22:58"></hs_TimeCode>The
Bill provides the framework to transform the system for children and
young people with SEN to ensure that a consistently high service is
provided across the country, with the examples of poor practice
provided being consigned to history. It is right that young people and
their families should have greater control and choice in decisions that
affect their lives. It is right that the health service should play a
full role in improving the planning, commissioning and provision of
services. It is very much a step in the right direction that
young people will be on the same footing whether they attend a
maintained school, an academy, a further education college or a sixth
form college. Replacing statements with a single assessment process and
combined education, health and care plans is to be welcomed.</hs_Para>

I said at the outset, there are examples of good practice. Scope
currently works with Suffolk county council to provide Activities

breaks and leisure services for children, their families and their
carers. By using the purchasing power of existing local service users,
Activities Unlimited has increased the availability of local services
such as youth clubs, swimming pools and play centres for families
across Suffolk, including those in my constituency. It is important

Bill provides the opportunity to do that, but I would be grateful if
the Government considered some issues in Committee and on Report that
will improve the Bill. First, everyone who needs a plan up to 25 should
get one. Provision should not be restricted to those with a statemented
SEN. As other hon. Members have said, it is also necessary to consider
higher education. The local offer needs refining, and should be backed
up with a national framework. There must be accountability for
delivering the local offer, and while the education health care plans
are welcome, more work is needed. Consideration should be given to how
best to commit health authorities to delivery of their new
responsibilities. One should also bear in mind the changing role of
local authorities in education. With the rise of academies and
free schools, local education authorities do not have the powers they
once had. The Bill should be future-proofed to take account of the fact
that the role of local education authorities may change still further

authorities are taking very different approaches, with the worst

deliverers of the service, and that is endangering the quality of the

that, at the very least, local authorities should continue to fund
current students until they have completed their course. It is
important that that commitment is given by the Government to provide
assurance in the system, so that there is the
confidence to build on the

The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

exclusion of young offenders from this Bill. I hope that the Government
take the opportunity in Committee to re-examine that, because it seems,
for reasons he<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
expressed better than I could, that these young people need all the
support they can get. Education for over-18s is not supported strongly
in the Bill; it says that local authorities “can” take
account of that when developing provision. That means that they might
not take it into account, so the Government could also look to
strengthen provision in that
area<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

list of small issues, I would like the Government to examine the higher
education provision. Young people with these additional needs should
surely be supported in higher education, too, but the Bill deliberately
excludes young people in higher education. Some young people’s
higher education will be provided by further education colleges, and
there is a lack of clarity about the position for that group in

welcome the excellent way in which the Minister began the debate by
saying that he wanted to engage with issues and take the opportunity to
improve the Bill. A number of hon. Members have mentioned the
good intentions of the Bill and touched on the real issue, which is
that with the changing landscape of free schools, academies, studio
schools and so on—the hon. Member for Waveney mentioned
that—there is a dislocation and dismemberment of a service, and
we end up with a series of ad-hoc provisions. The Bill recognises the
need for a proper service, but providing it is a challenge, because
whereas Every Child Matters has a clear and direct philosophy behind
it, the philosophy behind this Bill is at variance with the philosophy
behind many of the other educational changes the Government are pushing
forward. The Bill provides an opportunity for this

close to the hearts of Ministers, hon. Members and many of our

for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin), who has just made a typically well-informed
contribution, I am not an expert in this policy area. Most of what I
have learnt about it has come through the tuition of a very good
organisation in the New Forest, Supporting special Children And their
Relatives and Friends—SCARF. It has alerted me to one particular
aspect in the Bill, which was referred to by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:34:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

encountered by young people when they reach 16.</hs_Para>

composed of parents of children with serious learning difficulties.
They cope, and in most cases they cope quite heroically, but they need
a degree 
<?notus-xml column=110?>of certainty in order to plan their lives. They told me that young
people aged up to 16 were guaranteed five days of tuition per week, and
were subsequently classified as adults. They had been receiving the
full range of support to proceed to further education on what might be
regarded as a full-time basis—for at least five days a
week—but over the years since 2008, first under Labour and then
under the present coalition Government, further education funds had
been successively cut, and they were able to receive further education
provision for their children with special needs first for just four
days a week, and then for three. A ravine, or chasm, had
appeared between the ages of 16 and 18. Families who had worked out a
way of coping beforehand, and could cope afterwards, were suddenly
confronted with an additional severe burden which could disrupt all
their plans and hopes over that two-year
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000079">This

I have received from the Under-Secretary of State for Education, my
hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr Timpson), and I think
it is a measure of Ministers’ commitment to the Bill that he
appears to have been present since the beginning of the debate. I was
also struck by the fact that the Secretary of State was present for the
first two hours, although he would not be participating directly in the
debate, and I know that the Under-Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills, the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo
Swinson), who will wind up the debate, has been present for the vast
majority of it. I therefore have no doubt about the seriousness with
which these problems are being
taken.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000080">I
originally raised the matter in an Adjournment debate on 22 October
last year. My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich sent me a
very helpful letter on 13 December, at the end of which he
wrote—it was the first occasion during all my time in Parliament
that a Minister had done this—“If you would like to come
and talk this over with my officials, please do so.” I did, and
the meeting took place on 13 February, less than a fortnight
ago.</hs_Para>

point emerged from those discussions. I shall observe the
principle that one should only try to make one main point in any given
oration; at least, that is what Mr. Speaker always used to tell me
during the years when we were practising our speaking techniques before
entering this place. I understand that, whereas in the past funds have
been effectively guaranteed on the basis that a minimum of 450 teaching
hours a year will be supplied for young people with special educational
needs, that minimum will rise to 540 hours, with an average of 600.
What was impressed on us by the Minister’s officials at the
meeting was that that should mean that any further education college
delivering those hours should deliver them over a period of at least
four days, rather than three.</hs_Para>

simple suggestion. It relates, I suspect, to clause 37(4) of the Bill,
which
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13022528000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000097">“Regulations

think that we need either an amendment at a later stage, or a
commitment from a Minister that those regulations will specify that the
minimum number of teaching hours —now, I believe, guaranteed to
be 540, with an average of 600—shall be delivered over no 
<?notus-xml column=111?>fewer than four days. That would be a major step in
the right direction, because it would mean that those
parents—with all the burdens that they bear, all the efforts
that they make, and all the courage that they show—could be
assured that, for at least four days a week, their children could
receive appropriate stimulation and support. As they point out, the
last thing someone aged between 16 and 18 wants is to be nursemaided by
their parents. They need stimulation and support. The Government are
offering the extra hours—all praise to them for that—but
they should ensure that the local authorities are instructed to deliver
them over a minimum of four days a

McKinnell</B> (Newcastle upon Tyne North) (Lab):</Member> The Bill
covers such a medley of issues about which I and many of my
constituents care deeply that it was difficult to know where to start.
I have raised many of them previously in the House from both the Front
Bench and the Back Benches, including the adoption process, the
importance of supporting all looked-after children, the reform of the
family justice system, how to enable parents to create a better
work-life balance and the protection of Sure Start services, which I am
alarmed to see being put at risk by some of the Government’s
local authority cuts. All those issues are incredibly important, as
they not only have a direct effect on our constituents but impact on
the welfare of society as a whole. However, I decided to focus on the
reforms to the system for children and young people with special
educational needs, including those who are disabled, so that, in the
words of the Department for Education,</hs_Para>

Bill’s aim to provide support from birth to the age of 25
through the new education, health and care plans is laudable and
deserves cross-party support. We all know from our constituency
casework that the provision for families and children with special
educational needs is often not up to scratch and, too often, the
support that is available must be fought for extremely hard by parents.
I welcome the move towards EHCPs, but I support the concerns expressed
by several special educational needs organisations that as the Bill is
drafted they will offer no more legal entitlement to support from
health and social care services than statements. I know that
organisations such as the National Autistic Society—including
its Newcastle branch, which I met recently—are very concerned
that the health and social care aspects of EHCPs should be put on the
same statutory footing as education, with greater duties in
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:42:05"></hs_TimeCode>. If the
Government are serious about delivering a joined-up system of support
to families across all services, that concern must be addressed and

am keen to focus today on personal budgets, the idea of a local offer
of support and, more particularly, how that will be delivered on the
ground in the current climate of austerity and cuts to local services.
Earlier this month, Mencap published its latest report into the
provision of short breaks, commonly known as respite care, for family
carers of people with a learning disability. That excellent report
makes sobering, indeed difficult, reading. Its key finding is that
eight out of 10 family carers are still reaching crisis point due to a
lack of breaks from caring. The Minister should be particularly 
<?notus-xml column=112?>concerned by the report’s findings that, in the past three years,
four out of 10 family carers said they had experienced cuts to short
breaks and four out of 10 felt their short breaks services had got
worse. Three out of 10 councils had closed short breaks services for
adults and children, more than half had cut spending on short breaks
and six out of 10 had provided short breaks services to a smaller
proportion of children with a learning disability in their
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:43:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000087">I
know from my constituency just how important short-break provision is
to families with children, including adult sons and daughters, with
learning disabilities and special educational needs. In Newbiggin Hall
in my constituency, we are hugely fortunate to have Cheviot View, a
purpose-built and extremely impressive facility that provides overnight
residential short-break care for children and young people with
disabilities aged 6 to 18. The city council area also has Castle Dene,

had the privilege of visiting both centres and meeting the families who
use the extremely high-quality facilities, which have been described as
an example of best practice. The short breaks provided by the centres
to children and young people with a wide range of different and often
very complex needs enables them to develop friendships, be independent
and take part in activities in which they simply would not otherwise
have the opportunity to take part. More than that, short breaks provide
their often exhausted and isolated families with much needed respite,
not a holiday, just the opportunity to take a break from their
full-time caring role and do the everyday things, such as shopping,
cleaning, having a full night’s sleep and spending time with
their other children, that most of us take for granted. By doing that,
the centres undoubtedly help to prevent family and relationship
breakdown, and there is no doubt in my mind that they provide an
absolute lifeline to many local
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000089">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:45:04"></hs_TimeCode>
recent meetings with families who see those facilities put at risk were
invariably moving and emotional. The reason for my visits was the
proposed closure of those centres by Newcastle city council as part of
its draft budget for the period 2013-16. Following the cuts to local
authority funding, the city treasurer estimates a funding gap in the
city of about £100 million. Newcastle is not alone. Other
northern cities and the poorest London boroughs are bearing the brunt
of many of the local government cuts; the areas in most need of support
are being hardest
hit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000090">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>
respite centres in Newcastle were therefore considered for closure
towards the £100 million of required savings, alongside a whole
raft of other savings. I am pleased to say that since the budget
consultation closed, and following an incredible campaign run by local
people including Nicola Vose, the tenacious mother of two children who
use the facilities, the council is revisiting its decision and has
announced that the centres will remain open until 2014 and, I very much
hope, beyond. Part of the reason the centres may be able to stay open
is that many local authority areas around Newcastle are closing their
centres and may now need to access services in
Newcastle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022528000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022528000091">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>

confirm how much consideration

That includes the 
<?notus-xml column=114?>responsibilities of parents who have done a runner.
The legislation will make it clear to them that they have a
responsibility to their children, whether they are on the scene
or not. The provision does nothing to dilute the principle of the
paramountcy of the welfare of the child; that is absolutely clear. If
it did anything else, I would not support it. It is in clause 1; it is
subjugated to that very important paramountcy principle in the opening

lot has happened on adoption in the past few years. This legislation
builds on the work of the adoption action plan and the adoption
gateway. It was encouraging to see the early glimmers of a reversal in
the trend in adoption numbers since 2007; we saw a tick up in 2012, but
it is early days. I very much support the measures on fostering for
adoption, or concurrent planning, as we used to call it. Coram in
particular has done some excellent work on that. It is about a seamless

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:51:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stockport (Ann Coffey) said, we absolutely need to do more research
on those adoptions that are disrupted. I am afraid that it is also
necessary for us to do more around ethnic matching. As to whether we
need legislation to do it, I do not know, but we absolutely need to
make it clear that first and foremost a child needs a safe, loving,
stable environment from a family. If that family happens to be an
ethnic match, that is a bonus; it should not be a deal-breaker for the
child.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022532000019">I
am concerned that the £150 million taken from the early
intervention grant may mean that provision is taken away from children
who remain in care. Even if we double the number of children going into
adoption—that is not a target—90% of children in the care
system will remain in it, in foster care and residential homes, and
will not go into adoption. Yet the only measures in the Bill relating
to looked-after children are those for virtual heads, which I welcome,
and those on contact arrangements. Why do we not extend personal
budgets to foster carers? Why do we not do more to give children in
care priority access to mental health services? Half of children in
care suffer from mental health problems. That is probably the single
biggest contribution we could make to giving them greater stability and
a chance to do well at
school.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022532000020">As
the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has
said, half of children who come into care because of abuse or neglect
suffer further abuse when they return home, with up to half of them
returning to care. If we did more to support them, so that they could
stay with their families, we would have fewer kids in care.</hs_Para>

more. Where I take issue with the Government is on recruitment. We
desperately need to recruit more prospective adopters. We desperately
need voluntary agencies to recruit more adopters, but it is too early
to compel local authorities to take away the responsibility for
recruiting adopters. It has been only a year since the adoption
scorecard came out. They are three-year track records, and they are
always retrospective. We need to give local authorities a greater
chance to show that they can recruit more adopters and work in
partnership with voluntary agencies. One thing that we could do to help
those agencies is create a bounty fee; voluntary agencies would be paid
for recruiting prospective adopters. At the moment, the more they
recruit, the more they have to pay to retain and train them. They do
not get paid until they receive the inter-agency fee. A bounty measure
would incentivise voluntary agencies to do more of what they so
successfully do to recruit. The Bill risks de-linking adoption from
other permanent options.</hs_Para>

I would like to see more measures for supporting young carers, as many

that have gone badly wrong. I would like to see child performance
regulations in the Bill—which my ten-minute rule Bill will
propose—as it is the only opportunity that we have had and
probably will have in this Parliament to introduce them. I would also
like to see us do more to compel local safeguarding children’s
boards to publish their serious case reviews and to commission them in

impact of a local offer without minimum standards. Lack of minimum
standards could be the undoing of the intention behind it. With falling
budgets it will be very difficult for local authorities to deliver on
education, health and care plans without national minimum standards. A

School Action Plus. The Government will need to address in some detail

children in care and the plans to speed up adoption, the Government
have made much of the delays in adoption. Two and a half years, as the
Minister pointed out, is the average time it takes for a child to be
adopted. It is right to point out that for young children delay in
making secure, long-term, safe relationships can be as damaging as the
neglect or abuse that caused them to be taken into care in the first
place. For children who are adopted and for families adopting, where
the right match is made between child and family, yes, everything
should be done to speed up the legal and administrative
process.</hs_Para>

are problems with the speed of the court process, with the
understanding of the courts, with the case loads of social workers, and
with the understanding of some professionals of the impact of delay or
the impact of children moving from birth family, sometimes to multiple
foster carers. Understanding of the long-term psychological damage done
is improving, but there are still delays at all stages. However, just
speeding up adoption placements is not the full answer. Some 90% of
children in care do not go on to be adopted. I agree that where
adoption can be speeded up, it should be, and so should decisions about
long-term foster care, kinship care, special guardianship and keeping
families together. These should all be made in a timely fashion. In
short, we need a system of care for children which is for the many, not
just the lucky

idea that adoption is the gold standard, followed by lesser options for
other children, is not good enough for the most disadvantaged group of
children in our society. Just because a child ends up in a
children’s home does not mean that they should receive a lower
level of care or support than one who is adopted. Speed is not always
the answer. Getting the placement right is tricky. Adoption placements,
sadly, break down. Just as with children who are in foster care or
residential care, children who are adopted are often severely damaged,
physically or psychologically, and it can be very difficult for them to
build relationships with adoptive or foster parents.</hs_Para>

circumstances. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:59:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for East Worthing and Shoreham said, the presumption that the child is
put first is incredibly important, and I glad that he pointed out that
that is not affected by what is proposed. If it is in the interests of
the child for adoption to be rushed through, that is great, so let us
do all we can when a child and prospective adopters bond, but when it
is not so clear, a little more thought needs to be given. It must be
worse for a child to be placed with a family only to find out months or
even a few years later that they have to move to another
placement.</hs_Para>

importance of identity and the need to form stable attachments are
crucial to the well-being of each child, and the long-term impact on
children who have gone through the care system cannot be
underestimated. In the long term, the impact is there for all to see in
the high number of young people who were in the care system and whose
life chances have been permanently damaged. Sadly, children who are in
care are all too likely to end up with few or no qualifications, which
has a seriously damaging impact on their job prospects and 
<?notus-xml column=117?>increases the chances that they will have mental
health problems, will be homeless or will struggle to build stable
relationships later in life. Of course, far too many people in our
prisons were in care as children.</hs_Para>

is crucial that everything is done to support children in care to
ensure that they have a stable, loving home, whether through adoption
or not. In order to achieve that, we need to look at those adults who
are expected to support the children in the care system. We have heard
a lot about social worker case loads. We need to recruit and train more
social
workers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0003.htm#13022532000032">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:01:20"></hs_TimeCode>
want to talk about foster carers, adoptive parents and the recruitment
of the adults who could look after so many more of the children going
through the care system. What I want to see from the Government are
ideas on how we can get far more adults to be adoptive parents. It is
about being honest and upfront with them about the difficulties they
will face, the emotional challenges of children who are severely
damaged, and all the challenges, stress and problems that can be caused
for a family taking on such vulnerable children. Being upfront is the
way to go, but training and support is also important. If we are to
have professionals in teaching, in nursing and in social work, why not
make people professionals when they come forward to adopt or to care as
foster carers? Why not express formally that they are professionals and
put in place the money to support them, and not just in the support
services, but in the funding they get
themselves?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_25_PT_1/48D21892C4F2065732230E779BE6EA3D691844CF" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 February 2013">Monday

11, most of all, is dear to my heart. It will give children the right
to know, and to have a relationship with, both their parents. We need
the understanding that the child must have the right to a relationship
with both parents, because too often it is about mums’ rights
and dads’ rights, but this is actually about the
rights of the child. It is not right that a parent should sink
their child’s right to know the other parent in a sea of
acrimony when they split up. From my point of view, that is a very
timely and welcome reform. I have had so many complaints about that
from constituents, such as Mrs A of Wootton, who wrote about her
son’s experience. She said, “Each time a visit is due,
their mother creates a great deal of hassle, never being able to give a

child. What I have to say is that it is wholly wrong in both cases, as
it is an abuse of the child’s rights. It is a child’s
right to know and have a relationship with both parents because both
parents have love, affection, knowledge and mentorship to
offer—and the law should not stand in the way of that; the law
should assert and assist that and make it more possible.</hs_Para>

the special needs elements, I am grateful for the briefings we received
from the Association of Educational Psychologists, my own local group
the Hillingdon Autistic Care and Support society, and the National
Autistic Society itself. Future work will be based on the foundation
stones of the assessment procedure. The regulations or the code of
practice need to be explicit about what is expected in the assessment.
There will be a requirement to draw on very specialist services. I
would welcome it if those services were spelled out in some detail in
the regulations—for example, that there will be recourse to
educational psychologists, that there will be recourse to
speech and language therapy. It should be obligatory that that sort of
service will be part and parcel of the assessment procedure. Again, I
fear that in this economic climate some local authorities, for example,
might be tempted to save money by using less rigorous assessment
procedures or by using under-qualified or inappropriately qualified
staff to save money. That can be overcome, I think, only by central
direction from the central Government in regulation.</hs_Para>

will be important in these assessments. I am anxious that there are no
time limits in the Bill and hope that they will be determined in more
detail in regulations. We should set out in regulations the specific
time limits on responses to parents’ requests for assessment, on
providing a mediation certificate, and on when a plan is to be put in
place. There also need to be regulations on the form and content of the
plans, because there are anxieties not only about a postcode lottery,
as others have said, but about the possibility that form and content
could vary across the piece. That could not only create difficulties

were formerly covered by the School Action and School Action Plus

improve the lot of those young people who will be subject to the new

talking about for so long is vital if we are to make real progress. The

for young people up to the age of 25, it is essential that 25 does not
become the new cliff edge. More work needs to be done to ensure that
duties are imposed on local authorities and others to provide for those
important transition years. Many young people with special educational
needs take time to develop. They do not abide by the usual milestones,
but go at their own pace and do things in their own time, which is why
the extension is so important. We do not want to see the good work that

my experience of working with such children, the care system is often
disjointed and baffling. Families routinely deal with more than 30
professionals from education, social care, health and other services.
It was standard for families to tell me how frustrated they were that
they had to say the same thing over and again to different
professionals because the information was not shared between
departments, let alone between other agencies. Communication between
agencies is generally inadequate, leaving families burdened with the
stress of having to navigate their way through an unco-ordinated
system. All that happens at a time when many families are overwhelmed

hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland) referred
to the cliff edge that some young people face as they move between
child and adult services. As that person moves into adulthood, support

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:33:43"></hs_TimeCode>Teenage years
can be difficult for any young person, but for those with special
educational needs they are that much harder. This Bill is an
opportunity to address the cliff edge that is a cause of concern for

the TreeHouse school in Muswell Hill, where young people with autism
between the ages of four and 19 receive specialist education,

of its considerable experience, Ambitious about Autism understands the
challenges of supporting young people through that difficult
transition. It has a pragmatic and realistic approach to the likelihood
of dropping out and seeking to restart education. It is easy to
understand that young people with autism will take time out of
education—they do so for a range of reasons, including health
issues, exclusion from college, or self-exclusion owing to a lack of
appropriate support. Equally, young people with autism might commence
an apprenticeship or work placement but find it unsuitable and seek to
return to
college.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000086">Ambitious
about Autism is concerned that the Bill means that those young people
could lose their package of support and struggle to be assisted back
into education. I regard such assistance as an absolute imperative. All
hon. Members know that young people often find it difficult to settle
on one path. It is essential that those with special educational needs
are given the safety net of being able to find their way back into
education, and that they have the appropriate support to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000087">The
Government suggest that regulations could make provision to support
such young people. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to ensure that
they are explicit on the need to protect education, health and care
plans for young people. I also urge him to review support for
young people with special educational needs between the ages of 19 and
25, should they fall out of education, employment or training for any
reason. We should have a view to supporting them back into education
when that best meets their
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000088">Ambitious
about Autism’s “Finished at School” campaign found
that just one in four young people with autism access education beyond
school. For some, that will be through choice, but others would stay in
education if only they could access courses and colleges that are
capable of providing appropriate support. I welcome the steps the
Government have taken to improve the 16-to-25 elements of the Bill, but
we need a clearer definition of post-16 education and training
institutions. Regulations setting out the definition should be
published before Committee and ensure that young people have the
broadest possible options for further
education.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_25_PT_1/3021C235178F984114560823259EF8245DB5F817" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 February 2013">Monday

children’s centre rather than a registry office. That would
destigmatise children’s centres, which would be an instant

I would like the Government to adopt my ten-minute rule Bill, which
deals with children born on to the child protection list. When there is
no plan to take the baby away, the mother would be allocated talking
therapies when she became pregnant. In that way, she can improve her
maternal attunement towards the baby. The sting in the tail is that, if
the baby reaches six months and there is no improvement in the
mother’s ability to parent, a decision should be taken at a case
review to take the baby away. There is a pitifully short window of
opportunity for the baby. If the Bill is all about the children, we
should seriously consider more radical solutions to ensure that we are
not wasting their valuable
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000093">Finally,

the needs of children in the wider care system are not neglected. We

children in fostering for adoption arrangements before the court has
made a decision. Those are crucial decisions for children, yet nearly
eight in 10 social workers say that they are overburdened. The

we welcome some of the measures in the Bill that help the people who
matter most to children—the key adults in their
lives—through the shared parental leave provisions and the post
adoption support provisions, we have concerns about the capacity of an
overstretched, hard-working children’s work force to meet those
rising needs. We will therefore seek to improve the Bill in Committee,
so that the system gives more support to families—not just to
parents who have children with special educational needs, but to
siblings and others who play an active role in helping a child at home.
We want to be sure that the pathfinder schemes for personal budgets
provide concrete proof that they will result in better outcomes for
children before they are rolled out. That is our key test for the Bill:
does it improve the situation of the children whom it seeks to
help?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000105">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:46:56"></hs_TimeCode>
are concerned that too often the Government are not child-focused; that
too often they see children through the eyes of adults, not adults and
adult systems through the eyes of children. It is why we are concerned
by measures—for example, the time limits on court proceedings,
as we heard from the Chair of the Justice Committee—that seek to
prescribe the solution for individual children. We have heard a great
deal about them in the course of the debate. It is important to retain
individual flexibility for individual children, and we will seek to
press the Government on that point in Committee.</hs_Para>

heard concerns from all parts of the House about attempts to define
children’s best interests in law. We heard a welcome assurance
from the Minister that that is not about seeking to define
parents’ rights against children’s rights, but our
concerns remain. We share the concerns of the Children’s
Commissioner, and many of the organisations working with children, that
this sends a dangerous signal that the paramountcy of children’s
welfare is being diluted. While we agree strongly with the Government
that parental involvement is in the best interests of children, so too
are other relationships with grandparents, siblings, step-parents and
friends. That is what children say matters to them, and we believe that
they ought to be listened to and treated as individuals when decisions
that affect them are made.</hs_Para>

will seek to give children a long overdue voice and ensure that the
Bill reflects their priorities, not the Government’s, and the
stark reality of the situation they face. While we will support
strongly the Minister’s efforts where they improve the lives of
some children, today we are laying down a challenge to the Government:
work with us to improve the lives of more children. At present, many
children are silent and invisible in the Bill, and do not have the
childhoods that they, or we, 
<?notus-xml column=130?>would wish or expect. We lay down a challenge
to Ministers to work with us during the passage of the Bill
to do better by
them.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_25_PT_1/B300BE089540F418A1B1530C0048706E34D257B3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 February 2013">Monday

Under-Secretary of State for Education, my hon. Friend the Member for
Crewe and Nantwich (Mr Timpson), to be introducing legislation on
issues about which I am so passionate. It is a pleasure to have heard
all the contributions by hon. Members from across the House, and I

diverse, but they are united by the guiding principle of bringing about
real, radical and positive change for children and families.</hs_Para>

Members in Committee, including
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:49:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom), who was so
concise in her remarks. Clearly, the House contains a lot of expertise
on these issues and we will have interesting discussions in

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:50:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

start this reform process, which has of course been continued by
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:50:29"></hs_TimeCode>the
Under-Secretary of State for Education. I also thank all those who got
involved in pre-legislative scrutiny, particularly the Education
Committee, as that process was a good example of how the House can
improve legislation before it becomes a full Bill. I welcome the broad
consensus on many of our SEN measures, particularly the support for a
statutory framework that works for children and young people from birth
to 25. We, of course, look forward to further discussions in Committee,
but I wish to say that if any hon. Member was in any doubt about the
intention of the Bill, they should look at clause 19 for the key
founding principles on which the SEN provision will be based.</hs_Para>

the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart), made
specific mention of the local offer and the Under-Secretary’s
use of the term “common framework”. The regulations will
provide the common framework for local offers, setting out all the
things they should contain. That will bring consistency and will enable
provision in local areas to be compared, and I am sure that will be
welcomed. As my ministerial colleague has mentioned, we will be
providing indicative regulations for the Committee, so that we can have
a fuller discussion at that time.</hs_Para>

the Member for East Worthing 
<?notus-xml column=131?>and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), who eloquently put the
case that the needs and welfare of the child remain of paramount
importance. I know that some hon. Members expressed concern that the
paramountcy principle will be undermined, but I wish to reassure the
House that the relevant clause has been drafted with the express
intention of not diluting that principle, which is so important, as has
been said.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) raised the horrific example of
the experience of a young child victim of abuse giving evidence and the
traumatic way in which that took place. We take this issue very
seriously, and we will certainly bring that to the attention of
Ministry of Justice Ministers in order to raise the point she makes.
Such issues have been discussed recently;
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>

hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg) asked for
reassurances about the details of our plans for childminder agencies.
We will be setting out more detail, including some draft regulations,
in Committee. Introducing agencies is about increasing choice for
parents; no childminder will be forced to join an agency and parents
will vote with their feet, choosing the childminders or other child
care offering the best quality and value for money.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:53:45"></hs_TimeCode>Let me just set
out the context. In the past two decades the number of childminders has
almost halved. That is a real problem on the provision we need to
secure for parents. Agencies will help us to increase that provision,
which is much needed, and, especially, to give the greater flexibility
that many parents increasingly need for out-of-hours child care
provision, too.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) raised the
issue of the sufficiency duty, and I wish to clarify the position in
case there has been any misunderstanding. Our proposal is to repeal the
requirement for local authorities to conduct an assessment of the
sufficiency of child care in their area in very specific terms.
However, the duty to secure sufficient child care remains—it is
in section 6 of the Childcare Act 2006—and to meet that duty,
authorities will need to collect data on supply and demand. We are
repealing the bureaucratic requirement to create a specific document
and publish
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000116">The
issue of staff-child ratios in child care is not dealt with in the
Bill, but as it was raised by more than one Member today, let me say
that our focus is on quality rather than quantity. We are consulting on
the proposal, and in particular on what levels of qualification would
unlock higher ratios. I encourage the hon. Member for Hackney South and
Shoreditch, and any others who are particularly interested in the
subject, to contribute to the
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000117">While
welcoming the Government’s plans to extend the right to request
flexible working, the hon. Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell)
expressed concern about the move to guidance. Let me reassure her, and
other Members, that we want to make the process simpler and less
bureaucratic for employers and employees alike. I was rather horrified
when, having arrived in the Department and asked what the procedure
was, I was shown a flow chart featuring eight separate steps with
periods of 28 or 14 days elapsing between them, the total amounting to
84 days. Far too much bureaucracy 
<?notus-xml column=132?>was involved in what should be a straightforward and
simple set of discussions between employers and employees. We are
replacing that with two pages of common-sense, straightforward
guidance, so that everyone will know where they stand. I think that
that move should be
welcomed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000118">These
reforms are long overdue. They address systems that are old-fashioned
and out of step with the needs of children and the wishes of modern
parents. The needs of children will be put where they rightly belong,
at the heart of the services that support them. In the
Children’s Commissioner, children and young people will have a
strong and independent champion. Children for whom adoption is the
right option will be settled more quickly in a safe and loving home.
Unnecessary and damaging delays will be driven from the family court
system. The most radical reforms of the special educational needs
system in 30 years will raise aspirations and put children, young
people and their parents at the centre of decisions. Child care will be
more widely available and of better quality, helping parents to juggle
their work and family
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000119">Perhaps
because there has been general agreement on the subject, we have not
heard a great deal today about the shared parental leave plans, but
they constitute a radical reform. Mums and dads will have freedom to
choose how they share time off after having a baby or adopting. As
every parent knows, having children brings both joy and plenty of
challenges. Our changes will let families get on with sharing the care
responsibilities in whatever way works for them, replacing
rigid rules based on an outdated stereotype that assumes that men are
the breadwinners and the role of women is to stay at home and look
after
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000120">By
extending the right to request flexible working to all employees, we
will help families in the widest sense, while also removing some of the
workplace resentment about the different rights that exist for parents
and those without children. We will also help the economy to benefit
from a more flexible, committed and productive work force. Changing the
culture of United Kingdom workplaces to embrace flexibility is good for
employers and good for
workers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000121">At
the heart of the Bill are two simple changes. We are giving families
real choice and flexibility in relation to the decisions that affect
them, and we are ensuring that services focus consistently on the best
interests of the children who need them. This is a Bill that will make
real, long-lasting changes, and I commend it to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000122"><I>Question

the amendment tabled by

the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) was not selected for debate, it
would have prevented opposed private business from being taken if it
were reached after 4 pm. As I have just said, we do not expect business
on the Bill to conclude before 4 pm and the opposed private business is
likely to be reached after that. The amendment would therefore have
obstructed

Christopher Chope</B> (Christchurch) (Con):</Member> I hesitate to call
the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House
disingenuous, but that is probably the only proper description of what
he has just enunciated. Standing Order No. 20 provides that private
business should be given three hours between the hours of 4
o’clock and 7 o’clock. The Leader of the House has all
the rest of the parliamentary timetable to play with as he wishes, so
surely he should respect the right of people who put private business
before the House to do so with some certainty as to when that business
will begin and conclude. That is the whole purpose of Standing Order
No.

there was no Standing Order, we would be treating private and public
business in exactly the same way. As Members know, I take a keen
interest in private business, and I think it is important that we do
not tear up our Standing Orders on an ad hoc basis. It is almost
invariably the case that the Leader of the House tables a motion to try
to vary the convention under Standing Order No. 20 that private
business should be dealt with for a specified three-hour
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000150">If<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
I was speaking on behalf of the promoter of a private Bill, I should
wish to have certainty; it is unwhipped business, so to ensure that it
can proceed it is important that the Member in charge of the Bill can
tell colleagues to come along to the debate because at 7 o’clock
there may be a vote. Instead of that situation being crystal clear for
everybody, tonight’s proposal will mean that nobody will be
quite sure when business on the City of London (Various Powers) Bill

should not be treated with levity. The whole purpose of Standing Orders
is that we should maintain and stick to them. If, whenever we had
private business, the Standing Orders were invariably set aside, they
would be brought into disrepute. In the absence of a written
constitution, the Standing Orders are our ultimate defence of liberty.

undermine the Standing

us look at what would happen tomorrow if the business of the House

the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill. If discussion on that Bill had not

us remember that in the past the Government would not normally have
given half a day for Report and Third Reading of a major Bill; they
would have allocated a whole day. Indeed, that is what they did
originally in the programme motion that was carried by the House on 19
November last year, in which it was agreed that Report and Third
Reading of the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill would have a full day.
As the 
<?notus-xml column=138?>Government want to curtail debate on the Bill, they
have tabled a motion among the remaining orders to restrict the length
of Report and Third Reading, and they are compounding that felony by
saying that they wish to push private business to later on in the day,

business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022532000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#13022532000163">Anyone

Why are we having to debate this at 10 o’clock on a Monday

grass—relatively speaking—for consideration later in the
day. That is my proposition, and that is why I tabled the amendment,
which was not selected. That would have been a slightly academic
amendment, as reflected in the Speaker’s decision not to call

the House considers the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill and agrees the

as he rightly said, of whether there will be a Standing Order No. 24
motion, whether an urgent question will be sought and granted and
whether a statement will be made. Those matters will inevitably give
rise to a degree of uncertainty, so although my hon. Friend the Member

Irranca-Davies</B> (Ogmore) (Lab):</Member> Let me begin this debate by
posing what may seem a little like a pub quiz question. What do all the
following people have in common: Mick Mars, the guitarist for rock band
Mötley Crüe; Vladimir Kramnik, the Russian world chess
champion; Mike Atherton, the English cricket player; Jens Stoltenberg,
the Prime Minister of Norway—and, not forgetting, me? We all
have a condition called ankylosing spondylitis—athletes, chess
champions and rock gods and Members of Parliament: we can all get it,
along with around 200,000 other people from all walks of life across
the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302263000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#1302263000034">Ankylosing
spondylitis is not a condition we hear a lot about, yet the 200,000
people with this condition are roughly twice the number who have
Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis. Perhaps it is the
very name ankylosing spondylitis, which does not lend itself to easy
headlines or easy campaigning, although it may also be due to the
historical lack of awareness, including among GPs and clinicians, of
the condition. AS is often overlooked and misdiagnosed, but it is a
type of arthritis that can start when people are young—often
between 15 and 35 years of age. It is a type of chronic, long-term
arthritis that affects parts of the spine, including bones, muscles and
ligaments. The condition can be severe, with around one in 10 people at
risk of long-term disability. It is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed
late—typically 10 years late—and that was certainly the
case with
me.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302263000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#1302263000035">Let

usually starts in the late teens and early twenties and can cause
lifelong pain and stiffness. There is no cure for AS. It’s a
form of inflammatory arthritis mainly affecting the spine and hips,
which may fuse over time. Ankylosing means fusing together and
spondylitis means inflammation. It can also cause inflammation in other
areas of the body, including the heart, the bowel and the eyes. Unless
treated and managed effectively, AS will lead to great pain and can

gone. But during and after matches I would experience real stiffness
and soreness in the neck and the spine. I found it increasingly hard to

As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T22:31:34"></hs_TimeCode> the years

progressively the flexibility in my spine and my neck grew less and

my late twenties, the stiffness and the pain were periodically
debilitating, and affecting my sport and my general health. I had been
to see GPs over the years since my teens. I had been given strong
painkillers, sometimes steroids. I had been to see masseurs and
chiropractors who had stretched and crunched me, worked out the knots
in my neck, and applied various odious potions to me. I had resorted to
homeopathic medicines, including a vile concoction involving exotic
mushrooms from Russia, complete with a handbook on how to use it, and
various mail order medicines. Some of these were harmless but utterly
useless. Others were probably directly detrimental to my health and

Irranca-Davies:</Member></B> That is a very important point. People
often refer to it as a bad back, growing pains, and as an assortment of
other things, but that is a classic case of misdiagnosis. If somebody
has AS, it does not go away. It is long term and debilitating and
unless diagnosed, it will get worse and worse. The hon. Gentleman is
absolutely
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T22:33:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

of the development of the condition in me, no one had diagnosed it, so
I was trying anything and everything. Then, as luck had it, in
desperation I had an appointment with a different doctor
because my usual one was away. He suggested that I visit a
rheumatologist, and that is where I first heard of the condition called
ankylosing spondylitis. There started the beginning of a more coherent
diagnosis and a programme of treatment involving appropriate
physio- therapy and, when needed, oral steroids or, when the
problem was severe, steroid injections directly into joints. By this
stage, in addition to the fluctuating but regular stiffness and pain,
every few months I would have a major flare-up when my joints,
especially ankles, knees and hips, would swell like billy-o and scream
with pain. Yet—this is a common refrain from AS
sufferers—I would just carry on. Sufferers get our heads down
and carry on. We build a tolerance to pain and a dogged determination.
It is far from heroic; it is just pragmatic. We have bills to pay,
places to go and people to see. We just do not give up very

situation came to a head here in Parliament. The story I am about to
tell will be disbelieved by many, because it reveals—wait for
it—the compassion of the Whips Office. Back in 2003, I had been
struggling along and getting by, but this was the mother of all
flare-ups. I have the acute form of AS, which I sometimes feel
makes me fortunate, although I guess that others who have it may
disagree. Rather than enduring constant pain and discomfort, I could go
for months without problems, then—bang!—when it hits, it
hits

early-warning aches, throbs and fatigue started about a month before
the crunch. After hobbling slowly for a couple of weeks, I resorted to
using a stick, then two sticks, and then switched to crutches a few
days later. Progressively, I also looked like I felt—like I had
been through 10 rounds with Mike Tyson after a week without sleep.
Finally, for one particular vote it took me nearly 15 minutes to walk
from one end of the voting Lobby to the other, which is the length of
this Chamber. I was in so much pain. At that point, a friendly
Government Whip whispered to me, “Huw, get yourself
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T22:36:11"></hs_TimeCode>.”
Although that reveals the compassion of the Whips, the following
sentence was telling: “Get yourself better, ’cos we need
you back in two weeks for a crunch vote.” Still, I take
compassion wherever it comes from and whatever the

episode finally got me on to the treatment that has transformed the
quality of my life over the past decade and—touch
wood—has meant that I have not had a major flare-up in all that
time. I was fortunate to be referred, finally, to an AS specialist and
was put on to an innovative and then experimental treatment called
anti-TNF—anti-tumour necrosis factor—which is an
immunosuppressant that has helped control the condition. It is not
without the risk of side effects and I would prefer not to be on
medication for the rest of my life, but my quality of life has been
transformed. Anti-TNFs, which are now moving on to new generations that
can target specific types of AS, will not be right for everyone, but I

available, and investment in research must also be

we should increase the awareness and recognition of AS. AS has always

please can we use MRI, not X-rays, for early diagnosis? Clinicians now
agree that MRI scanning is a far better option because it can pick up

also have a range of things that we want from GPs. We want them to
consider AS as a possible diagnosis if patients have symptoms of back
pain and stiffness that are not improving. GPs should refer patients to
a rheumatologist as soon they suspect AS. MRI scans should be part of
that process. There should be access through GPs to specialists,
including rheumatologists, physiotherapists and specialist nurses.
There should be access to physiotherapy sessions, either as part of a
group or individually. Information should be provided in GP surgeries.
There should be access to expert surgical assessment and treatment for
people with severe spinal deformity who may wish to have surgery to
correct it. There should be regular follow-up appointments and ready
access to expert reassessment, including monitoring for bone health,
osteoporosis and cardiovascular risk. Finally and critically, there

He explained to me that he had ankylosing spondylitis, and I had never
heard of it before. He said that he had two cousins in the

that the NHS delivered. The programme was clearly well intended, and we
recognise that it achieved demonstrable improvements in a small number
of major conditions—coronary heart disease and cancer, for
example. However, that model of quality improvement would be totally
impracticable and unsustainable if we attempted to replicate it across
hundreds of less common conditions.</hs_Para>

recognise that 200,000 people have this condition—as the hon.
Gentleman said, that is more than have Parkinson’s and
MS—and such a move could overwhelm the capacity of NHS
management, not to say that of national bodies such as the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The entire NHS budget
could be tied up with rather inflexible packages of ring-fenced
funding. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T22:50:03"></hs_TimeCode>It
therefore seems that we need a general model of quality improvement

that time is tight, I will turn to the specific points raised by the
hon. Gentleman. I agree completely about the importance of raising
awareness of this condition among GPs, especially given the importance
and difficulty of early diagnosis. The hon. Gentleman mentioned his
long and winding road to finally getting a diagnosis after 10 years,
which, as he said, is the experience of many people. I salute the
valuable work done by the society’s “GP Awareness”
campaign, but we must also recognise that in their day-to-day work GPs
have to deal with and recognise a vast number of different conditions
and may meet a new case of ankylosing spondylitis only once every few
years. There is no easy answer to that dilemma although in future
computerised decision aids such as clinical knowledge summaries may
help to prompt GPs to recognise or at least suspect more serious but
rarer conditions such as
AS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T22:51:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302263000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#1302263000079">The
hon. Gentleman drew attention to the society’s recommendation
that MRI scans should be used in the diagnosis of early AS, rather than
waiting for damage to become apparent on a X-ray. I understand that a
consensus for that proposal is developing among clinicians, but
I am not sure whether there are any further actions that the Department
or Commissioning Board could usefully take at this stage to promote a 
<?notus-xml column=149?>greater uptake of such an approach. In a sense, word is spreading among
clinicians about the potential value of such a move.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman asked whether we should commission NICE to develop a
quality standard or clinical guidelines for ankylosing spondylitis, but
I am afraid I cannot offer a lot of comfort. As he may be aware, we
have recently published a list of all quality standards that we
currently expect NICE to develop, following extensive consultation with
professional and patient organisations. The list includes a number of
the more common musculoskeletal conditions but not AS. In future, the
NHS Commissioning Board will be responsible for requesting NICE to
develop additional standards. In the meantime, it is open to the
National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society to propose to NICE that the
quality standard for chronic pain should include a statement on the
need to consider other serious conditions for patients presenting with
chronic back pain. That might be a valuable thing to do.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman drew attention to the importance of support for
self-help in managing this condition, and he leads from the front in
that respect. As I have made clear, we are in complete agreement on
that point, and the model of care to which I have already
referred—which of course applies to other conditions and not
just AS —will strongly promote that
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T22:53:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302263000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/debtext/130225-0004.htm#1302263000082">Finally,

occurring across Europe and seeking the commitment from all member
states to not only put an end to it but to prevent it happening again.

recent nuclear test on 12 February. The package will implement UN
Security Council Resolution 2087, which imposed new criteria allowing
the EU to sanction individuals involved in the supply of conventional
arms and dual-use goods and banned the export to DPRK of certain
materials for ballistic missiles. In addition, a limited range of
financial restrictions were agreed in response to the nuclear test,
including bans on the sale or purchase of gold, diamonds, precious
metals and Government bonds. The EU reiterated its call on the
Government of DPRK to urgently improve the human rights situation in

migrants from around the world and those that make a valued
contribution to British society. Given the ongoing need to reduce

asylum claim. Where the United Kingdom is responsible for deciding a
case, LA testing may be carried out on an informed consent basis, and
presently, only if it is strongly suspected the applicant has provided
false information regarding their place of origin. A refusal to submit
to testing may be taken into account when determining whether an

work is at an early stage and no tenders have yet been issued. It is

Information on the exact number of couples who adopted a child is not
available. The Department collects information on the numbers of looked
after children who have been adopted by single people, civil partners,
married and unmarried (same sex and different sex) couples. Some
couples will adopt two or more children. The number of couples who
adopt will therefore be lower than the number of children
adopted.</hs_Para>

April 2011 the Department for Education introduced the Early
Intervention Grant (EIG). The grant is un-ringfenced and does not
contain any notional allocations for different policy areas. This gives
local authorities greater freedom and flexibility in how they spend
their funding, enabling them to make judgments based on local needs and
what works best. Subject to that local decision making, the EIG can
support a full range of services for children, young people and
families including Sure Start children's centres. Information on

the Secretary of State for Education, my right hon. Friend the Member
for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), has explained, the overall funding for
early intervention is increasing, from £2.2 billion in 2011-12
to £2.5 billion in 2014-15. The transfer of funding for early
education for two-year-olds from lower income households from the EIG
to the Dedicated Schools Grant reduced the size of the EIG from 2012-13
to 2013-14. However, this funding is still allocated to local
authorities. In 2013-14 the total EIG itself will be
£1,708,918,200, and in 2014-15 it will be

Laws:</Member></B> The Government is absolutely determined to close
attainment gaps between disadvantaged children and their peers. The
pupil premium is the means by which we provide schools with additional
support to raise the attainment of children from disadvantaged
backgrounds. Our investment will be £900 per pupil in 2013-14,
and will rise further to £2.5 billion overall in
2014-15.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022610000435" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0002.htm#13022610000435">The
allocation of the pupil premium to schools corresponds to numbers of
pupils who have been looked after in public care for more than six
months in the year, or known to have been eligible for free school
meals (FSM) at any time during the past six years (“Ever
6 FSM”). These are our best available objective
indicators of the disadvantage faced by individual children: the strong
correlation between FSM eligibility and under-achievement suggests that
using these criteria helps to channel funding to those pupils who need
it most. As we are able to identify these children from school and
local authority census returns, FSM eligibility is the best indicator
of disadvantage available. Notwithstanding these benefits, we recognise
that there remain some problems in using FSM to determine a school's
pupil premium budget. The first is that not all families claim their
entitlement to FSMs; we also know that some poor families are not
entitled to FSMs because they receive working tax credit. Our expansion
of pupil premium eligibility to include the Ever 6 FSM measure is
designed to help overcome both problems, and we are also reforming the
benefits system, through universal credit, in order to address the
second
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022610000436" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0002.htm#13022610000436">The

have made registration easier, by streamlining the application process

ECS allows local authorities to establish a family's free school meal 
<?notus-xml column=56?>eligibility quickly, by checking data held by the Department for Work
and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs and the Home Office. We are
encouraging local authorities to increase their use of this resource,
which, as well as reducing bureaucracy and cost at a local level,
encourages more parents to sign up their children for a free school
lunch. For those authorities that choose to use it, the ECS allows
parents to check their own eligibility and apply for FSM
online—all without the stigma of applying through school or
local authority administrative
staff.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022610000438" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0002.htm#13022610000438">In
November 2012, we further encouraged FSM take-up by drawing local
authorities' attention to the Government's research report,
‘Pupils not claiming free school meals’. The report
looked at take-up of FSM by different local authorities and found
registration ranges between 67% and 100%, with around 14% of the 1.4
million children aged four to 15 in England entitled to receive FSM but
not claiming them. This represents 21% of children nationally, around
200,000
pupils.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022610000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0002.htm#13022610000439">The
Government welcomes Ofsted's most recent report in February 2012 on the
pupil premium, its case studies showing how schools are using the
premium to close attainment gaps, and its accompanying analytical
toolkit. Sir Michael Wilshaw's analysis of the characteristic features
of good and poor practice is extremely important, and should be studied
carefully by all school leaders. One of his observations is that
effective schools “carefully ring-fenced their funding so that
they always spent it on the target group of pupils”. Where
schools do this, it will enable them to provide better outcomes for
their disadvantaged pupils, and help schools in responding to
constructive dialogue on closing attainment gaps with their
inspectors.</hs_Para>

it aims to ensure that all pupils play a range of competitive sports.
Examples given in the draft programme of study of traditional sports
that schools can teach include football, cricket, hockey, netball and
rugby.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022610000556" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0003.htm#13022610000556">In

As students' places for this autumn are generally not confirmed at this

Government is committed to finding ways to ensure that young people
have the opportunity to engage with science subjects, and pursue
science and engineering careers, especially among under-represented
groups; such as girls and those living in disadvantaged areas. The key
to encouraging more young people to take up such careers is to ensure
that they are inspired by, and achieve well in, science and technology
at school. To encourage this, the Government is investing up to
£135 million over the current spending review period
to support schools to improve the quality and provision of science
teaching. This includes: high quality professional development
opportunities; subject knowledge enhancement courses for pre-Initial
Teacher Training graduates and teachers without a specialist science
qualification; and support for schools to improve participation in GCSE
triple science and A level physics. Science GCSEs are also included in
the English Baccalaureate (EBacc). This is promoting and increasing the
number of pupils with science GCSEs, and in turn there is an increase
in pupils who progress to take science and physics at A level. For
young people wishing to pursue a career in engineering, in November
2012 the Chancellor announced that the Government will be supporting
the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop a series of new Engineering
qualifications at KS4. These qualifications are for inclusion within
the ‘Wolf’ list of high value non-GCSE qualifications to
be taught from 2014 and reported in school performance tables from
2016. In addition, physics, which is a key foundation for science and
engineering study at university and for many science and engineering
careers, is being supported through the Stimulating Physics
Network.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13022610000054" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0003.htm#13022610000054">Young

the last 18 months, the Department has had considerable success in
reducing the cost of its estate through consolidation and targeted
building disposals. This has seen the Department surrender four
leasehold office properties through a combination of lease breaks and
lease expiries as well as an administrative transfer of a property to
another Government Department. This has generated net savings of
£6.5 million net per annum over that period. The Department has
also successfully sublet surplus space across their leasehold office
estate over the same period, reducing the overall property cost by
approximately £6.44 million via additional tenant income. At
Eland house in Victoria, we have sublet space to Ofwat, the Department
for Transport and the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency—as well as

Boles:</Member></B> Schedule 5 of the Town and Country Planning Act
1990 gives minerals planning authorities the power to impose planning
conditions on mineral operators to provide for site restoration and
aftercare with their application for minerals extraction (including
shale gas). This is to ensure clearance of equipment and for proper
restoration of the site once operations have ceased. For sites that are
to be returned to agriculture, forestry or amenity purposes, there is
an obligation on the mineral operator to look after the site for a
maximum period of five years once restoration has been completed.
Planned restoration for other uses may require a separate planning
permission.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022610000726" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0003.htm#13022610000726">The

ensuring strong protections for the Green Belt, Areas of Outstanding

authorities in terms of the risk of being liable for costs in a

December made clear that where a local authority refuses a planning
application on the grounds that it is contrary to development plan
policy, and no material considerations including national policy
indicate that planning permission should have been granted, there
should generally be no grounds for an award of costs against the
planning authority for unreasonable refusal of an

Harper:</Member></B> The Dublin System plays an important role in
establishing the member state responsible for determining an
application for asylum. The Government is committed to the Dublin
System, as it reinforces the principle that asylum should be claimed in
the first safe country and helps tackle the problem of people making
multiple claims in different EU member states. Since 2004, we have
removed over 10,000 asylum applicants under the Dublin System which has
resulted in significant financial savings and has also sent a powerful
message that the UK can and will act against those who try to abuse our
asylum
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022610001112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0003.htm#13022610001112">The
Government is broadly satisfied with the progress that the European
Asylum Support Office (EASO) has made since its creation in 2010. We
fully support the work EASO has carried out so far and believe it has
made a meaningful contribution to member states, such as Greece, that
are in need of practical cooperation and capacity building measures.
The Government is also pleased that EASO has taken on and further
developed a number of practical cooperation measures which have already
been undertaken in recent years, such as a common approach to
information on countries of origin and the establishment of the
European Asylum Curriculum.</hs_Para>

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.
Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the
offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the
courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to
ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are
taken into account when those data are

for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more

Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the

devices to purchase are also operational decisions for chief officers

drug screener for use in police stations in possible drug-driving cases
was type approved by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May) in December 2012.
Work is continuing towards introducing further devices for use in
police stations. To enable police officers to identify drivers
committing the proposed new drug-driving offence, manufacturers will be
invited to submit roadside drug testing devices for type approval. Once
the Government considers the Expert Panel’s report, due to be
published shortly, alongside all other factors, a detailed
specification and an invitation to submit devices to enter the
‘type approval process’ will be issued. It will then be
for manufacturers to submit a device that meets the requirements of the
specification. This will ensure that roadside devices cover the

of review and consideration for the release of files into the public

groupings 'under 10 years', '10-17 years', '18-20 years', '21 years and
over' and 'age unknown'. Latest available information therefore relates
to arrests for notifiable offences of persons aged between 10 and 17
years for the financial years 1999-2000 to 2010-11, and are shown in
Table A. Data for 2011-12 are scheduled to be published in the spring

is to reduce HMRC stationery and postage cost where agents have ceased
to act. It has become apparent that agents who have recently set up but
have not yet registered for online filing and are not

the annual cleanse. HMRC has now implemented changes to the routine

billion into HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to better tackle evasion,
criminal attacks, unpaid tax debt and avoidance, which will result in
additional compliance revenues of £9 billion per annum by the
end of 2014/15. The Government has a number of tools at its disposal
for tackling tax avoidance, including the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance
Schemes (DOTAS) regime. However, DOTAS is highly specific to the UK, as
it only concerns UK taxes, and requires a detailed knowledge of the
UK's tax system. It cannot, therefore, be applied to other countries.
Nevertheless, the Government has other policies in place to more
directly assist developing countries by, for instance, building their
capacity to establish and maintain effective tax systems of their
own.</hs_Para>

the UK's energy-intensive industries remain competitive. From this
year, the Government is implementing measures worth around £250
million over the spending review period to reduce the impact of policy
on the costs of electricity for the most electricity-intensive
industries. This includes an increase in the level of relief from the
climate change levy on electricity for Climate Change Agreement
participants from 65 to 90% and a compensation package to help offset
the cost of reducing carbon emissions. As set out in the Energy Bill,
energy intensive industries will also be exempted from the costs of
Contracts for Difference under Electricity Market Reform, subject to
consultation and state aid clearance.</hs_Para>

consumer price inflation statistics produced by ONS are specifically
not intended to measure what people often refer to as the “cost
of living”. In popular usage, what this means is ill defined.
Some use it to mean a measure of the cost of buying sufficient
quantities of various items to maintain some minimal standard of
living. However, defining this standard is very subjective. Also, if
the minimal acceptable standard rises over time, such an index would
rise more rapidly than our inflation
measures.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13022614000693" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0008.htm#13022614000693">Another
definition is an index restricted to basic essentials. However, it
would be difficult to reach a consensus on what constitutes
“basic essentials”. For example, items such as tobacco
could be excluded because tobacco may or may not be considered an
essential item. Also, many former luxuries such as telephones are how
usually considered
essential.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13022614000694" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0008.htm#13022614000694">The
economic definition of the cost of living is the answer to the question
“What is the <I>minimum</I> cost, at this month's prices, of
achieving the level of utility actually attained in the base
period?” Due to the stress on <I>minimum</I>, a cost of living
index will usually give a lower rate of inflation than our inflation
measures.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13022614000695" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0008.htm#13022614000695">Furthermore,
consumer price statistics do not measure inflation for the average
family. The statistics measure changes to the cost of a
“basket” of goods and services bought by households. The
content of the basket reflects household expenditure—the more
that is spent on an item, the greater importance it has on inflation.
The basket looks at total expenditure by households in aggregate rather
than expenditure for an ‘average’ family. For example,
the prices of gas, electricity and coal heating are included in the
basket, although it is unlikely that many households would use all
three.</hs_brev>

Population Survey (APS). Unfortunately, due to small sample sizes, the
requested estimates are not sufficiently reliable and therefore not
available at constituency level from this source. However, we can
produce the data you require at a regional level. Please follow this
