probation service are to be handed to the private sector. Yet again,
the Government are simply putting public money into deep private
pockets and bringing additional costs into the system. Given the
year-by-year decline in reoffending, why are they intent on unleashing

ideas from not just the private sector but the voluntary sector, so
that we can start to drive down those all-important reoffending rates.
The argument for opening up rehabilitation to other agencies, private

implementing their idea. However, I note that the hon. Gentleman was

the way home, while Mrs Burgess pushed Wilson in his pram, her
daughter, Meg, followed a few steps behind. With no warning, a
72-foot-long section of wall collapsed, spilling tonnes of rubble,
breeze-blocks and earth over the pavement and burying Meg. Mrs Burgess
screamed, pulled at the rubble with her hands and tried to pull Meg
out, but unfortunately Meg was declared dead 10 minutes after arriving
at Glan Clwyd hospital in nearby Bodelwyddan. Tragically, Meg was
crushed to death as a 5-feet 2-inch wall fell on top of her. The
72-foot-long wall was built of 9-inch breeze-blocks right next to the

tonnes of rubble piled up behind it.</hs_Para>

purpose. The wall had not been properly anchored into the ground, no
measures had been taken to protect pedestrians walking along the
pavement, and it collapsed just moments after it had been backfilled.
The builder, George Collier, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross
negligence at Mold Crown court in October and was given a two-year jail
sentence. Officially, justice has been done, but Meg should never have
been killed in the first place, because the wall should have been built

more needs to be done. As things stand, retaining and load-bearing
walls are not covered by building regulations. There are centrally
available guidelines about how a retaining wall should be built, but
sadly they are not always adhered to. A Department for Communities and
Local Government consultation document published in January 2012
revealed that more than 50% of small builders surveyed did not follow
any form of official guidance for building walls.</hs_Para>

fact is, Mr Speaker, that you and I could go out this afternoon, watch
a video on YouTube, erect a 5-foot wall and pile up tonnes of rubble
behind it, and there would be no obligation on us to seek official
guidance or consult experienced structural engineers and building
control would not need to inspect our work. In Meg’s case,
despite the builder’s 30 years of experience in the
groundworking trade, he chose to cut corners and build a wall without
the structural integrity required to retain the weight he planned to
pile against it. Had the builder followed the guidelines, Meg would
still be alive
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T12:39:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0001.htm#13020551000221">That
is the crux of the issue. Although the builder clearly did not follow
construction guidelines, at no point did anyone check whether he had
done so. Had retaining walls been included in building regulations, the
property owner would have had to submit plans for the wall to the local
authority for approval and to indicate its purpose as a retaining wall,
the design would have had to incorporate the additional strengthening
measures required for it to carry weight and the work would have had to
be inspected before any earth was piled against it. Any building
inspector would have instantly seen that the proposals for the wall
were not up to scratch and that it would be unlikely to support its own
weight, let alone the weight of rubble and earth piled up behind it.
Any building inspector would have been able to see that the wall was
not strong enough. No earth would have been piled up behind the wall,
and Meg would still be alive today. Instead, Mr Collier 
<?notus-xml column=124?>thought he could get away with saving a few hundred pounds on materials,
and a few hours of labour. As a result, a young child is

motion would enable a Bill to come before the House to bring retaining
and load-bearing walls within building regulations. This is a simple,
straightforward proposal for which other countries across the world
have seen fit to legislate. In Australia, for example, any retaining
wall over 1 metre in height requires development approval. They have
also been legislated for in a number of US states, for instance in
Colorado, where any retaining wall over 3 feet high requires a site
plan to be submitted and a permit to be obtained from county planning
departments. In the Republic of Ireland, planning permission is
required for retaining walls over a certain height, depending on the

Catholics, Baptists, atheists and many others were allowed to marry

today that this Bill is not in any way trying to treat the Church of

the Churches will be exactly the same as for other religious
institutions. The difference, of which I am sure she will be aware, is
that the Church of England and the Church in Wales have different
duties under common law to marry people in their parishes. The canon
law of the established Church of England is part of the law of the
land, so we need different measures in place to recognise those
differences. I absolutely assure her that if either of those

of same-sex marriage. The second is that the Court would need to decide
that the interests of a same-sex couple who wanted a particular
religious organisation to marry them outweighed the rights and beliefs
of an entire faith and its congregation as a whole. The third is that
the Court would need to discount the importance of article 9 of its own
convention, which guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and

also need to understand the wider consequences of the Bill. The
introduction of equal marriage will not marginalise those who believe
that marriage should be between a man and a woman—that is
clearly a mainstream view—but neither will it continue to
marginalise those who believe that marriage can, and should, also be
between a man and a man or a woman and a woman. We will not allow one
belief to exist at the expense of the other. No misguided sense of
political correctness will be allowed to impinge on that. It would be

Gentleman is right to bring that out in more detail. He will, of
course, have read the Education Secretary’s words on this, which
were reported widely over the weekend. The point to make clearly to the
House is that teachers would, of course, be expected to
explain—and as professionals, they would—the law on
marriage, but what we never would expect a teacher  
<?notus-xml column=133?>to do is promote something that ran contrary to

make, and perhaps it clears up some of the misunderstandings in some of

very strongly not just into the Bill, but into our traditions and our
long-term political history. It is something that we have always valued

further safeguards in article 9 of the European convention. I agree
with the Minister for Women and Equalities that it is inconceivable
that the European Court would tell a Church or faith group to hold
same-sex weddings. Despite the fact that many countries across Europe,
including Spain, Portugal and Belgium, already have same-sex marriages,
there have been no successful challenges in the European courts, and
the Minister is right that the European Court allows a wide margin of
appreciation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000371" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000371">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T13:33:40"></hs_TimeCode>

thousands of years—been between a man and a woman and should
remain so. For some people, that is their faith, and under the Bill
their faith can be respected, but that is no reason not to change the
law. It is hardly surprising that for thousands of years same-sex
couples were not allowed to marry—they were not even allowed to
exist. Same sex was illegal, never mind same-sex marriage. Legal sex by
definition was between a man and a woman—that, too, was the case

cannot hide discrimination simply by calling it a definition. Marriage
has changed many times over the centuries—and thank goodness for

marriage, handed from their fathers to their husbands and denied rights
of their own. Until the 1990s, women’s bodies were effectively
treated as their husbands’ property. If a husband raped his
wife, it was not even treated as a crime. Civil marriage was introduced
over 170 years ago and was pretty radical at the time, but now, every
year, 160,000 of us get married in a civil ceremony.

people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe that marriage is
by definition about the procreation of children. However, that is not

Many marriages are childless, and we do not prevent people who are too
old or too sick to have children from getting married. We do not do
fertility tests at the altar. Yes, in vast numbers of families,
marriage is an important starting point for a loving family bringing up
children, but gay couples bring up children too. As people live longer,
the family commitments involved in marriage are much wider than
bringing up
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T13:36:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000376" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000376">Most
MPs will know the sadness but also the inspiration they have drawn from
visiting a long-married couple where, for example, the wife is
struggling to cope, struggling to remember the world around her and
struggling to recognise even the husband with whom she has shared
decades of her life, yet he carries on: cooking for her, washing her,
getting her up, putting her to bed, talking to her even as she becomes
a stranger in front of him. That is marriage.

visited a gay man, who died some years ago after a long illness during

2004. Denmark, Belgium, Canada, Norway, Portugal, Argentina and South

the same-sex couples who have told me of their love for each other are

marriage is to stay relevant, to stay important and to remain a crucial
part of our family and social relationships, it also has to remain in
tune with the values of every generation, and that means that it should

We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T13:40:20"></hs_TimeCode> have
discriminated for too long. Until the 1960s people were locked up or
punished for loving someone of the same sex. Gay men were told by the
Home Secretary even in the 1950s that they were a
“plague” on this country. Lesbian women were forced to
hide their relationships, and teenagers were bullied at school, with no
protection. Until the early 1990s teachers were unable to tell the

centuries, civilisations have recognised the value and importance to
society of having an enduring and exclusive union between one man and
one woman, not least for the raising and nurturing of children. That
relationship is called marriage. The uniqueness of marriage is that it
embodies the distinctiveness of men and women, so removing that
complementarity from the definition of marriage is to lose any social
institution where sexual difference is explicitly
acknowledged.</hs_Para>

Government clearly well appreciate the value of marriage. Indeed, one
of the points about the legislation before the House today is that the
Bill makes no provision for heterosexual couples to enter into civil
partnerships. Clearly, policy makers considered that allowing
heterosexual couples to enter into civil partnerships would undermine
the institution of marriage. So what this legislation will do is to end
the concept of marriage as it has been understood by society in general
and by almost all faith groups in particular for recorded
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T13:45:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000403" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000403">Each
of us will have to decide how we vote on this matter, according to our
consciences and on a free vote. I shall vote against the Bill. From the
outset, Ministers have made it clear that they intend that the
legislation will give protection and ensure that Churches that do not
wish to perform same-sex marriages are not forced to do so. That is
consistent with the legislation relating to civil partnerships, where
it is for faith groups as a whole to decide to opt into the legislation
to allow civil partnerships to be registered on their

may be helpful to the House if I, in my capacity as Second Church
Estates Commissioner, make clear to the House the views of the Church

accept the Government’s good faith in this matter and am
appreciative, as is the Bishop of Leicester, who convenes the Bishops
in the other place, and as are senior Church officials, of the attempts
the Government have made. The Government rightly wish to ensure that
every Church and denomination can reach its own conclusion on these

so-called quadruple locks are sensible and necessary. It was
unfortunate a couple of months ago when the Government were talking in
terms of “banning” the Church of England and the Church
in Wales from doing anything, because that was a completely misleading
account, and I am pleased to see that nothing of that kind now features
in the Bill or in the Minister’s explanation. The simple point
is that the Church of England and the 
<?notus-xml column=144?>Church in Wales have not wanted anything different in substance from all
other Churches and faiths—namely, to be left entirely free to
determine their own doctrine and practice in relation to
marriage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T13:47:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000406" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000406">Achieving
that is slightly more complex in relation to the Church in Wales
because, at disestablishment, it retained the common law duty to marry
all parishioners. It is even more complicated in relation to the Church
of England because as well as the common law duty, its canon law
remains part of the law of the land and it also has its own devolved
legislature which, with Parliament’s agreement, can amend Church
legislation and Westminster legislation. So I am grateful to the

I leave the question of the locks, let me be clear that we think that
the Government have done their best in these, given their intention to
introduce same-sex marriage. But, as many other commentators have made
clear, there is an inevitable degree of risk in all this, given that it
would ultimately be for the courts, and in particular the Strasbourg
court, to decide whether provisions in the legislation are compatible
with the European convention on human rights. There is absolutely no
doubt that once marriage is redefined in this very fundamental way, a
number of new legal questions will arise and no one can be sure what
the eventual outcome will be. The Government believe that this is a
risk worth taking. The Church of England does not. As I understand it,
the Roman Catholic Church does not, and nor do a number of other faith
groups, including the Muslim
faith.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000411">The
Bill has raised a number of extremely difficult second-order issues.
Although the failure to consummate a marriage will still be a ground on
which a heterosexual marriage can be voidable, the Bill provides that
consummation is not to be a ground on which a marriage of a same-sex
couple will be voidable. It also provides that adultery is to have its
existing definition—namely, sexual intercourse with a person of
the opposite sex. It therefore follows that divorce law for
heterosexual couples will be fundamentally different from divorce law
for same-sex couples, because for heterosexual couples the matrimonial
offence of adultery will persist while there will be no similar
matrimonial offence in relation to same-sex marriage. The fact that
officials have been unable to apply these long-standing concepts to
same-sex marriage is a further demonstration of just how problematic is
the concept of same-sex marriage.

marriage into the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 to provide equality. The
gay lobby have said themselves in their campaigning that they have been
looking for a Bill that will give them the same rights as heterosexual
couples and enable them to enjoy faithful and committed relationships.
This Bill in no way makes a requirement of faithfulness from same-sex
couples; in fact, it does the opposite. In a heterosexual
marriage, a couple can divorce on the grounds of adultery, and the
legal requirement for adultery to have taken place is that someone has
had sex with a member of the opposite sex.</hs_Para>

“I will forsake all others because to you I will be faithful in
honour of our vows and my faithfulness to us and our marriage.”
A gay couple have no obligation to make that vow. They do not have to

cannot meet this requirement. The Government have tucked this aspect
right at the back of the Bill, possibly because they do not want it to
be debated in Committee. That is sad, because it is part of the
inequality. If I were part of a gay couple, I would feel like a poor

that homosexuality had been legalised— thinking that he would be
appalled—the response was that he did not mind it being
legalised so long as it was not made compulsory. I think that many

the first time in history, a Government have proposed a Bill that will
change the very nature of marriage in law. Until now, society and the
Church have had a shared view of the essential purpose of marriage. It
is primarily an institution that supports the bearing and raising of
children in a committed and constant relationship. The traditional
understanding of marriage has three basic elements: it is between a man

a Bill to be driven by the word “equality” and to then
promote inequality seems to demonstrate a spectacular failure. An
example of that is the fact that a civil partnership is available only
to same-sex couples. This is not a Bill that has equality at its heart.
In honesty, it is a Bill that dilutes the meaning of
marriage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000458" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000458">Holding
a traditional view of marriage should not be seen as discriminatory.
Unfortunately, the Bill has promoted that notion. It has not created
tolerance, but has highlighted division. The Government cannot
guarantee protection for Churches or individuals with a traditional
view because they cannot predict or control what happens in the courts.
What has happened to Catholic adoption agencies is a good example of
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000459" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000459">Moreover,
the Bill no longer promotes exclusiveness. It does not consider
adultery to be a violation of commitment and so it undermines the
nature of marriage and the way in which marriage promotes predictable,
long-term family environments for children. That is a worrying move for
a Government to make. Are the supporters of the Bill really saying that
marriage is good for society, while at the same time reducing the
substance and value of marriage?</hs_Para>

how that linked to gay couples enjoying the same rights as heterosexual

different point of view, but as bigots and homophobes. I am neither a
bigot nor a homophobe. I have strong views about this and they are
traditional views, but why does that suddenly make me completely beyond

we were not forcing people into same-sex relationships. He and I
discussed the idea of equality for a while. “Equality for

importance of not being zealots and bigots ourselves, but understanding
the other point of view. We are, I hope, going to make a change that
will make it legal for two men or two women to be married. Just as when
we outlawed incitement to racial hatred we started a cultural shift in

do the same. But we want to take people with us, not leave them behind

group turns towards it. Gay couples are now asking to be admitted. Here
we have a section of society who are saying that they want to declare
commitment and that they value stability, in the sight of the public
and perhaps of God. We defenders of marriage should be gratefully

is said that gay people should accept civil partnerships—and no
more—which confer most of the legal rights of a marriage.
Thousands of people such as me have cause to be grateful for the
courage of hon. Members who voted for that change. Entering a civil
partnership was the most important thing I have done in my life. At
that time, civil partnerships were opposed by the Churches, a
significant proportion of the public and many hon. Members. Just eight
years later, only a small minority of the public oppose civil
partnerships and many hon. Members who voted against the change now say
they support it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T14:23:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
People choose marriage for a reason: they know that it means something
special. Indeed, it is because marriage is different that many are
opposing the change, so we cannot say that civil partnerships are the
same or dismiss the debate as being about a name. How many married
couples would like to be told that they were barred from matrimony and
able only to take out a civil partnership?</hs_Para>

Church of England and the Catholic Church object to gay marriage. I
disagree with them, but their religious freedom is surely among the
greatest prizes in our democracy. I would not vote for this Bill unless
I believed that it protected religious freedom. No faith group should
be compelled by law to conduct a gay marriage against its will, and
none will be, but religious freedom cuts both ways. Why should the law
prevent liberal Jews, Quakers or Unitarian Churches from conducting gay
marriages, as they wish to? With the proper safeguards for faith groups
and individuals to exercise their consciences and to disagree, I do not
believe that there are sufficient grounds to oppose a measure that
allows gay marriages for others. No one has to enter a gay marriage. No
one’s Church has to conduct a gay marriage. We simply have to
agree that someone else can enter a gay marriage.</hs_Para>

there are many Anglicans and Roman Catholics who wish that their
Churches were as open and welcoming as those that support the Bill
entirely. In fact, all the opinion polls show that a majority not just
of the public, but of Anglicans and Roman Catholics in this country
support equal marriage. However, in their wisdom, the leaderships of
the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church are not yet
prepared to take such a step. That is their prerogative. It is
perfectly possible to make the argument that, as a particular religion
understands it, marriage can only be between a man and a woman. However
the Churches’ credibility in arguing that would be a lot greater
if they welcomed and celebrated civil partnerships. The fact that they
do not do so leads me to conclude only that their objection to the Bill
is not about the institution of marriage or even the word, but about a
residual prejudice against same-sex
relationships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000490" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000490">The

marriage has procreating potential in that marriage brings together
biologically the two elements needed to generate a child. The very
reason that marriage is underpinned with laws and customs is that
children often result from it. They need protecting from the tendency
of adults to want to break their ties and cast off their
responsibilities. Marriage exists to keep the parents exclusively
committed to each other, because, on average, that is the best and most
stable environment for children. If marriage were solely about the

letters from constituents about the Bill. One I received came from a
couple who first met in 1978 and have been in a loving and committed
relationship ever since. They are accepted, welcomed and supported as a
couple by their friends and family, and they have waited 35 years for
the House finally to catch up with what they and their friends already
knew: that their same-sex relationship is every bit as valid, important
and equal as their straight friends’
relationships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000533" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000533">Over
the period of that couple’s relationship, there have been huge
changes in how society at large views them and other same-sex couples.
I marched in protest 25 years ago when the House passed section
28—legislation that offensively characterised same-sex
relationships as “pretend”. The fact that we have a quite
different Bill before us today is testament to the power of politics to
change minds and build a better

to LGBT people who have suffered hatred and discrimination in their
lives because of who they were born, and to the same-sex couples and

extending it to more people. To those who do not like gay marriage, I
say, “Don’t marry someone gay, but please don’t

couples.”</hs_Para>

great detail has said to me about the Bill, “Oh, it’s
about weddings in churches for gay people, isn’t it?”

of those individuals who have treated me with courtesy and respect such
that I can, in conscience, support the Bill this evening without fear

gay weddings in church. We are not. I am satisfied by the advice of the
Attorney-General that that is an infinitesimal possibility. We have
heard about how nobody can legislate against a challenge in the courts,

quadruple lock the Minister referred to makes worrying reading. There
is no protection for public sector chaplains in the armed forces; NHS
and university staff will be denied, for fear of losing their jobs, the
freedom to express the opinion that marriage is between one man and one
woman. Some 40,000 teachers have expressed the valid fear, backed up by
legal opinion, that they will not be able to opt out of endorsing
same-sex marriage and allow someone else to teach that aspect of the
curriculum. There is something horribly wrong about a teacher losing
their job for seeking to bow out gracefully of teaching that section by
allowing someone else to step in.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:01:20"></hs_TimeCode>It is also wrong
that parents have no protection enabling them to remove their children
from classes in which they will be taught something that is expressly

about council registrars who feel unable to follow the new definition

the quadruple lock will ensure that Europe cannot change things. She

but I will give only one, because time is against me: Islington council
sacked registrar Lillian Ladele for requesting an accommodation of her
conscientious objection to same-sex civil partnership, and the European
Court confirmed that a public authority could force employees to act
against their beliefs on marriage and sack any who resist. That
demonstrates

it. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>I imagine
that a majority will vote to give the Bill a Second Reading, but we
must disabuse people of the notion that it will place a prohibition on
how people may speak and preach about these things and on what happens
in schools. I am sure, however, that the Joint Committee on Human
Rights, of which I am a member, will address that issue intensely and
will be able to give guarantees to people who fear that the Bill will

hope that we will address two other things. I supported civil
partnerships. I think the Church was wrong to oppose them at the time,
and I hope that it and other faith groups now understand that they
would do themselves a service if they allowed services of blessing for
people in civil partnerships. It would not be good, however, to provide
for an easy transfer from civil partnership to civil marriage, which is
what the Bill proposes. If we are to have civil marriage, there ought
to be an obligation on everybody to have the ceremony of civil
marriage, so that the full import is understood. I also do not
understood why the Government are not making civil partnerships
available for conventional male-female relationships as well as for gay
people.</hs_Para>

exact parallels between the battle over slavery and this, but there is
a lesson: people then took different sides of an intense argument, even
though they came from the same faith or other backgrounds, but things
move on and we have to learn that understanding each

definition of marriage has been changed by the state over time, so it

changed over the years to keep up with public attitudes, from the
beginning of real state involvement in marriage in the 1750s to the
introduction of non-religious civil marriages in the 1830s, and from
allowing married women to own property in the 1880s to outlawing rape

marry in their affirmed gender. On the other hand, religious marriage
will continue to be a matter for religious organisations, not the
state, to define—or redefine, for that matter. So this is about
not redefining marriage, but extending it to a category of people who
are already, de facto, eligible to enter into marriage as a result of
the introduction and broad acceptance of civil partnerships. Surveys
have shown that 80% of adults under the age of 50 in the UK now support

Bill that keeps the traditional meaning of marriage for some sections
of society, saying that marriage is between a man and a woman for the
procreation of children, then gives others in society a different
meaning of marriage, saying that marriage of same-sex couples is
lawful, is not equal. The Bill also does not change the meaning of
adultery: if a person in a same-sex marriage has an affair with someone
from the opposite sex, that is deemed as adultery; but if they have an
affair with someone of the same sex, it is not classed as adultery and

is clearly both a foundational and a progressive institution; it is
both traditional and radical. It secures well-being and manifest

and for women. However, traditional marriage is under threat, and has
been for many years. The steady erosion of marriage over the last few
decades is a grave social and economic ill. Why, then, does the state
want to undermine it even further? With about 50% of children in our
society being born out of wedlock, the state should be looking at ways
to strengthen the institution of marriage for the sake of children,
rather than eroding the true purpose of marriage even further. There is
a plethora of evidence to suggest that the best platform to address
poverty, acceptance, socialisation and a place in society for children
is parental sacrifice and the love of the children of their
union—the traditional family unit, sealed by traditional
marriage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:16:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

from this Bill, which, as it currently stands, is incredibly divisive,
rather than inclusive. The Government should take a serious look at
opening up civil partnerships to heterosexual couples and simply change
the name to something like “state marriage”. In that way,
those who want marriage so that they can be called married, get their
way and those who want to maintain traditional marriage for its true
intended purpose can keep it. In that way, those who do not want a
traditional option of marriage can have marriage under a civil
partnership, or state marriage, where they currently cannot and those
who believe the Churches should decide on who they want to marry can
allow them to do so. Let the Churches decide, not the state, and let
them do so without fearing

I was a first-time candidate in the mid-1990s, I confess that I was
concerned about plans at that time for lesbians and gay couples to be
able to adopt. That was not because I believed that their parenting
would be in any way inferior to that of straight couples—I did
not, and do not, believe that. It was because I feared that the social
climate at that time might have meant that many of the children would
be subjected to serious bullying. Happily, today we live in a very
different world. Some eight years have passed since the introduction of
civil partnerships, and about two years have passed since the bar on
religious ceremonies was removed. I believe it is time that we in this
House have the courage to vote for equal

me explain my main reason for wanting to speak in this debate. As a
straight woman of the Christian faith, I cannot believe it is right
that I could be married in a church—and also that people of no
faith whatever could be married in a church—yet believers who
are lesbian and gay are shunned by the civil laws of the land on this
issue, and even denominations that freely wish to marry them are barred
from performing one of the most fundamental sacramental and pastoral
duties. Do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:24:13"></hs_TimeCode>
Members honestly believe that we should say to a Quaker couple whose
meeting house wishes to perform a religious ceremony that they should
be unable to have that, or that we should say the same to reformed or
liberal Jews or to Unitarians? What about the United Reformed Church,
which brought in religious ceremonies for civil partnerships last year?
That Church was created from non-conformist traditions whose adherents
were once barred from standing for office in this place and barred from
our universities, and whose burial rites were not permitted in our
parish churchyards. Do Members seriously believe that, in
the 21st century, we should be denying religious freedom to those faith

offers an opt-in. As we have heard, Catholic Spain has had equal

partnerships, and if there are weaknesses in those arrangements, they
should be put right. In particular, I see no problem with same-sex
unions being celebrated in places of worship where congregations want
to do so. A same-sex couple can have the same wish to affirm and to
have affirmed a lifelong exclusive commitment as a man and a woman
getting married, and we should value that and be willing to recognise
and celebrate it. This Bill, however, affirms not that same-sex unions
are equal with marriages, but rather that they are the same as
marriages, when in reality they are not: they are different. I think we
will be poorer if we adopt a watered-down definition of marriage based
on two aims from the Church of England’s list instead of all

Reynolds</B> (Stalybridge and Hyde) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> Having
listened carefully to the representations I have received
from constituents on both sides of the debate, I will vote for equal
marriage today. I will do so because I am a Christian, not in spite of
it. I believe marriage is important, and I believe it should be taken
seriously—certainly more seriously than how it is
presented in modern celebrity culture. I also think there
are things that undermine marriage and strong
relationships—the lack of family-friendly
working hours and prohibitive child care costs are among
them—but I genuinely cannot see how my support for
equal marriage undermines my own marriage, the marriage of anyone else,
or marriage as an institution. If anything, I believe it
strengthens it.</hs_Para>

that this is a difficult debate for some people. I understand that some
Members have a different view from me, but I do not believe a case has
been made to explain why the honour and privileges of marriage should
not be extended to all. Some of the e-mails I
have received have asked, “What protection will be offered to
people who disagree?”, but this is a permissive law. It gives
the right to conduct same-sex marriages only to organisations that wish
to do so. I am genuinely not aware of anything from which
people will need to be
protected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000620" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000620">Another
of my concerns relates to the role of teachers in Catholic schools in
the event of this redefinition. I believe that the Education Secretary
has provided adequate reassurance in that regard, but I hope we can all
agree that what schools should be doing is working to tackle
homophobia, and that that should be the starting point for the
discussion of these issues in schools.</hs_Para>

have raised the prospect of “polymarriage” between three
or more people if this change goes through. I find that objection quite
offensive. Comments of that kind degrade the loving relationships of
many of my constituents, and I feel that they make a poor contribution
to the
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000622" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000622">One
of the things I find saddening is that in many of the objections I have
received is an assumption that gay and lesbian people and Christians
are two separate groups. When a petition was read out in my church on a
Sunday several months ago, I could see how distressed gay members of
the congregation felt. It is a matter of huge regret that some
people—only some—have not acted more sensitively when
addressing this matter.</hs_Para>

overwhelming majority of the letters and e-mails that I have received
have been extremely cordial, a number of them—not least some
from people professing to want to uphold Christian values—have
displayed a vitriol which I find extremely worrying. For instance, I
have been told that my wife and I—my wife is chair of the
governors at our local faith school—should not have married in a
church if I am unwilling to vote against this measure. My response to
that is extremely robust. If those people want to purge the various
Churches of anyone who believes that faith is compatible with equal
rights, they can do so, but they will kill the Churches if they do.
There is no future in such a narrow, unwelcoming world view. We have
reconciled many literal interpretations of scripture with modern life,
and we can do so again on this
occasion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000624" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000624">One
of the more philosophical arguments that has been presented to me is
that marriage belongs to the Church and not to the state. I do not
believe that that is true either. We have revised and changed marriage
through statute repeatedly over the last 100 years, and I believe that
many of those changes strengthened marriage, notwithstanding the claims
to the contrary that were made at the time. They include the
introduction of register office weddings and weddings outside religious
venues, and changes in the law on sexual violence within marriage. Many
of those changes opened up the honour of marriage to a wider circle of
people, and they should be commended for doing
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000625" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000625"><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Gwynne" PimsId="4785" UID="13020551001405" xid="827" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551001405"><B>Andrew

transgendered people in Bristol over the last half century, and it
begins with the story of Oliver, a 55-year-old partner in a firm of
solicitors, who in 1963 was found guilty of gross indecency and
sentenced to three months in prison or a fine of £40. It reveals
all the trials and tribulations of that half-century, the ups and
downs, and the way in which the experiences of gay people in Bristol

all exhibitions, OutStories is not interested only in the abstract; it
makes one think about one’s own place in history. For me that
was rather easy, because I am mentioned in the exhibition as the first
openly gay Member of Parliament to serve my city, and indeed the first
on the Liberal Democrat Benches. I was born in 1966, when homosexuality
was still without the law and a criminal offence. During my life we
have seen much progress, but it has come in fits and starts and has not
always been easy. Throughout my teenage years and my years at
university, being openly gay was virtually impossible, because
occasionally it could be a terrifying identity for an individual to
have. I am thinking of the abuse that I received myself, and the far
worse that I saw meted out to other people at school and university.

fellow citizens have been through. Equality is not something that can

is not the sole property of any faith or denomination; it has always
been regulated by civic society, whether during the
Reformation, with the various Acts of Uniformity concerning the liturgy
and the Book of Common Prayer, or in respect of the rights of women in
the 19th century. Indeed, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, which

Member for Bristol West (Stephen Williams), who spoke powerfully from
his own experience. I am going to vote for the Bill to be given its
Second Reading tonight because I believe it is right to give all
committed, loving partnerships the same legal status. However, the Bill
bears all the hallmarks of a rushed job. The Government’s
confusion between a marriage and a wedding is made clear in the

have two concerns that I hope will be addressed in Committee before the
Government bring the Bill back for its Third Reading. I do not want us,
inadvertently, to back the Church of England into disestablishment. The
reason why the Church of England, unlike the other faiths, needs
special mention is not to introduce a new hurdle, but to reflects its
position as the established Church. Anyone and everyone who resides in
a parish has the right to marry and be married in their parish 
<?notus-xml column=178?>church. Canon law, which embodies the teaching of the Church, is also
part of the law of England. However regrettable some hon. Members feel
this to be, the Church of England is not, in the foreseeable future,
going to change its teaching on marriage, so this statute needs to
reflect that position if the Church of England is not going to be
subject to successful legal challenges. To put it another way, we need
to balance people’s rights under articles 12 and 14 in the
European convention of human rights to marry and be free from
discrimination against the equally important right under article 9 to
freedom of religion. Consequently, it is vital that that part of the
Bill is not weakened in
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:44:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000639" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0002.htm#13020551000639">In
another respect, I feel that the Bill does not go far enough. The
Government say that they want to treat all marriages in the same way,
but part 3 of schedule 4 exempts same-sex marriages from rules on
consummation and adultery. In practice, I guess that consummation might
not be a big problem. As for adultery, however, surely if sexual
fidelity is central to heterosexual marriages it should be central to
any and all marriages. Why is the Bill fixating on biological
heterosexual intercourse? A similar issue arises in how the Bill sets
out the rights of children born to lesbian mothers. Surely children
born to lesbian mothers should have the same right to two parents as
other children and the presumption should be that a married lesbian
couple are both parents of the child if one of them has a baby. I hope
that those Members who are on the Committee will consider that, as well
as the rights of children adopted by gay married men.</hs_Para>

Our civil partnership was a huge step for us, and yet many argue that

denied basic rights: next of kin and relationships were not recognised,
pension rights were not available to surviving partners, and
discrimination in property and inheritance issues was widespread. Civil

Members across the whole House that while that legislation

am bitterly disappointed at the manner in which people’s genuine

want to ensure that my views are recorded, because I do not agree with
the comments from people who are clearly steeped in bigotry and hatred.
My concerns are based on three considerations. First, the Bill, should
it become law, will give no new rights to same-sex couples in England
and Wales, and it is a complete fabrication to suggest that it is about
equality. Indeed, the briefing from Stonewall—an organisation I

rights.</hs_Para>

I believe very strongly that the state should have no role in marriage
whatsoever. Any couple, same-sex or not, should have access to civil
partnerships or unions. If this is truly about changing definitions and
setting them in law, for goodness’ sake, let us do it properly
and allow the state properly to recognise 
<?notus-xml column=180?>relationships, treat all people equally and allow equal access to all
the mechanisms of the state.

the Minister should think again about confining the Bill to civil

Church—any Church—or other faiths. It would be much
better to let them define spiritual marriage as they see fit and offer
it as they see fit. That would be very reassuring to a lot of

as this is an equalities measure it might be worth thinking about what
there is to lose by extending civil partnerships to everyone. That
would be a reasonable tidying-up exercise. I heard the Minister assure
the House that no one who is opposed to same-sex marriage will be
forced to promote it, and I believe she is sincere, but I hope that she
will do a bit more in Committee to give those guarantees some absolute
certainty. Lots of people who are not in any sense bigots are
expressing genuine and legitimate concerns, and when making a social
change, we are obliged to recognise those
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000676" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0003.htm#13020551000676">Finally,

weakened or undermined marriage in those countries—quite the

second argument is that equal marriage would threaten freedom of

gay people will, for their own reasons, continue to opt for civil

perhaps their relationship with a partner to whom they were previously

choice for gay people according to their lights and consciences, they
should equally be available as an option for mixed-sex couples. They,
too, might want to maintain a relationship with their church, their

anomalies and undermine the recognised obligations and norms that

new area of debate, confusion and differences within the same new

concepts of consummation and adultery will remain, yet they will not
apply for same-sex couples who take up the proposed provision. This
ludicrous situation underscores why, nearly a decade ago, the wise
provision of civil partnerships was made—to ensure that same-sex
couples could make an equally valid commitment in law, receiving all

the same values and Christian ideals that I do, and who worship on a

let us use today to return to a discussion of what marriage ought to be
about. When I married my wife, I understood our marriage to have two
important dimensions: the expression of love, fidelity and mutuality
over the course of our life together; and a commitment to raise
children. Gay men and women can now raise children—this House
made that decision—so let us not hear any further discussion
about having a family as if gay men and women cannot have
that.</hs_Para>

for the stability of wider society, and that no Government should

redefinition of marriage. I know that many people inside and outside
the House have desired a slanging match across and around the Chamber,

trust that the Bill’s supporters appreciate that those who
oppose it do so because of genuinely held beliefs and convictions, many
of which were taught to them at their mother’s knee. Most
people, even to this day, regard the United Kingdom as a Christian
country. To some that is an embarrassment, while others thank God that
our nation still has some gospel light and enjoys freedom of thought
and speech. Each day, hon. Members gather in this Chamber to hear the
Scriptures read and prayer offered to God, humbly asking for
God’s blessing upon our Queen, her Government and our
deliberations. We as leaders among our people still acknowledge
God’s sovereign throne, the authority of His revered word and
our need for wisdom far greater than our own. Sadly, after doing so
today, we are turning from the teachings of that same book, and placing
our wisdom and knowledge above divine
wisdom.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000796" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0003.htm#13020551000796">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:58:17"></hs_TimeCode>
is true to say that to mention Scriptures in debate in this Chamber
often brings scorn, laughter, mockery, isolation and intolerance, but
Scripture reminds us that God said it was not good that man should be
alone, so he brought Eve unto Adam. For thousands of years, in almost
all cultures, marriage has been defined to be a lifelong union between
a man and a woman. Marriage is an institution given by God for the good
of all mankind in every age and has been the bedrock institution of
family and society, but today our Government intend to sweep away a
definition that has served our nation well for centuries and to impose
new standards and values on the whole of society, irrespective of
religious beliefs or personal convictions. Surely religious
liberty 
<?notus-xml column=199?>and freedom of conscience are not to be cast aside on a whim, simply

Nothing is as fundamental as that. I was disappointed by the frivolous

sexual orientation regulations of 2007, which forced out of business
Catholic adoption agencies that made special efforts to help the most
disabled, deserving and vulnerable children. Those agencies were put
out of business, smashed on the altar of political correctness. Today,
we are talking not about fairness and equality, but about a hierarchy
of rights—“Your rights are more important than my
rights.” Members who vote for the Bill should think carefully
about that. They should look at themselves in the mirror and ask
whether they want to be responsible for a Catholic teaching assistant
being hounded from her office as a result of this Bill. That is not
fantasy; it can happen. I believe that it will happen unless we do

This is one of the most significant debates in this Parliament yet, by

Radical social change that undermines the long-standing and commonly

party came into being to defend. I fear that this is about trying to
detoxify the brand. I have a lot of good friends in the Tory party, but
I say this to the Prime Minister, who has astonished me by introducing
this legislation: this may appease some people out there for a while,
but it will undermine  the grass roots of the Tory party. We

approach the Bill wanting to support it, but I have concerns. Issues
raised by constituents have made me think and ask questions, and made
me seek answers and reassurances. For me, the points that have been
raised reflect the many personal battles that I have faced and some of
the most troubling and dark times in my life. Many people have spoken
and written about deeply held religious beliefs. From an early age, I
developed those beliefs, going to church without the support of my
family. That faith grew over time, but in my adolescence, I began to
realise that I was gay. Being gay in a small Welsh village really was
like being the only gay in the village. It was the start of some very
deep questioning about my faith and my sexuality that has taken me
years to try to resolve, and I am still seeking
answers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000820" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0003.htm#13020551000820"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T17:14:21"></hs_TimeCode>When

have received raised exactly those
points<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. But
marriage changed from the moment civil marriage was enacted. The state
created an act of union that was separate from religion and the Church,
so as the state is involved in civil marriage, I cannot see how we can
make it exclusive. I want to live in a society that does not
discriminate. That is why I support the Bill. However, I want to secure
that personal choice for marriage, as well as personal freedom. That is
why I welcome the locks that the Government have put in

reflection, I believe the Bill strengthens the meaning of religious
freedom, which is a principle we should all uphold. Many religious
groups that want to perform same-sex marriages are currently barred
from doing so, which surely contradicts the true meaning of religious
freedom. The measures in the Bill before us lay the decision
whether to hold such marriages squarely at the doors  of those
organisations. It is not a decision of the state and allows
each group to decide, bringing about true
freedom<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

state is involved is in extending civil marriage to same-sex couples.
In an equal and free society, this must surely be right. Equality
measures introduced in the past have changed attitudes, as I have
witnessed. This is another step forward. Marriage is a wonderful
institution, but for too long we have seen a decline in the number of
people making that commitment. Rather than see the Bill as a threat to
that institution, we should see it as a great opportunity to show how

Reading of the Bill on the basis that it is the fundamental right of
all people to have the opportunities and obligations of marriage,
irrespective of whether it is between two people of the same sex or
different sexes. Marriage bestows a host of benefits that should be
equally available to people, whether they are gay or straight. There

Bill opens up the opportunities for civil marriage and enables Churches
to go forward as well, if they so wish. A couple of the arguments used
against this are red herrings, in particular the issue of the
definition of marriage, adultery and consummation. Most divorces are
due to unreasonable behaviour, and it is obvious that if a gay partner
went off with somebody else or there was no sexual relationship between
the partners, that could be construed as unreasonable behaviour, so in
practice there is a homosexual version of adultery and consummation.

argument is entirely a red

equal rights to marriage in one’s own Church, the issue of
freedom of religion arises. Whose freedom is it? Is it the freedom of
the Church, when the great majority of parishioners want to go forward
and ordain women, for instance, or want to allow all couples to get
married? Some of these issues are for the Church. When considering in
detail the position of the Church in Wales and the Church of England,
we should be under no illusion that those Churches are under an
obligation to marry all comers. Therefore, when this legislation goes
through they will, as an arm of the state, be open to legal challenge
in Strasbourg. That involves genuine legal questions that need to be

According to those on the Front Bench, the Bill is all about love, but
marriage is not defined anywhere in law by love. It is exemplified by
love—I love my wife passionately—but that is not what
marriage is. That is an expression of a relationship. There are many
arranged marriages and many marriages are loveless, but those people
are still in law and by law married. Marriage is not defined by love
itself. The vow that we take when we get married is there to sustain
marriage, even after love wanes, if it wanes at

I also respond to the point that has been made continually
about marriage having been between a man and a woman throughout
history? Given that homosexuality was illegal in the UK until the late
’60s, it is ridiculous to make the point that marriage has
always been between a man and a woman. Until that point, a homosexual
relationship would not even have been legal. Had homosexuality been
legalised 100 years ago, we probably would have had this debate many
years back. People must bear that historical context in

more than demonstrated by this debate, marriage is incredibly important

that many people still celebrate civil marriages. It is a good thing
that they do because, given the declining church attendances over many
decades, if they did not, marriage would be declining at a greater rate
than it is. Many people enter into marriage sincerely and happily

Bill will achieve a great deal in equalising the marriage laws in their

freedom. The right to marry is set out in article 12 of the European

civil partners already have all the legal rights of marriage, which is

many years cannot enter a civil partnership, but if one dies leaving

inheritance tax on the property. That would not apply to female
same-sex partners. That is hardly fair, is it? As a result of the Bill,
same-sex couples have a choice of seeking to get married or seeking a
civil registration. A heterosexual couple would be denied the

marriage. That, too, is hardly

Peter Bottomley</B> (Worthing West) (Con):</Member> The primary
commandment is to love the Lord my God with all my heart, soul, mind
and strength. I have been reminded by one ordained constituent that
that should be used as a way of defining the second great
commandment, which is to treat my neighbour as myself. Essentially, we
are asking whether we can remove the barriers that stop same-sex
couples enjoying the commitment—the “at one”
meaning—of marriage. That is what the Bill comes down to. It
does not redefine marriage; it just takes away
barriers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000895" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0003.htm#13020551000895">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T16:51:42"></hs_TimeCode>

homosexual at the time. He got married aged 60 to a woman, one got
murdered by a rent boy and one spent 30 years in the Community of the
Resurrection. In his book, “Someday I’ll Find
You”, Harry Williams, who also wrote “The True
Resurrection” and “The True Wilderness”, explained
the difficulty of coming to terms with his homosexuality. He should not
have had to do that. He should have had the chance of a happy life,

those of a husband and wife married to each other throughout the

children aside, we ought to have the same kind of understanding that
Margaret Thatcher showed when, in 1967, she voted for the
decriminalisation of homosexuality. That was the year Chief Justice
Warren of the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a
unanimous judgment in a case called Loving <I>v. </I>Virginia, where a
couple, one called “Black” and one called
“White”, wanted to be married in the state of Virginia.
Read the judgment and understand that that case got to the Supreme
Court because people were putting arguments against people of different
colour being able to live together. Those arguments are absurd now, and
it is absurd that we are having this debate.</hs_Para>

do that, even though I am not a member of the Plymouth Brethren and
even though the Plymouth Brethren live a life that is, shall we say,
somewhat different to that of the majority of people or even to my

schechita and so on. I will continue to do that because I

equate this debate with what happened to divorce law in the previous
century. Interestingly, in all this talk about marriage always being
the same and its continued popularity, no one seems to have mentioned
the loosening of the divorce laws. As I said, I am a Roman Catholic,
and in that faith divorce is treated differently, but nobody, to my
knowledge, has ever challenged the right of a Roman Catholic priest or,
indeed, an Anglican to refuse to marry a divorced couple. It has never
actually happened, and that is how I see this issue.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T17:55:07"></hs_TimeCode>I approach it
with principles based on the reciprocity that exists in any democratic
society between minorities and our protection of their rights. I

Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) went slightly over the top and
historically I think he was incorrect. It was not Rosa Parks to begin
with. The principle of separate but equal was defined as wrong by the
Supreme Court in Brown<I> v. </I>Topeka Education Board in
1959—if my history teaching is still there. Nevertheless, he was
right about it being different. All we are asking for in the Bill,
principally, is civil marriage. The majority of existing civil
marriages are between divorcees, so the Roman Catholic Church does not
recognise them anyway, and that is fine; it is permitted—and it
will be permitted to keep its particular beliefs in this case as

that was what I came here to do—to protect those freedoms and

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T17:56:22"></hs_TimeCode>As I said, that
is the principle I work on: a reciprocity between minorities in respect
of their beliefs and right to carry on with their lifestyle as they
wish, provided it does not interfere with that of others. I do not see
how the Bill creates any problems with that or will prevent me in
future from defending the Plymouth Brethrens, the Jewish faith, my own

Howell</B> (Henley) (Con):</Member> Like most hon. Members, I have
thought long and hard about this issue. I am a keen proponent of equal
opportunity, and I recently celebrated my 25th wedding anniversary so I
greatly value the institution of marriage. Also like many hon. Members,
I have received a large number of letters and e-mails on this subject.
I therefore undertook my own research into the issues raised, and in
July I published a paper setting out my response. At the
time, I concluded that no compelling case had yet been made against the
change. I stand by that paper’s conclusion; I wish us to move
towards being a society more at ease with
itself.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000924" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0003.htm#13020551000924">Since
the Bill was published, e-mails have continued to be sent to me, and I
have great respect for the deeply held views that have been expressed.
I am particularly grateful to those who have entered into genuine
debate with me and those who have put their own case with generosity of
spirit. This is a matter of conscience and we must all respond with
integrity, as we have done in this debate. The outcome at the ballot
box must not be allowed to drive this important debate, and I resent
the implication that it
should.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000925" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0003.htm#13020551000925">In
my paper, I pointed out that Spain served as a good example. It allowed
gay civil marriage in 2005. There have been no changes since. The new
conservative Government of the Partido Popular have not moved to change
it, and life has gone on as normal. That is unsurprising, as fewer than
2% of marriages have been same-sex marriages.</hs_Para>

discussion, I have come to realise that there is a lack of depth and a
lack of clarity in some of the responses, and although support for this
Bill today will serve to send it on to Committee for scrutiny, I am
concerned that some of the issues may be too fundamental to be resolved
by that process. I therefore ask Ministers how open they are likely to
be in Committee to undertaking fundamental reform, including reviewing
civil
partnerships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000927" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0003.htm#13020551000927">I,
too, have been troubled by the issues before us. Deep down, I remain of
the view that, in the end, it is right to make it legal for two people
of the same gender to marry. I cannot comprehend that a gay marriage
would undermine a heterosexual marriage, but I have come to question
whether this Bill might have been prepared in haste, and whether it
would be possible to address its deficiencies in
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020551000928" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0003.htm#13020551000928">I

the speed with which this proposal has come forward. I agree that it
was in the equalities contract produced just before the general

or the Queen’s Speech. While none of that is essential for
introducing legislation, a change of this type touches deep emotions
and we need to allow time for proper reflection on the genuine concerns

Act was introduced to protect people who dissented from the common view
at the time. Before 1836, people had to get married in a Church of
England church, which was anathema to the many Roman
Catholics, non-conformists and Quakers and the very small number of
atheists. The then Government under Viscount Melbourne introduced the
legislation to protect the liberties of those people. A
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T18:09:33"></hs_TimeCode>case cited in
the House at the time involved a Roman Catholic lady who had married a
fellow Roman Catholic in a clandestine marriage. The husband then ran

forward-looking piece of legislation.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T18:09:33"></hs_TimeCode> arguments
marshalled against it were not dissimilar to those that we are hearing
today. It was argued that marriage was somehow exclusively the preserve
of religion, and that extending it into the secular sphere in any way
would devalue it. At that time, the number of people, such as atheists,
who were married in secular ceremonies was minuscule, but the figure
has now risen to 60% of marriages and we do not regard such marriages
as being of any less worth or involving any less love than those that
are conducted in a church. I believe that, 177 years later, we should
now seek to protect the love, the freedoms and the liberties of another
minority that has been oppressed and forgotten for so

have heard two main reasons for opposing the legislation. We have been
asked to guarantee that it will not be successfully challenged in the
courts. In fact, no Member can guarantee that the present law will not
be successfully challenged. The question should be whether there is a
credible risk of such a challenge, and the answer to that is no.
Countries that already have this law have not been challenged. For
years in this country, we have allowed divorced people to remarry in
church, yet the Catholic Church’s policy of not remarrying
divorcees has not been challenged. The most eminent lawyers in the
country tell us that the risk is inconceivable, and the Church of
England’s own briefing states that the Church does not believe
it to be realistic or
likely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020569000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0004.htm#13020569000019"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T18:09:06"></hs_TimeCode>The
other argument against the legislation is that it would undermine
marriage. Mrs Barwell suffers enough as a result of my job, and if I
thought it likely that I would go home tonight only to be accused of
undermining my marriage by voting for the Bill, I would not vote for
it. However, no one has yet come up with a credible explanation of how
it would undermine marriage. Yes, it is controversial, but
decriminalising homosexuality was controversial, as was our equalising
the age of consent. It was also controversial when the Labour
Government rightly legislated for civil partnerships. Once those things
were done and the world did not end, public opinion changed, and that
is what will happen when this legislation is
passed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T18:09:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020569000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0004.htm#13020569000020">I
am by nature a small “c” conservative. I do not like
change. There is a part of me that would like to take the world back to
1990 when my father was healthy, when I did not have the pressures of a
demanding job and England were in the semi-finals of the World cup.
There is another part of me, however, that recognises the failure of
that approach. For conservatism to work, we have to accept that the
world changes. If we do not, we become an anachronism. What
we have to do as Conservatives is shape that change and try to preserve
the best of what we inherited.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T18:10:19"></hs_TimeCode> is what
this Bill does. If it becomes law, it will not undermine marriage; it
will not lead to Churches or mosques that do not wish to do so being
forced to conduct same-sex marriages. What it will do is allow people

we gone from being a party with four electoral successes to
become a party on the edge of political extinction? The reality is that

faced—for example, the rhetoric of race and engaging with the

shall be voting against the Bill because my perspective on what
marriage is really about is different from that of some other Members.
Of course marriage is about loving commitment to one another, but for
me it is fundamentally still about family, the bedrock of society.
Marriage involves special provisions, such as support for the family
and the procreation of children. Of course that is not the case for all
families, for various reasons, but I nevertheless think those
provisions are too important to be tampered with in rushed legislation
that has not been subject to adequate
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020569000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0004.htm#13020569000035">We
can request as many legal opinions as we like, but the Government do
not plan to indemnify any institution against legal costs if the

partnerships to people of the same sex, perpetuating what is
effectively a two-tier institution, either by not repealing the law or
by denying it to people of opposite sexes. I feel that there are too
many inconsistencies, and there is no doubt that the intertwining of
Church of England law with the law of England is very difficult to
unpick.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020569000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0004.htm#13020569000036">I

because they are homophobes, or solely for religious reasons. In fact,
more Catholic Conservative Members will be voting for the Bill than

concern about the way in which the Bill is being introduced. Not enough
attention has been paid to the valid concerns of people who are
genuinely frightened about the possibility, mentioned by my hon. Friend
the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce), that they will be prosecuted if
they do not offer weddings of all kinds. Although the Minister did not
say this, legal advice suggests that people who work for councils will

Leadsom</B> (South Northamptonshire) (Con):</Member> The debate goes to
the heart of our 21st-century dilemma. In Parliament we rightly
advocate equality, freedom and the protection of minority rights, but
too often the rights of one group conflict directly with the rights of
another. That is not new. Back in the 1850s a political hero of mine,
John Stuart Mill, tried in his essay “On Liberty” to
define where one person’s liberty ended and another
person’s liberty began. He said that we should

issue of same-sex marriage tests human liberties to the limit. As a
Christian, I have been struggling with trying to square the fact that
the Bible teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman, with my
belief that God loves us all equally, whether we believe in him or not,
whether we go to church or not, and whatever our sexuality.</hs_Para>

the first point I wish to make is that I wholeheartedly believe that
same-sex couples have as valid a relationship with their partner as do
heterosexuals. I also believe that in the eyes of the state we all
deserve to be treated equally.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T18:20:06"></hs_TimeCode>But I want to go
back to the issue of how one’s person’s liberty should
not be allowed to encroach upon another’s, and that is where I
am genuinely torn. I have deep sympathy with the hundreds of my
constituents who fear that legislation for same-sex marriage will
profoundly encroach—although this may be unintended —on
their right to live according to their faith. For many, the conviction
that marriage can take place only between a man and a woman means that
they feel that their own marriage is undermined by what they see as a
profound change to the biblical definition. Others fear that same-sex
marriage will lead to those working as teachers, priests and chaplains,
and those working in the caring professions, being unable to
express their own profoundly held views in the workplace. I share their
concerns and believe that they are right to fear discrimination against
those of faith if this legislation is enacted.</hs_Para>

I do not believe that we have any mandate for this Bill: there is no
nationwide clamour for same-sex marriage; civil partnership does
provide state recognition for the love of same-sex partners; and if we
were truly seeking equality, surely we would also be legislating for
heterosexuals to enter into civil partnership. This Bill
causes great hurt and for many represents a radical

<?notus-xml column=222?>reform without proper consideration having been given to the
consequences. I deeply regret the way in which it has diminished the
principles of democracy and liberty in this country. It is being rushed
through to the shock of many people. Fundamental change such as this

Parliaments in the world and the message we give from this place
matters deeply. So with great sadness, I shall be positively
abstaining: I shall be walking through the Aye Lobby in solidarity with
the minority of same-sex couples for whom marriage represents the

freedoms may well be under threat from this ill-considered

many speakers have said, the issue for gay people in this country has
changed dramatically over many years. In my lifetime it has gone from a
situation where homosexuality was not recognised in the public square,
through a childhood where the absence of understanding of that issue
was loud as any absence can be, through a recognition that when one
came of age the very act of having sex could lead to the catching of a
contagious illness, and through a period when there was a recognition
that that illness could lead to loved ones and friends dying. It has
also led in the political sphere to political opponents
using one’s sexual orientation as a weapon to seek to achieve
the accumulation of votes, notwithstanding what their party might say
is its abiding principle. Out of that period—significantly,
perhaps, from the period of the reaction to HIV and AIDS—came
the power for the recognition of same-sex couples having unions. This
country, the previous Government and my right hon. Friend the Member
for Rutland and Melton (Mr Duncan)
should<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T18:24:31"></hs_TimeCode> be
enormously proud of their role in bringing civil partnerships into

his partner.</hs_Para>

that has taught me that, although it is important that I speak in this
debate, it is as important that I listen. When one receives so many
observations from one’s constituents of deeply held views, it is
important for all Members to have some humility before they vote based
on their own opinions. Many of those expressions have been based on a
religious belief. We should understand that faith matters and we ignore
the subtlety of the sinews of faith that operate in our public square
if we seek to push to one side people’s concerns and
objections.</hs_Para>

man and a woman. I stand by that commitment. For saying that in public,
I have been subjected to vilification, abuse, threats to my physical
well-being and threats to my office. None has come from constituents,
but from people outside my constituency. I have received five letters
of support for a change to the sexual arrangements in marriage and
1,000 supporting my stance. The vast majority of my constituents share
my view that there is no need for such a change. If I thought that
same-sex couples did not have the same rights before the law in any
shape or form, I would think again, but civil partnerships, introduced
by Parliament well before I was elected, introduced those rights for
same-sex couples.</hs_Para>

I often recall the day a few years ago when I finally plucked up the
courage to tell my parents that I was gay. I began the conversation
with the line, “Mum, you know I’m never going to be able
to marry.” I used that form of words as a way of broaching an
awkward conversation and I did not really think much about it at the

look at the marriage that my parents have—45 years and going
strong—and I aspire to the same thing. I do not have someone at
the minute, but if I do, I want to cherish that person, love them,
support them. It is not just about a ceremony; it is about being with
them for the rest of a life, in good times and bad, richer or poorer,
sickness and health. That can apply as much to me as to a straight
couple. I do not understand why some people feel threatened that
allowing me to have that in any way diminishes what a heterosexual

very much welcome the Bill. There are many different interpretations of
marriage. We have heard them discussed today. Some people do not wish
divorcees to remarry. Others are perfectly comfortable with it. I am no
theological expert, but the concept of marriage has evolved over time.
It is perfectly possible to respect those who take a traditional view
of marriage. I do not agree with it, but I utterly respect those who
sincerely hold that view. It is surely possible both to respect that
and to allow others to enjoy the benefits of marriage. Other countries
have managed it perfectly well—Spain, Canada and many other
countries. It is surely not beyond our wit and wisdom to devise that in
law in this country. That is why I welcome the Bill and, in a little

the civil rights movement and in 1967 homosexuality was made 
<?notus-xml column=226?>legal. Approximately 10 years ago civil partnerships were made legal. In

me, this is a matter of commitment. I have spent 20 years as a
community activist, councillor, lawyer, and now MP seeing examples of
the difficulties that occur when couples fail to commit and fail to
bring up children in the right way. Yet when two people show a desire
to commit in the most serious way possible, are we to deny them that
opportunity merely because they are of the same sex? That cannot be
right. We know that married couples are twice as likely to stay
together as cohabiting couples. Yes, there are clear religious problems
with the arguments made in favour of the Bill, but I cannot conceive of
a God who creates, allows and permits homosexuals but would then want
us to deny them the right to seek marital fulfilment within a religious

Unitarians, who want to conduct such marriages to be able to move
forward on that. With respect, that seems totally illogical. I am
satisfied that the necessary religious freedoms are in place and that

hundreds of thousands, of our supporters, who feel threatened. Perhaps
the tide of history is moving against them, but a major social change
should not be pushed through with no electoral mandate. Previous
speakers have referred to the contract for equalities that was

it was not. Very few people knew that it existed, and at that point

argument that marriage can exist only between a man and a woman, I
recognise that that is the teaching in many faiths but, as hon. Members
throughout the House have pointed out, marriage is not just a religious
matter—it is a social institution, too, and precisely because it
is a social institution the meaning of marriage changes over time as
society’s values change. Those changes prove that marriage is
remarkably resilient. Indeed, its resilience derives in part from its
ability to adapt to changing social mores. By recognising and extending
the definition of marriage to reflect today’s greater openness
towards and recognition of same-sex relationships, the Bill does not
weaken the institution of marriage. On the contrary, it takes it
forward, strengthens it and helps to perpetuate
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020569000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/debtext/130205-0004.htm#13020569000088">Those

the heart of this Bill is a straightforward proposition. If a couple
love each other, the state should not stop them from getting married
unless there is a good reason, and in this day and age being gay is not
a good reason, if it ever was. I know that, for some
religions and faiths, this goes beyond their beliefs. I respect that
entirely; as a  
<?notus-xml column=231?>result, the Bill specifically protects the rights of those who do not
agree and does not compel anyone to do anything. All religious
organisations are free to choose whether to opt in or opt out. This
Bill simply allows people to get married who are currently excluded
from doing so purely because they are of the same sex. It is a clear
and simple objective, delivered in a way that promotes and protects
religious freedom. In short, I believe this is a sensible and timely
step forward. On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.</hs_Para>

Anne Main</B> (St Albans) (Con):</Member> On a point of order, Mr
Speaker. On the Floor of the House today, we heard many times that the
Bill should be committed to a Committee of the whole House. The
Minister was asked whether that was possible, and he gave his reasons
why he believed not. For clarification, Mr Speaker, and before we vote
on the programme motion, is it possible to have split Committee
proceedings, with some upstairs, facilitating what the Minister would
like to happen, and some on the Floor of the
House?</hs_Para>

render it a point of order on which  I can rule. Her view, no

assuredly guide her and perhaps other right hon. and hon. Members on
how to vote on the programme motion, which is about to be moved by or

pragmatic plans—which will hopefully fit with some of his that

urge him to ensure that his Department and the related bodies,

Heritage, give their full support to the Britain on Foot in the

President Obama is supporting such initiatives in the States. The US

the Member for Macclesfield will be pleased to hear that it is entirely
supportive of the aims of the Britain on Foot campaign, as they align
with increasing activity in the great outdoors and the subsequent
economic benefit for tourism businesses. VisitEngland recognises the
connection between increased outdoor activity-related tourism and
increased sales of outdoor clothing and equipment. The agenda of the
Outdoor Industries Association and Britain on Foot is very much aligned
with VisitEngland’s strategic framework for tourism in England.
Its focus on modernising the rural offering and getting younger people
in particular interested in outdoor experiences will ultimately benefit
the rural

me touch on two issues my hon. Friend mentioned. I always get asked
about International Olympic Committee votes. It is important to say
that the only people who vote on which sports go into the mix—he
is absolutely right, the vote is in the September IOC session in Buenos
Aires—are the IOC members, and they are extremely resistant to
pressure from Government to get sports in and out. A number of sports
are trying to  get in this time around, some of which would do
us, as  a country, quite a lot of good, so we would like
to  see them in. The advice to mountaineering—indeed,
the advice I would give to any sport—is that it is important to
take a strategic long-term view. Mountaineering may be lucky in 2020,
but if it is not, the sport’s representatives need to keep
plugging away, because the programme changes regularly. Even in London,
we could sense that there were some sports that may not have a
long-term future in the summer games. There is a case for
mountaineering in either the winter or the summer games; as there is a
place for it in both, it is well worth plugging away at the strategic
level.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T20:31:07"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

McDonnell</B> (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful for
hon. Members’ attendance this morning at this debate about HMRC
and its capacity and resources. Over the past decade or so, tax debates
in Westminster Hall have usually been attended by the usual public
administration anoraks—a club that I am a member of—or
failed accountants who have been elected to the House of Commons, which
is even worse. Not any more, however: the recession means that we all
take an interest in public expenditure and look at every element of
public income. A tax justice campaign is being waged as a result of the
recession, and I pay tribute to tax justice campaigners John
Christensen and Richard Murphy for their work over the years, as well
as to UK Uncut, whose direct action campaign brought the issue to the
attention of the public. It is concerned about the scandal of unpaid
and uncollected tax. The debate reveals that our system does not work
effectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000008">There
is another scandal associated with our taxation system: not just how
much taxation is avoided or evaded, but how badly our tax collection
and administration is managed overall—and, to be frank, how it
has been mismanaged by politicians over the past few decades. At times,
there has been almost catastrophic short-sightedness and incompetence.
The genesis of the debate was a lobby by the Public and Commercial
Services Union that happened in the past six months, and meetings with
members. I chair the PCS parliamentary group, and the union represents
55,000 staff at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. There have
been many meetings with Members, and meetings in constituencies, to
express the overwhelming sense of frustration, which has at times
verged on anger that, as professionals, staff have been held back from
fulfilling their role of ensuring that taxes are collected
efficiently.</hs_Para>

particular sense of frustration because during the recession HMRC
could, through tax collection, make a significant contribution to
tackling the economic crisis and, indeed, the overall deficit. Staff
feel that they are being held back professionally, and undermined by
cuts: staffing cuts, office closures, deteriorating work conditions
resulting in low morale, and the lack of appropriate professional and
legislative tools to do the job. Time and again the view has been
expressed that more and more policy changes load responsibilities on to
them—more work for an overstretched and overburdened work force.
The expression used by many of the staff is that they have been set up
to fail—in some instances so that their jobs can be privatised.
I want to explore the current situation in HMRC and consider the
remedies that are needed. The Government need to stand back at this
point, and consider staffing resources and the challenges that staff
face.</hs_Para>

job? It dates back to the time of Chaucer, the earliest famous tax
collector—a putative PCS shop steward. It is simply to collect
taxes. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
circulated an excellent brief before the debate, and summed it up. HMRC
simply makes the tax system work: that is what it is meant to do, but
the reality is that it struggles to do so. We know that from the
evidence that is available to us. If the main role of HMRC is to
collect the taxes, it is clear from the recent evidence that it has not
the resources and legislative tools to do so. That is clear from the
evidence of the tax gap—we have debated the tax gap at length in
this Chamber and I appreciate that there are disputes about using it as
an overall assessment of performance, and about the overall level of
the tax gap itself, but we know that the range is anything from the
£70 to £120 billion estimated by the Tax Research UK,
under Richard Murphy, and the HMRC’s and the Minister’s
estimate of between £30 billion and £40 billion a year.
In other words, even on the Government’s own assessment, half
the current deficit is not being collected in taxes, because of tax
avoidance and
evasion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000011">The
scale of tax avoidance and evasion has caused anger throughout our
communities. It is not only the tax justice campaigns and the media
that have been railing against them—so have the Government. In
December the Chancellor said that people are “right to be
angry” about companies not paying their fair share of the tax,
and I fully agree with him. The Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills said in November that it was “completely
unacceptable” that companies could get away with what he
described as gaming the system, to avoid tax, and referred to
“appalling stories of abuse” within the tax
system.</hs_Para>

the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge), tore aside the veil that

companies of devising, and ruthlessly implementing,
large-scale—massive—avoidance schemes described by some
as obscene. It is worth repeating the scale of what we have seen, in
example after example: Starbucks paying only £8.5 million in
corporation tax since it was launched here in 1998, despite £3
billion of sales; Google paying £6 million in tax last year on a
turnover of £395 million; Apple paying £14.5
million in tax on £1 billion of sales. Numerous other examples

Field</B> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</Member> The hon.
Gentleman has listed a range of selective statistics, but he is well
aware that tax is paid on profits, not turnover. Part and parcel of
sales is VAT, so taxes other than corporation tax are involved. Does he
think that a big danger in the debate is the intermingling of the sense
of tax evasion, which is absolutely illegal, with tax avoidance? Not
only is tax avoidance legal, but it is bizarre for politicians in

previous Government, but I was critical then also. Under this
Government, it is expected to find another 15%. What does that mean?
The Minister and I were involved in a discussion about this in the main
Chamber a few weeks ago. That scale of reduction would be startling for
any organisation. In 2005, HMRC employed 97,000; by 2015 it is planned
that the total staff numbers will be 55,000—almost half the
staff cut. Since this Government were elected, 7,000 HMRC jobs have
gone. The objective in all this is to save what? Some £1
billion. That makes no economic sense when there is a tax
gap—tax that remains uncollected—of, according to

be frank, HMRC is woefully under-resourced to tackle the tax gap, and
fraud and evasion, and the view of professionals in the field is that
the staff cuts seriously hinder the department’s effectiveness.

staff levels, and that is true. There have been some additional staff,

that fails to appreciate the role of other front-line staff in dealing
with tax inquiries and chasing up payments. Those essential back-room
staff, who are not respected in the role they play, seem to be the ones
who are vulnerable to losing their jobs. The Government have partially
recognised some of the staff resource issues, providing £900
million to secure an extra £7 billion in tax revenue,
and announcing a further £77 million in December to expand
HMRC’s anti-avoidance and evasion activities, which they predict
will secure another £2 billion. That small investment
over the coming years will secure a total of £22 billion of
additional taxation, demonstrating that investing in the staff and the

than 100 staff in Stockport have recently been offered voluntary

will not delay the Chamber too long, but I have an example of the
contradictory nature of the whole affair, which is the closure of the
Wick office. All 15 staff based at the office work in local compliance,
or local tax collection. The total cost of commercial rent and staff
comes to £494,475—I will offer the Minister my detailed
brief afterwards if he so wishes. The total tax yield for the same
period is £14 million. Each member of staff is 
<?notus-xml column=8?>responsible for bringing in close to £1 million in one tax year.
The office, which we think has a realistic target of £20 million
a year, is to close. To save £500,000, therefore, we lose
£20 million as a result of the staff cuts. The Wick staff are
all experienced and have used that experience gained over the years to
be successful in their work. The loss of 15 jobs in Wick is equivalent,
per head of population, to the loss of 17,000 jobs in London. There is
a significant impact on the local economy, and that is repeated in area
after area. The problem is that local office closures will mean new
demands on call

Government expect 80% of universal credit claimants to use online
services, but it is likely that many of those people will not have
internet access. In the absence of local offices, the next port of call
will be the telephone service, on which the cost burden will fall ever
more greatly as people are called on to fill out more detailed
information in order to access benefits such as tax credits and
employment and support allowance. That demonstrates the digital divide
in our country and the divide between those who can access a local

Insecurity is ever present. Staff have suffered a pay freeze, pension
cuts, job cuts and office closures, and now, as a result of Cabinet
Office procedures, the department is reviewing all terms and
conditions, including hours of work, leave, parental and special leave,
child care, job sharing, flexitime and part-time working, all of which

of the HMRC nursery closures was brutal and incompetent. HMRC announced
on 23 August 2012 that it was to close eight workplace nurseries by
November. The nurseries were in Blackburn, Cardiff, East Kilbride,
Leeds, Leicester, Nottingham, Salford and Wolverhampton. Parents were
given just 12 weeks’ notice, and the decision was taken without
any consultation with the trade unions. PCS led a campaign with the
support of numerous Members, whom I thank, and one

rationale for closing the nurseries was that it would be fairer to
everyone to have the same level of child care provision, so it
introduced a child care voucher scheme, taking no account of the
financial or personal impact of the decision on staff. It raised
serious concerns among staff about HMRC’s commitment to
family-friendly policies. The organisation’s management have
admitted that it was not their finest hour. It has certainly hit morale
badly within the department.</hs_Para>

galling to HMRC staff and to us is that contracts are being handed out
to corporations involved in large-scale tax avoidance. It is
extraordinary. I raised the issue in the House some weeks ago, but I
will run through the examples. Capgemini and Accenture, two IT
companies with HMRC contracts, were both identified recently as having
avoided paying tax. Capgemini, the lead contractor on the £8
billion Aspire contract, paid only £308,000—or less than
1%—in corporation tax last year on £38 million in
profits. There is no justification for that happening in the first
place, and certainly no justification for us feeding a tax avoider with
Government contracts. Accenture, which has a £9.6 million
contract with HMRC to supply technical support, managed to reduce its
tax bill to 3.5%, paying only £2.8 million in tax on nearly
£82 million in profits in Britain last year, yet we awarded it
another
contract.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000054">To

Mapeley, which is now part of the US offshore group Fortress Management
Services, were based in Britain, the Treasury could expect to receive
around £184 million in tax revenues. In fact, the company is
expected to pay only £14 million on its lucrative HMRC contract.

I believe that Ministers have begun to become aware of it in recent

re-resourced. Staffing levels must be brought back up. A new sense of
purpose and a new direction must be injected into the department. Staff

low-cost place to be and, given the paucity of white-collar jobs on
Teesside, it would be easy to get new people there to replace
the  400 jobs that were lost in Middlesbrough when the tax
office closed a few years ago. Middlesbrough has the second highest
unemployment rate in the country, so the loss of those jobs was hugely
damaging. We need more resource, and let us have some on
Teesside.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_05_PT_1/A06479962E1EEEF8D209811878C53C33A2458384" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2013">Tuesday

Field</B> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</Member> Let us cut
to the chase. Among the vast number of businesses and UK taxpayers,
HMRC has a not entirely undeserved reputation as a byword for
incompetence, opaqueness and arbitrary action, verging on shambolic. In
his passionate opening speech, the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington

of Parliament who represents a constituency that is an important part
of the UK economy, and there is a real problem—we will, no

<?notus-xml column=14?>society. I have spoken about that in the House, and particularly against
the backdrop of the protests at  St Paul’s cathedral a
little over a year ago. Many—dare I say

political game scoring that goes on. We need a far better pre-clearance
system, certainly if we are to have a new anti-avoidance rule that is
both equitable and, more importantly, effective. The Government have it
clear that they want to introduce such a rule in the Budget within six
or seven weeks. Therefore, the pace of change of tax law must alter. I
have served on many Finance Bill Committees, both as a Front Bencher in
opposition and as a Back Bencher in government and opposition. Our
system is horribly and terribly complex, and our code is much longer
than the much-derided Indian system of the past. We should all aspire
to a simpler tax system because complexity is the godfather to the
complex avoidance schemes that we have heard about at great length
during this

of small businesses must be better understood. I was a small business
man for seven years before I became a Member of Parliament in 2001, but
thank goodness, I am not still in business. I speak to businesses of a

is a danger that, in the perennial chatter about the failings of the
tax system and politicians’ understandable reluctance not to
play to the gallery, tax regulation will become much more arbitrary.
One of this nation’s greatest assets as a place to do business

large international corporations are arranging their affairs to avoid
playing their fair share of tax, Governments and Oppositions—at

George Mudie</B> (Leeds East) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) on securing
this important debate. I want to start by asking why it is necessary to
deal with some of the problems. In an age of austerity, particularly,
every pound matters and every pound not collected means front-line cuts
in operating Departments, such as the Department for Education, the
Home Office and so on. It is important to get all the money in. In this
country, people respect taxpayers and the need to pay tax, but they
demand that the system is fair and
efficient.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000093">The
system is failing in two ways. I do not think, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Glasgow North West (John Robertson) said, that it is a
question of management. People from HMRC have appeared before the
Treasury Committee, and they are largely hard-working and trying to do
their best, but that is difficult because of cuts imposed on the
Department by the last Government and the present one. There is total
disregard for the fact that, when money is cut, 10 times the revenue is
cut. The problem is to face up to
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000094">On
efficiency, the withdrawal of finance affects HMRC’s efficiency
and ordinary people’s perception of how it treats them. The
effect of staff cuts is self-evident and disastrous on a scale that is
totally unacceptable. On paper, it may seem that office cuts involve
just a bit of money and a bit of real estate, but that is not so. For
many people—the elderly, those with complicated problems, or
those who just have trouble filling in forms—in many towns and
regions, offices provide their only chance to meet face to face, and
that is the point. Because of those savings and staff cuts, the
Department is taking the decision for ordinary people that they either
go online, telephone, or write, and they never get a face-to-face
explanation of complicated tax matters. Call centres are fine, but
people do not know who they are talking to. Once people think about
what has been said and want to go back, they are starting the
conversation afresh.</hs_Para>

criticism of the Department and the chief executive that when she went
to the Public Accounts Committee last week, she said that an HMRC
review showed that customers believed a five-minute wait was
acceptable. I do not know of any politician in this Chamber who would
hang on a phone for five minutes to get an answer, especially when it
is an automated answer that goes through information and costs money,
and when people do get through, they are asked the same questions. That
is about efficiency, and it is putting people off. Some money would put
that right.</hs_Para>

have referred to the unfairness in tax avoidance and tax
evasion—and tax evasion by rich people and large multinational
and British companies. In the minute I have left, I would like to put
two questions to the Minister. The first is straightforward. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer put in £174 million for an army of
investigators to deal with such companies. Is that fresh money, or is
it part of the £900 million that was included in the spending
review?</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=16?><hs_Para UID="13020531000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000097">The second
question relates to unfairness. Two and a
half years ago, Christine Lagarde, the head of the International
Monetary Fund, gave the British Government the names and addresses of
2,000 people who had Swiss bank accounts. A number of them—I
think 500—were being looked at for serious fraud. To date, two
years later, only one has been charged. Is that the end of it? With the
Swiss tax deal, is that issue now being dropped, as those people are
being treated under the terms of the tax deal? If so, it would be
totally
unacceptable.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_05_PT_1/8EF096A9B4CD6B5EEF96F9C80BF524608AA0507E" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2013">Tuesday

Public and Commercial Services Union commissioned one of the most
comprehensive calculations of the UK tax gap ever undertaken. The
report, by Tax Research UK, estimated that the tax gap could be as big
as £120 billion a year. I accept that the report was criticised
by tax professionals, Ministers, HMRC and many large companies, but we
have learned since 2010 that that estimate is likely to be more

tax gap? The tax gap includes tax lost to avoidance, which is people
seeking to minimise their tax bill without deliberate deception, but
contrary to the spirit of the law. A good example was seen when tax for
those earning £150,000 a year went up to 50% and some payments
were brought forward, so that people subject to the 50% tax rate did
not pay tax on that amount of money. As we see now, payments such as
bonuses are being paid late, so again, they miss the 50% tax rate. That
is immoral, as I am sure that many in the Chamber would agree, but it
is not illegal. There is also tax lost to evasion, which is the illegal
non-payment and underpayment of taxes by making a false declaration.
Interestingly, that includes not only fraud, but error and neglect,
which I will briefly come on to later. The tax gap also includes late
or non-payment of tax—tax not due or not paid on time.</hs_Para>

tax gap is £35 billion, £120 billion, or somewhere in
between—or, as some of the recent scandals with well known names
show, possibly even higher—it is a heck of a lot money, and it
could make a real difference at this time of austerity and devastation
of public services. All Labour Members will argue that we need to grow
our way out of a recession, and we can see the current consequences of
trying to cut our way out of it, as the triple-dip looms. However,
fundamental to that growth must be the effective collection of tax, and
it seems the closure of local offices does not make financial
sense.</hs_Para>

it is like saying, “I pay VAT when I buy things in shops, and I
pay other taxes.” People who are employed by all of us pay
national insurance, but there is that whole bit of tax that should be
paid, and there are those who are not doing so. As we know, many
individuals and companies manage to avoid paying it, and as has been
said, the tax system is so complicated that it makes it easy and
possible for people to avoid tax. It is wrong, and in my view,

Bloggs of Bolton or Freda Brown of Wigan do not declare all of their

scale or scope of their business when they are not household names?
Local knowledge is invaluable and it is a real asset in ensuring that
the right tax is paid. As other hon. Members have said, it is also an
important service in the local area. It is about assistance so that
people can try to get their tax right, so that they are not evading tax
by error or neglect—unwittingly or unwillingly. They should have

working to build our economy. How can it be right that trying to talk

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Howarth. I join
colleagues in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and
Harlington (John McDonnell) on securing this morning’s extremely
timely and interesting debate. His interest in all matters related to

today’s debate as timely not least because, until very recently,
I had anticipated being briefed this morning by HMRC’s chief
executive in my capacity as 
<?notus-xml column=18?>shadow Exchequer Secretary. Sadly, that meeting was cancelled at short
notice—or was it perhaps prevented from taking place? I could
not comment. In any event, as luck would have it, my hon. Friend
successfully secured this debate, and the Minister will be pleased to
know that many of the issues that I wanted to raise with the chief
executive I will now raise directly with him
instead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000110">What
is clear from the many excellent contributions this morning is the
absolutely crucial function performed by HMRC and its staff. Of course,
HMRC does not just act as the UK’s “credit control
department”. It has a vital role to play in delivering key
Government policies, such as the impending universal credit, to which I
will return. HMRC interacts with most of the UK’s adult
population of 45 million and, indirectly, with their children, as well
as with about 5 million businesses, and its primary function in doing
so is to make our taxation system work. Indeed, without the money that
HMRC collects, there would be no funding to invest in public services.
That is why the capacity and resources that it has to perform its role
are so critical and an ever-more pressing issue in this period of
austerity and growing Government debt—a point that was made
forcefully by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds East (Mr
Mudie).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000111">HMRC
staff can provide a pretty impressive return on investment. We know
that, last year, senior HMRC officials brought in £16.7 billion
over and above that which was returned by businesses and individuals.
Indeed, the Association of Revenue and
Customs—ARC—estimates that a senior tax official, earning
£50,000 a year, can expect to generate an additional yield of at
least £1.5 million a year—a return of 30 times the cost
of their salary. Many hon. Members have referred to the excellent
analysis provided by the PCS of the yield provided by HMRC’s
office in Wick alone. That office is scheduled for closure in this
financial year, as hon. Members have also mentioned. Each member of the
15 staff working in the Wick office in northern Scotland is
responsible for bringing in about £1 million in tax a year. The
total is more than £14.3 million. That compares with the overall
annual salary and rental bill for the office of £494,000. It is
an impressive
return.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000112">Despite
the impression that one may have gained from recent media reports, we
are fortunate to live in a generally tax-compliant country, with 93% of
all tax paid as it should be. However, that figure, which compares well
with those for our trading partners, can be maintained and improved
only if we have a properly resourced HMRC. The Government should be
doing everything within their power to assist HMRC to close the
remaining tax gap, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton West
(Julie Hilling) talked about in some detail. Many hon. Members have
contributed today to give colour to the picture of just how difficult
it will be to close that tax gap in the context in which HMRC currently
operates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000113">As
we are all too aware, HMRC faces budget cuts of £2 billion in
the course of this Parliament. The Minister is likely to mention that
the Government are “reinvesting” more than £900
million in HMRC, but the straight fact is that that is money that the
Treasury had planned to take away from HMRC and is now returning. That
still leaves HMRC with a £2 billion net reduction in resources.
The Prime Minister may claim that HMRC’s staffing levels are
increasing under his Government, but a quick fact check reveals that
HMRC is losing 10,000 staff. It is 
<?notus-xml column=19?>little wonder, therefore, that there are serious concerns that HMRC
staff and resources are being stretched to the absolute limit, and that
situation is likely to get
worse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000114">Indeed,
the National Audit Office report on HMRC’s customer service
performance, published in December, revealed truly worrying findings
about the way in which HMRC handles its customers. A completely
unacceptable 20 million telephone calls to HMRC went unanswered last
year. As other hon. Members have mentioned, the NAO estimated that it
cost customers £33 million in call charges while waiting to
speak to a human being, on top of the estimated £103 million
cost of wasted customer time. That is particularly concerning for those
on low incomes, who literally cannot afford to keep hanging on the
telephone, and for struggling small and medium-sized enterprises, which
could be making far more productive use of their time. The hon. Member
for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field) made a very
passionate plea for small businesses in his contribution to the debate,
and I agreed with much of what he
said.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000115">It
is therefore welcome that HMRC appears to be improving its performance
in that area, but I am sure that the Minister would acknowledge the
Public Accounts Committee’s conclusion that that is from a very
low base, with targets far below industry standards. I urge him to
ensure that the recently announced move away from 0845 numbers will
benefit people on low incomes, who often use pay-as-you-go mobile
phones rather than mobile contracts or
landlines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000116">We
also heard the truly staggering statement by HMRC’s chief
executive at a Public Accounts Committee session just last month that
the agency currently has about 100,000 unanswered letters, although

year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000117">It
is not just the NAO and the PAC that believe that HMRC is creaking at
the edges. A survey by the Chartered Institute of Taxation of its
members in the summer of 2012 found significant concerns regarding
customer service provided by HMRC, including: delays in post handling;
telephone calls that are passed to a customer service centre, resulting
in a four-to-six week further delay; increases in basic errors; and
delays in getting through to PAYE telephone
lines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000118">A
similar survey by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales found that HMRC is often failing to meet its “basic
responsibilities”, with phone calls and letters frequently going
unanswered and staff often lacking the knowledge and training to handle
complex inquiries. That is not just an inconvenience for taxpayers;
mistakes by HMRC can be very costly and can make all the difference to
a struggling SME or a struggling family. Every hour spent on hold to
HMRC is holding back our economic growth, and that is at a time when
the Government are relying on SMEs to dig us out of this economic
stagnation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000119">Of
course, the situation is not helped by a Government who simply do not
seem to think through how their policies will be delivered on the
ground. The debacle over the changes to child benefit, which came into
force last month, has seen 475 staff drafted in to deal with that
policy at a cost of £11.7 million and an additional 
<?notus-xml column=20?>500,000 taxpayers being drawn into the complex self-assessment regime. I
would therefore be grateful if the Minister confirmed from which areas
of work those  475 staff have been taken in order to implement
that ill-thought-through policy. What assessment has been made of the
impact on what would be their usual
work?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000120">Will
the Minister also give us some clarity this morning on progress in
relation to the real time information system? He is well aware of the
concerns of small businesses about the huge financial and
administrative burden that that will place on them at what is already
an extremely challenging time. It is extremely worrying, given that the
functioning of universal credit will depend on that system functioning
properly, that answers to recent written parliamentary questions
suggest that the IT system matching employers with their bank records
in the RTI pilot has a current failure rate of 25%. Will the Minister
outline whether the success rate has improved in recent weeks? Can he
provide us with some reassurance that he is confident that real time

area in which the Government have been making themselves look extremely
busy of late is that of initiatives to tackle tax avoidance. The
Chancellor’s announcement ahead of the autumn statement of
£77 million of “new” funding for HMRC to expand
anti-avoidance and  evasion activity is welcome. However, the
Minister must acknowledge that that does not come close to the
£2 billion of swingeing cuts that HMRC faces. I have
asked him this question before, and my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds
East asked it again this morning: can he clarify whether that is indeed
new funding or whether it just represents funding being shifted from
one area of HMRC to another? If it is the latter, what assessment has
been made of the revenue that will be lost from elsewhere as a result
of reduced resource and
capacity?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000123">Time
is limited, so the final key concern about HMRC capacity and resources
that I will raise this morning—the case has been made powerfully
by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington—is about
the staff. Many concerns have been expressed about the number of highly
skilled, experienced staff who have left HMRC. The Association of
Revenue and Customs describes it as a “demographic time
bomb”. I understand that more than half of HMRC’s work
force are over the age of 45 and 18% are over 55. I have nothing
against older employees, but there are genuine concerns about future
work force planning and the ability of HMRC to deliver on some of the
Government’s
priorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000124">HMRC
is being asked to deliver ever-more complex taxation legislation, to
deliver what have been described as “undeliverable”
Treasury policies, to close the tax gap and to improve dramatically its
customer service—all while receiving £2 billion less in
funding and operating with 10,000 fewer staff. Nobody disputes that
efficiencies need to be made—every part of the public sector
needs to make them and HMRC does not expect to be immune from that
requirement—but it has already made hugely significant savings
over recent years, including under the previous Government, so I urge
the Minister to accept that there must be a limit to HMRC’s
capacity  to do more with
less.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_05_PT_1/A6EE102129D354FC8726323CB8AA81DDEB0A5819" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2013">Tuesday

Members will know, HMRC was formed a little under eight years ago by
the merger of Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue. At that time,
it was made up of around 100,000 staff. The previous Government sought
efficiencies and, as a result, staff numbers fell by around 25,000
between 2005 and 2010. As part of that process, the number of staff
engaged in compliance work also fell each year, and by 2010, about
10,000 staff had been lost in those important revenue-raising
areas.</hs_Para>

part of this Government’s first spending review, it was crucial
that we recognised the dual role that HMRC would play in contributing
to deficit reduction, through both cost reductions and, more
significantly, collecting additional revenue by tackling tax avoidance
and evasion—a point that several hon. Members raised this
morning. Our priority was to ensure that HMRC delivered a service that
would provide the best possible value for money to taxpayers.
Consequently, we required HMRC to make 25% efficiencies to reduce its
costs. We then agreed to reinvest a proportion of those efficiencies to
tackle avoidance and evasion. The result was a net impact of overall
savings over the spending review period of about 16% and a net
reduction in overall staff numbers of about 10,000. I say
“net” because in that figure is an actual increase of
about 2,500 in the number of staff HMRC deployed on its compliance
activities over the

HMRC has proceeded. Time prevents me from running through in detail all
the areas in which there have been savings, but it is worth pointing
out that there have been significant savings of £74
million in the price paid for IT equipment and services, and savings in

rather than inputs. As it happens, the number of staff working in
compliance and enforcement is going up under this Government—a

reinvestment of efficiencies involves £917 million over the

cumulatively, over the spending review period, HMRC will bring in about
£20 billion of additional revenues, and an additional
£7 billion every year thereafter. Additional revenues

increase its efforts to tackle tax avoidance and evasion, through
improving HMRC’s computerised risking systems; further
strengthening the risk assessment capability across the large business
sector; increasing the attention given to offshore evasion and
avoidance, and—probably of most interest to hon. Members
here—increasing the staff employed to target avoidance and
evasion by the
wealthy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000138">Secondly,
in the autumn statement, we invested a further amount, totalling
£77 million, to accelerate HMRC’s debt collection
activities and bring in about  £1 billion in tax over
the period; reduce tax credit error and fraud and reduce losses by
about £0.5 billion,  and expand HMRC’s digital
service to its customers, which will include help to small businesses
as part of our initiatives to introduce growth into the small and
medium-sized enterprise sector. My hon. Friend the Member for Cities of
London and Westminster (Mark Field) is right when he says that we want
to do everything we can to ensure that the burden on small businesses
can be reduced and that it is easier to deal with HMRC.</hs_Para>

whole, the investment package will mean that HMRC will collect an
additional £2 billion in 2014-15. That is over and above the
£7 billion in additional revenue that HMRC will collect in that
year as a result of the spending review settlement in 2010. On top of 
<?notus-xml column=23?>that, our investment in digital will allow HMRC to offer a modernised

Government have recognised the crucial role that HMRC has played, and
will continue to play, in helping manage the deficit we inherited. It
is bringing in more additional revenues than ever before, and that is
not the only area where HMRC is delivering well. The latest performance
figures, from December 2012, show that post handling in local offices
is the best it has been since HMRC was formed, with about 90% cleared
within 15 days of receipt in recent months. The hon. Member
for Newcastle upon Tyne North highlighted press reports saying that
100,000 items of post have not been dealt with, but that must be put in
the context of HMRC’s receiving 200,000 items of post every
week. We are talking about post that has by and large arrived in the
past two or three days.</hs_Para>

self-assessment filing system is a clear success: 92.9% of
self-assessment tax returns for 2011-12 were filed on time this
year—the best result since HMRC was created—and 82.5% of
those returns were filed online, which is a new record. We are all
aware of the difficulties that HMRC faced a few years ago in handling
the fallout from the new computer system, but such difficulties are now
behind it and it is on track to bring PAYE up to date by March 2013. We
are also taking steps to improve automation.</hs_Para>

to say more, but it is sadly not possible to do so today in the time
available. I apologise to hon. Members for not being able to address
every question that has been asked. We appreciate what the taxpayer
wants from HMRC. We want to raise revenue and reduce the tax gap. We
are giving HMRC the resources to do precisely that. I will continue to
work with HMRC to ensure that it continues to provide the best possible
value for money for the taxpaying

represent a community in shock, reeling from the suddenly announced
intention to transfer Furness general hospital’s beloved special
care baby unit and consultant maternity services out of the county,
from 9 o’clock this morning, to Lancaster. Pleas to rethink that
emergency transfer have so far been rebuffed, leaving expectant mums
distraught at the prospect of a 50-mile trip in the back of ambulance
if they suffer complications in labour. I will set out our concerns in
detail and stress the areas in which we hope the Minister, who is of
course an expert in the field, will agree to intervene, but first I

significant budget reductions across the University Hospitals of

emergency provision across more than one site in the

is also the campaign against the removal of  A and E, maternity
and intensive care units at Royal Lancaster infirmary, on which the
Downing street petition in the name of Matthew Hood already has
thousands of signatures. I think that my constituency neighbour, the
hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) wants to do
exactly that—move Lancaster’s  A and E department
to the Westmorland general hospital. Let me simply say that any attempt
to question Barrow’s need for an A and E department would be met
with horror not only by every single resident of the Furness area, but
by the prized and highly regulated industries on which the nation
depends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000147">The
broader question facing the Morecambe Bay trust is how best to locate
services when the population is far more spread out than in most areas
of Britain, and when centres of population are often connected by a
single road that winds through Cumbria’s unique landscape. In
other areas, a trust for hundreds of thousands of residents might
naturally be based around one A and E department
and one maternity unit, but that would put an unacceptable strain on
residents of Morecambe bay. People in pockets of severe deprivation in
Barrow and families who, for whatever reason, just do not travel would
be forced to go to another county and be completely cut off from their
families. In an emergency, it would result in journey times of more
than an hour on routes that are prone to become blocked by
breakdowns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000148">I
want to ask the Minister four questions about the four tests in the
Government’s forthcoming consultation. His first test is the
evidence base. Will he ensure that the options and risks are properly
weighed, so that the risks inherent in long-distance ambulance travel
are set alongside what might otherwise be the optimal configuration of
services? The second test is whether there is the support of GP
commissioners. The past 24 hours have shown the damaging
shambles that can occur when a trust attempts to press on
against the will of local commissioners. The 
<?notus-xml column=25?>Government back the new system, so will the Minister ensure that local
GPs have the teeth to insist on the services that communities
need? The third test is choice for patients. Will
the Minister ensure that problems of isolation and lack of access to
services are an integral part of the assessment when it arrives on the
Secretary of State’s desk? It is hard to imagine the test of
choice being passed if, for example, an isolated peninsula’s
only consultant-led maternity unit were downgraded. The fourth test is
strengthened public engagement. The trust needs to do much better than
the mess of the past few days, which has left women desperately worried
and confused. I shall say more on that in a moment, but the underlying
point is that engaging means listening and acting. Of course, health
professionals have a duty to present the options and a proper
assessment of safety in each case, but if the public weigh that up and
say that they want to keep the services they need close to home, the
Government should listen to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000149">Another
major issue is the need for Ministers to ensure that our local

trigger sufficient improvements, despite laying bare shortcomings in

trust’s commitment to an independently chaired but internally

sufficient to give confidence and ensure that lessons are learned, not
only in this individual hospital, but in the entire NHS. Most of all, I

me deal first with the shambolic process that has left expectant women
unsure about where they can give birth—even now, as we speak,
two hours after the transfer was due to take place—because of
genuine fears about a lack of ambulance cover. The decision was taken
unilaterally by the trust, with no consultation or warning given to the
public, the obstetric consultants who work at Furness general, or the
GPs responsible for commissioning the services. The option of
transferring staff from the Royal Lancaster infirmary was not put to
the board. Although there can be no doubt that staffing levels are low
at Furness general, there was no detailed risk assessment of the
dangers of transferring mums in labour by ambulance. Most alarmingly,
no attempt was made to engage the North West ambulance
service—this was confirmed to me by the service last
night—until last Wednesday evening, leaving that organisation
unable to find the extra unit that it estimates will be necessary to
cope with the increased demand on an already stretched operation. This
is an appalling and potentially dangerous shambles that has greatly
increased the anxiety of pregnant women in my constituency, on top of
the worry they already felt at the news, during what is naturally one
of the most worrying times in their life
anyway.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000159">Will
the Minister intervene personally to impose order on the chaos? Will he
confirm that the regional health authority’s gold command is

we have the best chance of getting the services we need back as soon as
possible? Let me be clear: families in my constituency and beyond will
be devastated if we lose 
<?notus-xml column=27?>consultant-led maternity services permanently. The Minister is a
practising obstetrician and will know better than I that the removal of
the clinician-led special care baby unit will result in women who
expect complicated deliveries or who experience complications during
birth facing a transfer to Lancaster, involving a journey time of about
one hour along a road that, less than a fortnight ago, became almost
impassable due to heavy snow—in fact, journeys between Barrow
and Lancaster were taking up to 10 hours. Trying to transfer a mother

has been suggested that air ambulances could be used to speed up
transfer times in the event of Furness general hospital’s
maternity unit being downgraded, but serious questions need to be

lives each year, but it has just three helicopters to cover not only

Morris</B> (Morecambe and Lunesdale) (Con):</Member> I thank you for
calling me in this debate, Mr Howarth, as it is one that will be
closely watched in my constituency. For some weeks, the local press has
been awash with allegations about both maternity and accident and
emergency services at our NHS trust. I am concerned not about services
changing but about the scare stories surrounding the matter. I have a
letter from the chief executive of the trust that confirms that it will
not shut the A and E at Royal Lancaster infirmary. The Minister also
has this letter, but I will quote from
it:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13020531000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000200">“The
A and E at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary serves the population of
Lancaster and surrounding areas and treats in the region of 50,000
people each year. Whilst it would be wrong of me to second guess the
future, I personally find it hard to imagine Lancaster not having
emergency services. Let me be clear, we do not have any plans to shut
the Accident and Emergency department in Lancaster. We are deeply
concerned that these continual rumours are undermining confidence and
frightening the public. We will continue to work with the public, staff
and stakeholders to better understand the review of services to help
allay these
concerns.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13020531000167" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000167">Jackie
Daniel, the CEO of the trust, is saying there that not only does she
have no plans to close the A and E, but she cannot even imagine a
scenario in which anyone would close it, not least because it serves
50,000 people a
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000168">However,
a concerted Labour campaign has been mounted by local party members who
actually work in the NHS to make people believe that the A and E is
likely to close. The campaign involves press briefings, an online
petition, a Facebook group and even people walking round the centre of
Morecambe with clipboards inviting people to join. I want the
e-petition removed from Directgov and have written to the Cabinet
Secretary to ask for him to intervene. We cannot have this dishonest
campaign fought through the Directgov e-petition platform. If the A and
E is not under threat, it must be concluded that Labour is frightening
people for its own political advantage, which is morally
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000169">It
is perhaps time to admit the truth: the trust is getting better under
this Government. A new and better management was brought in by the
previous Secretary of State for Health. A new minor injuries unit
was opened in my constituency by the Minister only a few
weeks ago. A new health centre in Heysham, costing
£20 million, was opened last year. We have four new wards
just opened. All of that was paid for by the 2.8% increase
in funding for the NHS.</hs_Para>

pay tribute to the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)
for his advocacy on the behalf of his constituents and all those in
Cumbria who are looked after by the local trust and to my hon. Friend
the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (David Morris), whose
constituency I recently had the pleasure of visiting, for his advocacy
on the behalf of his 
<?notus-xml column=29?>constituents. I have indeed received a copy of the letter sent to him by
the chief executive of the NHS trust, which
says:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13020531000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000201">“Whilst

the main issues raised in the debate, I have already paid tribute to
the strong advocacy on behalf of his constituents by the hon. Member
for Barrow and Furness. He was very kind to brand me an expert in
obstetrics. I would not go quite that far, but he is right to say
that  I have considerable understanding of the issues involved
and of the importance of ensuring that we provide safe and comfortable
environments in which women can give birth. He is also right to read
out the case that I advocated in a debate here in Westminster Hall some
time ago, and it is important that we recognise that uncomplicated
deliveries can become more complicated. We know that for women in some
parts of the country, particularly those in more deprived areas, there
are often higher risk rates of prematurity. These are all issues that
need to be taken fully into account whenever services for the safe
delivery of babies, and for the safe care of women during pregnancy,
delivery and the period afterwards, are
examined.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000175">The
hon. Gentleman is also right to highlight that there are geographical
considerations in Cumbria, as in many rural areas, including the fact
that there is only one main road and the problems that presents in
respect of allowing the local trust to transfer patients effectively
and safely from one site to another. It potentially creates
difficulties at certain times of day if the road is busy, as he is
aware. However, it also requires the availability of ambulances, and he
was right to point that out.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020531000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000176">When
decisions are made about changing services, whatever the reason may be
for changing them, they cannot be taken in isolation. In this
case––I will discuss this further later––I
believe that the decision was made in good faith, although I share some
of the concerns that the hon. Gentleman raised, given that we know that
there have been a lot of problems at the trust with maternity services
as well as the safety concerns he outlined. Those decisions cannot be
taken in isolation. They need to be taken in collaboration and after
discussion with local commissioners and indeed with the ambulance
service, if they are to be made correctly and for the benefit of
patients.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020531000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000177">The hon.
Gentleman was also right to outline the four tests for reconfiguration.
In particular, he was right that reconfiguration must be clinically
led, based upon evidence and always in the best interests of patients.
Reconfiguration should never happen for cost reasons alone, and he was
absolutely right to highlight that. Reconfiguration also needs to have
the support of local GP commissioners. However, from what he has said
today it appears that there are local concerns about the proposed
changes, and that there has not been an integrated, joined-up approach
in relation to this
decision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000178">We
have also discussed the concerns over the need to integrate ambulance
transfers into any local decisions because of the travelling distance
from Barrow to Lancaster. That is one of the issues that should have
been take into account when these decisions about reconfiguration were
being made, and I am very concerned to hear the  
<?notus-xml column=30?>hon. Gentleman say that he does not believe that they were taken into
account and that local commissioners also have concerns about this
matter.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020531000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000179">I am very
happy to meet the hon. Gentleman again in the very near future to
discuss this; that would be very desirable. It is vital to ensure, as
the hon. Member for Copeland (Mr Reed) said, that we do not see service
reconfiguration by stealth or via the back door. We should have an
integrated, joined-up approach to local decision making, particularly
in view of what can only be described as the deficiencies of the past
at the trust and the very sad cases that the hon. Member for Barrow and
Furness and I have corresponded about, as well as the police
investigations that are going on. He is aware that it would be
inappropriate for me to directly comment on those.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020531000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000180">There is a
need to ensure that in the future decisions are made in a holistic way
and in the best interests of patient safety. Such decisions are not
just for the trust to make alone but must be made in conjunction with
the local commissioners and the ambulance service, if we want to ensure
patient safety. The hon. Gentleman and I can discuss that further when
we meet.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020531000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000181">The hon.
Gentleman raised another important issue: the ongoing investigations at
the trust. He was right to do so. As we know, tomorrow the Mid
Staffordshire report will be published, which makes these sorts of
issues all the more poignant and important. The NHS has sometimes had a
history of covering up bad things that have happened to patients, and
that is completely unacceptable. The result of that is bad care for
patients, and cultural problems in trusts and hospitals. Those sorts of
things cannot go on. When there are investigations, they need to be
carried out transparently and openly, so that people feel the issues
have been fully aired. It is also vital that those investigations have
a degree of independence, as he suggested.</hs_Para>

Woodcock:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for giving way, and for the
excellent and considered way that he is responding to my points. He
referred to the Mid Staffordshire situation. Does he accept that that
started as an internal inquiry, which was found to be insufficient to
get to the bottom of the issues and required a greater degree of
independence to be established? We are worried that the same thing may
be apparent in Furness.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020531000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000183"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Poulter" PimsId="5522" UID="13020531000258" xid="1024" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000258">Dr
Poulter:</Member></B> Absolutely. There will be a full response to the
Mid Staffordshire inquiry tomorrow, so I will not pre-empt it or go
into detailed discussion of that issue. However, it is absolutely right
that we must encourage staff who have concerns about patient care to
raise those concerns and air them in an open way. Moreover, when we
know that there have been long-standing failings at a trust about the
quality of care provided to patients and concerns raised about those
failings—although Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, for
example, has made some good progress in recent months, there are some
long-standing issues there—it is important that, when an
investigation is carried out, it is carried out in a transparent, open
and independent way; there must be a great degree of independence
involved.</hs_Para>

sees fit to launch an investigation and a review of what has happened,
it is important that the investigation and review pass the test of
transparency. There may well be a role for local MPs and other 
<?notus-xml column=31?>interested parties in that process, and when the hon. Member for Barrow
and Furness and I meet, that is an issue that I will be very keen to
discuss further, to ensure that we can discuss with the local trust
ways in which we can ensure that there is that transparency and
independence in the process. That is very important to ensure that
those patients, and their families who have had problems in the
past—in some cases, there have been deaths at the
trust—feel that the investigation addresses their
allegations.</hs_Para>

this debate is not just about maternity services at the Morecambe Bay
NHS Foundation Trust; there have been other issues around the trust,
and any investigation will need to take account of all those issues. I
understand that that is what will happen.</hs_Para>

Jamie Reed:</Member></B> I am very grateful to the Minister for his
considered and thoughtful response to the debate. I agree with him
wholeheartedly on the importance of transparency and openness. However,
where there are different clinical commissioning groups commissioning
services from a single trust that operates a number of different
hospitals, who actually holds the ring and decides which services are
commissioned
where?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020531000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000187"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Poulter" PimsId="5522" UID="13020531000260" xid="1024" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020531000260">Dr
Poulter:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman asks a very good and
thoughtful question. It is the duty of the commissioning groups to work
collaboratively for the best interests of patients. They obviously have
responsibility for their own budgets and, as I say, they all ought to
work collaboratively for the benefit of patients. However, if there are
concerns about that, there is also a role in  this process for
the commissioning board, which will have some oversight over the
process, to help to ease it 
<?notus-xml column=32?>through. In many parts of the country, there is already good evidence
that the emerging local commissioning groups are working together
collaboratively in just the way that I have described. I hope that that
is reassuring for the hon. Gentleman.</hs_Para>

the Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust has had a very long and troubled
history. We also know that it serves a very important purpose in
looking after people throughout north Lancashire and Cumbria. My hon.
Friend the Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Eric Ollerenshaw) made
clearly the good point that the configuration of the trust
geographically is challenging. We, as a group, are going to meet
together to talk through some of these issues and the troubled history
of the trust, to ensure that we can do our best to work through these
issues.</hs_Para>

been problems in the past with the trust and local patients have not
been treated properly, and they and their families have suffered. There
have been long-standing concerns over local care quality issues. That
may mean that we have to redesign the way that services are delivered;
that may be an inevitable consequence of improving patient care in the
long run. Nevertheless, the driver of this process must be delivering
high-quality local health care within the envelope of providing
improved patient care with better outcomes and safer care, for
patients. However, the only way that we will achieve that is if all the
commissioners are working collaboratively with the trust in a more
integrated approach to care. The failure to do that is where things
have gone wrong in the past, and that is what needs to change in the
future.</hs_Para>

said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13020535000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020535000144">“We
worked to reduce the use of animals in scientific research through a
science-led programme headed by the National Centre for the
Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research. However,

the number of such experiments has risen further, to its highest level
since records began, my concern is that the use of the past tense in
that sentence could be interpreted to imply that the Government have
given up their attempt to reduce numbers. If not—and I sincerely
hope that the Government have not given up that attempt—what new
steps will be taken and when do the Government expect a visible
impact?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020535000011">The
number of animals currently being used in experiments in Great
Britain—of course, Northern Ireland has a separate
system—is the highest since 1986, when statistics were
comprehensively collected for the first time following the introduction
of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. According to Home Office
statistics published in July 2012, in 2011 there were
3,710,621 animals used in 3,792,857 procedures in Great
Britain. That represents an increase of 1.9% on the 2010
figures. Procedures were performed on particular species, including
1,459 primates, 11,844 rabbits, 11,514 guinea pigs, 2,865
dogs, and 161,733 birds. Of those experiments, only 13% were directly
related to human health. Some 
<?notus-xml column=34?>of the non-medical experiments included: the use of 3,524 animals to
test food additives; the use of 541 animals to test the
effects of alcohol; the use of 13,676 animals in experiments examining
the effects of pollution; and the use of 22,785 animals in experiments
relating to agriculture. More than half the animal experiments in 2011
were carried out on animals that had been genetically altered, and many
such animals are killed before they are even used because they do not
show the correct
characteristics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020535000012">The
second issue that I will raise is the testing of household products on
animals. The Government have recently announced their guide for licence
holders on the operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act

procedures should be recorded under this heading are taken on a case by

statement that there were no tests of this nature in 2011 leads me to
believe that the ban would only cover finished products, rather than
also covering ingredients. I believe that would seriously undermine the
ban, as the vast majority of testing for household products involves
testing of ingredients. Indeed, as much was admitted in response to
another parliamentary question, which was answered on 28 March 2011 by

fourth point that I will raise is the Government’s
implementation of the requirements of European directive 2010/63 on 1
January. Most of the UK controls, which are of a higher standard than
those in many other EU countries, will remain in place. However, as
some features may be slightly different, it will be some time before it
is clear how the changes will affect animals. Nevertheless, there are
some ongoing concerns.</hs_Para>

transposing the new European directive into UK law, while existing UK
standards are retained where they are higher than those set out in the
directive, a key concern is how the legislation will be interpreted in
practice. The draft guidance, which has now been released for
consultation, needs to be unequivocal, to ensure that UK standards are
retained.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020535000022">The
revised legislation includes a move to transfer more responsibility for
its implementation from central to local control at individual
establishment level. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals believes that the Home Office must have a robust programme in
place to ensure good practice, to identify shortcomings within
establishments and, where needed, to have proper sanctions. It will
also be important for establishments to maintain a strong and effective
local animal welfare and ethical review body, so that each
establishment can ensure compliance with the law and with good
practice. The new body replaces the local ethical review process, which
progressed well over its 12 years and had widespread support.
Indeed, the RSPCA has developed guidelines on best practice for the
ethical review process, which should form the basis of the new
body’s
roles.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020535000023">The
Home Office has chosen to retain the personal licence system, but the
content of the proposed new licence has been considerably reduced and
now, I fear, contains inadequate detail. The proposed new licence
removes much of the detail from the previous licence, and places
greater emphasis on an individual’s training and competency
record. Potential licensees will have to specify only the broad
categories of animals and experimental techniques they want to use,
whereas the previous licence required a detailed list of techniques,
along with details of the species and the stage of development of the
animals to be used. The information will now be held in a training and

inconsistencies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020535000024"><Member ContinuationText="Angela Smith" PimsId="4808" UID="13020535000166" xid="886" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0001.htm#13020535000166"><B>Angela

sourced from outside the EU. A recent British Union Against Vivisection
investigation found that a breeding centre in Mauritius was killing
monkeys that were not of the

the new regulations, especially those relating to ethical consideration
of whether and how animals are used. A third important step would be
better implementation of the three R’s—the replacement of
animals with humane alternatives, a reduction in animal use, and
refinement to reduce suffering and improve welfare. Fourthly, it is
important to have an effective system that ensures that all persons

fifth step would be to introduce more transparency into the system by
repealing section 24 of the 1986 Act, which enables information about
animal experiments to remain secret. Other steps would be to set a
detailed timetable for the ending of all research not for medical
purposes, which could reduce the number of experiments by an estimated
87%, and to ban the most severe experiments allowed by the new European
directive. In transposing the new directive, the Government have,
unfortunately, yet to rule out those aspects, which means that animals
could, for example, be subjected to repeated electric shock treatment
to induce a state of learned helplessness or be forced to do exercise
until they suffered from exhaustion. Although the transposition is now
complete, the Government still have time to issue a policy statement
making it clear that no project licences will be granted for such

testing is the one such area in which I think most people would support
that kind of lobbying work. Indeed, public opinion polls show that the

those things that, if asked, people are very much against, but they
struggle as consumers to put that into practice. People like me might
spend ages looking at all the labels on everything—the Leaping
Bunny logo is useful if people are trying to find a product that has
not been tested on animals anywhere through the supply chain—but
many others are misled by products such as Herbal Essences. People
think that because something has “herbal” or
“natural” in its name, all the ingredients must be
derived from the plant world with no chemicals. They also extrapolate
that those products are humane and

many other public sector bodies. Will the Minister tell us whether the

documentation to ensure that batches are compliant. Not only would that
act as a deterrent to companies that might want to chance their arm,
but it would uncover anything before it reached the market. When we
consider the way in which the recent horsemeat situation came to light,
everyone would agree that we should not find out after the event that
something such as horsemeat has entered the food chain; we want to stop

couple of questions for the Minister. The recent legislation carrying
forward the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 came into force in
January 2013. It requires that alternative non-animal research
techniques be used in medical research if available. Researchers must
ensure that, wherever possible, a scientifically satisfactory method or
testing strategy not entailing the use of live animals should be used,
and the number of animals used in projects should be reduced to a
minimum. How will scientists know whether a non-animal alternative
method is available, given that no central database currently exists?
Without such a resource, how will the Home Office be able to monitor
compliance properly or encourage the promotion of
alternatives?</hs_Para>

duplication. Currently, researchers have no way of knowing the results
of previous experiments 
<?notus-xml column=41?>involving animals. An experiment at Cardiff university, for example,
which involved sewing up the eyelids of newborn kittens had already
been done elsewhere; it had turned out to be fruitless in finding a
cure for lazy eye in children. Has the Home Office assessed the
feasibility of introducing a central database that licence holders
would have to search before submitting a project application? I
understand that it has been discussed recently at European level in
working groups, but that no progress was made. Why, and what steps will
the Minister commit to take to help those discussions

partly that results of some research are not publicly disseminated, but
there is also an issue of commercial confidentiality where products for
sale are involved. People do not want to reveal in what direction their
thoughts are headed, in case someone steals their research and comes up
with a similar product. They do not want to give their rivals a
commercial advantage. I can see why drug companies, for example, would

the codes of practice. Although we have not seen all the regulations, I

the directive will come into force under this Government, it is the
result of 10 years’ work, much of which was done by the previous
Labour Government and our MEPs, who were instrumental in strengthening
the animal welfare provisions in the European Parliament so that all EU
countries have the same basic standards of animal welfare for the first
time. That will not only protect animals from unnecessary suffering,
but prevent UK bioscience jobs from going to other EU countries, thus
ensuring that one of our most important sectors remains competitive
with its rivals around the world.</hs_Para>

essential that the Government’s policy on animal experimentation
continues to strike the right balance. As Members have said, it is
vital that we keep a watchful eye on the number of experiments being
conducted. The Labour party supports the coalition agreement to reduce
the number of experiments conducted on animals, and we want to ensure
that the Government stick to their pledge. As Members will be aware,
the number of experiments involving animals has been steadily rising
for a number of years, reaching a 25-year high in 2011.</hs_Para>

Front-Bench team are as concerned about the issue as we were when my
hon. Friend the 
<?notus-xml column=44?>Member for Kingston upon Hull North raised it towards the end of last
year. Clearly, the Government need to examine the issue and to get to
grips with the numbers as quickly as possible. As with any other issue,
Governments are judged on what they say and what they deliver, and this
issue should be no different. The Government need to work with the
bioscience industry to ensure that progress is made.</hs_Para>

Front-Bench team’s other concern, which the hon. Member for
Crawley also raised, is the fall in the number of laboratory
inspections and the closure of regional inspection offices. The Labour
party’s stance on the issue remains the same. The UK has some of
the world’s highest animal welfare standards, but the number of
inspections has fallen, while regional inspection offices have been
closing. We have understandable concerns about how the Government
expect to implement those closures without compromising the quality of
inspections and animal welfare standards. The public, campaign groups,
animal rights groups and the Labour party expect the Government to
ensure policy is strictly enforced.</hs_Para>

am pleased that colleagues have given me time to elaborate at length on
all the points raised by my hon. Friend and other Members, including,
in particular, the hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy).
First, however, I will set out a bit of context. I can do that because

of both coalition parties—I think it is shared on both sides of

it is essential and when there is no alternative. That is, indeed,
Government policy, and it was the policy of the previous
Government.</hs_Para>

Members, including my hon. Friend, said, our current
legislation—the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act
1986—has recently been revised to transpose European directive
2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used 
<?notus-xml column=45?>for scientific purposes. There were two key objectives in the new
directive. One was to strengthen the protection of animals used in
scientific procedures, and the other was to promote the 3
R’s—strategies that replace, reduce and refine the use of
animals in scientific procedures. The hon. Member for Bristol East
asked about an academic post in that regard, and I will come to that in
a little while.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020535000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000084">The
Government have fully embraced those aims in transposing the directive.
The amended Act provides a high level of protection for animals. As
several Members have made clear, work cannot be licensed if it could be
carried out without using animals. The procedures must also cause the
minimum possible suffering to the smallest number of animals of the
lowest sensitivity.</hs_Para>

the opportunity to place in the legislation absolute bans on the use of
great apes and stray animals of domestic species. We have retained
stricter United Kingdom standards, which provide for: special
protection for cats, dogs and horses, in addition to non-human
primates; protection for immature forms of birds and reptiles; larger
enclosure and cage sizes for dogs and a number of other species; and
more humane methods of killing animals. Those measures are necessary
and justified on animal welfare grounds and to maintain public
confidence that animals used in experiments and testing will continue
to be properly
protected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000086">At
the same time, animal experiments continue, at the moment, to be
necessary if improvements in health care are to be developed with the
minimum of delay. It is a fact that our national health service would
be unable to function effectively were it not for the availability of
medicines and treatments that have been developed and tested through
research using animals. Almost every form of conventional medical
treatment has relied in part on the study of animals. That includes
asthma treatments and medicines for ulcers, schizophrenia  and
depression, polio vaccine, and kidney dialysis and
transplants—those are just a few
examples.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000087">While
we accept that animal experiments are effective and necessary, they
should be used only when the benefits have been carefully weighed
against the costs to the animals; when there is no other way of
achieving the desired result; when the procedures applied to the
animals will cause the least suffering possible; when the minimum
number of animals will be used to achieve the outcome; and when high
standards of animal welfare are applied. That approach closely reflects
what the public want. They understand the necessity and importance of
using animal experiments in some areas, but they want the number of
such experiments to be the minimum necessary.</hs_Para>

Harper:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. There is
sometimes a caricature of those involved in research. If they had
alternatives to using animals, they would implement them; they use
animals because there are not currently alternatives in all cases. My
hon. Friend puts his finger on the issue: the use of animals for
experiments, particularly in a country such as the UK, which has high
standards, is expensive. Companies 
<?notus-xml column=46?>use animals only because there are not more effective remedies. Also,
they are conscious that they could develop effective
alternatives that would also be more
cost-effective. However costly—in several senses—animal
experiments are, if there are no alternatives, those cannot be used;
but many pressures are pushing researchers towards the use of
alternatives when they are available, and that is welcome to all of us,
including my hon.
Friend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000090">We
also accept that regulation must not be overly bureaucratic, so we have
made some small but important changes, allowing us to simplify the
detail required in personal licences and the way we process
applications for them. Another important change in the revised Act is
the requirement placed on member states to collect and publish
statistical information, on not just the number of animals used, but
the severity of the procedures applied to them. Publication of
information about the experience of the animals will be an advance in
transparency. Combined with the mandatory requirement to publish
non-technical summaries of authorised projects, that will help to
inform the parliamentary and public debate

Harper:</Member></B> The hon. Lady raises an important issue. This may
be a good time to pick up on the point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Crawley about section 24 of the 1986 Act, which, as he said,
currently prohibits the disclosure by Home Office Ministers and
officials, other than in their discharge of functions under the Act, of
confidential information about the use of animals in scientific
procedures. There are two reasons for the provision. One relates to the
hon. Lady’s point, and covers information that might put
individuals at risk from those people who sadly are not content with
democratic decision making and debate, but choose to use
violence—something that we in the House would all abhor. In
addition, the provision protects intellectual property. I think that I
can say a little more on that than my hon. Friend did.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020535000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000093">The
Government agree that section 24 is not framed satisfactorily. There is
little room for manoeuvre, and it acts somewhat as a blanket ban on
disclosing information. It can, for example, make it difficult for Home
Office inspectors to share good practice between establishments. The
hon. Lady raised that, and so did my hon. Friend the Member for
Crawley. The problem is that clear consensus about what we should do
did not emerge in the recent public consultation on the transposition
of the European directive—whether we should repeal the section
or change it in some way. There was a range of views, and we wanted, as
my hon. Friend said, to give it further thought. As to a
timetable—I think that is what he was after—I can be a
bit more specific. We are doing that work now, over the next six
months, and aim to report our conclusions to Parliament before the
House rises for the summer. I hope that that gives some reassuring
firmness to the timetable.</hs_Para>

was that many of the people who responded to the consultation did not
like the status quo, but there was no really clear sense of what to
replace it with. We 
<?notus-xml column=47?>must be mindful of the two issues I raised:
intellectual property, which it is legitimate for researchers to
protect; and the extent to which we need to protect those involved in
important work. Changes to the regime for animal welfare should be made
by Parliament, after legitimate public debate. They should not happen
because people take it on themselves to try to drive out of business
through intimidation and violence those who conduct lawful work. Those
are the things that we shall be thinking through: being as open as
possible, but with those two constraints. I hope that that is helpful,
and that that approach is widely shared in the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000095">It
is probably worth picking up the point about statistics, which my hon.
Friend the Member for Crawley and several other hon. Members raised. He
is correct to say that the latest statistics, for 2011, showed that the
number of animals used in experiments and testing was higher than it
had been for some years. It was not the highest ever number. The high
point was reached in statistics produced under the Cruelty to Animals
Act 1876, which preceded the current legislation: in the 1970s about 5
million animals were used. Thus there has been a drop, but my hon.
Friend is right to say that the number is going up.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020535000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000096">An
interesting point arises in that context, which brings me back to a
point made by the hon. Member for Ashfield, about the United
Kingdom’s reputation as a place to do life sciences and
bioscience. I understand that that industry is growing in the UK, more
quickly than the increase in the number of animals used; so the usage
of animals for each £1 of research, or however one might
characterise it, is falling, but more such work is being done in the
UK. It seems to me that that is a good thing, because we want that work
to be done here; we want those generally well-paid jobs to be in the
United Kingdom. Also, because we have high standards of welfare in our
animal testing regime, it is better for animals, if research is to take
place anywhere in the world, for it to happen in the UK. However, if
the size of the business in the UK grows, that may mean that even if
the number of animals used for every given type of research falls, the
overall number goes up.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020535000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000097">Of course,
the quickest way to reduce the number of animals would be to drive the
work overseas, which would not be good for the United Kingdom, for jobs
or for animal welfare. We must be thoughtful about the numbers. We
should consider the size of the industry and the work that is being
carried out, and whether we are driving down the proportion of animals
being used in that work. We need to think about the global position. It
is a coalition Government objective to get more of the life sciences
business—the bioscience industry—in the United Kingdom.
As the hon. Member for Ashfield said, the Opposition support that, and
if we attract such business here more quickly than we manage to deliver
on the three R’s, the number of animals that are used will rise.
However, we may be driving down the rate at which they are used, while
the industry grows. That is a bit of a conundrum, and I do not have the
answer, but it shows that care should be exercised in using
statistics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000098"><B><Member ContinuationText="Roger Williams" PimsId="4622" UID="13020535000186" xid="638" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000186">Roger
Williams:</Member></B> The Minister makes a good point. I put a
question to the Home Office about the number of animals used for
experimentation in Wales, and was 
<?notus-xml column=48?>surprised that the figure had gone up; but after I visited Cardiff
university, I understood that its success in attracting research funds,
and its high status in life sciences and bioscience, was the reason for
the rise.</hs_Para>

Harper:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I was really
only cautioning about the need to examine data and be careful about how
we apply it. It is also worth commenting on the way statistics are set
out, which was put into primary legislation. The most significant
number relates to the breeding of genetically modified
animals—largely mice. When the relevant table was designed, that
was a small number at the end. Most of the animals that are
bred—1.4 million mice—are used in other areas of
research: they might well be used in medicine studies, or in
fundamental biological research, but they are not categorised in that
way. We need to be careful about categories and how we define uses. For
example, my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley said that only 13% of
procedures relate to applied studies for human medicine or dentistry;
but, of course, the remaining 87% includes fundamental research, which
can involve any of the categories; and applied veterinary studies and
the protection of man, animals and the environment also underpin much
medical research. Again, therefore, it is worth being cautious about
numbers and what we read into
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000100">Several
hon. Members mentioned enforcement. It is no good having good
legislation if we do not enforce it properly. The Home Office
inspectorate picks up much of that work. The Home Office inspectors are
skilled individuals. They are all registered medical or veterinary
practitioners and usually have first-hand experience of
biomedical research and possess higher scientific or
clinical postgraduate qualifications.
Their work underpins the 1986 Act. They provide
advice to the Secretary of State on licence applications, and technical
and operational advice on issues related to regulating animal
experiments. They also visit the facilities where work is carried out,
to check compliance with licences and certificates and to provide
advice on applications and good
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000102">The

full programme of inspections.</hs_Para>

magic number of inspections. Under the revised Act, there is a risk
assessment for determining the frequency of inspection. We look at the
number and type of procedures that take place at an establishment; the
severity of those procedures; the number and species of animals housed
and used; any special conditions placed on the licences; the history of
compliance of that institution, and any information that might come to
light and indicate non-compliance with the terms of the licence. That

there may be less stringent guidelines. The strategy should be
science-led and that is why we have asked the National Centre for
Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research to take a
leading role in its
delivery.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000106">That
might be a good point to pick up on something the hon. Member for
Bristol East said. She referred to the Dr Hadwen Trust chair in
replacements. We welcome that. Home Office officials meet that trust
regularly and we look forward to seeing the impact of its professorial
post. That is a welcome step towards the science of replacement methods
and will contribute to our commitment. The hon. Lady raised the
specific question about the extent to which it could be rolled out
elsewhere. We will take that away and think about how we might
practically do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000107">The
Home Office takes this issue very seriously. Lord Taylor of Holbeach
this morning visited a research laboratory to observe the work. He also
has a close relationship with the Minister for Universities and
Science, and they work closely together on examining trends in the
industry, attracting life sciences to the UK and the implications for
regulating this area. There is a fair bit of joined-up activity between
the Home Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills.</hs_Para>

also raised information sharing. I mentioned in connection with section
24 that that sometimes gets in the way of inspectors sharing best
practice. We will think about that as we consider how we change that
section. She also mentioned databases and alternatives to animal
testing. Several databases already exist. A new role has been created
of the named information officer, who, we hope, will be able to assist
scientists in searching for alternatives. I have said this before, but
I repeat that nobody really wishes to use animals when there are
alternatives. We need to make it easier for those involved to seek
those alternatives and use them where we
can.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000109">Several
other issues were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley and
supported by others. The number of procedures conducted for testing
household products and their ingredients has fallen since 1997. There
were no procedures under that heading in 2011. We have already
announced our commitment to end testing household products on animals,
to be implemented using licensing powers under the 1986 Act. We will
put a condition on the relevant product licences. We have consulted on
that to get a working definition of “household product”,
as mentioned by the hon. Member for Bristol East. We are close to
finalising a definition that we think will be workable—there is
no point having one that is not. We will make an announcement on that
in due course.</hs_Para>

responses to the consultation favoured inclusion of ingredients in the
ban, a point made by the hon. Lady. That is a bit more complicated than
it might at first appear. Some substances used as ingredients in
household products can have other uses. There are also ingredients,
such as chemicals and biocides, that under other legislation have
mandatory safety testing requirements that involve using animals.
Therefore, it is quite a difficult 
<?notus-xml column=50?>area. We are in the process of thinking the matter through to
come up with something sensible. We want to come up with something that
is workable and sensible, but does not have a chain of unforeseen
consequences. It is complicated, and an obvious answer did not present
itself during the consultation. I assure the hon. Lady that we are
thinking and working on that, but it is complicated. Rushing to do it
and getting it wrong would not be helpful. I hope that she can take it
on trust for the moment that the thought processes are under way. I
have listened carefully to what she and my hon. Friend the Member for
Crawley said and will feed that into our
thinking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000111">My
hon. Friend also talked about the mid-term review. He was slightly
concerned by the use of the past tense. That was simply because it was
a mid-term review, looking back over the first period of government.
However, we are very much in the present tense in terms of continuing
work. The national centre I talked about is actively pursuing a wide
range of initiatives, including increased funding for three R’s
work in universities. It supports innovation in the three R’s
through its CRACK IT programme. It looks at new disciplines such as
engineering and mathematics to reduce animal use. I think the hon.
Member for Bristol East touched on that when she talked about the
professorial post.</hs_Para>

initiatives include working with regulators to reduce animal use,
investment in education and training and support for stem cell and
tissue engineering technologies. There is quite a lot of work going on
led by experts in their field. That is what we want: a science-led
approach to driving some of the change. That was touched on by my hon.
Friend, and by the hon. Lady when she spoke about those involved in the
business having alternative methods of delivering testing and safety
assessments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000113">My
hon. Friend also talked about the animals in science
committee—the advisory committee that is  in the process
of being set up. There will be a working protocol agreed with the
committee chair that sets up the size and qualifications of the
committee. That working protocol will be published and will set out the
issues that will be automatically submitted to the committee for

Friend talked about the use of non-human primates and their
importation. Many people have a particular concern about the use of
non-human primates in scientific research. It is a small part of animal
research compared with overall usage, but it is an important part. In
the UK, we use small numbers of non-human primates for developing and
testing vaccines against some of the world’s largest killers,
such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, TB, and for the potential future treatment
of degenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s. The majority—about three quarters—of
the primates used in 2011 were used for the safety testing
of medicines.</hs_Para>

are sourced outside the UK, where animals of the right quality are
readily available—I am afraid that that comes down to our
not-brilliant climate. For those particular animals, rearing them in
the UK is not viable, as they would have to be reared inside.
It  is much easier to rear them outside in overseas locations,
which makes the process more productive. Banning their importation
would harm essential work. However, 
<?notus-xml column=51?>what is important, as my hon. Friend said, is for those who import the
animals to ensure that the suppliers they deal with have proper
controls and processes in place so that, in the breeding part of the
operation, the animals are well
treated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000116">My
hon. Friend also talked about the personal licence system, which
identifies the individual, the place where the work will be carried
out, the species authorised for use and the types of techniques.
Granting a licence depends, as it did previously, on a demonstration
that the person has done the appropriate training, both for the species
they are using and the techniques they are carrying out. The
application requires a declaration by the local named training and
competence officer to confirm that that level of training has been
carried out by the applicant, and that the list of species that may be
authorised is similar to the previous descriptions provided by
applicants. It is also similar to a list used for the statistical
returns. It is personal to the individual, which is
important—when we debated the transposition of the directive,
the personal link was felt to be welcome and valuable—and so it
is not transferable to someone else. Furthermore, not only training,
but the practical work experience under supervision, is important. That
is something that the Home Office inspectors can monitor on their
visits—not only someone’s initial training, but the
practical experience under supervision to ensure compliance with the
terms of the personal
licence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000117">The
hon. Member for Bristol East asked a couple of questions to do with
cosmetics. She rightly noted that the UK banned the testing of finished
cosmetics and ingredients in 1997 and 1998, because the Government
considered the justification for using animals to be inadequate given
the benefits of the products and the alternative tests available. She
also referred to the European cosmetics directive; the EU banned animal
testing of finished cosmetics in 2004 and of ingredients in 2009. To
meet the requirements of the directive, a partial marketing ban was
also implemented in 2009. It banned the supply of cosmetics for which
animal tests had been carried out anywhere in the world, but did not
extend to the test for the three most complex human effects of testing.
A full marketing ban, which includes such tests and to which the hon.
Lady referred, is expected to come into effect on 11 March, regardless
of the fact that validated replacement tests are not
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000118">The
ban is not a complete sales ban on all animal-tested cosmetics. Some
parts of the world, as discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Torbay (Mr Sanders), insist on animal testing as a regulatory
requirement, so products subject to such a regime are not
banned from the EU. Nevertheless, animal testing to meet the
requirements of EU cosmetics legislation will be prohibited once the
marketing ban enters into force. That is a bit 
<?notus-xml column=52?>complicated, and I have probably made things less clear, rather than
clearer. The impetus, however, will come from consumer pressure, which
the hon. Lady talked about, and transparency. Moreover, as other
countries develop, as their consumers become more
sophisticated—as happened in this country—and as their
legislative processes improve, they will come under pressure on such
issues. It is helpful, working through the Foreign Office and
elsewhere, for us to explain what we have done in the UK and the EU to
set our standards, to show that we can deliver on testing when
necessary, or simply lead by example when not necessary. We can
all participate in
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000119">The
hon. Member for Bristol East mentioned enforcement of the marketing
ban, which does indeed fall to local authority trading standards, on
which the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills leads. I will
talk to my colleagues in BIS to see where that issue has got to and how
it is being rolled out to trading standards departments. It may be
rather dreadful to hand the action over to my colleagues, but I will
ask them to look into the subject and to write to the hon. Lady. I will
put a copy of the reply in the Library. I suspect that she will then
use that information to go and duff up her local trading standards
organisation, to ensure that it is fully engaged in that important
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000120">I
hope that I have set out the Government’s approach. My hon.
Friend the Member for Crawley made a wide-ranging speech. I think I
have addressed all his questions, as well as those asked by the hon.
Member for Ashfield, who spoke for the Opposition. I am grateful for
the shared work with the Opposition on the subject; when the hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull North and I debated the transposition of
the directive, she was machine-gunning her questions at me, so it did
not feel entirely as if we were on the same side, but I
machine-gunned all the answers back. A lot of the work in this

direction, minimising the use of animals, using them only when
absolutely necessary and, if we do use them, having the highest
possible standards. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley for

thank the Minister for his attention today. He is fully aware of the
strategic importance and significance of the A120, in particular, as an
economic and strategic link, not only throughout the county of Essex,
but to Europe. It is part of the trans-European transport network route
known as the UK-Ireland-Benelux road axis, and it connects with
Stansted airport in the west—in the constituency of my right
hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan
Haselhurst)—which is Britain’s second largest air freight
port transporting cargo worth £8 billion a year, as well as with
Harwich International port in the east, which has trade links with
northern Europe and serves about 1 million passengers a year.</hs_Para>

the A120 is not only about connecting locations. It is important and
strategic, because it gives people and businesses opportunities to
access national, European and global markets. The importance of the
road to the economic well-being of the region and  the county
of Essex cannot be understated. The road is particularly important to
my constituents and to businesses there. Essex is a dynamic county of
entrepreneurs  with a vibrant mix of traditional industries,
such as manufacturing, rural farming and innovative light businesses.
Of course, entrepreneurs are the wealth creators not only for the
county of Essex, but for the country, and are creating private sector
jobs and prosperity in our economy.</hs_Para>

my constituency, small and medium-sized businesses are highly
significant. The proportion is more than 80%, and they are growing,
despite the economic downturn that we have had. I have to
say—the Minister has heard me say this before, as have many
other Essex colleagues—that we are a great county to do business
in. Our strategic geographical location, our proximity to London, and
our access not only to ports, but to Stansted and Southend airports has
a lot to do with it. Our 20th century transport
infrastructure, however, is holding us and, particularly, businesses
back. Nowhere is that more evident than with the A120
and particularly the 12-mile  single carriageway
stretch that runs north to my constituency, between
Braintree and the A12 at the Marks Tey end  of the A120. That
also touches the southern edges of the constituencies of my hon.
Friends the Members for Braintree (Mr Newmark) and for Harwich and

road is one of the most heavily used in Essex by the business sector.
Some 56% of businesses responding to an Essex chambers of commerce
survey indicated that they use the road regularly. However, the single
carriageway section, as I have alluded to, is not fit for purpose. It
is extremely congested, causes severe delays, is highly dangerous, and
is a barrier to economic growth. Those delays harm businesses and
damage small and medium-sized firms, not only in my constituency, but
in neighbouring constituencies. For them, an extra half-hour delay in
traffic can mean the loss of a lucrative contract.  
<?notus-xml column=54?>It can damage their reputation, prevent them from expanding and adding
more capacity, and it adds hundreds of thousand of pounds to their
running costs each year.</hs_Para>

Minister has been generous with his time, meeting me and other
representatives from my constituency to look into the pressures on the
road, but I would like  to highlight that figures as far back
as 2005 show that an estimated 25,000 vehicles use that stretch of road
every single day, when single carriageway roads are typically expected
to carry approximately 23,000 vehicles. Annual daily traffic flow data
from the Department for Transport in 2010 indicated that on parts of
the A120, some 14% of traffic is accounted for by HGVs, compared with
an average of only 6% across Essex. That demand inevitably puts strains
on the road and its junctions, leading to delays and a backlog on to
smaller roads, affecting nearby villages.</hs_Para>

are no alternative routes where traffic can go. The report also

increased traffic flows in future, stress levels, as measured by the

section of the single carriageway.</hs_Para>

address those problems, it was recommended that the A120 was classified
as a route of strategic national importance to attract funding from
other sources and a wider pool, and crucially that the single
carriageway section be dualled in a scheme which, at that time, would
have cost approximately £500 million. The advantages of dualling
were clearly laid out. First, it would enable the road to increase
capacity and accommodate an average 25% increase in traffic in both
directions. Secondly, with less congestion, journey times would
decrease by between six and 11 minutes, which is significant for this
12-mile stretch of road. Thirdly, an upgraded and dualled road would
lead to economic benefits, estimated at the time to be around
£725 million for users, and with wider economic benefits of
£106 million. At today’s prices, it is estimated that the
benefits would exceed £1.1 billion. The proposed scheme would
have delivered good value for money and, naturally, it would have
unlocked wider economic potential, helping to create thousands of new
jobs in the process and improving access to the Haven
Gateway.</hs_Para>

as my hon. Friend the Minister and other colleagues know, the A120 was
not considered to be a priority by the previous Labour Government, who
went on to scrap the scheme. We are now living with that local legacy,
and there is huge disappointment locally. The Minister will be aware
that we are coming together collectively with the Essex chambers of
commerce, Essex county council, Braintree district council, the
Highways Agency, Colchester borough council, Tendring district council
and the Haven Gateway partnership, in particular, 
<?notus-xml column=55?>to start lobbying and fighting to make it a strategic route, and

take this moment to pay tribute to all my colleagues, and my local
authorities and neighbouring local authorities. Despite the
disappointment of what happened in the past, we are now adamant about
building an even stronger economic and business case for dualling the
A120. The Essex chambers of commerce has recently set up the Essex
business transport and infrastructure forum to support businesses and
the business effort in co-ordinating the development of economic
arguments. I invite the Minister to come to one of our future meetings

want to touch on the A120 and the road safety implications. As the

relating to the A120 and to the single carriageway being dualled. Local
parish councils along that route—Marks Tey, Bradwell and
Coggleshall—along with local residents, to whom I would like to
pay tribute, have set up a significant campaign called “Save
Lives Not Time”, and they have campaigned to see the road become
much safer. We have had lots of problems on the road, as I have
mentioned, but they have done tremendous work to see that lives are
saved and that accidents are prevented.</hs_Para>

Road Safety Foundation has classified the A120 as one of the 10 most
dangerous roads in the country and figures from the CrashMap website,
set up by the Government, also show the number and seriousness of road
traffic accidents. There has been not just a high number but more than
50 further serious accidents in the period from 2005 to 2011, and
further fatalities have occurred on this stretch of road. Naturally, we
want to see that stopped. The Highways Agency has been very helpful and
recognised that. It has in place a maintenance programme to address
some hot spots—in particular, around the Earls Colne road
junction. However, unless this road is upgraded and the capacity issue
addressed, there will be further serious and life-changing accidents,
all of which I believe can be
prevented.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000138">I
would like now to come on to how we can fund the A120. I have touched
on the fact that the cost of a previous scheme was estimated at
£500 million. I appreciate that in the current economic climate
and given the appalling state of the public finances inherited from the
previous Labour Government, the current Government are prevented from
doing what we would all like to see—investing and committing
hundreds of millions of pounds to the A120. However, I have already
said—the Minister has heard me say this consistently—that
this should be treated as a priority scheme. I believe that there is an
opportunity for the Government to consider innovative funding
models.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000139">The
Minister will be aware that in recent years the Marks Tey consortium,
known as Gateway 120 Ltd, has developed proposals that could unlock a
considerable amount of money, through section 106 agreements and the
community infrastructure levy, to help to provide private sector
funding to support upgrades. Braintree district council has already
said that it has allocated  £5 million of new homes
bonuses to contribute towards joint investment in this major
infrastructure project.  In addition, there have been
discussions on and the 
<?notus-xml column=56?>development of a revised proposal, which differs from the previous
scheme considered by the Highways Agency and could be much more
cost-effective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000140">I
believe—I would like the Minister to look into this—that
funding may also be available through the European Union. The A120 is
part of the trans-European transport network and may qualify for TEN-T
programme funding or funding from the structural and cohesion funds. I
urge the Government to look into that. The Minister will not be
surprised to hear that I believe that Europe has had far too much of
our money. I think  that this is an opportunity for us to bring
back some of that money and invest it in infrastructure, not just
within the region but in our country. I urge that more work be done to
investigate that aspect of
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020535000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020535000141">I
believe that spending public funds on upgrading this road will yield
significant economic benefits, along with greater tax revenue for the
Government. At a time of economic austerity, we need barriers to trade
and private sector growth and investment to be removed; with
alternative private funding models, such as that to which I have
alluded, we can help to unlock that process. If the Government can
commit to upgrading the road, that will naturally help to unlock the
economic potential not just of Essex but of the eastern region and also
the south-east of this country and unleash the power of  the
country’s wealth creators. But at the same time, we must look at
alternative funding sources as well. I look forward to hearing what the
Minister has to
say.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_05_PT_1/D4C0A0F1ED9882C7C0FBE5F54E57998672AE9386" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2013">Tuesday

Alan Haselhurst</B> (Saffron Walden) (Con):</Member> I am very grateful
to my hon. Friend the Minister for being allowed to make a small
contribution to the debate. If I may, I shall add a little historical
perspective. The Saffron Walden constituency, from the point
at which I became the Member in 1977 until 2010, included the northern
part of the Braintree district, and across that section of the county
there ran the A604, which was a principal road between Colchester and
Cambridge. It was later downgraded to become the A1124 and the A1109. I
had, as the Member, many representations at that time for village
bypasses to overcome some of the problems—very similar to those
that my hon. Friend the Member for Witham (Priti Patel) has mentioned
on the stretch of road from Braintree to Marks Tey—and to avoid
the heavy traffic that was thundering through, with accidents and great
risk to
pedestrians.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000003">However,
I was told then, by Essex county council and by the Department for
Transport, that I did not understand what the strategy was. It was
explained to me that the strategy to bring heavy traffic and, indeed,
all traffic from the east coast ports to the midlands and the north was
twofold. It was to build the Orwell bridge, so that traffic could have
the choice of going up the A12 and then on to the A14, or come along
the A120, which was to be upgraded to the M11 at Stansted. It is
extraordinary that after 35 years, we had half of that done, from
Stansted to Braintree, and the other half conspicuously, dramatically
undone—one and a half routes between the east coast
and the midlands and the north. That is truly
ludicrous.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000004">Of
course, that strategic decision, explained to me in 1977-78, was before
a decision had been taken to allow the development of Stansted airport,
which of course 
<?notus-xml column=57?>has generated much more traffic, so it is even more extraordinary, with
the institution by many of the freight companies of headquarters at
Stansted and the traffic that that generates, that there still appears
to be no recognition in the Department for Transport, over many, many
years now, of the importance of completing the link that was originally
intended when I first became involved on behalf of my constituents.
Thirty-five years we have had to wait—how much longer? Surely
the time for the gap to be plugged has
come.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13020552000115" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000115">4.16

Sheridan, and I am delighted to be here. I congratulate my hon. Friend
the Member for Witham (Priti Patel) on securing the debate. She knows
that, were it not for the debate in the main Chamber, many more people
would be here this afternoon. I have been particularly struck by what
she and my right hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan

hon. Friend has been a tireless campaigner on the need for future
investment in this road, as has my right hon. Friend. I recognise her
continuing determination to speak about the importance of this subject
for her constituents, local businesses and the local economy. I am of
course aware that she has asked a number of parliamentary questions
about the improvements that she quite rightly believes are required to
the A120 and to the A12. She secured an Adjournment debate last year on
transport in Essex. As she will remember, I met her recently to discuss
the proposals to improve the A120 and therefore I am pleased to be
responding to this debate this
afternoon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000007">The
strategic road network is the Government’s largest single asset,
currently valued at about £100 billion and comprising some 4,350
miles of motorway and trunk road. The Government recognise the
importance of the transport infrastructure to supporting the economy,
and local economies throughout the country, and therefore we have
announced increased levels of Government funding to deliver
improvements targeted at supporting economic
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000008">My
hon. Friends will remember the announcement in the 2010 spending review
that we were investing an extra £1.4 billion in starting 14
major road schemes over the spending review period. My right hon.
Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as part of the 2011 autumn
statement, identified several other schemes that would be brought
forward for delivery. In the 2012 statement, the Chancellor announced
additional capital investment in this Parliament that would enable four
major schemes to be brought
forward.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13020552000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000098">I
therefore hope that my hon. Friends will recognise that the Government
are keen to support the infrastructure of our country. Indeed, in the
2012 statement, there was the provision of a further £100
million of capital expenditure in this spending round to undertake
further pinchpoint schemes. My hon. Friend the Member for Witham will
be aware that that included a £0.28
million—£280,000—pinchpoint scheme to widen
Galley’s Corner roundabout south-east of Braintree. It is
obviously true, but I am 
<?notus-xml column=58?>sure that it disappointed her, that no other schemes that applied for
pinchpoint funding on the A120—several did apply—could be
delivered within the scope and the criteria of that fund. She and I
have spoken about that.</hs_ParaIndent>

Friend the Member for Saffron Walden spoke a little about the history
of the A120, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Witham. Obviously,
sections of it are single-carriageway road, as she rightly said. The
A120 east of the M11 is a trunk road and therefore part of the
strategic road network. As she points out, it also forms part of the
comprehensive trans-European road
network.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000010">My
hon. Friends were right to point out that if one looks at the history
of the road and the Department’s consultations, surveys and
studies on proposed improvements to the A120, one sees that in 2001-02
a comprehensive study was undertaken to look at the problems facing the
A12 corridor between London and Ipswich, which included the A120. The
study recommended road improvements between Marks Tey and Braintree,
and that dualling the A120 from the A12 to Harwich should be considered
in the longer
term.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000011">As
my hon. Friends said, the previous Administration’s review of
regional priorities in the east of England provided advice that changed
those priorities, and the regional assembly removed the proposals from
their prioritised programme. In the previous Government’s
response to the advice, they accepted the recommendations for
prioritisation, and the Department for Transport instructed that the
scheme should not proceed further. That is the history. It is worth
setting out the
context.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000012">My
hon. Friends will know that, given the previous decisions on the
prioritisation of improvements, there was not a sufficiently developed
business case for the proposal at the time of the
Government’s 2010 comprehensive spending review. I have spoken
about the schemes that the Chancellor prioritised. A developed business
case was a key requirement in both 2010 and 2011. The Department
therefore had no plans to develop future scheme improvements in this
location. There have been subsequent developments, to which my hon.
Friends
referred.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000013">In
our January meeting, I explained that, in assessing schemes for the
future, the Highways Agency is looking at a process that would involve
local parties in considering future priorities on a more local level,
rather than on a simply regional basis. For the record, it may be worth
setting out exactly how we expect such route-based strategies to
work.</hs_Para>

to the recommendations in Alan Cook’s review of the Highways
Agency, we agreed to develop and roll out a programme of route-based
strategies to identify future transport investments for the strategic
road network. The Highways Agency is developing three route-based
strategies at initial locations, one of which is the A12 from its
junction with the M25 to its junction with the A14 and the A120 between
Colchester and Harwich.</hs_Para>

initial strategies will be complete in March this year. We will take
the lessons learnt from the production to inform a wider programme of
strategies to assess network prioritisation, starting in the next
financial year, which as I explained is likely to include the remaining
section of the A120 west of the A12. Route-based strategies will ensure
that there is clear 
<?notus-xml column=59?>evidence to make informed decisions on what is necessary for the
strategic network to support economic growth locally and keep the

I said to my hon. Friend when we met in January, a key element of the
route-based strategy is the engagement and involvement of local groups,
including, as we discussed, local enterprise partnerships. I very much
welcome the work of the Haven Gateway group in bringing together the
range of local interests. I also welcome its analysis of the potential
transport benefits and, more importantly, the potential benefits for
economic growth in the region, which will be useful in informing the
route-based strategy for the rest of the A120. I have made it clear,
and I hope she accepts my reassurances, that the Highways Agency will
work closely with local groups, via the LEP and local authorities, when
it undertakes the route-based strategy work for the rest of the
A120.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000017">As
I have said in this and other debates, the Government recognise the
importance of transport infrastructure to facilitating economic
development and the role that it can play in bringing forward proposed
new housing developments. In our January meeting, my hon. Friend
highlighted the development proposals from Gateway 120 Ltd. My
Department and the Highways Agency are more than happy to
discuss with prospective developers the needs and costs of
transport infrastructure improvements to the strategic road network in
the area. As she will recognise, any development proposals will clearly
need to fit in with the aspirations of the local plans, and, at the
meeting, I took some reassurance from her that that was so. She also

Gateway 120 to that end. That meeting took place yesterday. I am happy

for the A120 for us to explore together, with my Department’s
officials, and I will ensure that we do so. She will also be aware that
the Department clearly needs to know more about the absolute details of
the transport proposals that underline the Gateway 120 scheme before we

to the Highways Agency. We recognise the concerns over safety. I have
asked Highways Agency officials to investigate options to make the

safety audit for that location, which will provide detailed evidence of
incidents and accidents and allow a detailed analysis of the situation.
That will allow us to bring forward options to address the problem. I

spent much time speaking to constituents. One of the benefits of
standing in a by-election is spending an awful lot of time speaking to
people, and the issue regularly came up on the doorstep. I have spoken
to housing associations and other registered social landlords, to local
authorities—specifically Cardiff council—and to other

simplification of welfare payments is desirable, there are clearly
consistent fears and forecasts of dire consequences that Ministers and

us look at some of the headline figures. On Monday 10 December 2012,
the Government published their new impact assessment for universal
credit, which showed several very worrying facts. First, 800,000 more
people across the UK face lower entitlements. The original assessment,
which was published in 2011, said that 2 million people would face
lower entitlements under universal credit, but that number has now
risen to 2.8 million, with an average loss of entitlement of
£137 a month. I will come to the specific statistics for Wales
in a moment. Of those losers, 400,000 will be concentrated in the two
lowest income
groups.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000031">We
expect 600,000 more parents to lose out under universal credit.
Households will also lose more: the original impact assessment said
that only 200,000 families would lose more than £75 a month, but
the latest one states that 1.3 million households will lose more than
£100 a month and that an incredible 300,000 families will lose
more than £300 a month, which amounts to £3,600 a year.
The impact assessment points out that higher administrative costs will
result from the changes. The Department has also dropped its claim that
universal credit will tackle poverty, which has been removed from the
2012 impact
assessment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000032">There

be affected. I would be grateful if the Minister shared the

the key fears that people have raised with me about the implementation

budgeting for many families; secondly, as my hon. Friend the Member for

on budgeting, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions frequently
appears to suggest that those of us who raise the issue are patronising
our constituents. Rather than taking so entirely complacent an
approach, I commend the work that organisations such as the citizens
advice bureaux, the Cardiff and Vale credit union, housing
associations—for example, Cadwyn in my constituency—are
doing to support tenants by helping them to set up bank accounts, jam
jar accounts and similar facilities in credit unions. I also commend
the work the Welsh Government’s work to support those
efforts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000040">Levels
of financial literacy––let alone access to a bank
account––are not, unlike this measure, universal, and we
need to be realistic about the impact of the changes on many people.
Rather than making huge assumptions, perhaps the Minister would tell us
what risks he sees in relation to the problems in the area and what his
Department is doing to assist. I can certainly tell him that many of
the organisations that I have mentioned, let alone individual
constituents, have experienced varying or little support from his

support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000041">I

accounts and additional support for budgeting, both of which we intend

it is under the system we have inherited from the previous

me deal with some of the specific concerns that have been expressed.
The hon. Member for Cardiff South and Penarth raised the issue about
benefits being paid in arrears on a monthly basis. It is important that
the new system is designed around the patterns of modern working life.
Given that three quarters of the employed population are already paid
on a monthly basis, receiving payments monthly will be something that
people are familiar with when we move to universal credit.</hs_Para>

recognise that some people may struggle to budget, and we are making
provision to ensure that they do not fall through the cracks. We are
working with banks and credit unions, such as the ones the hon.
Gentleman quoted, to explore suitable financial products that may help
people to budget and to put money by each month to fulfil their
responsibilities to pay their rent and other household
bills. Around 4.2 million Department for Work and Pensions claimants
already have a bank account. We know that historically some people on a
low income have experienced difficulties in accessing and using banking
products. We want to ensure that claimants have access to a basic bank
account with safe and secure standing order and direct debit
facilities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000081">Let
me move on to the point that was made about online services. As the
hon. Gentleman indicated, the service will be online. We want people to
be able to make a claim and to report changes, as they would with
online banking. If people are going to participate effectively in
today’s modern labour market, they will have to be conversant
with digital tools. In the words of Lord Freud, digitisation is a
“social imperative”. Of course we can and must do more to
ensure that people can access services online. We do not want the
digital divide in his constituency and others to persist. We must
tackle it and this process is a very good way of tackling it. I am
surprised that Opposition Members are so resistant to the actions that
we can take to help tackle that digital divide and improve social
inclusion.</hs_Para>

we are working through the implementation of this programme is through
our pathfinder approach, which enables us to proceed with
implementation in phases. It is an approach that we have used in other
large programmes. For example, in the new child maintenance scheme we
have used the pathfinder process. In implementing the personal
independence payment, which replaces the disability living allowance,
we will begin with a few thousand new claims in April, before rolling
it out. So the staged and methodical approach that we take to rolling
out programmes—“prove before you
move”—means that we will fully implement a change once we
are satisfied from experience in a live environment that it is safe to
do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000088">That
is why we are rolling out the pathfinder in April in Greater Manchester
and Cheshire, to allow us time to test during this period and with a
view to successful implementation nationally later this year. This
thoughtful and considered approach to rolling out is important. It will
ensure that we test the operation to run universal credit; the people
capabilities required to support the service; communications;
implementation; the behaviour of claimants; and how to ensure that we
respond effectively to unintended
consequences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000089">Let
me touch on direct payments. I understand the concerns about the
payment of housing costs directly to claimants, but we remain
of the view that paying housing costs directly is an important way of
helping people to manage their own finances and to become more
independent. The emerging evidence from the demonstration projects,
including the one in Torfaen, does not suggest that large numbers of
claimants will suddenly fall into arrears. On the contrary, because the
take-on of claims is going to be gradual—over a period of
years—there will be no big bang effect, and there is no real
evidence of any likely sudden impact on landlords’
incomes.</hs_Para>

lessons to learn from those projects, and we will continue to monitor
the position very carefully. They will enable us to test trigger points

necessary—switching back payment to the landlord for a period

tenant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020552000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/halltext/130205h0002.htm#13020552000091">We

Nevertheless, the support mechanisms that are in place are very
important. They give landlords a real incentive to work with their
tenants around employment issues to help them into work, and encourage
landlords to work more closely with their tenants to understand their
financial capabilities and what support

practical lessons on delivering services in an innovative way at the
local level, including triage, which is working with claimants to
identify their needs, how those needs can be met and where support can
be accessed locally; improving online access, so that we can get more
claimants using online resources and, where they cannot use them,
providing assisted support to get online locally at libraries,
community centres and other community buildings where personal
computers may be accessible; budgeting support, so that people can
manage their finances independently; and, of course, all underpinned

the valid point that the hon. Gentleman made about ensuring that
support is available at a local level. It is in none of our interests
for claimants of universal credit to be left high and dry. That is why
we are working to ensure that the support is in place, whether it is
about getting online, debt advice, managing money, or setting up the
right bank account or jam jar account to enable people to manage their
money. We want to provide the infrastructure around universal credit to
help claimants.</hs_Para>

that way, and focusing on how we tackle those problems rather than
simply throwing our hands up in horror and saying that it is all doomed
to fail, we will provide the right outcomes for the hon.
Gentleman’s constituents and for mine. That is because it is
absolutely right that we do all we can to ensure that people know that
work pays, that people in Wales will be better off as a consequence of
the introduction of universal credit and that people do not see the
disruption that happens at the moment when they move from out-of-work
benefits to in-work benefits. The system is here to ensure that people
understand that it is better to work than not to work, and better to
earn more than to earn less. There will not be the situation that many
people are in now, of having to turn down bonuses from their
employers 
<?notus-xml column=71?>because it does not work with the benefit system. We need to tackle some
of the problems of the past, to give our people hope for the
future.</hs_Para>

strategic health authorities (SHAs)—North East, Yorkshire and
the Humber, West Midlands and East Midlands—with regard to the
functions of approving registered medical practitioners and approved

summary, Dr Harris found that the SHAs involved did not overtly or
wittingly delegate the functions concerned. However, he identified two
key principles as to how the 
<?notus-xml column=10?>technically irregular delegation happened. First,
the SHAs concerned should have been
aware that, where a function has been conferred by statute on a public
authority, the public authority may not further delegate the
performance of the function to another body unless expressly permitted
to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020532000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/wmstext/130205m0001.htm#13020532000042">Secondly,
the SHAs considered that, because they remained accountable for the
functions, the delegation of the operation of the approval arrangements
to mental health trusts through contracts was not something that risked
legal irregularity. The report sets out the factors that led to this
situation in more
detail.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020532000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/wmstext/130205m0001.htm#13020532000043">In
the second part of his review report, Dr Harris recommends that every
organisation in the post-April 2013 NHS, including the Department of
Health, should undertake a process of due diligence. To guide this
process he sets out four key
principles:</hs_Para><hs_brevIndent Justify="left" UID="13020532000076" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/wmstext/130205m0001.htm#13020532000076">that

that the total remuneration package offered to the judiciary, including
pension provision, should not be reduced for serving judges, this forms
part of a broader constitutional principle that an independent

judicial pension scheme will be constituted under the same legislation
as will apply to other public service pension schemes. But we now
propose to proceed on the 
<?notus-xml column=11?>basis of a new, stand-alone judicial pension scheme for which the Lord
Chancellor would be the responsible authority. The
scheme regulations will be subject to affirmative resolution procedure.
This approach will allow the judges to participate in the governance of
their pension arrangements and to have a say in how their pension terms
develop in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020532000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/wmstext/130205m0001.htm#13020532000050">It
is proposed that the new scheme will apply to all judges other than
those within 10 years of pension age at 1 April 2012; this group
(around 75% of judges at 1 April 2012) will continue in their current
schemes. Other judges will move into the new scheme for service from 1
April 2015. Those appointed before 1 April 2012, and who were aged
between 51½ and 55 at that date, will have the option to defer
joining the new scheme until an age-related later date; this
“tapering protection” is intended to avoid a cliff-edge
in treatment for those who fall just outside the group with full
protection. Previous service in any of the current judicial schemes
will be fully protected, continuing to be pensioned under the rules of
the current scheme but reflecting the individual’s salary on
retirement.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020532000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/wmstext/130205m0001.htm#13020532000051">In
common with the approach applying to other public service pension
schemes, the new scheme will be registered with HM Revenue and Customs
for tax purposes. Particular concerns have been expressed about the
impact on some judges of moving to a tax-registered pension scheme. We
understand these concerns and propose to address them by allowing those
likely to be most affected the option of a transitional protection
allowance in lieu of pension accrual in the new scheme. Eligibility to
apply for this allowance will be strictly limited to those serving
judges who have had continuous membership of a judicial pension scheme,
who have registered their prejudicial pensions for enhanced protection
under the Finance Act 2004 or fixed protection under the Finance Act
2011 and who have made no contributions to a tax-registered pension

Chalara fraxinea is present and our knowledge of the biology of the

eliminating the disease from already infected trees. The pathogen is
present in inaccessible areas of the tree and it is also difficult to
apply fungicides effectively to large trees. Fungicides may however
have a role in particular situations such as the protection of young
trees in nurseries and protection of specimen trees or trees of special

impacts of their permitted radioactive discharges on wildlife species.
This includes routine discharges, following treatment, arising from the
storage of radioactive waste, for example from
ventilation plant or routine purging of water from storage ponds. These
assessments are done to demonstrate that the impact of discharges
during normal operation of storage plant will not exceed
internationally derived radiation guidelines. The
assessments are also done to check that wildlife species are
protected under legislation related to conservation. The strict
permitting of the radioactive discharges from waste storage at
Sellafield has taken account of such
assessments.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_05_PT_1/F350FF2D2E22119B8217A09FD15017135F20B37E" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2013">Tuesday

journey times, capacity and connectivity between major cities of the
north, midlands and London enabling northern regions to fulfil their
economic potential. Journey time improvements will be possible from new
classic-compatible high speed trains serving Cumbria, while the
Staffordshire area, including Stone, will continue to benefit from the
high speed services delivered by Phase One of the scheme. HS2 will also
free up space for additional commuter, regional and freight services on
the west coast mainline offering more opportunity for services to meet
local needs. Latest estimates published in August 2012 suggest HS2 will
deliver net benefits of £64 billion including over £15
billion in wider economic impacts. If local areas seize the opportunity
offered by HS2 these benefits could be greater. HS2 Ltd will undertake
further work to assess the sub- national, regional and local economic
impacts of HS2.</hs_Para>

Government believes that Voluntary Adoption Agencies are an essential
part of the adopter recruitment system. To ensure the Department's
adoption reform programme is informed by the expertise contained within
the voluntary sector, members of the Consortium of Voluntary Adoption
Agencies (CVAA UK) are a part of the expert working group that advises
the Department on its adoption reform
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020574000604" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/text/130205w0002.htm#13020574000604">The
CVAA's Sector Performance report for England for 2011-2012 reported
that Voluntary Adoption Agencies placed 20% more children with adoptive
families than in the previous year—611 in comparison to 510.
Ministers and officials regularly meet representatives of Voluntary
Adoption Agencies to discuss how the sector can work with the
Government to improve and increase the recruitment and approval of
adopters. To this end, the Department has announced a
£1 million grant to the Consortium of Voluntary Adoption
Agencies to enable it to pump-prime local Voluntary Adoption Agencies
to recruit more adopters.</hs_Para>

Government's current adoption reform programme will help all adoption
agencies make improvements to their services and increase the number of
adopters they recruit. We have proposed a more streamlined adopter
approval process and commissioned market research into attitudes,
motivations and barriers to adoption to support the recruitment of
adopters. We have also announced improvements to adoption support and
launched the National Gateway for Adoption, which is an information
line providing accurate advice to people interested in
adoption.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020574000607" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130205/text/130205w0002.htm#13020574000607">We

loving homes. In particular, we welcome recent signs that local

of the fee paid by one local authority to another to that charged by

certain Croatian producers that do not yet meet the single market's
rules to continue to market their products in Croatia only; and
temporary arrangements that will enable the operation of the border

Since the DRC's presidential and parliamentary elections in November
last year, the British ambassador and his staff have regularly
underlined to the DRC Government, including to the National Independent
Electoral Commission (CENI), that we support the recommendations of the
EU election observation mission report. This includes the provision
that the DRC Government should hold provincial and local elections
within reasonable deadlines and in the best possible conditions. We
welcome the passage in January 2013 of election reform legislation by
the National Assembly, and hope that early and effective implementation
of the legislation, including the appointment of new CENI leadership,
will pave the way to early and high quality local and provincial
elections.</hs_Para>

tuberculosis (TB) in 2010, which demonstrated its clinical and cost
effectiveness. Public health guidance from the National Institute for

of the mobile chest X-ray services like Find and Treat to identify
active pulmonary TB among people who use homeless or substance misuse
services in areas of identified need, including major urban centres
with a high incidence of TB. The NHS in London, which has funded the

Tony Baldry:</Member></B> The general position with regard to chancel
repair liability is now a good deal clearer and more satisfactory than
it has previously been. Following discussion with the Charity
Commission in the light of the Broadway case, the Commission has now
given general advice—available on its website—which
explains that chancel repair liability need not be enforced or
registered in every case.

other significant development is the statement from the Heritage
Lottery Fund (which will take over the grants repair scheme for places
of worship in April). They will not encourage PCCs to pursue chancel
repair liability where it is unreasonable for them to do so. These two
developments should make is much less difficult for PCCs when it comes
to balancing their responsibilities as charity trustees with their
responsibility to support the Church’s mission. If a
PCC—having taken a decision not to enforce or register chancel
repair liability in accordance with the framework set out by the
Charity Commission—wished to give householders the added
assurance that there would be no subsequent change of mind, it would be
open to them to enter into deeds under which they agreed not to
register or enforce the liability. While the Church nationally cannot
give advice to PCCs in specific cases, the Legal Office of the National
Church Institutions is able to offer advice to diocesan Registrars on
this
subject.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_05_PT_1/9BE8080AFE158DBB13FE5B1D92921E6BAC25BFC8" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2013">Tuesday

any changes to that original assessment. Elements of our programme have

diplomacy and aid programmes is fundamental to ensuring that UK
investments produce long-lasting results in eastern DRC. Officials from

opportunity to promote long term peace and stability. We are actively

arrangements will be required in addition to budgeting support. This
may include making more frequent than monthly payments, paying housing
costs directly to landlords or splitting payment of an award between
partners. Wherever possible, these exceptional arrangements will be
time-limited and delivered in conjunction with appropriate support to
help claimants successfully make the transition to monthly budgeting.
