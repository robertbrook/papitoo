extremely hard on behalf of the views and concerns of her constituents
throughout the process of the decision that was finally made by NHS
North West London last Tuesday. Comparative performance data have a
very important role to play, particularly with regard to excess

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T11:37:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ealing Central and Acton (Angie Bray) asked a key question. Under
the secondary legislation being introduced by the Secretary of State
under section 75 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, local
commissioning groups will be forced to allow private providers into the
NHS. These private providers will be exempt from the Freedom of
Information Act, which will make it harder for patients to compare data
between providers. It cannot benefit NHS patients for core clinical
services to be given to private providers that do not have to conform
to the same standards of transparency as those in the NHS. Will the
Secretary of State see reason, ensure a level playing field for the NHS
and withdraw the section 75 regulations without
delay<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T11:38:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0001.htm#13022662000051"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jeremy Hunt" PimsId="4799" UID="13022662002141" xid="894" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0001.htm#13022662002141">Mr

hon. Gentleman hates: Whizz-Kids who are supplying services to disabled
children in Tower Hamlets, or Mind, which is supplying psychological
therapy to people in Middlesbrough? The reality is that those
regulations are completely consistent with the procurement guidelines
that his Government sent to primary care trusts. He needs to stop

talking about selling off land that is mostly not used for clinical

investing £10 million in improving the maternity department,
which has already benefited from £750,000 from the Government

is clinically led and services are better delivered for patients, that
has to be a good thing so let us look at these proposals. If they are

hospitals based at the Care Quality Commission. That will introduce
compassionate care, patient feedback and expert peer review into a

Secondly, in response to the Dilnot report, the Government announced a
long-term solution to the funding of social care, which will both help
thousands of low-income pensioners avoid having to sell their homes and

levels. The most worrying thing from the analysis that will be
published today is that four in 10 of the jobs being lost come directly
from services linked to the care of older people. Does the Secretary of

has a responsibility to look seriously at the issues facing people who

small. Indeed, in 2001, only 7% of people lived in the private rented

rented accommodation is very expensive, but when I questioned the Prime
Minister on this subject he told me that the problem was that housing
benefit costs in London had risen to £6 billion. The reason they
have risen is because of the number of people placed in private rented
accommodation by local authorities, which are fulfilling their
statutory housing duties and have no control over rent levels. In
return, the Government have now capped housing benefits at a very low
level—given the effective rents charged—and the universal
cap will cause even greater problems when it is introduced. Members who
represent central London constituencies are already witnessing a
massive depopulation of our communities as private sector tenants
placed there by the local authority are having their benefit limited
and they cannot afford to pay the difference between their benefits and
the rent charged. Constituents come to me who have a difference of
£100 and more between their benefit level and the rent level,

towards some tenants. I am not saying that every private sector

Registry, a requirement for decent homes standards to apply to all
rented accommodation—not just council and housing association

environmental standards, crucially including energy efficiency
standards because the private rented sector tends to cost more and not
just in rent levels, which are often horrendous—roughly three to
four times what the local authority charges for similar properties in

want to query a couple of things that my hon. Friend the Minister said.
She is a first-class Minister, and I think that had she been a shadow
Minister, she would have been arguing for more scrutiny. I notice that
she has now been left alone on the Front Bench with 
<?notus-xml column=180?>just one Whip, which seems to indicate that nobody in Government wants
to be associated with this programme motion. When the Deputy Leader of
the House <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T12:59:22"></hs_TimeCode>sat on
the Opposition Benches, he was a fine proponent of opposing programme
motions, and it must be very sad for him to have to take this line
today.</hs_Para>

is an intellectual flaw in the Minister’s argument. If she is
saying that this is not controversial and that three hours gives us
plenty of time for debate, why bring in another programme motion,
because the debate will automatically finish within three hours anyway?
The centralist, Stalinist approach of this Executive is such that they
want to be wedded to programme
motions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T12:59:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662000268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0001.htm#13022662000268">I
know that that is not the Prime Minister’s view, because in his
excellent speech, “Fixing Broken Politics”, which he made
in May 2009—I am sure that every Member has read it—he
roundly criticised programme motions and said that they reduced
scrutiny. Basically, a Bill is thought up in Downing street, pushed
through its Second Reading and then goes to a Committee that is stuffed
full of Members who support it. There is no way of getting on a
Committee unless the Whips support the decision. Then, when the Bill
comes back to the Chamber to be considered, Back-Bench Members who are
interested in it but who could not get on the Committee do not have
enough time to make amendments or discuss it. I guarantee that that is
exactly what will happen today if the programme motion goes through.
Amendments will not be reached and they will not be discussed, and
that, of course, is fundamentally what the Government want. They do not
want scrutiny of this Bill. Such a situation occurs when
Members on both Front Benches are in league together. The shadow
Minister, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T13:00:46"></hs_TimeCode>

a brief point of principle. The problem with the timing results from
the fact that the programming of Parliament is controlled entirely by
the Executive. Parliament has already agreed to a timetable motion,
which in my opinion it did not need to do. It does not need programme
motions; we should be able to scrutinise Bills for the time that
Parliament thinks necessary. The programme motion, which went through
on Second Reading, gave a whole day to consider the Bill and give it
its Third Reading. That is what we should be doing today. The only
reason why the debate is being restricted—again, the shadow
Minister let this slip out—is that amendments have been tabled

highlighting the misconceptions. The Office of Fair Trading is already
able to enforce a grocery code of practice. It is already in place. It

concerns about how supermarkets are operating with regard to their

the suppliers, but on consumers. It proposed the introduction of the

their goods if they are not bought by a supermarket. Equally, a
supermarket does not have much of a shop if it has nothing on its
shelves to sell. This is not a one-way street. The supermarket cannot
manage without the supplier. The nature of the free market means that
they have to work together on each other’s terms. If a

on to this point in a bit more detail soon, but the hon. Lady is
forgetting something. The big supermarkets, without a shadow of a
doubt, are massive companies that have hundreds of stores in their
chains. By definition, a viable supplier to a supermarket chain has to
be a very big company as well, otherwise it would not have the
wherewithal to supply all the supermarket’s branches. When I get
to the detail of my new clauses, I will talk about the thresholds that
the Bill should apply. She will see that far from it being the case
that vast supermarkets are being awful to very small suppliers, many of

one frees or three for twos. It asked its suppliers instead to just
sell it the product at an everyday low price and to put what they would
have invested in a promotion into providing that price. It was not

production dries up quickly. That happens when foreign bodies are found
in certain products, which have to be taken off the shelves. A
supermarket can operate only if it then has other suppliers that it can
go to and ask to fill the void at short notice. It goes to another
supplier and says, “We’ve got some empty shelves and a
lack of supply. Can you come and help us out?” Do people really

However, new clause 2 specifies a turnover of £1 billion a year,

with a £1 billion-a-year turnover. That should be something to
celebrate, not to criticise supermarkets for. Suppliers would be
delighted to be companies of that scale. I am not entirely sure which

there will be some kind of magical transfer of wealth from the
supermarket to

will all feed through and go to the small farmers. It does not work

increase the volume—that is how they look to increase their

is far bigger than any supermarket chain? Is the purpose of the Bill to

2, and why—with your permission, Mr Speaker—I shall put
new clause 2 to a vote. I have listed some of the suppliers that would
be covered by the £1 billion figure in new clause 2. The
adjudicator will deal with retailers with a turnover of more than
£1 billion. The Bill is effectively saying that other people
need protecting from such huge organisations, and that they are too big
not to have an unfair advantage in any contract negotiation. The Bill
therefore puts in place a kind of backstop. My point is that if a
supermarket with a turnover of £1 billion a year is
deemed big enough to look after itself without any extra help or
support, surely suppliers with a similar turnover are in exactly the
same situation. If a supermarket with such a turnover is deemed too big
to be trusted to negotiate properly, why would a supplier with a

of those massive organisations that pay the bills of the Food and Drink

this matter? Has he not got the capability to understand the equation

hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer) has made
the point that if supermarkets stick to their agreement, there would be
nothing for the adjudicator to do. We would be paying her a huge salary
to do nothing, which seems a bizarre situation, but there we go. On the
other hand, there might be lots of complaints and everything could be
working fantastically with everyone thinking that the Bill has been a
great triumph, with even small suppliers thinking that it has been
great, and all the rest of it. Well, in seven years’ time, we
can let the Bill expire and decide for ourselves whether it was a good
thing or a bad thing. We can also decide whether the threshold I favour
is worth putting back in again if we agree to it today or worth
inserting if we do not. We will be able to see how it works in
practice. If all my fears turn out not to be a problem, it can all be
resolved when the Bill is looked at again in seven years’ time.
If my fears are proved to be correct and people accept that some of my
concerns were true, it could equally be dealt with at that particular
point. Why box ourselves into something that is a complete waste of
time? Let us have a sunset clause, so that we can deal with any

that if such a sunset clause is not introduced, and if the Bill is

of bureaucracy that we could well have done without, it will carry on
endlessly. Nobody will have the guts to do anything about it. The
provision will provide a mechanism for getting rid of the legislation

am chair of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union parliamentary
group. We meet that union, which represents the workers in the baking
and confectionary industry, on a regular basis. We have had a long
campaign over a number of years to express our concerns about
below-cost selling in the baking and confectionary sector. The concern
relates to the Bill’s general provisions, but because I raised
it on Second Reading, I shall not delay us further except to explain
that the same pressure suppliers have felt from supermarkets has had
its effect on the baking industry, as it has on farming and
elsewhere.</hs_Para>

pressure to cut overall costs has reduced the quality of the product.
Concerns have also been expressed over the years about the safety of
ingredients. Some consumer organisations have pointed out the
deterioration of the quality of bread as a result of the amount of
water introduced into bread production, which has undermined the
nutritional benefits from eating bread and has had an impact on the
population’s health.</hs_Para>

anxiety is that the same sort of pressure has been applied to the
baking industry. The result for members of the bakers’ union has
been reductions in wages and job cuts, and the reduction in overall pay
means that this sector has significant levels of low pay; in fact, it
is one of the most low-paid sectors in our industry at the moment.
Another impact of that pressure is deteriorating working conditions and
terms of employment. Bakers have expressed the concern that skills
within the sector have been undermined, too. With people’s
potential to be upskilled undermined, it means further pressure on
wages.</hs_Para>

are vulnerable workers, therefore, and they are fearful of raising

deteriorating conditions in the industry.

bakers’ union welcomes clause 13, which enables the adjudicator

issues arise over time. It is important, however, that this process is
seen to be open and transparent. That is what amendment 3 is designed
to achieve. It would simply ensure that the Office of Fair Trading is
required to publish its response to the recommendations in the
groceries code adjudicator’s review. The response should explain
whether the OFT has acted on those recommendations. The amendment would

amendment such as mine was unnecessary, and would not give the Bill any
additional force. She suggested that if the OFT repeatedly failed to
act on the adjudicator’s recommendations, two routes would be
available. Select Committees, she said, would have “a role to

a judicial review of the OFT, in particular to establish whether it was

impossible that it would succeed on reasonableness grounds, especially
in the context of the OFT’s powers and the broad range of

understand the reason for the Minister’s responses in Committee.
I realise that she does not want to over-bureaucratise the process.
However, I think that the world has changed and moved on since the
Committee stage. There has been, for instance, the issue of public
concern about the content of consumer goods following the horsemeat
scandal. People expect the Government to be decisive, as well as open
and transparent, in tidying up the current mess, but in the long term
they expect a system that will monitor the operations of the
supermarkets and other parts of the grocery supply chain. It is

openly, transparently and effectively, and that is what my amendment

give the OFT a duty to report on whether or not it has acted on a
recommendation from the groceries code adjudicator or has taken it into
account, that demonstrates the weakness of the Bill. The amendment does
not even require a detailed report giving reasons for the OFT’s
decision, although there will probably be a public clamour for such a
requirement following the rejection of a recommendation. This is a
simple, minor amendment, which I think the House would be expected to

logic of saying that there are some very large food producers in the
world whose market dominance is such that they do not need the
protection of the Bill. However, I think that a careful reading of it
demonstrates that it will ensure that the instances cited by my hon.
Friend will not actually come to pass. I remind him of my earlier
point—which was endorsed, in different terms, by the hon. Member
for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)—that this was purely about the
groceries code adjudicator. Many of the businesses listed by my hon.
Friend may be only partly involved in groceries. For instance, a number
of the products of Procter &amp; Gamble, about which he spoke at
length, are not grocery products. Moreover, the trading arms of big
multinational conglomerates are likely, as individual suppliers, to be
much smaller

me now deal with a point of principle raised by my hon. Friend. He
sought to pour scorn on those of us who are also Conservative Members,
but who support the Bill. He said that he was entirely in favour of a
free market. I too am in favour of a free market, but I also believe in
a fair market. If we took the definition of a free market to its
extreme, which my hon. Friend came close to doing, we would end up with
a single retailer and a single supplier, because that it is the
eventual aim. 
<?notus-xml column=203?>The game of Monopoly is the arch-example of a total, unfettered free
enterprise. I strongly believe, not that markets must be regulated, but
that when there is a clear imbalance in a market, some element of
fairness is necessary. I remind my hon. Friend that one of the great

James Paice:</Member></B> I will come to that specific point, but let
me first deal with the more philosophical point raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Shipley, who made clear that he did not consider
those of us who share these Benches with him to be true Conservatives
if we supported the Bill. I wish to rebut that view. The Bill is
necessary because—as has just been suggested by my hon. Friend
the Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson)—notwithstanding
what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley, there are
plenty of examples of supermarkets exceeding what I believe to be fair
terms of trade.</hs_Para>

time as a Minister, I had a number of meetings with supermarket chief
executives, either alone or in a group. Most of them—and,
indeed, other senior directors and officials from
supermarkets—would argue, as has my hon. Friend the Member for
Shipley, that there is no need for the Bill, and that they are already
doing everything fairly, above board and properly. I can only conclude
that many chief executives do not know what is being done in their
names by people operating much further down the chain. Reference has
been made to buyers. Since the code was introduced in 2010, there have
been numerous examples, some quite recent, of suppliers being verbally
required by supermarkets to use a nominated haulier, even though the
supplier may be able to find an equally good and competent haulier to
do the job for less money. There are also examples of supermarkets
seeing that a supplier has made a certain amount of profit in one year,
but instead of saying to them, “We think you’re being
excessive and therefore we should pay you slightly less for your
product next year,” which we could all accept, they say they
want a cheque now—today—for £1.5 million or more
before they will even consider doing business with that supplier next
year. That is not acceptable; it is not a moral way of doing business,
which is why I strongly believe the supermarkets need to be
investigated.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T14:20:45"></hs_TimeCode>The debate has

it turned out that he had nothing to do. My attitude is different. I
would be delighted if the adjudicator had nothing to do, because it
would demonstrate that everything was being done in accordance with the
code and that all suppliers were being treated fairly—although I
have to tell my hon. Friend that I do not believe there is any chance
whatever of that being the case. Indeed, a number of cases are already
being brought forward for the adjudicator to deal with, and I have
described a couple 
<?notus-xml column=204?>of them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T14:22:08"></hs_TimeCode>. I think
the threat of such action may well prove to be the answer to our

adjudicator on the basis that the code is in place, as it is clearly
not enforceable through the Office of Fair Trading.</hs_Para>

the Member for St Ives (Andrew George). The Competition
Commission’s reason for all this was to look after the consumer.
The whole thrust of its argument was that shifting risk from the
retailer to the supplier was putting the long-term interests of the
consumer at risk, with the result that while items may be cheaper
today, they may be far more expensive in future, or the supply chain
may no longer exist. That is not in the long-term interests of the
consumer.</hs_Para>

argument, because the situation in this case is the same as it is for
judges: if everybody obeyed the law, we would not need any judges, but
we would still have them, just in case. There is ample evidence that
there will be cases for the adjudicator to adjudicate on, however. The
Bill contains a number of limiting provisions, too: the adjudicator can
decide not to take up a reference; the adjudicator can fine somebody if
the reference has no serious foundation; and the adjudicator’s

the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), and it goes to the heart of
some of the main issues that have been discussed in the House over the
past few months. Our amendment calls on the Government to ensure that

commercial pressures that can be put on suppliers and that drive down
quality and safety, creating possible food scandals, such as the recent
revelations around horsemeat in beef
products.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0002.htm#13022662000462">The
amendment would explicitly enable the adjudicator to include in its

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has been ahead of the UK every

having the adjudicator reporting annually to the OFT on those issues,
steps would be taken before any criminal activity had taken place. That
might be dealt with at a much earlier stage in the process, because the
adjudicator may come across instances where it feels the costs have
been driven down so low as to compromise food safety. Our approach
would allow a supplier to take such issues to the adjudicator, and they
may be included in the adjudicator’s annual report. That might

Of course, only the OFT can change the code, but, critically, 
<?notus-xml column=209?>nothing in the Bill binds it merely to respond to the recommendations.
We are not saying that a binding clause in the Bill should ensure that
the OFT acts on every recommendation, but the OFT should at least be
bound to respond to the recommendations so that the industry has some
transparency on the issues raised in the report.

point in Committee on a number of occasions. The Minister responded
that if the OFT continued to ignore the recommendations, the Government
would step in and do something about it. Indeed, she suggested that
there could be some review of the OFT’s processes. That is all
well and good, and I appreciate the fact that she gave that
reassurance, but we are looking for a two-way dialogue between the

work properly. Indeed, the whole purpose of the groceries code and the
groceries code adjudicator is to ensure that those markets work
properly without a damaging imbalance in the power of the various
factors concerned. The large companies listed by the hon. Gentleman can
look after themselves, and he is right to raise that issue, but they
will not go  to the adjudicator. The adjudicator has been set
up to consider supplier imbalances in market power, as considered by
the Competition Commission. I am sure that the adjudicator would not
wish to consider an imbalance  in the other direction just
because she is not mandated to do so.</hs_Para>

the interests of the very large organisations. If the adjudicator will

agree with my hon. Friend that large companies are big enough, ugly
enough and strong enough to do their own negotiation. That is what will
happen between those suppliers and supermarkets; the groceries code
adjudicator will have no role in those deals or supply contracts. Even
a small producer could agree, if they chose to do so, to supply a
product at below the cost of production. If they were minded to do
that, that would be entirely their decision. They could commit suicide
in that way and the adjudicator would have no role to step in and get
involved in the deal. The only point at which the adjudicator would get
involved would be when the supermarket wanted to change the deal agreed
by the supplier and the retailer. It seems simple to me: Unilever and
other large corporations have the commercial muscle to negotiate a deal
with which they and the retailer are happy. As long as that deal does
not change, no one will get involved. That seems to me to be a system
that will work well and that, through market forces, has worked well
for generations.</hs_Para>

referee and will have the teeth to make sure that the Goliath does not

that the adjudicator’s office will intentionally be small, mean
and lean. It will not be some behemoth, as the hon. Members
who spoke to new clauses 1, 2 and 3 suggested it would be. It is
supposed to be an intelligent organisation that does not go on fishing
expeditions but responds to good intelligence. I suspect that if there
are no cases to follow, the report will be very slim indeed. I suspect
that the adjudicator will not respond to Procter &amp; Gamble or anyone
else if they are asked, “Please look at the power relationship

is at a set moment in time to get rid of the adjudicator, which would
fly in the face of the advice that has come down over years from the
Competition Commission and others that there is a need for such an
adjudicator. Lean and mean, yes, but the hon. Member for Shipley should
have some faith in the adjudicator and, having advertised the position

I do not criticise the length of time and I am glad that the hon.
Gentleman has had the opportunity to expound his arguments. I have no
doubt that he and colleagues who spoke in support of his new clauses
believe firmly in what he was saying and believe that we should have
much more of what he regards as a free market. I am not anti-free
market. The hon. Gentleman may not realise it, but I spent six years
working in the private sector running leisure centres, theatres and so
on. I understand how the free market works. I have worked within it as
a manager and as a business person. I am opposed to the approach that

hon. Member for Shipley challenged Members to go and explain to their
constituents why they would argue against the cheapest possible price.
I will not argue that we should have the cheapest price for every
product on a supermarket shelf if that means sacrificing much-needed
employment protection such as the Gangmasters Licensing Authority or
sacrificing the standards in British agriculture of which we are
rightly proud, such as animal welfare standards and so on. His argument
that we should provide the very cheapest by lowering standards on food
safety, food provenance, nutrition or employment rights is the argument
that has previously exposed to their detriment multinational companies
when they have been caught out for exploitation or low
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T14:56:27"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have only to think back, in a wholly different sector, to some years

us say that a larger operator over the turnover steps forward to the
adjudicator with evidence that does not affect it directly but affects
a series of smaller suppliers right down the chain. Does he seriously
suggest that the adjudicator should not be able to take action on that?
I trust the adjudicator to follow the evidence and identify the power
relationship if the supply chain is being abused. If the evidence comes
from a larger operator, all to the good. I want the adjudicator to step

hon. Members will know, last week, Sodexho, one of the biggest catering
firms in the UK and indeed in Europe, which supplies processed meat to
schools, hospitals and our armed forces, withdrew all its frozen beef
products after discovering adulteration with horsemeat. This is where
the race to the bottom and the aim to be the cheapest of all lead us,
when the cost of horsemeat going into mince is a quarter of that of
good British beef, without appropriate regulation—and
enforcement of that
regulation.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13022662002112" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0002.htm#13022662002112">3

may say, “Well, that only affects poor people shopping the
bargain ranges.” But Sodexho also supplies Royal
Ascot—what was in those hors d’oeuvres that were passed

This is a major issue. In Scotland last week, schools, council leisure

current stocks of frozen beef products after the discovery of
contaminated beef at a school in Lanarkshire.</hs_Para>

and, on the way through its “shopping experience”,

those meatballs have also been withdrawn. We now know that some

than being open, as the big supermarkets have been, and testing, they
have been withdrawing products that they suspect have been adulterated

practice. I understand his wanting to raise the horsemeat scandal
whenever he can, but does he really believe that these
amendments—especially amendment 34, which would require the
adjudicator to report on issues of food safety, food hygiene and food
authenticity—fall within the code of practice? He is proposing

the adjudicator were aware of abuses elsewhere they would expect the
adjudicator to inform the relevant authorities. I shall be interested
in the Government’s response to the amendment, but I would have
thought that there would be almost an obligation on the adjudicator to
report any observed abuse in the management of the

my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South that amendments 34 and 35

suppliers. In my day, I was one of those smaller suppliers, but I did
not come across the practices that have been described as happening in
the supermarkets, where there have been nasty attempts to force the use
of the hauliers demanded by the supermarkets. I did not come across
such things, so I accept that this is a very different

anti-competitive effect.</hs_Para>

Competition Commission found that, through buyer power, the large
retailers were engaging in practices that transferred excessive risk
and unexpected costs to their suppliers, and that this in turn could
reduce the incentive of suppliers to invest and innovate, which would
act against the long-term interests of consumers. It is worth noting
that all six members of the Competition Commission group who undertook
the market investigation into groceries agreed that the transfer of
excessive risks or unexpected costs by grocery retailers to their
suppliers is likely to lessen suppliers’ incentives to invest in
new capacity, products and production processes. If unchecked, those
practices would ultimately have a detrimental effect on consumers.
Paragraph 11.375 of the commission’s report states clearly that
all but one member of the investigation panel considered the
adjudicator essential for the monitoring and enforcement of the code
and that the code on its own would not be enough. That relates to the

adjudicator so that it would be less extensive than the coverage

in principle that is a sensible approach to take. As I have said, the
groceries code was put in place by the Competition Commission, after a
detailed and thorough investigation, to rectify certain features of the
groceries market that were causing long-term detriment to consumers.
The adjudicator’s prime purpose is to enforce the code, so it is
sensible and coherent that they and the code should have the same
coverage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0002.htm#13022662000544"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:22:40"></hs_TimeCode>With
regard to the suggestion in new clause 2 that suppliers with a large
turnover should be excluded, it is important to point out that the
Competition Commission and the Select Committee explicitly considered
that and concluded that excluding certain suppliers would not be
appropriate. The Committee stated in its report that such an approach
“would be impractical” and that because GSCOP applies to
suppliers of all sizes, so should its monitoring enforcement. The
Committee stated that the adjudicator is the gateway to the dispute
resolution procedure, so with no access to the adjudicator large
suppliers would have only the courts for redress, not the arbitration
process, which is also very helpful. If the evidence from large
suppliers on whether retailers are complying cannot be taken into
account, smaller suppliers—this point was made earlier by other
hon. Members—might also lose out because the evidence might be
crucial to the case. According to the Select Committee, large suppliers
might be better able to bring widespread potential breaches to the
adjudicator’s attention than small suppliers. For all those
reasons, it is important that the scope of the adjudicator fits that of
the code.</hs_Para>

wholeheartedly hope that will be the case, but if we find that there
are many breaches of the code, and if the evidence comes from a variety
of sources, the adjudicator will need to look at that and be empowered
to make recommendations and requests, and they will need to be properly
and adequately resourced in order to do so. Therefore, an arbitrary
restriction on who can complain would actually make the
adjudicator’s life harder and, indeed, could increase the risk
of judicial review, so we will reject the new clause and encourage hon.

new clauses 4 and 5, it is fundamentally right that large supermarkets
should treat their suppliers fairly wherever those suppliers are

unfair treatment of suppliers and to cause detriment to consumers,
regardless of whether those suppliers are outside the EU or the UK.
Excluding overseas suppliers would therefore not be helpful to the
fundamental purpose of the provision and would, indeed, undermine it.
The code and the adjudicator complement each other and so they need to
have the same scope. I resisted in Committee amendments that would have
expanded the adjudicator’s role beyond merely enforcing the
code, but I must now also resist amendments that would limit the

incredibly important. I myself suffer from a very severe allergy to
nuts, and  I completely rely on labels on food products being
accurate in order ultimately to stop me from having a life-threatening
anaphylactic reaction. There are very important reasons why this is
very serious and is being taken as such. That is why my ministerial
colleagues in DEFRA have taken strong and decisive action—action
with food businesses, action in Europe, and action in tracking down the
people who have caused this and bringing them to justice.

it is not where the adjudicator’s expertise will be developed;

the House that large retailers are required by the order as it stands
to procure in such a way that all their subsidiaries comply with it as
though they themselves were bound by it. That includes incorporating
the code into supply agreements. If that did not happen, it would
constitute a breach of the order by the large retailer, which is named

not plan to revisit those arguments, but the fundamental question is
whether it is appropriate to single out two particular issues for the
adjudicator to focus on when considering any changes to the code. My
view is that that is not the best way to progress. Clause 13 is widely
drafted, and rightly so. That means that if the adjudicator considers
it appropriate for any changes to be made to the groceries code, he or
she—it is a she at the moment—must recommend them to the
Office of Fair Trading. To single out specific issues would weaken the

out intermediaries would be particularly inappropriate, because it is
unlikely that the code could be amended to include them without a
further investigation by the Competition Commission. The reason for
that is that the legal framework under which the order can be amended
is set out in section 161 of the Enterprise Act 2002. It states that,
in order for that to happen, there must be a change in
circumstances—for example, a new, abusive practice by
retailers—and, indeed, that that change must relate to the
initial adverse effects found  by the Competition Commission,
namely the passing  of excessive risk and unexpected cost to
suppliers. It is

hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) tabled amendment 27 on

intend commencement to take place two months after the Bill receives
Royal Assent. It is, however, usual procedure not to set that out in
legislation, but to allow the Secretary of State discretion to commence
an Act by

I cannot accept, in fact or in spirit, new clause 3, which was tabled
by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:39:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Shipley. I agree that we do not want statutory offices to
continue when they are not needed, and the Government 
<?notus-xml column=224?>have been working according to that principle. Indeed, in accordance
with our general policy on sunsetting, the Bill’s sunset
clause—clause 15—means that the Secretary of State must
review the adjudicator every three years and may decide, if
appropriate, to abolish the office. However, proposing an arbitrary end
to the Act is not appropriate. If, in seven years’ time, the
problems with large retailers that have led to the creation of the Bill
and the adjudicator persist, we would not want the Act to be repealed
automatically. I reassure Members that the Secretary of State will be
rigorous in reviewing this matter. I believe that that is a much better
way to ensure that statutory offices do not continue

hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) who, as he has made
clear, came to listen to the debate before making his mind up. He has
decided that if new clause 2 was not accepted, we would be in the
ludicrous situation whereby retailers with a turnover of more than
£1 billion will be subject to the code, but can be
taken to the adjudicator by suppliers with a turnover of more than
£1 billion who are perfectly big and capable enough to look

Friend the Member for Wellingborough came to the debate with an open

already decided what the Government’s view was and that the
Report stage of the Bill was a completely pointless exercise. Perhaps
that is why we have had only three hours to discuss all of
today’s proposals. She made it abundantly clear that she was not
prepared to listen to the debate or to any arguments because the
Competition Commission had told her what she should say and she was not
prepared to deviate from that. That makes a farce of having Report

my capacity as Chair of the Select Committee on Business, Innovation
and Skills I often need to berate Ministers for not doing what the
Committee’s in-depth research has demonstrated to be necessary.
On this occasion, although the Under-Secretary had concerns about some
of our recommendations, on reflection she pretty much adopted whatever
the Committee said was appropriate. Just as I berate Ministers on
occasion, I want publicly to thank the Under-Secretary for her
flexibility and reasonableness.</hs_Para>

Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Sir James Paice). I can

<?notus-xml column=237?>reveal that there was a conspiracy within government, of which I was

the Member for St Ives (Andrew George), and he has campaigned

I am trying to be as consensual as possible, that I know from what my

Opposition Front Bench made debates in Committee enjoyable and that
they made a genuine contribution. As they know, we have listened to
what they have had to say and have on occasion been able to agree with
them. That goes for

that I have awarded bouquets around the House, I want simply to say
that the Bill establishes an adjudicator to enforce the groceries
supply code of practice. As recommended by the Competition
Commission’s market investigation in 2008, the adjudicator will
ensure that large retailers treat their direct suppliers lawfully and
fairly. The adjudicator will be able to receive anonymous complaints
from any source and may decide to launch an investigation if it is felt
that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the code has been
broken. We anticipate there will be around two to four investigations
per year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:28:47"></hs_TimeCode> and if
the adjudicator is satisfied that the code has been broken, a range of
sanctions will be available. The adjudicator can make recommendations
to a retailer, require it to publish details of the breach, and, in the
most egregious cases, impose a financial
penalty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:28:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:28:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662001984" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662001984">We

Christine Tacon has a wide range of experience in the groceries sector,
has held senior corporate roles in retailers and direct suppliers and
spent 11 years as managing director of Co-operative Farms, the largest
farming operation in the UK. Members will be pleased to note that she
will undergo her pre-appointment hearing with the Business, Innovation
and Skills Committee tomorrow, although Ministers retain the final
decision on her appointment. We are confident, and we hope that the
Committee agrees, that she will be an excellent adjudicator.</hs_Para>

the BIS Select Committee because it would be a dereliction of their
parliamentary duty and was not an important enough position to be
subject to a Select Committee pre-appointment hearing. I am delighted
that Ministers have come round to our way of thinking. I am also
delighted that they came round to the way of thinking of the other
place by putting trade associations into the Bill. The Bill is far

part of the country. The hon. Gentleman used the example in Committee
of the dairy farmers dispute. In fact, that dispute would not have been
covered even if the adjudicator had been in place, because there had
not been a breach of the code. That example was interesting in terms of
trying to keep the code live and make sure it is as responsive to the
industry as possible—not just to the suppliers. The hon. Member
for Shipley (Philip Davies) made some important points. It needs to be
responsive to the supermarkets. They make such a considerable
contribution to our economy, and we must not forget the role they play.

named in his speech, but he was wrong to say that my private
Member’s Bill fell on deaf ears. It fell on some deaf ears among
the Liberal Democrats, some in the Conservative party and, yes, some in
my party. But I was able to build a consensus on the issue. The reason
it did not reach the statute book—as you will recall, Mr Deputy
Speaker, as someone who was on the Committee for its very quick single
sitting—was that occupational hazard for Members of Parliament
known as a general election. But before the election we were able to

have portrayed the Bill as supermarket knocking or bashing. I hope that

brought before the consumer a great range of products that might never
otherwise have been available, in a competitive environment. However,
there are people within the supermarket structures, as I touched on in
an earlier intervention, who are perhaps acting with excessive zeal
and, I am quite certain, going outside the terms of the code. I am not
at all surprised if people much higher up the management structures are
not aware of what is being done lower down by those who want to make
their names as competitive buyers. I hope the Bill will be sufficient
to ensure that such malpractices are stamped out, because I am sure
they are not what most people want to see. As I said earlier, I feel

Bill would make some relatively minor changes to street trading
controls in the City of London and to the law on the walkways within
the square mile. The only place where street trading can take place in
the City is on Middlesex street, as part of the famous Petticoat lane
market. The limitation on street trading can be traced back over a
century and is reflected in the City’s current local
legislation, which confines such activities to the street market on
Middlesex street.</hs_Para>

reason for the City’s particular code lies in its
demography—it is primarily a business area, not a residential
one—and the unique demands that that imposes.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:46:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Members
will be well aware, the City was not always almost entirely a place of
offices and of the commercial sphere. Until the rise of the railways,
it was a significant residential area. It was home to more than 130,000
residents in 1801, but there was a precipitate drop as the railways
emerged in the 1830s and 1840s, and the impact of the second world war,
in particular, ensured that much of the residential population is now
in the Barbican
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:47:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002026">However,
London’s attractiveness as a tourist destination and the greater
accessibility of the St Paul’s area via the Millennium bridge
from Tate Modern at Bankside brings large numbers of tourists on a
daily and hourly basis from south of the river. That has meant an
increased demand for retail development around New Change and some
retail development in the Broadgate area, and I suspect that before the
world is too much older there may yet be further retail development in
the area around Aldgate. It is development in the area around St
Paul’s cathedral, in particular, and the New Change area
adjacent to it, that has prompted a review of the existing code. The
aim has been to try to meet the needs that the changes are generating
while at the same time preserving the essentially business environment
that the City needs in order to
prosper.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002027">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:48:29"></hs_TimeCode>
consequence, the City of London corporation now wants to utilise the
Bill to liberalise the regime in two specific respects. First, the Bill
is designed to enable temporary street trading licences to be issued to
enable the use of public thoroughfares, such as Cheapside,
for street markets and similar events. The new retail
development at New Change, beside St Paul’s, aims to attract
shoppers not just during the week, but at weekends. It provides a
particular prompt because such liberalisation would enable promotional
activities to be held. Of course, the timing of such events would have
to be carefully managed because, as is well known, the City is
relatively empty on most weekends.</hs_Para>

the Bill would allow ice cream and related products to be sold outside
food premises. That, too, is prompted by increased tourist demand,
particularly in the vicinity of St Paul’s. It is difficult to
imagine the consumption of ice cream as an attraction at the moment,
given the cold winter we are having, but I hope that it will be only a
matter of weeks or, being pessimistic, months until that will prove
extremely welcome.</hs_Para>

new regulatory changes are balanced by provisions for more effective
enforcement of the street trading controls, including an increase in
the maximum fine to the level that applies elsewhere in London and
extension into the City of the powers available in other London
boroughs to seize goods and property used in connection with unlawful
street trading.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>I am well aware

Field:</Member></B> As I said, there is a case to be made that the City
of London is a different sort of local authority in a different sort of
area given the preponderance of office space rather than residential
space and its character as a business quarter. The corporation has
tried to ensure that we encourage tourism. It is obviously in
everyone’s interests to have a large amount of tourism
throughout the UK, and attractions such as St Paul’s cathedral
will remain of global importance. However, there is also a recognition
that the square mile—the area of the City of London—is
rather unusual in this regard. Therefore, the very limited changes
proposed in the Bill should apply to the City despite the great efforts
that my hon. Friend has made to ensure that such changes are not made
in places as far flung as Reading, Canterbury and
Nottingham<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:52:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002033">These
powers are intended not least to deal with the problem of ice cream
vans trading illegally in the City—a rather small category of
pedlarship, as my hon. Friend will recognise. These illegal traders
have given rise to numerous complaints from the public, from schools,
from businesses, and indeed from the chapter of St
Paul’s cathedral. The City has brought cases against some
traders, but the maximum fines that can be imposed have not, on their
own, been adequate to deter this activity. That is why we are moving
beyond the idea of a maximum fine to try to create a new power of
seizure so that we can properly enforce the rules that are already in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:52:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="13022662003879" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662003879">Mr

reason why prosecution is such an ineffective means of dealing with
these things is that the fines are so derisory. The fine is currently
set at level 2—only £500—and we are trying to
raise it to the new maximum level of £1,000. However, even at
that level it is so nugatory that the power of seizure would be more
effective. As my hon. Friend is aware, the sheer cost of starting a
legal action is outweighed manifold by the moneys that can be brought
in through
fines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:53:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002037">The
European Union services directive has been raised in connection with
the Canterbury City Council Bill and other recent local Bills. I
thought that it might be helpful if I went into that in a little more
detail than I had intended at this stage, having been prompted to do so
by a brief discussion with my hon. Friend earlier. As Members are well
aware, the EU services directive came into force on 28 December 2009.
In respect of the City of London, the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills accepted in correspondence some two years ago
that the general prohibition on street trading can stay. It

think that, by virtue of recital 9 to the Directive, there is a
reasonable argument that a complete prohibition on street trading, as

Wilcox raised three issues on Second Reading in the Lords. One of them
is pertinent to this debate and I will put it on the record, because I
know that my hon. Friend would want to address and it would make sense
for me to do so now rather than in response to further interventions.
The issue is whether a provision restricting ice cream street sales to
a business occupier might indirectly be discriminatory against
temporary service providers who have no established premises in the UK.
I accept that this remains a live issue to an
extent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002039">BIS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:59:41"></hs_TimeCode>
set out some of the concerns in correspondence in July 2011 and
suggested that most business occupiers in the City would be UK
nationals or companies, and that the provision could therefore be seen
to be indirectly discriminatory. The Department also recognised that
for temporary service providers—in other words, someone who is
not established here—the requirement is not likely to meet the
directive’s necessity and proportionality principles. Indeed,
the Department suggested that we take independent legal advice on the
issue and, following a meeting with BIS in September 2011, the City
corporation sought the opinion of leading counsel, which was sent to
BIS in the past few weeks. On 14 February, BIS indicated
that it “may disagree” with the opinion and confirmed as
much on 19 February, but without giving any reasons beyond stating that
the opinion had not changed its view that clause 9 is likely to be
considered as indirectly discriminatory in the context of service
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002040">I
hope the House will forgive me if I go into some detail, not just on
leading counsel’s case, but more importantly on why we feel that
this issue could and should properly be dealt with in Committee rather
than by delaying this Second Reading. Leading counsel’s advice
was, in summary, that the intended beneficiaries of the Bill are
sellers or suppliers of food who are being allowed to trade a little
way outside the premises that they occupy, that the commercial activity
taking place  
<?notus-xml column=246?>in the street is a spill-over from that which is carried out in the
associated premises, and that it is, therefore, clearly distinguishable
from the right to sell ice cream as a street trader. As a result, such
activity is subject to provisions on the freedom of establishment in
the EU services directive. The counsel further advised that that is
compatible with the provision in the services directive, as there is no
restriction on who may open a food business in the
City.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002041">Likewise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:59:41"></hs_TimeCode>,
the Bill does not make it any harder to open such establishments. In
fact, many of the food businesses in the City of London are operated by
nationals of other member states. Indeed, anyone who has tried to buy a
coffee or a sandwich in a shop in the City will know that it is almost
impossible to find anyone who  is not a national of another
state working in such an
establishment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:57:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002042">For
the specific purposes of this Second Reading, we strongly
believe—I hope that this will satisfy my hon. Friend—that
this does not affect any of the Bill’s provisions, particularly
the provision of temporary street trading licences, about which I will
say more in a moment. Therefore, the corporation will seek the views of
businesses and discuss the issue with them. As has been said, similar
elements were struck out of Bills relating to Canterbury, Reading and
Nottingham, but we feel that there is a special case for the City of
London and, given counsel’s opinion, we hope that we will
prevail in
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:58:30"></hs_TimeCode>. This

Field:</Member></B> I very much share my hon. Friend’s concern
about the lack of clarity and about the fact that, given that this has
been in play for three years, the implications were not addressed in
advance. Too much legislation from Europe seems to get through on the
nod and the problems of compatibility only become apparent at a later
stage. As I have said, a question remains, but we have received strong
advice from leading counsel and hope that we will prevail on this

Field:</Member></B> The Committee stage is clearly not imminent, so
there will hopefully be time for fully fledged discussions in which the
corporation can make its case robustly, given the opinion that we have
received from counsel. That will provide the opportunity for
amendments, but one would hope that they will not be needed and that
the case can be smoothed over in advance of Committee stage. I will
willingly do that on behalf of the corporation to try to get the Bill
through the Committee stage, whenever such further proceedings can be

believe that the corporation is right in its view that the street
trading provisions in the Bill are consistent with the directive. The
Government, in the shape of Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills officials, have indicated that they are content on two of the
three main points that have been raised, although they have recently
expressed concerns about the third point, which we have already
discussed. Clearly, it would not be in anyone’s interest, least
of all the City corporation as promoter of the Bill, to do anything
that could reasonably be regarded as contrary to EU law. We therefore
need to get clarification on this
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:02:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002049">I
will go through the Bill in a little more detail. The substantive
provisions begin with clauses 3 to 5, which make provision for
temporary street trading licences. Those licences will last for up to
21 days and may be granted for any area in the City other than
Middlesex street. The organisers of an event would be able
to apply for a licence on behalf of any number of street
traders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:02:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002050">Clause
6 will bring the maximum fine for illegal street trading in the City
into line with the rest of London. Currently, the maximum fine in the
City is a level 2 fine of £500, whereas for the rest of London
it is a level 3 fine of £1,000. That is a straightforward
measure to harmonise the
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:02:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002051">Clause
7 provides for the seizure and forfeiture of vehicles and goods used
for the purpose of unlawful street trading. As I have said, this is in
substance the same set of powers that exists in the rest of Greater
London under the London Local Authorities Act 2007, which introduced a
new enforcement regime into the street trading code laid down by the
London Local Authorities Act 1990. Seized property may be forfeited to
the court or sold to meet an award of costs on the conviction of a
person for the offence. Otherwise, it must generally be returned to the
person from whom it was seized.
Provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:03:46"></hs_TimeCode> is
made in the Bill for the disposal of property that cannot be returned
and for compensation for any unlawful seizure. Special provision is
made for the return or disposal of motor vehicles or perishable
items<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:03:52"></hs_TimeCode>. Clause 7
also enables a fixed penalty notice to be given for illegal street
trading, as can happen in the rest of Greater London and areas outside
the
capital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:04:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002052">Clause
8 will end the need to enact a byelaw to vary the charges that apply to
street traders. That procedure is so cumbersome that the charge for
street traders in the City has remained unchanged for the past 24
years. It seems to me that only MPs’ salaries have remained
unchanged for the same length of time. Perhaps I am exaggerating
slightly. However, the charge has remained unchanged at £15,
which contrasts with the charge for street trading imposed in, for
example, the neighbouring 
<?notus-xml column=248?>Tower Hamlets, which is £32. I should say that Middlesex street
is bisected by the boundary—it runs from north-west to
south-east, and the southern side is in the City of London and the
northern side in Tower Hamlets. It would make sense to harmonise the
charges<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:04:56"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:04:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="13022662003885" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662003885">Mr

before my time as a Member of Parliament, and it did not strike me that
there was an immense difference at that time, although that was some
time ago. Notwithstanding the different charges, there did not seem to
be a particular disincentive to have a stall in Tower Hamlets rather
than in the City of London. I should perhaps stress to my hon. Friend
that the charge is designed only to reflect relevant costs, but having
been set at £15 since 1989, putting it up to £32 does not
seem a huge imposition on those who would trade on the City side of

9 will enable food premises to sell ice creams from stalls or
dispensers on the public highway outside the premises. If approved, a
stall may be set up within 15 metres of the business premises. That
distance was chosen as a reasonable outer limit given the nature of the
public areas in which the sale of ice cream might take place. If a
location closer to the premises were deemed more appropriate by the
House, I believe that could be set out by the

clause 10 will make two small changes to the law on City walkways. I
should say that walkways are neither footpaths nor highways in the
conventional sense but private access ways over which the public are
given a right to pass on foot. The concept was initiated by the City in
a private Bill enacted as long ago as 1967. Walkways are found, for
example, in the Barbican. In the immediate aftermath of the second
world war, as part of the rebuilding following the bombing, there was
the dream of creating the Barbican, and indeed the dream of creating a
business district within the City of London with relatively few
residents. Pedways were envisaged at first-floor level, not just in the
Barbican but beyond. The clause will enable the corporation
to impose a charge to recoup administrative costs
incurred whenever a landowner requests a new declaration or
a variation of a
walkway<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:07:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
second element of clause 10 will enable a fixed penalty
notice to be issued when there is unlawful parking on a City walkway,

footpath<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:07:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022662002057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022662002057">The
Bill is a modest measure aimed at relaxing the existing street trading
code in the City of London to provide important flexibility. It will
enhance the attractiveness and vitality of the City both for its
residents—for the first time in more than two centuries we saw
an increase in the residential population of the City of London in the
most recent census—and for those work in and visit the City. As
I have said, the emergence of New Change as a new shopping centre means
that the City will become a more attractive place over weekends, and
more and more shops there are open on Saturdays and Sundays. I

as hon. Members will know, traditionally the Government neither support
nor oppose private Bills unless for some reason they contain provisions

Government’s role to bring such matters to the attention of the

some developments on the issue, the promoters of the Bill have not yet
been able to satisfy us that all the concerns that we raised have been
satisfactorily addressed. The good news, however, is that whereas back
in 2011 we had several concerns about the Bill’s compatibility
with the directive, now we have only one. The remaining concern relates
to clause 9, which seeks to allow only those with business premises to
sell ice cream from a receptacle outside those premises. The
Government’s view has been that the clause does not comply with
the services directive, because it may indirectly discriminate against
non-UK nationals. Our concern, therefore, remains the same as in

I appreciate that the promoters of the Bill have sought external legal
opinion to support their contention that clause 9 is compliant. As had
been said, it has recently been given to the Department. The Government
are looking at it and we hope it will be possible to reach agreement
before the Committee stage. If there cannot be agreement, then in that
scenario we would be compelled to submit a report to the House setting
out the legal reasons why we believe that clause 9 does not comply with
the services directive. I think it is helpful for the House to be aware
that discussions on legal clarity are

formal process. If the Government think there is a legal
problem—that the Bill is not compatible with provisions that we
are signed up to—we will report against it. We hope to be able
to reach agreement before Committee, but we will keep the House
informed at every stage. That will enable the House to assess these
issues in the light of the Government’s advice and assessment of
the legal situation. This is ongoing. The new legal opinion has been
produced and must be considered properly. However, I wanted to ensure
that the issue was flagged to the House so that if the Government must
issue such a report, it will not be a surprise. It might well yet be
that that does not come to pass.

think of the streets of my own city of Edinburgh, which is vibrant with
street traders selling things. The clause is peculiar, given that it is
limited to ice cream, but the clarity the Minister has provided on

Indeed, I am sure street traders up and down the country will be
wondering why it is so cheap in the City of London and not in their own

an approved receptacle or place of sale, then we are willing to support
it. We do not have any objections.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=251?>from the EU services directive. When that directive was implemented,

do away with pedlary altogether and, given the issue about equal access

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:18:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field) referred,
might itself be a good reason why the City should retain its
distinctive position—perhaps slightly aloof from other London
boroughs. I do not know how he would describe it, but it is certainly
different—and proud to be different—and just because some
boroughs seem to have been heavy-handed in how they deal with
enforcement and forfeiture, that is no reason why the same should apply
in the City of London.

hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that we already accept that, so
far as pedlary is concerned, a different set of rules has applied in
the City of London for more than a century. The question is: why did
the City of London suddenly want to impose a maximum fine of
£1,000, rather than £500, simply to harmonise with other
local authorities? My fear is that even £1,000 would be
insufficient as a disincentive without commensurate powers of seizure

been given or the number of offences that had not been prosecuted for
one reason or another. During our discussions on the various pedlary

exorbitant. The fact that £1,000 would be the maximum amount
that a persistent offender could be fined is therefore a strong
disincentive. My hon. Friend will be aware that a hamburger van or ice
cream van in central London can make a huge amount of money in a very
short time, given the through-flow of people on the streets. It is a
matter of concern—certainly in principle, although there is not
necessarily any evidence—about the numbers of people who have
gone through the whole legal process, given the fact that the New
Change shopping parade has now been updated. It has been up and running
only for the past 18 months, but its emergence will make the City of
London a more attractive proposition for a significant number of
tourists at weekends. I am afraid that the area could therefore attract
more illegal ice cream sellers, and it is as a result of those concerns
that we feel the need to move ahead. As I have said, the City of London

effectively a liberating provision when compared with the current

relaxation of the restrictive code. I am not going to argue against

Chope:</Member></B> I think my hon. Friend knows the answer to that: I
would like to see a much more relaxed arrangement. Any relaxation,
however, is probably better than none. It is important for
people to be able to enter the marketplace as business men without the
need for much capital. I view that as fundamental in an entrepreneurial
society. The City of London obviously 
<?notus-xml column=253?>epitomises the entrepreneurial society, which is why it is good for the
City of London to encourage street traders and people starting out in
their business life and career to be able to show what they are worth,
perhaps initially by getting a street trading licence, perhaps
operating like interns on a temporary basis and seeing how it goes. I
believe that clause 3 is—I hope I do not have to eat these words
later—a clause for good, so I support it.</hs_Para>

issue of temporary licences is not one that greatly concerns me, but I
am concerned about whether the case for increased penalties has been
made. It is easy to say that it is expensive to prosecute. We know that
companies will say, “We do not prosecute people who are
shoplifters because it is not worth the candle. It will cost us too
much to prosecute and when we get people before the courts, the fines
will be so derisory that we will not achieve much purpose and we will
have been put to a lot of needless expense.” That argument is
often put forward on behalf of public authorities, which are funded by
local or national taxpayer resources.</hs_Para>

said all that, this country is one that believes in the rule of law,
and I would have thought that an important principle of the rule of law
is that if an enforcement authority feels that breaches of specific
local byelaws or local legislation are to the detriment of the people
living in the area, it should be quite happy to prosecute, recognising
that a cost is associated with that. Ultimately, the taxpayer pays a
lot of money for prosecuting people and even more money if those people
are convicted and sentenced to prison, but we do not say that it is not
a good thing to do that, as it is an important matter of principle. I
am not impressed, in respect of clause 6, with the idea that
prosecuting authorities should not bring prosecutions just because they
think it is not financially expedient to do so on the grounds that
insufficient money will come back to them. Apart from anything else,
the penalties that will be increased will be court penalties; as I
understand it, they will not be to the benefit of City of London local
council tax payers. The penalties would go to helping to meet the costs
of the national Exchequer, as they are pooled for very understandable
reasons. In the absence of hard evidence, I am not convinced of the
case for increasing the penalties as set out in clause
6<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:28:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022691000012">I
have a much greater problem with clause 7. As I said in an
intervention, the provisions on enforcement of seizure, the return of
seized items, compensation, forfeiture of seized items, seizure of
perishable articles, motor vehicles and disposal orders have been
considered on a number of occasions by Members, most recently
in respect of four private Bills promoted by the city of
Leeds, the city of Nottingham, the city of Canterbury and Reading
borough council. Those provisions were removed from all four Bills. My
hon. Friend may say, “Ah, but this Bill relates to London, and
the same provisions have been passed in the case of other London local

Meanwhile, in their consultation paper, the Government have proposed
national legislation or regulation changes that local authorities can

a uniform regime covering issues such as this—issues of
reasonable grounds for belief or suspicion, for instance—along
with standard tests that would apply to the whole street trading regime

not say that the vehicle must have been used by the same person in the
commission of such an offence. It could have been acquired in all
innocence from a previous ice cream vendor in market overt, in an
auction or by a private treaty sale. The vehicle’s new owner
would not know that it had been used in the commissioning of an offence
in the past, so he would be penalised because, unknown to him, the
vehicle had been used in such a way. Surely that would be unreasonable.
If the EU services directive wants to create level playing fields, I
urge my hon. Friend the Minister to consider whether there should be a
level playing field, which we do not have at the moment, between those
who have purchased ice cream vans but find out later that they have
been used in connection with an offence in the City of London and those
who purchase ice cream vans that have not been used for such offences.

is designed to operate. The vagaries of the British weather mean that
the period of time in which anyone would want to sell ice cream is
often limited, but if someone committed an offence over a period of two
or three months of hot summer weather and had their ice cream van
seized, it would mean that they could not get it back every three days
and continue with impunity to commit another offence before the
constable impounded it again. The intention is simply to ensure that
someone who has committed an offence should not be entitled to continue
to do so simply because the wheels of the legal process take a long
time to work. That is what the measure is designed to do and it is
quite common in a range of areas, not just with ice cream

By 14 February a holding reply had been issued. By 19

the situation should have been anticipated  by BIS a long time

definitive ruling on whether the directive applies in such a way as to
negate the legitimate aspiration of the City of London to enable people
who already have businesses operating in the City of London to extend
those businesses for the purpose of selling ice creams when the season
is right. We must be absolutely mad if we think that should be outlawed
because it might indirectly discriminate against non-EU nationals. I
invite the Minister to let his imagination run riot and envisage any
other legislature in the European Union stating that it would be wrong
to bring in such a provision enabling their own people to engage in
enterprise because it might indirectly discriminate against Brits, for
example. I cannot believe that such an argument would be given the time

there are some that I am not so happy about and some issues that I
think need to be resolved. I am not minded to oppose the Bill’s
Second Reading, because I think that my hon. Friend brings a
constructive approach to these debates, which is no more nor no less
than we would expect of him and, certainly, of the City of London
itself. It recognises that some of us believe that these Bills are
better discussed, rather than pushed through without proper discussion.

Part of this process is designed to help save the time of hard-pressed

the West Yorkshire constabulary as it does to the City of London. I
assure the House that any officer exercising a power of seizure or
issuing a fixed penalty notice will receive proper training. The
corporation ensures that that applies to all current staff in cases
involving, for example, litter offences and highway obstructions. My
hon. Friend can be assured that council employees will receive proper
training through training sessions in order to be made aware of their

it is his intention. However, the people who run the City of London

where we are levying a maximum penalty, but if the goods exceed that

It might have a much longer date. I am not sure, therefore, why we have
only got 48 hours for all perishable goods, irrespective of how long

everything being sold will go off within 48 hours, but that clearly

Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster can help
me—the Bill does not make it clear who would pay for the
seizure, transportation, storage and return of the vehicle concerned.
When the police seize or confiscate a vehicle—for example, when
people are driving around without any insurance—they bring in a
transport company to take it away and lock it up, and people must pay a
release charge to get the car back again.
Presumably<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:38:02"></hs_TimeCode>, the
corporation would have to go through the same kind of operation. It
would not just leave the vehicle where it was, because presumably that
is the whole point—it was causing an obstruction or should not
have been there, and so the corporation would want to move
it.</hs_Para>

the corporation uses the provisions to bring in a garage to tow away

the Bill who would be liable for meeting the cost. Would the cost fall
on the trader or the corporation? If the cost was incurred by the
trader, but it was later shown that no offence had been committed,
would the corporation reimburse the trader?
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:38:57"></hs_TimeCode> far as I can
see—I stand to be corrected—the Bill does not make any of
those things clear. It would be particularly helpful, therefore, if we
could have some clarity. It is bad enough someone having their vehicle
seized, if no offence has been committed, but if they

the importance of the City of London Corporation. It is an anomalous
organisation, in that the City is the only area that still retains a

the next month. The City takes very seriously its responsibilities
beyond the square mile, and takes great pride in the work that it does
in the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Islington,
which make up the City fringe. We all benefit as Londoners from the

long cross-party and cross-estuary campaign to get action taken on the
very high tolls on the Humber bridge. As we know, this was successful
when we received a grant from the Chancellor of £150
million to enable the tolls to be halved. That has had a huge impact on
the numbers crossing the bridge, which was absolutely necessary given
the challenges in the region, with two of the poorest boroughs in the
country.</hs_Para>

want to refer in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:47:31"></hs_TimeCode>
a little detail to some of the changes introduced by the Bill and to
explain their necessity. Somebody once said to me that the bridge was
built on the back of a 1950s Bill, constructed in the 1970s and opened
in the 1980s. Indeed, I was three years old when it opened, and we have
worked out that my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes was nine when
the original Bill for the construction of the bridge was introduced
back in 1959. The bridge board building has been constructed for some
considerable time, and those who have visited it will appreciate that;
it is almost in a time warp and is like stepping back in
time.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022691000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0003.htm#13022691000169"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:47:58"></hs_TimeCode>There
used to be 22 members from the various local authorities serving on the
bridge board, and I declare an interest as a former member of that
board. I was not one of the 22 members, but one of the 22 reserve
members—in total, we had 44 potential members of the Humber
bridge board representing the four local authorities in the region. It
has to be said that the local authorities were different at that time.
It was an unwieldy institution, and the Bill will formally reduce
membership to four and add two members from the private sector, which
we all believe is necessary to give the bridge a new look and a new
drive. Those two additional members will be drawn from the business
community, and there is provision 
<?notus-xml column=273?>to allow for their reasonable expenses. This might have been a cause of
concern to some people, but I assure Members that the four members of
the local authorities will continue to draw their expenses for
attending the bridge board from the local authority remuneration
scheme, and there is no intention at all to draw any salaries or
additional expenses from the Humber bridge board. This provision is
necessary just for the out-of-pocket expenses of the two private sector
members, so that they can reclaim their travel expenses, which they
cannot do at the moment. There is no intention of creating director
salaries for the local authority members.</hs_Para>

could be argued that the bridge is more advantageous to people living
on the south bank of the Humber, but at present 98% of liability for
the burden of debt lies with the city of Hull because of the way in
which it was constructed. Protracted negotiations took place involving
one authority in particular, but the objections of that authority were
overcome. It was agreed that the bridge was of equal importance to all
four, and that the burden should therefore be shared equally between
them.</hs_Para>

primary focus will always be whether the bridge board’s finances
are sound and whether it can repay the debt, which is its No. 1 legal
responsibility. That is done through the tolls, as has always been the
case. It is not done at general expense to the taxpayer. Indeed, we
have paid for the bridge four times over and still owe about
£150 million. The situation in respect of tolls will be

is said that the way to bring two communities together is to build a
bridge. We did that to bring the communities of east Yorkshire and
north Lincolnshire together. In a way, that bridge became a cause of

economic development potential of the region. This Bill changes that,

participate in the economic development of our sub-region.</hs_Para>

of the tolls and because of the archaic, centralised and almost
Stalinist way in which the Humber Bridge Board was set up—it was
a creature of its post-war time—it was impossible to use that
bridge between the two communities to maximise our economic potential.
Now, with the local enterprise partnership, with an emphasis on
localism, we are determined to make that work. We have done an awful
lot by halving the bridge tolls, which is very important, but we need
to set up a new structure, reducing the 22 board members to four local
authority members—and we need to include all the local
authorities, because one was not included under the current structure.
We also need to add to that the knowledge and expertise of the business
community. Allowing those things to happen will mean that we can

Chelmsford (Mr Burns). We see the Bill as an essential part of a
sustainable settlement for the management and finances of the Humber
bridge to endure for the next 25 years or so. This is the outcome of
considerable work by all the local MPs—of all parties—the
four Humber area local authorities and the Humber Bridge Board, working
together to respond positively to the Government’s Humber bridge
review. I would like to record my appreciation of that
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000196">The
Government launched the Humber bridge review on 14 June 2011. We
consulted widely, and completed work on assessing the economic impacts
of the bridge, and the level of its tolls, on the Humber area economy.
We announced our conclusions on 29 November 2011. The Government
recognised that the Humber bridge has a unique history, and had a
unique burden of interest relative to its construction cost, and
therefore offered to write down some £150 million of the bridge
debt. That was conditional on the bridge board and local authorities
submitting a proposal for reform of the structure of the bridge board,
and the Humber area local authorities taking on full responsibility for
the remaining lower level of debt, and sharing that responsibility out
much more broadly and realistically between
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000197">The
bridge board and local authorities responded positively, and came
forward with a proposal for reforms, which the Government accepted, and
a deal was struck on 29 February 2012, almost a year ago to the day.
Some of those reforms could be enacted by the Government with secondary
legislation, and that was done during 2012, as I will describe. Other
reforms required primary legislation, and the Government agreed to
support a private Bill to be promoted by the bridge board to achieve
them—that Bill is what we are supporting today.</hs_Para>

at the reform package as a whole, the core principles for the
governance of the bridge set by the Humber Bridge Act 1959 do not
change. The first of those is that the bridge is owned by the Humber
area community through the Humber Bridge Board, with democratic
accountability through local authority members forming a majority on
the board. The second is that the costs of building and maintaining the
bridge be borne by its users, through the charging of tolls. That is
the long-standing practice for major estuarial crossings in England and
Wales. The third principle is that the bridge board has the
responsibility to run the bridge efficiently and safely, and to set an
adequate level of toll to meet its costs. Any shortfall in toll revenue
is made up by a levy on the bridge board’s constituent local
authorities. Turning to the component parts of the reform package, two
reforms were enacted by the Government in 2012. First, the Humber
Bridge (Debts) Order 2012 wrote down £150 million of the
£332 million bridge debt, and set a fixed interest rate of 4.25%
on the remaining debt. That enabled the bridge board to reduce the
bridge tolls substantially on 1 April 2012, including halving the toll
for cars from £3 to £1.50. Incidentally, the Chancellor
was given the credit for announcing that, but it is only fair to say,
even if I get myself into trouble, that the driving force in securing
the reduction was

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:05:07"></hs_TimeCode>I want to draw
attention to two reforms that meet the Government’s requirements
for the February 2012 deal. First, clause 3 brings representatives of
the local enterprise partnership on to the board, giving the Humber
area business community a stake in the good management of the bridge
and the opportunity to bring its energy and commercial expertise to its
day-to-day running. Secondly, clause 7 ensures that the incentive on
the bridge board to set a toll adequate to meet its costs is shared
equally between all the Humber area local authorities. That is a major
improvement from the previous arrangement, when approximately 98% of
the cost of any revenue shortfall fell on the council tax payers of the
city of Hull.</hs_Para>

other provisions in the Bill have been worked up by the bridge board
and local authorities to modernise the powers of the bridge board to
manage its affairs efficiently and transparently and to allow it to act
commercially to develop sources of revenue other than tolls while
remaining democratically accountable to the local community. On that
basis, we have agreed as a Government to support them. I shall not go
through them all now, but I want to draw attention to clause 11, which
removes the Secretary of State from the decision-making process on
setting the level of tolls while retaining the local community
safeguards and rights to be consulted on any change in the tolls. That
will save much time and taxpayers’ money and is a
good example of the implementation of the Government’s localism
agenda.</hs_Para>

Dakin</B> (Scunthorpe) (Lab):</Member> I want simply to make a few
points. First, I recognise the contribution many people have made to
the management and governance of the bridge over many years. They have
done a good job within the statutory requirements that the bridge board
has placed on them, but now is the time for the changes in the Bill to
release the dynamism that is necessary if the bridge is to be fit not
only for the present but for the future. Hon. Members who have already
spoken have emphasised the opportunities that the Bill presents, and it
is also an opportunity to deliver localism in action. That localism is
represented by the fact that MPs from across the parties and across the

Hull for cancer treatment and treatment for other serious illnesses and
the tolls have been a particular burden on the families of many people

put into trying to achieve the objectives of the Bill. I said to him
that if the Bill were not debated on Second Reading, it
would—because it is an unopposed Bill and there is no petition
against it—go to an Unopposed Bill Committee, and then come back
to the House for Third Reading, without a Report stage, so there would
be no opportunity for people to move any amendments or make any points
about it, whether good or bad. I hope that my hon. Friend now

increase. I suggest that they are now speaking with forked tongue,
because on this Bill they have conceded the point that reducing the
costs increases the activity and thus the yield. I have at home on the

a serious point, I hear what my hon. Friends say about local control,

the 
<?notus-xml column=281?>Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) implied in his intervention, there is
something to be said for having on the face of the Bill some safeguards
for local people against possible future increases in the level of

halved, but nothing in the Bill would safeguard against the
introduction of differential tolls, for example.</hs_Para>

primary responsibility of the bridge body is to service the debt, so
either way local taxpayers pay. Either the road user pays through the
tolls or responsibility reverts to the local authorities. So there is
no safeguard because the safeguard of not having a toll rise is that it
would then revert to the local taxpayers to pay for
anyway.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000223"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="13022691000431" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000431">Mr

arrangements are now for a much more equitable relationship. Certainly
when I was a Transport Minister it was an impossible subject to deal
with, because there was no incentive for the other local authorities
involved to be reasonable on these issues. However, that would not stop
something being written on the face of Bill. Even if there is no demand
locally for it and there are no petitions against the Bill at this
stage, it would still be possible for people to petition against the
Bill when it gets to the other place if they are concerned about the

says that the maintenance fund can be reduced. Money can be taken from
the maintenance fund and spent on other things. I believe that we have
too much crumbling infrastructure in this country, much of it owned and
managed by local authorities that have refused to use the money that
has been given to them, often by central Government, for the purposes
of the proper maintenance of that infrastructure. In my constituency,
the A338 Bournemouth spur road comes to mind as an example. I am

My constituents are national taxpayers and they do not want to be told

rebuilt is with national taxpayers’ money because the
maintenance fund was not used for the purposes for which it was set up.

necessarily how I read the Bill. If the members of the Humber Bridge

which there are not many people who use the bridge, so it might not be

Government Ministers, who are not directly elected. It is just an
impossible situation. As I said in my contribution, the key is that
four of the six board members are elected. Because of the importance of
the issue in the locality, I can assure him that it would be very

not his intention or, as far as I can see, that of any Members from

necessary for, so the idea that it is suddenly going to shove them up
to five quid overnight is wrong—it is not going to happen, to be
polite about it. We must remember that the

change in strategy this evening, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:30:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch has noted, some people will believe
politically that the best way to raise money to service the debt is to
increase taxes or, in this case, charges. The people on the board may
not accept the idea of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:34:30"></hs_TimeCode> the best

given a full or partial relief from the toll, perhaps because of
medical conditions. He said that when one makes a list one might
inadvertently miss something off and cause a problem, and I understand
that. However, an intention to give certain people a relief is only
that—an intention. Nothing in the Bill would force it to happen
or guarantee it. People could have their hopes raised and then see them
dashed. It would be unfortunate if the board had a change of heart, or
its personnel changed, and it no longer felt that a relief was
appropriate or affordable because, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:32:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Brigg and Goole says, their primary responsibility is to
service the debt.</hs_Para>

the Member for Cleethorpes perhaps inferred from my
intervention—to make it clear that there should be some form of
relief for people with, for example, serious medical conditions. It
need not specify anything in particular but would make sure that what
he intended happened in reality. One of the many unfortunate things in
politics is people’s hopes being raised and then dashed when
other people have made promises that they cannot keep. It would be good
if we could demonstrate in the Bill that this provision would be an
inevitable consequence of its being passed, whereas at the moment it is
just an aspiration and a hope that cannot be

build up resentment if it does not come with the support of the local

length. I will ask the bridge board to respond to him about the
maintenance fund. My understanding is that, at present, it has to be

Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Lewes

his reasonable point about allowances, which I am sure all local MPs
will want to pursue. However, the new members—the four members
from each authority—would have to be appointed every year
through their full council meeting, so if they went a bit bonkers and
sought to pay themselves £100,000 per year, they could be thrown
off the board by their local authorities. That is an extra check of
democratic accountability, because they are accountable to their local
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
That could have happened in the past—although it never
has—because a local authority, had it wanted to, could have used
its own procedures to introduce a special responsibility allowance to
pay the chairman of the bridge board. It would also be foolish for
board members to suggest payment of anything other than out-of-pocket
expenses. I think that local MPs from all parties would be particularly

provide much of a safeguard, because when a toll increase is sought, it

Wiggin</B> (North Herefordshire) (Con):</Member> As the House will
know, the Government are set to provide approximately £72
billion of grants to local authorities in England for 2013-14. Despite
the enormity of that figure, there is no disputing that overall
spending must be reduced. However, even though the cake is
smaller—indeed, precisely because the cake is smaller—we
must ensure that rural areas such as Herefordshire receive their fair
share of funding. For far too long, the historical balance has been
tipped against
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000262">Herefordshire<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:43:32"></hs_TimeCode>
is the fourth most sparsely populated county in England. It is made up
of five market towns, villages, remote farms and hamlets, as well as
Hereford city in the centre. At 42,500, the number of elderly residents
in Herefordshire as a proportion of the population is well above the
national average. Just over a fifth of Herefordshire’s
population, 22%, is aged 65 and over, compared with just 17% in England
and Wales as a whole. Rural sparsity is an expensive challenge for a
small county. Costs for transport, social care, schools, ambulances and
health services are all pushed up. Yet Herefordshire is not and has not
been a well resourced council. The 2012-13 budget figures show that
formula grant funding per capita is £311, which is 13% below the
national average of
£358.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000263">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:44:34"></hs_TimeCode>
can we do? The council has just voted to raise council tax by 1.9%,
because it feels that with only 1% being given by the Government, if it
freezes the council tax it will fall further and further behind over
time. I support a freeze in council tax, and I do not agree with
increasing it, as that will have a real impact on already stretched
household budgets, especially for the retired and those living on
pensions. Councillors have made efficiency savings of £21
million since 2011, and a further £9.1 million of savings are
due to be delivered this year, and once the fat has been trimmed the
pickings are lean. Factor in a below-average level of council tax,
alongside a relatively low base, and it is clear that Herefordshire is
running out of options. That is a state of affairs with which many of
my colleagues representing rural areas will be depressingly
familiar.</hs_Para>

on securing the debate. As the other MP for the glorious county of
Herefordshire, may I add my voice to his on the issue  of
underfunding and draw his attention and that of  the House to a
study that I commissioned in March 2010? It showed that the cumulative
underfunding for Herefordshire in the period from 2005 to 2010,

years, or roughly £35 million a year, including a shortfall of
£85 million in support for Herefordshire council.

and neighbour—it says in the Bible, “Love thy
neighbour”, and he is an easy man to love and I know his

concerned. There is some good news, because on 4 February my hon.
Friend the Minister announced that 95 authorities would receive a
transitional efficiency support for services in sparse areas grant, of
which £531,374 would go to Herefordshire. That and the technical
adjustments that I mentioned are excellent news and speak of the
coalition’s determination to bring about real change, and let us
never forget Labour’s pledge to deliver £52 billion of
local government cuts.</hs_Para>

is still work to be done. First, the efficiency support for services in
sparse areas funding has been provided for 2013-14 only. A one-off
grant cannot be budgeted for in rising to the challenges that rural
authorities face when delivering services in geographically sprawling
areas. Those are permanent challenges that can, and will, never be
completely overcome. It is time to give serious thought to our
long-term
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000268">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:48:21"></hs_TimeCode>,
the counterintuitive damping mechanism is undoing much of the
Government’s good work to date. There is undoubtedly common
sense in promoting stability and protecting councils from violent
change. However, there is no logic in freezing the system completely
for six years, which benefits only a select few London commuter belt
authorities with high house prices. The Government should look again at
that time
scale.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000269">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:49:00"></hs_TimeCode>
the summer consultation figures, Herefordshire should have benefitted
from an extra £6 million per annum. No less than 74% of that, or
£4.4 million, was subsequently lost through damping. Across the
country as a whole, that figure rises to at least £60 million.
That is a huge amount. Quite simply, the mechanism is preventing money
from being allocated where it is needed. Expectations were raised and
sadly dashed. Herefordshire council specifically requested that the
Government’s adjustments for sparsity be reflected in cash terms
and excluded from the damping or smoothing effect, yet that has not
happened. We now face a situation where the rural penalty has been
reduced at best by one or  two points from 50%, when it really
needs to be down to
40<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:49:56"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000270">It
is true that the changes to business rates from 1 April will mean that
local authorities can keep 50% of business rate growth. That is
designed to increase local employment and income by attracting new
businesses to an area. However, while useful, it may be an incentive
that urban authorities, with their existing infrastructure, may be
better placed to benefit from than rural areas such as mine. I ask
Ministers to look again at Herefordshire council’s suggestion.
Alternatively, damping could be unwound or the special grant continued

The Government have recognised this need and have risen to the
challenge only to be dampened down. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister
to look at this again. If he cannot un-dampen or de-dampen in the
immediate short term, then can he try looking at the longer term so
that councils can budget wisely rather than raise council

that behind all our thinking on local government funding is the fact
that it is vital that councils continue to play their part, as my hon.
Friend said, to tackle the inherited budget deficit by making sensible
savings and delivering value for money for the taxpayer. As I did on 4
February, I want to make it clear that this is a new settlement for
local government, one now based on self-determination and financial
independence for local authorities. We are seeking to shift power from
Whitehall to town hall. We are providing a direct financial incentive
for councils to promote growth, something my hon. Friend touched on in
his speech. Authorities will directly retain nearly
£11 billion of business rates instead of returning
them to the Treasury, and they will be able to keep the growth on that
share of business rates. Councils that strive and deliver the benefit
of growth by doing the right thing by their communities will bring in
jobs and business, and will gain the financial rewards
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:53:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000275">Importantly,
in this settlement we have accepted, as my hon. Friend noted, that
rural areas have been comparatively underfunded. We have therefore
ensured that there is proper recognition of the additional costs of
delivering services in rural areas. We have made adjustments to
relative needs formulae to reflect the greater cost of providing
services in rural areas—one of only three formula changes in the
settlement. We have increased the weight for super-sparse areas in the
formula; doubled the sparsity weight for older people’s social
care and the district level environmental, protective and cultural
services block; reinstated the sparsity adjustment for county level
environmental protective and cultural services; and introduced a
sparsity adjustment for fire and rescue. As a result, funding per head
is reducing by less in predominantly rural authorities than
in predominantly urban authorities, within all classes. The 
<?notus-xml column=291?>spending power of Herefordshire council is reducing  by less
than the England average in both 2013-14 and
2014-15.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022691000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/debtext/130226-0004.htm#13022691000276">We
listened to representations from rural authorities and had good
conversations with them during the consultation process. That is why,
as my hon. Friend said, we have also provided an £8.5 million
grant to help 95 rural authorities with sparse populations secure
efficiencies in services in 2013-14. He is right to say that this is a
one-year grant, giving councils a year to go further with some of the
efficiency work that many of them are doing very well. As I promised, I
will continue talking to councils over the next few months about the
long-term future of rural areas.

Herefordshire<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>
council will also receive one of the largest allocations of that
funding—£531,000—and Hereford and Worcester fire
authority will receive an additional £13,000. This extra funding

they provide in sparsely populated

the settlement provides a fair funding deal, with protections for the
most grant dependent authorities, whether they are rural or urban, and
leaves councils with considerable total spending power. The settlement
is not about what councils can take—that is the local government
finance of the past—but about what they can make. It represents
a watershed moment for council finances, with the localisation of
£11 billion of business rates, providing a strong incentive for
councils of all types to go for growth and reducing their dependency on
central grant. It means that 70% of funding will  be raised
locally, compared with just over 50% at the moment.</hs_Para>

a top-up authority, Herefordshire council gets the support of an
element of funding that will stay fixed in real terms and pays no levy
on growth in its business rates. That means that it keeps 49% of all
the business rates it collects, with no upper limit. Herefordshire has
forecast that it will collect more in business rates in 2013-14 than is
implicit in its business rates baseline, meaning that it will get an
immediate boost from the new business rates retention

there is the new homes bonus, which rewards councils for delivering
more homes and through which more than £2 million of funding
will go to Herefordshire council in 2013-14. This is a fundamental
change from the old system. Councils striving for growth, building
houses and delivering local businesses will find themselves rewarded
with increased revenue. Local authorities can and should now move away
from the “begging bowl” culture and focus their efforts
on delivery, growth and efficiencies. That is also why we introduced
the new efficiency challenge award of a further £9.2 million
that councils, including Herefordshire, can bid for.</hs_Para>

ownership is an important issue, and I have some key facts and figures
that are quite enlightening. There are approximately 9 million dogs in
the UK. Every year 250,000 people attend GP surgeries, minor injury
units or accident and emergency departments after being bitten by dogs,
and there are more than 6,000 hospital admissions resulting from dog
attacks. The cost of dog attacks to the NHS is probably some £10
million. There are some 5,000 dog attacks on postmen and postwomen each
year, of which 70% are on private property where irresponsible owners
are immune from prosecution. That is obviously another major part of
the
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000016">The
number of dogs dangerously out of control continues to increase.
Police, local authorities and animal welfare groups work together in a
few areas to promote responsible dog ownership, but only on a voluntary
basis. Fourteen people have been killed in dog attacks since
2005—eight children and six adults—and hundreds of
children received life-changing injuries and disfigurements during the
same period. Enforcement action and the number of prosecutions remain
low, as do court
penalties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000017">Some
8 million dogs are kept as pets in the UK, yet there are many stray
dogs running wild on our streets. Experts suggest that during 2011-12,
nearly 120,000 stray dogs were found, of which 7% were
destroyed. Having 120,000 dogs running wild hardly demonstrates
responsible ownership. Despite our dog-loving culture, many people seem
to be afraid of loose dogs, which is understandable. A pack of dogs
running towards someone is a frightening experience, and I am sure it
has happened to most people in this room. Whether or not the dogs
appear vicious, people tend not to enjoy such an experience. Many of
those animals are quite domesticated; they are not wild dogs or banned
breeds, but they are set loose to God and good nature by their
irresponsible owners or get loose by other
means.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000018">This
year, a survey on stray dogs conducted by Dogs Trust reported a 24%
rise in the number of individuals convicted of cruelty and neglect to
dogs, which is shameful. There was a 22% rise in convictions related to
dogs and a 21% rise in disqualifications from keeping animals. Again,
those are hardly the signs of a dog-loving nation. The figures are
frankly unacceptable in any civilised society. Due to many problems and
many more false dawns, progress on
responsible dog ownership and regulation has been
slow.</hs_Para>

announcements made earlier this month by the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs set out the
Government’s proposals concerning dogs. They
include measures on the compulsory microchipping of dogs,
the seizure of dogs and the extension of the law to cover private
property. On 15 February 2013, the Select Committee on Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs published a report following its inquiry into
dog control and welfare. As I mentioned, the report—“Dog
Control and Welfare”, HC 575—made a series of
recommendations and was critical of the Government’s approach.
Concerns are rife about the poor condition of many dogs, including
those bred for sale and those connected to pedigree
breeding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000020">As
I mentioned, incidences of out-of-control dogs have been increasing in
the UK. Statistics show that 210,000 people are attacked by dogs in
England annually, including 6,000 postal workers. It is not just postal
workers but visitors to people’s properties: people going in
through the back door or the back gate, doctors, nurses, postal workers

2005, 14 people have been killed by dogs, the majority in their own
homes. Many organisations are working assiduously on responsible dog
ownership, and there are some shining examples, including the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Dogs Trust, the
Communication Workers Union, Blue Cross, the Battersea Dogs and Cats

RSPCA believes that prevention is better than cure. It says that the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had a golden
opportunity finally to tackle the big issues, but instead merely
tinkered with existing legislation rather than making the comprehensive
reform called for by dog law enforcers. The RSPCA believes that
preventive measures, such as dog control notices, are required, as well
as the introduction of dog registration to improve ownership, and
education on dog welfare and safety. Such measures could prevent
suffering to animals as well as protecting public safety where there
are concerns that owners are failing to control their dogs or do not
know how to do so
effectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000023">CWU

experiencing increasing problems with dogs and the irresponsible
actions of their owners. CWU launched its “Bite Back”

Sheffield and Cambridge, when both victims were nearly killed. Some
23,000 postal workers have been attacked in the last five years. The
“Bite Back” campaign has achieved dangerous dog law

for whatever reason, England has been left behind in those positive
national changes. The public have a picture in the back of their mind

jokes and cartoons—but it is not really funny when we scrape the
surface. Let us look at the frightening statistics involving ordinary
people. Some 23,000 postmen were attacked by dogs in the last five
years, or 5,000 every year. An average of 12 are attacked
every day, and as I just explained, two were nearly killed in 2007-08.
Dog attacks peaked at 6,500 in 2008. Action is required now to

the three main issues arising from the written ministerial statement
was a requirement that dogs be microchipped with the owner’s
details. The second was a change in the criminal law, in section 3 of
the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, to extend the offence  of a dog
being dangerously out of control to all places, including private
property. The third was to allow owners of dogs seized as suspected
dangerous dogs or prohibited types to retain possession of their dogs

Secretary of State said that microchipping makes a clear link between a
dog and its owner. More than 100,000 dogs stray, are lost or are stolen
each year, and many must be kept in kennels before being re-homed. A
microchip allows them to be reunited quickly with their owners,
reducing stress for dog and owner alike. It will also lead to
substantial savings for local authorities and welfare charities, which
spend some £57 million a year on kennelling costs, and will mean
that fewer dogs are destroyed. Up to 6,000 are put down each year
because their owners cannot be found.</hs_Para>

microchipping of all dogs in England from 6 April 2016. After that
date, owners will need to have their dog microchipped and registered on

agree that it is imperative that any database, and the registration of
changes of ownership, must  be absolutely robust so that we do
not end up with a situation like the passporting of horses? There are
75 passport issuing organisations, and nobody has

made on microchipping has been well received by all parties; it is one

potential introduction of legislation in

the Minister’s response, I should be delighted to hear further
clarity on microchipping: the age at which dogs will be required to be
microchipped, whether there will be any exemptions, how the law will be
enforced, who will carry out the enforcement of the law and how it will
be funded. Does the Minister expect enforcement to be proactive or
reactive? Will microchipping a dog actually prove ownership of the
animal? That is important. If a local authority receives a stray dog
that is not microchipped, and if it is not claimed but in kennels, will
the local authority be able to microchip the dog and re-home it? Will
the requirement to keep contact details up to date on the database be
cheap for dog owners? Will there be a maximum fee, to ensure that the
introduction of microchipping, although most welcome, is not
cost-prohibitive for many people? A lot of vulnerable people have dogs
and cherish them. What education and awareness- raising will
DEFRA do over the next two years to encourage compliance with the
microchipping
regime?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000034">The
second major issue is the suggested amendment of the Dangerous Dogs Act
1991. Extending section 3 to cover all places, including private
property, is a major step forward, and will be welcomed on both sides
of the House. It will extend the law and give better protection to
people in their own homes, as well as to those I mentioned previously
who enter private property, such as postal workers. Again, however,
more clarity is required. For example, will the extension cover going
inside a private dwelling, or will it remain at the front door and just
cover the front garden? What private property will the law cover? Will
there be a defence for dog owners protecting their property and, if so,
what will it
be?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000035">Any
amendment is important because the legislation is important. To effect
the change in the law, DEFRA is to introduce amendments to the
Dangerous Dogs Act as soon as parliamentary time permits. Put simply,
there is not much disagreement in the Chamber this morning, but I
disagree about the timing: it is not good enough to say that the
legislative changes on private property will be introduced when there
is parliamentary time. We need a guarantee that the legislation will be
introduced at least in this Parliament. Indeed, we need to ensure that
the legislation is introduced as soon as possible—this week
would be fine as far as many people up and down the country are
concerned. The Dangerous Dogs Act is seen by many as extremely poor
legislation and as wholly ineffective, so it would be better to have
consolidated legislation covering everything, rather than tinkering
with other pieces of
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000036">The
third major issue is the seizure and kennelling  of suspected
dangerous dogs. To ensure the welfare of suspected prohibited dogs that
have become the subject  
<?notus-xml column=6?>of court proceedings and to ease the substantial cost to the police
service, the Government have decided that the police will no longer
need to seize and kennel such dogs pending the outcome of court
proceedings if they do not consider the dog to present a risk to the
public. The police will have the discretion to release a suspected
prohibited dog when they are completely satisfied that it is in the
care of a responsible owner. They will be allowed to put extra
restrictions on the owner, such as requiring the dog to be muzzled and
on a lead when in public. Such changes will be made by way of amendment
to the exemption scheme, and can be done through secondary legislation.
Someone mentioned this being the animal equivalent of an antisocial
behaviour order, an ASBO, suggesting it should be a DOGBO. I have not
seen that before, and I am not personally convinced, but the
cross-party line is fully
supportive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000037">The
Government consider that allowing suspected prohibited dogs to be
exempted from seizure in those circumstances strikes the right balance
between protecting the public from potentially dangerous dogs and
ensuring that the dogs are safely and properly looked after and not
unnecessarily removed from their homes. There needs to be clarity on
the issue. I am concerned that one or two dogs might slip through the
net. I am not sure that the police are properly qualified to identify
vicious or dangerous dogs. A beautiful white poodle could be totally
vicious, and the biggest dog in the world could be quite placid and not
vicious at all. Let us be honest about that: categorisation is
difficult. The police are extremely talented at deciding about
individuals and personalities from how they react, but I am not sure
that they are well qualified to determine which dogs may be vicious and
what owners must do to retain possession of their dog during a court
case, if indeed they want
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000038">Further
clarity is required. For example, is the Government’s proposal
to allow dogs to remain with their owners effective at the point of
potential seizure, or at the discretion of the police once the dog has
been seized and kept in kennels? Has DEFRA made an estimate of the
percentage of dogs seized each year that are likely to be affected by
the proposal? If so, what is that percentage and how did the Department
arrive at it? Why has DEFRA not looked at the court processes more
closely, to require a time limit on expert witness exams for all dogs
seized? I have already posed a whole number of questions, to which I
have added more, but many issues need clarification, probably on all
sides, to continue constructive
dialogue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000039">With
the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee highlighting the need
for a more fundamental approach to dog control, will the Government
commit to updating and consolidating all dog control legislation? Will
DEFRA commit to asking the Law Commission to conduct a review into dog
control legislation, as per the Select Committee recommendations? Will
DEFRA be providing any new money for training and education? The money
that was mentioned in the written statement and subsequently, which I
have not discussed yet, appears to have been spent already, as far as
the Opposition can see. There is no new
money.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_26_PT_1/EEBE902538B582F9B13F1BB96D082B0449FD99DC" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="26 February 2013">Tuesday

might be aware that I have an interest in greyhounds—indeed, I
have owned and raced a number of them in recent years, with varying
success—and I have been a very responsible owner. The greyhound
is a truly remarkable athlete. It is one of the oldest breeds in the
world: it is mentioned in the Bible, in Chaucer and in Shakespeare, no
less. It is arguably the most protected of all canine breeds. The
introduction of the Welfare of Racing Greyhounds Regulations 2010 under
the Animal Welfare Act 2006 was a major advance, helping to raise
welfare standards across greyhound racing, and we can take a leaf out
of that book. All the 30 or so greyhound tracks in England must be
licensed and inspected, as must their owners and their owners’
properties. That is about responsible ownership. The Greyhound Board of
Great Britain is the regulator and looks after greyhounds’
welfare in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022655000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000042"><Member ContinuationText="Michael Connarty" PimsId="2697" UID="13022655000063" xid="128" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022655000063"><B>Michael

different issue. I have been involved with greyhounds all my life.
There was an horrendous episode in Seaham, in the north-east; it was
like the killing fields of greyhounds. That spurred the Government to
introduce the regulations that I mentioned, so that every greyhound
must be microchipped, and every greyhound is now microchipped. That is
why I suggest that we should take a lead from the greyhound legislation
and ensure that all dogs are microchipped. The case that my hon. Friend
mentioned was horrific, and it was symptomatic of the times, but things
have changed greatly. That is why I mentioned greyhound racing. There
was a huge problem, but it has now been rectified because of
legislation.</hs_Para>

would say that the issue is microchipping. I agree that greyhounds make
fantastic pets. My point is that, because of the disasters involving
greyhounds, legislation introduced microchipping immediately. That has
had a great impact, and we should look at it. That is why I mentioned

have done with this, although that is a separate issue—on

legislation possible in the time available, and they were advised to
focus on the breeds and types of dog that were causing the attacks. It
was clear from the evidence that Mr Evans gave to the Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs Committee that the police and the Association of
Chief Police Officers still believe that certain breeds should be on
the list of dangerous dogs, but more needs to be done. In its report,
the Select Committee recommended the introduction of</hs_Para>

that hon. Members are 99% agreed on the matter, and if this were a

whether cases of trespassing involve the front door. I suspect that we
need to do a lot more on the reform of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to
be confident that when legislation is introduced, it will command the
greatest possible public support and not simply cause people to say,
“The 1991 Act was rubbish and this one is not much
better.” I do not think that the matter merits a Green Paper,
but especially given that the legislation might not necessarily be
introduced in the next Session of Parliament, it would be helpful to
have a discussion paper detailing the Government’s thinking on
the matter. That would focus all our minds on what we can do

that responsibility. Although that is a question about the boring

issue. As my hon. Friend made clear, there are more than 9
million dogs in the UK, and the number of our fellow human beings who
are attacked by dogs is startling. Every year, 250,000 people are
bitten by dogs and attend GP surgeries, minor injuries units and A and

serious injuries. The annual cost to the Exchequer is more than

to the drivers, health visitors, midwives and doctors whom my hon.

2008. That attack triggered my involvement in the campaign to improve
dog control in this country. To this day, Mr Coleman 
<?notus-xml column=11?>makes regular contributions to the local radio station because he is

about the increasing incidence of attacks on guide dogs by other dogs,
and I was pleased to see that the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs

that the Committee recommended the introduction of jail sentences of up
two years for attacks on guide dogs. I support that recommendation, and
I hope the Government will act on it. In addition, the number of

behind the debate is extensive. The current situation is primarily the
result of the work that the Communication Workers Union has undertaken,
in conjunction, initially, with the RSPCA, on the Bite Back campaign
since 2008. In a private Member’s Bill that I secured in 2009,
we called for the extension of the existing law to private property.
Work on the campaign continued, and the CWU worked very hard with the
RSPCA and the Dogs Trust. We secured a consultation from the outgoing
Labour Government in early 2010, mainly because Northern Ireland,
Scotland and Wales had already indicated that they were going to
legislate. The Government and the Prime Minister, therefore, wondered
why on earth, if the rest of the UK could do it, England could not do
the same. The same question remains today. Those three
countries—the other parts of the Union—have consolidated
and updated their legislation, so why cannot we do the
same?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000020">We
had the consultation, but we then had a significant wait for a response
from the incoming coalition Government, and that response was frankly
inadequate, although I acknowledge that there was progress. There was
agreement to extend the law to private property and on the principle of
microchipping. We then had a further consultation, which many of us
thought was unnecessary, but we are where we are. Two weeks ago, we
heard the outcome of the consultation, which was a commitment to
legislation but with no timetable. That is not good enough. We need a
timetable for implementing the Government’s proposals. Delay is
not good enough. We have waited four years for
action.</hs_Para>

dog attacks on other animals and on human beings is increasing year on
year, and the cost to the Exchequer is £9.5 million annually.
Surely, it has to be recognised that not only should the current

Committee’s recommendation that the Law Commission should look

problem of dangerous dogs is to be addressed, identification of dogs is
particularly important. Everyone agreed that microchipping is a good
thing, but other issues were raised, including the cost of
microchipping. More than 2 million dogs in this country are
microchipped, but the less responsible owners are least likely to
microchip their dogs, and those with limited resources might find the
expense of microchipping too burdensome, and that problem should be
addressed. The main question at the conference was about the database.
Who will hold and maintain it, who will pay the cost of running it, and
who will have access to it? I suspect that local authorities, the

years, the person who runs my farm experienced baby lambs aged between
one day and a week being killed, perhaps 20 at a time. They knew who
owned the dog, but the owner maintained that they did not know the dog

travesty that the Government are proposing to end criminal injuries
compensation scheme payments for dog attacks in the case of
irresponsible dog owners—it is already a Government
proposal—and yet they are not going to introduce compulsory
insurance. If someone registers their dog with the Dogs Trust, for
£20 a year, they get third-party liability insurance for the
dog, with up to £1 million cover. That cost of £20 a year
is less than one week’s food for a dog. It is estimated that,
over a dog’s lifetime, a dog owner can spend up to
£16,000—in fact, some estimates even put the figure at
£31,000, when looking after high-quality breeds that are taken
off to Crufts, and so on. It seems that the insurance costs less than
the dog’s inoculation for flea and worm treatment, but the
Government do not intend to introduce it. If they are taking away
criminal compensation payments, surely some kind of compulsory
insurance for dogs must be introduced, so that anyone attacked by a dog
is compensated for their injuries in a proper manner.</hs_Para>

have to die or be injured seriously by dogs before the Government do
something about it? Irresponsible dog ownership will only be controlled
by the Government imposing a serious penalty on people who have such
dogs in any area and use them in any way, whether that involves attacks
on guide dogs—and I totally support the idea of an aggravated
attack: attacks on caring dogs should be treated as though they are
attacks on the owners. The Government must do more. Their offer is not
enough at this time, and responsible dog ownership requires not only
microchipping, but dog owner control orders and compulsory insurance

to a child. They should look at that if they have not seen a victim

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Gray, and I

debate.</hs_Para>

by the comments made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk
(Michael Connarty), because until then we kept the debate fairly
non-party political. It is a bit rich to say that nothing happened and
no people were bitten in the 13 years that Labour were in power, and
had time to do something, and to blame everything on the coalition
Government. However, because of limited time, I will not rant and rave
about that for too long.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022656000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000043">I say to the
Minister that I very much welcome the fact that the Government have
listened since the first consultation. Originally, only puppies were to
be microchipped, which would have taken an awfully long time, but the
Government have now said, quite rightly, that all dogs should be
microchipped. I would like to see that come in sooner rather than
later.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022656000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000044">The Committee
took evidence from postal workers, and I have every sympathy for all
postal workers—as well as other workers who go into homes, such
as midwives—who have been bitten, especially where particular
dogs are known to bite. That is also one of the conundrums: it is not
only about which dog bites and whether it is vicious, because many
people know that their dogs bite yet they still do not lock them up,
keep them out of the way, or keep them under control. That is what we
have to emphasise. I am a farmer by background, and I know that animals
will sometimes turn, as will dogs. It is unfortunate when animals turn,
but it is not the same penalty as for dogs that are known to be
dangerous. I welcome, therefore, what we can do to help with measures
on private property. I also welcome the fact that we will have
universal microchipping, but we must have an accurate database. At Blue
Cross or Battersea dogs home, they can only identify the owners of
about 30% of the dogs that come in and are microchipped. An up-to-date
database must be put together.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022656000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000045">However, let
us deal with dangerous dogs in particular, and with people who breed
dogs to be dangerous, and beat them to make them dangerous. It is not
the dogs that are at fault, but the people. They will not get their
dogs microchipped, and they will not get insurance, because they do not
want their dogs linked to them. They want to ensure that they run
beneath the radar screen, which is why we have to be careful when
bringing in legislation that we do not make things more onerous for all
the people who legitimately own dogs, while not getting to people who
breed dogs to be dangerous, and beat them up to make them even more
dangerous. Whether it is a DOGBO, an ASBO or whatever sort of 
<?notus-xml column=16?>BO, we have to proactively get those people. It is not only about
legislation. People can legislate as much as they like; we can
legislate in Parliament until the cows come home, but it does not mean
that the law will be enforced. Very often, there is enough legislation,
but it is not being enforced.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022656000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000046">I turn to the
issue of breeds. Either we keep the Dangerous Dogs Act in its entirety,
and we add to the breed-specific legislation, or we scrap it. A lot of
dogs are crossed with Japanese breeds, Canadian breeds, and all sorts
of breeds, which can actually mean that a dog is just as vicious as a
pit bull. Again, that is done to get round the legislation, and the
people doing it are not the nicest people in society. They do not go to
Sunday school; they are out to cause damage to people. Other Members
mentioned what has happened to guide dogs. We have had the evidence. I
cannot imagine being blind, because fortunately I have my sight, but it
is bad enough for someone who is sighted to have their dog attacked as
they are walking along the road. However, if a blind person is walking
along the road and their dog is viciously attacked, it is hugely
upsetting, dramatic and traumatic. Not only is it traumatic for the
owner, but if the dog is destroyed or killed, or maimed in such a way
that it can no longer carry out its function and help the blind person,
there is a huge financial burden, because it probably costs
£1,500 to £2,000 to train a dog on the routes the person
takes. We have to take such matters
seriously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000047">We
also have to take seriously the internet sale of puppies, not only from
this country, but from eastern Europe and the Republic of Ireland. A
lot of puppies are coming into the country, and many of them are not
only dangerous, but potentially very ill. People who are sold such
puppies have enormous vet bills in order to put the dogs right, and
sometimes the dog dies and, again, there is huge
trauma.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000048">We
need not worry too much about the cost of microchipping, because many
of the charities that deal with dogs, such as Blue Cross and Battersea,
are happy to put in the microchips to help people who cannot afford
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000049">I

debates before. They are all fine campaigners on the issue. Hon.
Members on the Government Benches have also been in these debates
before. We have been here before. The need to tackle irresponsible dog
ownership has been a consistent theme during the past three
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000052">The
hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish) rightly said that it
is not the case that dog attacks never took place before the current
Government came to power, but we do know that in the final months of
the Labour Administration, a consultation was set up specifically to
consider the issue. It reported on 1 June 2010, and here we
are now, nearly three years later, almost going into the fourth year of
this
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000053">I
genuinely say to the Minister that I welcome the announcements that
have been made. We do. We want to support him, but we sometimes
feel—to stretch the analogy a bit—like a trusty old Welsh
sheepdog, trying to herd the Home Office and DEFRA Ministers through
the gate that is clearly identifiable at the other end of the field.
The darn sheep keep wandering off into the long grass; they keep being
distracted. We want to get the measures implemented. We want to move
away from the good words and away from what I have to say are
re-announcements. Many of the things we heard a couple of weeks ago
were
re-announcements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000054"><Member ContinuationText="Luciana Berger" PimsId="5574" UID="13022656000093" xid="1124" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000093"><B>Luciana

Friend for kindly giving way. Is it not the case that it is not just
Labour Members who feel frustrated? Hon. Members on both sides of the
House feel frustrated because we have not seen any movement since the
consultation closed in June 2010. We are speaking on behalf of all our
constituents who are affected. My constituent, Angela McGlynn, lost a
child. She desperately wants action from the Government and instructed
me to come here today on her behalf, to say, “Please—when
is this action coming
forward?”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000055"><B><Member ContinuationText="Huw Irranca-Davies" PimsId="1124" UID="13022656000094" xid="662" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000094">Huw
Irranca-Davies:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes the point succinctly
on behalf of her constituent and all the others. We are talking about
families who have lost loved ones, in her constituency and elsewhere,
in traumatic situations; families who have been attacked and owners of
guide dogs and companion dogs who have been attacked. The hon. Member
for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams) mentioned dogs that are out
of control in rural areas. All those issues have to do with
irresponsible ownership, rather than the type of dog. That is why,
although we welcome the announcements and, indeed, the re-announcements
that have been made, there is an element of frustration, which has been
relayed in the debate today. We are saying, “Get on with
it.” We will support the measures. We will rally behind the
Government to the nth degree to get things
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000056">The
hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry), who has great experience of
the issue, raised the possibility of the Minister beginning discussions
on the overall issue of the dog legislation that is in place—a
theme that was picked up by other hon. Members. I agree with the hon.
Member for Banbury, but we are in year 3 and going into year 4 of this
Government. We would have preferred to be doing things now and getting
on with it. It is not as though we have been quiet on the issue. It is 
<?notus-xml column=18?>not as though the RSPCA, Dogs Trust, the CWU, the Royal College of
Nursing, the Police Federation and others have been quiet; they have
all been very streamlined on the
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000057">One
of the big problems previously was that Ministers would say,
understandably, “Well, there isn’t any agreement.”
Actually, there has been a tremendous amount of agreement. It is rare
to get this level of agreement, and it extends to such things as dog
control notices. It extends to saying that we should have a fundamental
look at the overall complexity of the legislation and whether it should
be overhauled. There is agreement on microchipping. I say to the
Minister, “Go on. We’ll rally behind you on this. We need
to do it. Let’s keep the cost low and the burden minimal.
Let’s ensure that it works, that it’s efficient, that the
technology is right and that the databases are secure and actually talk
to one another.” Yes, there are technical issues, but let us get
on with it. Let us deal with the internet trading and backstreet
trading. Let us deal with the strays and the resulting kennelling costs
for local authorities, the police and others. Thousands upon thousands
of dogs are euthanised every year. That is appalling in a society that
purports to love its animals—a pet-owning
nation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000058">What
is going wrong? It is a classic market failure in many ways. There is
demand for the breeding of dogs and for the selling of dogs on the
internet. There is demand for illicit trading in dogs. We must step in
and take control. We must ensure that resources are in place and that
there is enforcement. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, in his
very good contribution, made the point well about enforcement, but
enforcement carries resource implications. Whether local authorities,
police or charities are doing the work, we need to find a way to do
more with less—to pick up the phrase of the day—but also
to ensure that enforcement is
happening.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000059">My
hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck did a tremendous job of
highlighting the challenges ahead. He talked about the £57
million a year of kennelling costs for local authorities. He talked
about the cost to the police of kennelling dogs. More than 100,000 dogs
stray, or are lost or stolen every year. Six thousand dogs are put down
every year. What a tragedy that is in terms of animal welfare. There is
also the impact on local authorities and others. There are attacks on
communication workers, social care workers, home visitors and so on. It
is an absolute tragedy. There are 5,000 attacks on postal workers every
year. There was a 12% increase in the number of warnings issued by the
RSPCA to dog owners last year because of poor
welfare.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000060">What
is going on? It may be a result of the economic times we are in. I do
not know. Certainly when I visit Battersea Dogs and Cats Home or other
organisations, they tell me that more dogs are being abandoned, and it
is not just breeds that are perceived to be dangerous; dogs across the
board are being left. They are being tied to lamp posts; they are being
left at shopping centres for someone to come along and pick up. There
are major implications in what is happening, but I say quite genuinely
to the Minister that he has our support in taking action, as well as
saying the
words.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022656000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022656000061">We
need to get on with it. There have been calls from hon. Members today
for the Government to set out a timetable. As a former Minister, I am
familiar with the form of words, “When parliamentary time
allows”, but I am also familiar with Ministers then coming to
this 
<?notus-xml column=19?>Chamber or to the main Chamber and saying, “What I mean by that
is that we will do it within this parliamentary Session. We’ll
have to work with the Whips; we’ll have to work through the
usual channels, but we will do it.” That is the sort of
commitment we are looking for.  We want to know that action

surely there is a major problem in this respect: if Scotland, Wales and

and the Dogs Trust offers, at £20 a year, proper liability
insurance for dog owners, should the Government not bring in those

Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Mr David Heath):</Member></B> It is of course a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr Gray. I congratulate the hon.
Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) on initiating the debate. It has been
a good debate in general, because we are all united over the broad
principles of what we are trying to do.  
<?notus-xml column=20?></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000003">Despite
points of difference on occasion being expressed, there has been a very
warm welcome to what the Government announced in the written
ministerial statement and a firm view that we are going in the right
direction. We are united, because we all want to encourage responsible
dog ownership and to help to tackle irresponsible owners. The question
therefore is, what are the right measures to achieve those objectives
and how quickly can we introduce
them?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000004">We
are absolutely clear that we will bear down on irresponsible owners who
allow their dogs to attack people, and we will do specific things to
address the appalling number of stray and abandoned dogs on our
streets. I say that because the Government consider owning a dog to be
a serious undertaking that should not be undertaken lightly. We are
working closely with the animal welfare charities to encourage people
to take more responsibility for their own actions and those of their
pets. I speak for the Government, but I know that I speak for the House
when I say that we care about dogs, about improving dog welfare and
about protecting public
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000005">The
measures that we have announced—the compulsory microchipping of
all dogs in England by 6 April 2016, an extension to the law on
dangerous dogs to give the police powers to tackle attacks on private
property and the ability for prohibited dogs that do not cause a threat
to be returned to their owners under strict conditions—are all
aspects of achieving the balance between protecting the public and the
welfare of the animals people own. We have worked closely with the Home
Office to ensure that there are measures to tackle antisocial behaviour
that involves dogs—I shall return to that point. I
hope that that will deal with the problems with dog control
orders, because we can achieve the same objective through different
routes in our criminal law system. We have a route available to deal
with the issues.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022657000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000006">I reject one
aspect of the criticism: I want to make it absolutely clear that the
measures are far-reaching. The Chair of the Select Committee on
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for Thirsk and
Malton (Miss McIntosh), described them as “woefully
inadequate”—they are simply not. They go to the root of
the main problems associated with dogs and dog ownership. We are trying
to tackle two issues here: to improve the welfare of dogs generally and
to address concerns about public safety from dog attacks. The two
issues need different but complementary solutions.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022657000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000007">I shall deal
with microchipping first, because the hon. Member for Wansbeck referred
to it extensively. Compulsory microchipping is, in the first instance,
a dog welfare measure. It will promote responsible dog ownership, by
improving the traceability of owners, and help local authorities and
charities to reunite more of the 100,000 dogs that stray or are stolen
each year. Many such dogs have to be kept in kennels before being
returned to their owners or re-homed. Having dogs stuck in kennels for
any length of time is potentially detrimental to their welfare and
costs animal welfare charities and local authorities nearly £60
million a
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000008">Microchipping
will allow dogs to be reunited with their owners more quickly, and that
is good for the dog and good for the owner. Indeed, 6,000 dogs have to
be put down each year because their owners cannot be found. Quite
frankly, that is a disgrace. Moreover, microchipping dogs will help to
ease the burden on our 
<?notus-xml column=21?>charities and local authorities and allow more precious resource for
other dog control and welfare work and for educating owners.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022657000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000009">The
Government’s proposal on microchipping has been widely welcomed
by the police, local authorities, veterinary bodies and animal welfare
charities. We have listened to their comments, and therefore, as was
mentioned earlier, the initial proposal was different from what is now
suggested. Following the consultation, we adapted our proposals in the
light of the comments. From 6 April 2016, owners in England
will need to have their dogs microchipped and registered on one of the
commercial databases available. They will have to register the details
of any new owner when they sell or give the dog away. Owners will be
required to keep their contact details up to date on the microchip
databases. My Department is working with database providers and
microchip suppliers to ensure minimum standards of service for
commercial databases and standards of microchips and that updated
implantation guidance and training is available, as well as a one-stop
24-hour enquiry point for microchipped lost and found dogs.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams) referred
to the cost of microchipping. I thank the Dogs Trust in particular for
its very generous support, whereby a free microchip will be available
for all unchipped dogs throughout England. Other animal welfare
charities are offering free microchipping at their centres, including
Battersea Dogs and Cats Home and Blue Cross, and the Kennel Club is
providing free scanners for local authorities, which is also very
welcome. I do not think someone not being able to afford the cost will
be an excuse.</hs_Para>

Member for Wansbeck asked what age of dog will be microchipped;
veterinary advice is that eight weeks is appropriate. He also asked
whether there were exemptions; the answer is, no, we do not plan to
have exemptions, because as soon as we create exemptions, we create
loopholes, and we do not want loopholes in the system. Let me be clear
that enforcement is not about harassing responsible owners, but an
offence will be committed if someone owns a dog that is not
microchipped and the offender will be subject to
prosecution.</hs_Para>

available; they are being used and will continue. We do not propose to
establish new databases. They will be

second key element of our proposals is to address the scourge of dog
attacks on people. I will not repeat the statistics but simply say that
regular attacks by dogs on people are totally unacceptable. We need to
toughen up the law, and we propose to do so. Many hon. Members have
asked when we will introduce the changes. The hon. Member for Ogmore
(Huw Irranca-Davies) was kind enough to accept that there are
conventions in Government, with which he is familiar, whereby I cannot
possibly commit to a particular time for the introduction of
legislation. It will not happen this Session, because we are only a
couple of months away from its end. Introducing new legislation at this
point will simply not
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000017">I
will be equally clear and say that it is certainly our intention to
introduce legislation in the next Session of Parliament—not
before the end of this Session, but in the next Session. That is our
intention. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> A shadow business
manager—the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela
Smith)—is cheering, but she knows the constraints under which I
make that statement. I simply say that we intend to do so, because,
subject to parliamentary approval, we want the proposals to be in place
during the next year. I hope that answers the major question that hon.
Members asked.</hs_Para>

were raised about whether the Law Commission ought to deal with the
legislation. I do not think that this is a case for the Law Commission;
it is not complex law and there are no legal ambiguities. It 
is of course always better to consolidate legislation, but I am not
sure whether it is necessary in this case. Look at what the Home Office
is proposing on dog control orders and the antisocial behaviour
proposals being introduced. They will provide a very firm vehicle for
the control of dogs and the anticipation of such offences, which the
Home Affairs Committee has been looking
at—</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr James Gray (in the Chair)" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3540" UID="13022657000081" xid="234" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000081">Mr

asking for this debate is to highlight the unfairness of the financial
and other support provided to local government. I am particularly
concerned about Knowsley, the wider Liverpool city region and the

issue that needs to be questioned is the general support for local
government. The Local Government Association made it clear that the
loss of grant over the current spending review period will leave a gap
by 2019-20 of £16.5 billion. That is not a small figure; it is a
very significant figure in terms of local government expenditure.
Indeed, the National Audit Office said that local authorities are
planning to reduce spending by £4.6 billion in real terms by
March this year, and after absorbing additional costs arising from
increased demand for local services that means there will be real cuts
in real services.</hs_Para>

points out that Departments did not break down their analyses to
identify regional or other variations. That is an important issue,
which I will return to later. If we were to go purely on what we have
been told by individual Departments, and particularly the
Minister’s Department—Communities and Local
Government—we would not know what the regional variations are. I
am particularly indebted to Knowsley council and the LGA for providing
a briefing that enabled me to make that breakdown. It is pretty
sobering reading.</hs_Para>

anticipates cuts in services—not in back-office functions or
luxuries, but actual services to the public—of £17
million during the next two years, which is a 15% cut. That means that
over the next three years the council must find savings of £36
million, on top of the £32 million savings it has already made.
We are talking about one of the smallest metropolitan boroughs having
to make cuts during the period of this Parliament of £68
million.</hs_Para>

organisations, Knowsley council sensibly looked at where it can make
reductions that do not affect front-line services, and where it has
been able to make those changes it has done so. It has even been able
to make small improvements in some services, recognising the priorities
that exist. However, the fact of the matter is that the council now has
nowhere else to go in terms efficiency savings and changes in policy
that could be made without a direct impact on
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000026"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13022657000083" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000083">Several

that local authorities are stuffed full of people with nothing useful
to do, and that all anyone has to do is to identify where those people
are and all the problems will be solved. However, the reality is that
there is no headroom left at all in most local authorities, and
increasingly we will find that that will directly impact on services.
If there is a reduction in the number of social workers, it has an
impact on adult social care, families under stress, children’s

my hon. Friend’s point, I will look at the latest settlement in
terms of metropolitan areas as a whole and in terms of other sorts of

London, the two-year cut is £129 per dwelling; the English
average is a two-year cut of £105 per dwelling; Wiltshire is

that point. She is absolutely right. To be perfectly honest, I do not
think it is any accident that Liverpool, which is No. 1 in the multiple
deprivation ranking, is experiencing one of the highest cuts per
dwelling anywhere in the country over the period. It is also
significant that Knowsley, which ranks fifth in terms of deprivation
and is therefore not far behind Liverpool, is experiencing a

the highest cuts—if not the highest—in the

that has a real impact. Knowsley council told me, and I have no reason
to disbelieve it, that cuts in services and jobs are now unavoidable.
It is having to anticipate cuts of £9 million to health and
social care and to children’s and family services over that
period. It is looking at 340 job losses, which will mean that services
suffer, and that in economic terms more people will be thrown on to the
scrap heap in areas such as Knowsley, where we have relatively high
levels of
unemployment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000041">Is
the situation a statistical fault or deliberate policy? When system
funding cuts are deepest in the areas such as Knowsley that are least
able to bear them, and not in areas with relatively few problems of
deprivation, we are bound to conclude that Knowsley is being targeted.
As has been pointed out by my hon. Friends the Members for Liverpool,
Riverside (Mrs Ellman) and for Sefton Central, surrounding areas that,
at least in part, have a similar character are experiencing the same
thing. It cannot therefore be an anomaly that relates only to Knowsley,

doubt, the Minister will make the point that the Government have
brought in innovations that might help. For example, he might talk
about the new business rates retention system, but the problem is that
it is no longer needs-based. All the evidence is that redistribution
will be to more prosperous areas, which will get to keep more of the
business rates, so Knowsley will again not benefit. The National Audit
Office has pointed
out:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13022657000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000071">“Business

is also the new homes bonus, which is supposed to reward councils that
boost new house building, but for every £1 lost through the
top-slice, Knowsley will get back only 15p through the new homes bonus,
whereas, for example, Uttlesford in Essex will get back £19 and
Basingstoke will get back £18. Again, the evidence is that the
benefits are being shifted away from the areas with the greatest levels
of deprivation to those with much lower
ones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000045">It
is a similar case with arrangements for council tax support. The Local
Government Association concluded that local authorities will have no
choice but to pass on the cut in that support to the working poor.
People who 
<?notus-xml column=26?>are in low-paid work and may be in receipt of council tax benefit will
feel the greatest impact, because the Government are providing only 90%
of the required funding. In fact, the Government have got their sums
wrong: the average is 11.4%, but the actual cut in Knowsley is 12%.
That cut is not transparent, but is taking place by stealth, even
though the Government claim that the arrangement is a new and helpful
innovation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000046">Before
I finish, I want to say a quick word about welfare reform. With the
bedroom tax, 5,000 households in Knowsley will lose £13 if they
are considered to have one bedroom too many, or more than £20
for two bedrooms. I attended a public meeting in Northwood in my
constituency on the bedroom tax, and I heard tale after tale of people
who will have nowhere to go. They will have no options, because there
are no two and one-bedroom properties to move into. Even though
Knowsley has comparatively low rents, work done so far shows that 123
families—mainly larger ones, with four or more children, in
private rented property—will be seriously impacted by the
benefit cap. It is clear that the emphasis is moving away from areas
with few problems compared with areas such as Knowsley, and that all
the impact will be in areas like
Knowsley.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000047">I
want to draw a few conclusions. The worst effects in finance and other
support for local government have been targeted on areas with the
highest levels of deprivation. The statistics I have presented,
including those provided by the Local Government Association, point to
that as an inescapable conclusion. Whichever way we look at it,
frankly, it is shameful that the poorest areas in the country are asked
to bear the brunt of the cuts. Without doubt, critical
services—they are more critical in areas that suffer high levels
of deprivation—will be cut
severely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000048">Similar
conclusions can be drawn about welfare reform, particularly in relation
to the bedroom tax, the benefit cap and universal benefit. Those hit
hardest will be those who work—described as the working
poor—the disabled and those dependent on benefits, who are least
able to bear the brunt of the
cuts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000049">Where
are we and where are we heading? I do not want to push the comparison
too far, but we are very much heading back to the days of the Poor Law
and the Speenhamland system of outdoor relief. With the bedroom tax, I
can even imagine that we will need a modern equivalent of workhouses,
because people will have nowhere to go. If we can make comparisons with
the worst aspects of the 19th century, the Government should hang their
head in shame at what they are
doing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000050">Targeting
the poorest areas is wrong in principle but, as the National Audit
Office suggests, the Government are making no effort to monitor the
effects of the changes. Before we know it, we will find families
spiralling into debt or greater deprivation after April, with no plan
for that when it comes about. Perhaps the Minister will not share my
analysis of the problem—I am almost sure that his briefing will
lead him in a completely different direction—but I hope that, at
the very least, he will agree that all those matters need to be closely
monitored after April, on almost a daily basis. The Government need a
back-up plan for how they will respond if the sorts of problems that I
have described arise. If they do not have one, frankly, they do not
deserve to be in
government.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_26_PT_1/9ECEC86C1FEB6B82DD65F3953D4E7F343E546FF3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="26 February 2013">Tuesday

Lewis:</Member></B> I dispute whether that is even correct, bearing in
mind that the base point that such areas start from is so much higher
than anywhere else. It was the previous Government who left areas with
high deprivation, 
<?notus-xml column=28?>such as Hastings and Great Yarmouth, with a cliff-edge drop in funding
of up to 20%, which this Government have had to fix. Places such as
Wokingham have been mentioned before in debates on the
settlement—Surrey was also mentioned today—but it must be
remembered that all the councils under discussion today are at least
£500 better off per household than Wokingham is in 2013-14.
Knowsley itself is pretty much at the average with regard to its
reduction, but it has a spending power of £3,122, compared with
an average of just £2,200, so this settlement is fair. Thanks to
the new efficiency support grant, the seven authorities that face the
biggest hit to their spending power in 2013-14, a couple of which I
have just mentioned, are eligible for a funding boost, which ensures
that no council faces a spending power decrease of more than 8.8%,
despite the previous Government leaving them with one closer to
20%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000059">Vitally,
the system now works in a council’s favour. Through the Localism
Act and the financial reforms in this settlement, some 70% of local
authority income will be raised locally. Councils now have more power
than ever before, but they need to understand the implications of this
settlement and to act in their residents’ best interests and
work harder on their behalf. They can do that by redesigning council
tax benefit to cut fraud, promoting local enterprise to get people back
into work, or redesigning services to make them more efficient and
sustainable. There are still savings that can be made. I disagree with
the earlier comment about the council tax support position. The money
the Government have put in, the opportunities that exist for savings
and the flexibilities that have been given to the sector can more than
make up for what is needed to be found. Last year, local government
showed commendable skill in reducing its budget while still protecting
front-line services. Many residents thought services had actually
improved. This is about not how much money is spent, but making sure
that it is spent in the right way.</hs_Para>

Lewis:</Member></B> I suggest to the mayor of Liverpool that some of
his language has been extremely unhelpful and somewhat unfair,
particularly when Liverpool starts with a per dwelling spending power
of around £2,700. Many areas of the country, even deprived areas
such as those in my constituency, would be keen to have such spending
power. I am happy to come to Liverpool during the course of this year.
In fact, I will be visiting the fire service soon, and so will be happy
to visit the council as well. I suggest the council looks at the
booklet, “50 ways to save money”. Part of taking that
local power and being a locally directly elected mayor is about having
responsibility. There is that old phrase, “With great power
comes responsibility.” Instead of looking to everyone else to
solve their own issues, councils should be looking at what they can do
locally; 
<?notus-xml column=29?>that is what local accountability and local democracy are about. Through
our community and neighbourhood budgets, we are rewiring the system and
bringing people together from across the board—local
authorities, the police and the health service. We are seeing such
alignment with the whole place community budgets. Areas close to
Liverpool and Manchester are finding local savings worth millions of
pounds, and providing an opportunity to realign the public sector to
make it more streamlined and
efficient.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000062">Thanks
to the autumn statement, which exempted local government from another
1% top slice, councils have time to put their house in order and put
people first. They should start that process by freezing council tax,
which rose exponentially under the previous Government—it more
than doubled. We have now put money aside to put tax rises on ice for a
third successive year. Already a huge number of councils are doing the
right thing, including, I am glad to say, Knowsley, as well as Derby,
Dorset, Northampton and Watford. Areas such as Lancashire are going
further and actually cutting council tax by about 2%. In many cases,
councils have far more in reserves than they are losing through
cutbacks. Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds have reserves twice that of
their spending power reductions. The local funding settlement used to

Government tend to treat reserves as some kind of luxury that local
authorities can easily live without. Before I came to this place, I
spent several years as the chair of the finance committee on Knowsley
council. I am no accountant, but I do know that a council has to have
reserves to hedge against unexpected areas of
expenditure—perhaps a surge in inflation that they cannot cope
with or pay settlements that they were not anticipating. It is
prudential to have reserves, not in any way a flagrant abuse of the
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022657000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000064"><B><Member ContinuationText="Brandon Lewis" PimsId="5681" UID="13022657000100" xid="1098" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022657000100">Brandon
Lewis:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. It is
right for a council to have reserves. However, it is also right to use
those reserves at the right time and to keep only a prudent amount of
reserves. Many people in this country cannot understand how local
government can say that it is struggling when at the same time it has
built itself up in the past couple of 
<?notus-xml column=30?>years, even under these changes and savings, to have the highest level
of reserves it has ever had—they have increased to around
£16 billion. When authorities such as Liverpool, Manchester and
Leeds have reserves roughly twice that of their spending power
reductions, I suspect that most residents will have some lack of
sympathy with their argument that there is not enough money to protect
their services.</hs_Para>

councils will be able to retain around £11 billion-worth of
business rates, which will deliver £10 billion extra to the
wider economy. In recent years, Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool all
saw their business rates rise above the national average of 4.8%, but
thanks to the old begging bowl system, they missed out on the
opportunity of making the most of that money. That will not be the case
in the future; they will get the benefit. It will be about what
councils make and not what they take that counts. If they bring in more
businesses and more jobs, they will be rewarded. With regard to the
comment on the new homes bonus, with more than £650 million
being allocated this year, the same applies. If councils build, they
will get the money. It does not matter where they are in the country.
If they build the houses, they will get the money.</hs_Para>

settlement, we capture a new ethos in local government. We are looking
to generate more income through the new homes bonus, business rates
retention and the new transition challenge award where councils that

for that part of the bid.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman mentioned reserves. What is also important for
councillors and council officers to remember is that those reserves are
not the council’s money to sit on and protect. The money that
councils have is taxpayers’ money to be spent on services for
taxpayers. If councils are willing to put people above political
ponderance, to look to the future, and not in the rear-view mirror and
do things because that is the way we have always done them, they have a
once-in-a-generation chance to move forward, finance themselves in a

Penrose</B> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to

all agree that there are two fairly severe challenges facing our built
environment, no matter which part of the country we may be talking
about. On the one hand, a housing crisis is looming. The
Minister’s colleague, the Minister for Housing, has been making
the tours of the TV studios and radio airwaves to make the point that
we have an incipient housing crisis, caused by years and years of
under-building, and that if we are not careful and if we do not do
something about the situation relatively quickly we face the prospect
of owner-occupation being something that will fairly rapidly become
just the preserve of the rich. That will happen unless we start to
build significantly more houses. The figure bandied around is that more
than 100,000 homes—in fact, several hundred thousand
homes—will have to be built every year for several years, in
order to catch up with the backlog.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022670000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000007">Given the
levels of building needed to match current and expected demand, the
pressure on finding sites and space will be intense. Even if we use all
the brownfield sites that are available, it is true that if we do not
find other spaces to build on, the pressure on our green fields will
inevitably grow. I suspect many people view that prospect with alarm;
it is an extremely unpleasant and inconvenient fact. If we can find
alternatives, clearly we should use them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022670000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000008">In addition
to the threat, or challenge, of the housing crisis, our high streets
also face two very serious challenges: one of long standing, the other
relatively recent. The long-standing challenge is that, for several
decades, out-of-town shopping centres have been threatening to suck the
life out of our high streets by pulling shoppers away from town centres
to out-of-town locations, and in some cases they have actually done so.
That has been going on for many years. Back in the 1980s or 1990s, John
Gummer, a distant predecessor of the Minister, started to introduce
restrictions on planning permissions for out-of-town shopping centres.
That process has continued; in fact, as recently as last year the
latest set of planning guidelines further sought to restrict
permissions.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022670000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000009">That is a
well-established threat; it has existed for some time. More recently,
of course, the advent of online shopping means that many more people
are now shopping from home over the web, and as a result a great many
retail store chains have concluded that they need fewer shops to cover
the entire country. Inevitably, that has reduced demand for shopping
locations on Britain’s high streets.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022670000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000010">Those two
challenges mean that change is inevitably coming to our towns and
cities. That should not surprise us. Change is fine; it is okay and it
is something that Britain’s built environment has had to face up
to over decades, indeed over centuries. In fact, if we look at 
<?notus-xml column=32?>townscapes and cityscapes—the way that towns and cities
look—we see that all of them are the product of successive waves
of development, in some cases going back very many years. We are in
London. London has been occupied for at least a couple of millennia and
the signs of successive waves of development during human occupation of
this site are around for us to see, even now.</hs_Para>

Penrose:</Member></B> Bath is indeed extremely beautiful; it is also a
very rare example of a single, fairly homogenous and relatively planned
style of building. With very few exceptions such as Bath, or more
modern examples such as Milton Keynes, most of the rest of
Britain’s towns and cities are not planned. The way they look is
the result of a set of rather accidental phases and stages of
development. As a result, some of those phases and stages of
development, which have inevitably happened because towns and cities
have had to react to society’s changing needs over decades and
centuries, have created a look that in some cases may be beautiful and
in some cases may be very, very average indeed. In fact, I suspect that
many of us can think of some parts of some towns and cities that
everybody would cheerfully see being redeveloped quite rapidly. And
there is everything in between.</hs_Para>

cases, we have lucky accidents of beautiful parts of our towns and
cities, and in other cases the unlucky accidents of rather ugly places.
We need to face up to the fact not only that change has always been a
facet of the development of our built environment but that it will
always be so. Our towns and cities need to carry on changing if they
are to cope with the changing demands of society. They always have and
they always will. Given the twin challenges I have just set out, it is
extremely likely that we are due for another bout of
change—another rapid stage of evolution in what our towns and
cities need to do. Nowhere is that more true than on the high street,
as it tries to face up to the challenges that I described.</hs_Para>

is not whether change is coming—clearly it is—but rather
how we react to it; how our built environment reacts to it and how
local residents are able to use the buildings that we have inherited
from our predecessors and those that we are building and developing to
bequeath to our successors in whichever urban environment we live and
work.</hs_Para>

it is crucial to ensure that we keep the best bits of what we have
already. As I said, there are plenty of examples of beautiful
townscapes and wonderful locations, from London’s Mall through
to city-centre locations from Edinburgh right the way down to Cornwall,
and back again. We need to ensure that as we allow our towns and cities
to change, to develop and to react to the pressures on them, we keep
the best pieces and do not casually or accidentally allow them to be
destroyed in the process of development.</hs_Para>

have some mechanisms to do that. For example, we have listed buildings.
A very small proportion of this country’s
buildings—roughly 4%—are subject to listing orders. That
means that if they are of particular historic or architectural
importance, they are legally protected from being damaged by future
development. Equally, we have conservation areas, which is where I
think the Minister and the rest of his Department come in. Those areas
are protected by planning laws. Local councils can designate a
conservation area, and that allows a measure of protection to ensure
that it is properly looked after and a homogenous look is
maintained.</hs_Para>

on the passion for tourism that he has shown on both the Front and Back
Benches. Does he agree that although listing and conservation areas are
very welcome, there is a bit of a failing, because in neither case is
sufficient weight put on actually keeping a building for what it was
actually designed to be, even though in many cases that is perfectly
possible?</hs_Para>

Penrose:</Member></B> I agree with my hon. Friend that, wherever
possible, it is often more historically authentic to try to maintain a
particular building for its original purpose. However, it may no longer
be possible to maintain a building for its original purpose; a good
example would be Martello towers, which, for those who have temporarily
forgotten, were part of Britain’s defences during the Napoleonic
wars, guarding our coastline from invasion. Clearly, whatever we may
think about the likelihood of a French invasion in the future, Martello
towers are no longer part of this country’s sea defences, so it
would not be sensible to have them as a military installation any more.
Many of them have now been very successfully converted, and most
conservationists would argue is that if it is not possible, either for
economic or other reasons, to maintain a building for its initial use,
it is far better to make sure that it has a modern use than to have it
sit empty, because if a building sits empty it very rapidly decays.
Although I instinctively sympathise with my hon. Friend’s
comment, if it is not feasible we need to be flexible and accept the
case for
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000020">Moving
on from listed buildings and conservation areas, I recently called for
an addition to the available tools for protecting the best of what we
currently have, to ensure that as the process of change moves forward
in our towns and cities, what is good is not accidentally destroyed. In
addition to individual listed buildings and conservation areas, we also
need to give consideration to listed views—some way of
protecting the skyline or particular avenues of views in towns and
cities. There is already a small measure of protection. For example,
here in London a number of view corridors are protected, so that people
can see the dome of St Paul’s from various points in the city,
including a hill on Hampstead heath. But those corridors are narrowly
defined and do not provide a ready way of protecting the incidental,
day-to-day or small-scale beauty that most of us can think of in towns
and villages in our
constituencies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000021">Most
people, as they take the dog for a walk or go for a walk on a Sunday
with their family, for example, will know local spots where the view is
perfect and they love 
<?notus-xml column=34?>it. They will pause when looking at such a view to appreciate it,
whether it is a towpath on a canal, a bandstand in the park or the
local high street; it does not matter exactly what it is. It is hard
for existing legislation to protect that aspect of what is good-looking
and therefore worth preserving in our urban environment. It would help
if we moved towards rounding out and completing the suite of protection
measures that we
have.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000022">Deciding
what protections we need, and designating the bits that are worth
saving, would allow us to move faster and more vigorously towards the
kind of change and updating in urban environments that we have already
mentioned, particularly high streets, given the housing requirements
that we know about. If we know about the bits that are worth keeping,
inevitably and logically it follows that everything else is at least
fair game for being updated, redeveloped and regenerated more rapidly,
so that it can be altered to reflect what society needs from it with
less fuss than
before.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000023">We
can move faster in reacting to the forces of housing requirements and
the hollowing out of high streets, but only if we know what is worth
keeping—because we will have designated it, as I have
described—and what is not so special, which, if it is changed,
we should not be so worried about. Having designated the stuff that is
worth keeping, we should be more relaxed about everything else,
allowing more rapid development and not being so precious about what
regulatory and planning constraints we place on some
things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000024">If
people look around while walking on most high streets in Britain, in
most places they will usually see a ground floor with retail and
sometimes leisure—restaurants, or whatever—and above
that, except in the centre of the biggest cities, they will see one or
two storeys of lightly used residual construction in buildings that
have been standing for 100 years. The upper floors tend not to have
been designed to be used above retail and, in many cases, they are hard
to access and use for anything terribly productive. In many otherwise
thriving high streets, above those one or two extra storeys above the
ground floor there is just fresh
air.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000025">Those
spaces ought to be some of the most valuable, productive and useful in
our towns and cities, yet they are lightly used or unbuilt, by and
large because such buildings were constructed in the 19th century or
earlier and, if they are not historically important, the chances are
that they are not terribly useful either. We should allow the ones that
are not designated as important and historically, visually or
architecturally significant to be redeveloped more easily. To do that,
we need to be a bit more relaxed about the regulations that we
apply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000026">My
gentle suggestion—my starter for 10—is that if we want to
free up the opportunity for our high streets to be redesigned and
redeveloped more easily, and make space for more housing in town
centres, reducing the inevitable pressure on the fringes of towns, on
the green belt and green fields, we should consider allowing developers
to build up rather than just out. I suggest to my right hon. Friend the
Minister that to do that we should allow buildings to be redeveloped,
particularly on high streets, knocked down if necessary and built up.
It should be economic to rebuild them. A building that is four or five
storeys high, when it is currently only one or two, makes the economics
of redevelopment work much more effectively.</hs_Para>

extend the permitted development rules, which currently allow
small-scale extensions and additions to buildings, to allow additional
height to be added to some town centre buildings. We could set a
maximum height, for example, up to the maximum height of other
buildings in the same block, or to that of a local church tower or the
tree canopy—something that is not absurdly tall. I am not
talking about building the Shard in towns around the country. I am
talking about a small addition that would make more of our towns and
cities look more like a Parisian boulevard, for example, with shops,
restaurants, cafés and other commercial premises on the ground
floor and a mixture of either offices or apartments a few floors above.
Those are great places  to live and work; they are elegant and
in some cases beautiful. Doing that would make sure that we were
hanging on to the important parts that are already beautiful in our
developed and built
environment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000028">That
small change could be transformational and could save our high streets,
or allow them to develop and mutate as they must if they are to
survive, and could, I hope, reduce pressure on our green fields by
providing alternative places to build much needed houses. This is a
small suggestion—a modest proposal—and I hope that the

Vickers</B> (Cleethorpes) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr Dobbin. I congratulate my hon. Friend the
Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) on securing this important
debate, which covers a range of subjects, all of which are keenly
considered important by those whom we
represent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000030">The
full title of the debate is “Role of planning in preserving
urban views and regenerating high streets”. Our high streets are
coming to terms with the change in shopping habits. Can the planning
system do anything to help speed and assist that regeneration? The key
question is, is the planning system a help or a hindrance in that
process at the moment? Clearly, it has a part to play. I served for
five years as a cabinet member on a local authority, in charge of
planning policy. Thankfully, I was not in charge of implementing
individual decisions, which of course is the most contentious part of
it. The part that I found most difficult was the speed at which the
planning system works. Whether people are on the side of a developer or
a shopkeeper wanting to make a minor change, or objecting to an
application that they feel will blight their part of town, they want a
speedy resolution of the
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000031">We
can all relate to the listed views that my hon. Friend mentioned. As he
represents a different seaside resort, I am sure he has a different
view, but he should come to witness the sunrise over Cleethorpes. All
of those things add to the quality of life, so they are
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000032">The
Government have made some important changes to the planning system
since the coalition agreement, including the new planning framework,
all of which has been very good. One aspect about which I have
reservations 
<?notus-xml column=36?>is that more decision making is being passed to unelected officials, be
it the Planning Inspectorate or whatever, whether on appeal or because
a local authority is seen to be failing in its duty. A vital part of
the local democratic process is that local councillors should be in
charge of making planning decisions. Those of us who have served on a
local authority appreciate that people expect us to be involved in and
to influence planning decisions, whether small or large. That goes
right to the heart of our local democratic
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000033">Cleethorpes
High street has a good mix, and it is surviving despite the onslaught
from out-of-town developments and neighbouring Grimsby, where the main
shopping centres are located. I appreciate that shoppers do not take
note of political boundaries. In fact, Grimsby and Cleethorpes are one
area. Thirty years ago, Freeman street in Grimsby was the hub of the
local retail community, which served a vast housing area where many who
worked on the fish docks lived. Freeman street has declined into a
street of boarded-up properties with the occasional charity shop, a few
takeaways and little else because the local authority, on which I
served for a period, did its level best to maintain the high street as
it was without recognising that the main shopping centre had moved
elsewhere. We tried to preserve the high street, and it was like
continually putting plasters on to a
wound.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000034">We
must recognise that the high street is changing. Out-of-town retail
parks have, to a considerable extent, become a replacement high street.
People can go to the local out-of-town supermarket, which is surrounded
by half a dozen outlets of a similar nature. People can get everything
in that one place, which we must recognise. I want to preserve high
streets where they are commercially viable and, in effect, wanted by
the local
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000035">I
am not a particular fan of the recommendations of the Mary Portas
review, although not because I do not support its aims and
objectives—I served on a town team for a great many years.
Across the country, there are councils, chambers of commerce, traders
associations and the like that have tried virtually everything
contained in the Portas review, including adjusting planning 
controls and doing their best to keep parking charges at a reasonable
level.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000036">We
must recognise that parking charges are an important part of a local
authority’s income. When I was a councillor, parking charges
represented just over £1 million of income. Yes, people can say
that doing away with or restricting parking charges would boost the
local economy and might attract more business, thereby boosting
business rates, but it is a long-term process. In the meantime, the
local authority is stuck with having to provide services on
hard-pressed budgets. That income simply cannot be replaced. Yes, there
are schemes. North Lincolnshire council, which forms part of my
constituency, has had a very successful scheme in recent months that
has proven a godsend to many of the smaller towns and has helped things
along
considerably.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000037">Promenades
are an important part of seaside resorts such as Cleethorpes and
Weston-super-Mare, and they are equally part of the retail mix. Yes,
promenades have their amusement arcades, but if we want a vibrant
seaside resort, there has to be a mix of arcades, retail, cafés,
restaurants, and so on. We urgently need to do all we can. My own party
produced a document on seaside resorts prior to the election called, as
I recall, “Not the 
<?notus-xml column=37?>end of the line.” The document considered many of those issues,
and perhaps it is worth the Minister digging the document out of the
files so that we can see whether we can proceed with some of its
suggestions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000038">My
hon. Friend mentioned the need for change of use so that people are
able to bring many of the now surplus retail units back into
use—every town has parades of shops that are now redundant as
retail units. Yet more help is needed, perhaps including a programme of
support, so that owners can change those units into residential use. We
all know of the chronic housing difficulties in many parts of the
country, and many of the surplus retail properties are owned by
small-time developers or redundant family businesses that have now
closed down with people moving on. It would be helpful if the Minister
were to consider those
things.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13022670000218" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000218">2.56

a former Minister with responsibility for heritage, I want to say that
the hon. Gentleman is right when he remarked on the important balance
of preserving what we have come to understand across communities as
beauty in relation to our heritage. I remember the delicate discussions
when I was a Minister in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on
balancing the interests of heritage against new
building.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000041">In
London we have broadly got that right. We can point to exemplary new
architecture that contributes to the London skyline, such as the
Gherkin, the Shard and the London Eye. Those buildings are
controversial—some people like them, and some people dislike
them—but they contribute to the sense that London is a modern,
forward-looking city. None of us would want to see the important centre
that is Westminster, and the important heritage that lies here,
destroyed. The London Eye, across the way by County hall, adds to that
and provides the right balance. Equally, there were delicate discussion
on how the Shard might affect the views from the Tower of London and
the important line of sight that goes right down to Richmond park, and
we arrived at the right balance. Those discussions will continue as new
developments are
proposed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000042">When
we consider what has been achieved in parts of London that have been
run down and are in need of regeneration, such as the royal docks and
the huge work by the London borough of Newham under the leadership of
its mayor, Sir Robin Wales, particularly around the Olympic site and
the Westfield development, there has been a huge contribution of
modernity, and the right balance has been struck for the vibrant
multicultural community, which has experienced tremendous poverty over
the
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000043">I
thought it was important to contribute to this debate because at the
same time, a story has been unfolding on our London high
streets—a quiet disaster in need of serious regulation. I am
slightly concerned by the presumption made by the hon. Gentleman,
unless I misunderstood him, that protection should apply to heritage,
beauty, what we need to preserve and where we need development, but
that we more or less do not need regulation for the rest. I want to
introduce to this debate 
<?notus-xml column=38?>a growing depth of concern, across London and now in some of our other
major towns and cities, about the look and shape of our high streets
and how individual people can affect that. What people see here in
London, from Ealing to Tottenham to Hackney to Peckham, is a
proliferation of betting shops, payday loan shops and fast food
restaurants, usually in the shape of chicken shops. They are not
Kentucky Fried Chicken but Tennessee, Kansas or any other state. They
are rife in boroughs such as Waltham Forest and Haringey. Pawn shops
also
proliferate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000044">That
is disastrous to the high street. No one says that it is a problem to
have one or two bookmakers, but it is a problem to have, as Haringey
Green Lanes does, nine in a stretch of no more than 800 metres. Do we
need  22 bookmakers from Seven Sisters tube station up
Tottenham High road and Fore street and into Enfield? What kind of
regulatory environment has led to that? The hon. Gentleman was a
Minister in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with some
responsibilities in that area. It is time for his colleagues in DCMS
and the Department for Communities and Local Government to come
together to establish the right planning and licensing environment to
preserve what we understand as a high street. If we just allow mini Las
Vegases to develop across London, we will be thumbing our noses at a
licensing regime that worked well. All developed countries take the
planning and licensing of gambling
seriously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Greg Mulholland" PimsId="4826" UID="13022670000236" xid="861" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000236">Greg
Mulholland:</Member></B> I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman would
agree with me and the all-party parliamentary Save the Pub group. We
point out that it is not the rigidity of the planning system but its
weaknesses that are causing problems. He and I have both highlighted
the ludicrous situation that a viable pub can be turned into a betting
shop without the need to go through the planning process, which
undermines the whole topic that we are
discussing.</hs_Para>

Lammy:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
contribution. I was moving in that direction, but I saw him in his seat
and knew that he would elucidate very well the situation faced by our
pubs, particularly on the high street, so I navigated my remarks into
his terrain. However, I will leave him to give the peroration that I
know he is about to give. He will know that the reason for the
proliferation and saturation of bookmakers on our high streets is
relaxed planning laws that have allowed them to move into former pubs,
banks and estate agents’—frankly, to move
anywhere—when they should be in a sui generis class of their
own. Any civilised democracy would seek to regulate that area of
activity carefully. I am not suggesting that it should be the same as
how we might choose to regulate lap dancing clubs, for example, but I
think we have wisdom as human beings in taking gambling seriously and
requiring a certain kind of regulation for it.</hs_Para>

later this week, an Adjournment debate will be held in the House on
fixed-odds terminals in betting shops. These new machines, which allow
people to lose up to £100 in 20 seconds, are driving the
proliferation of betting shops. I am deeply concerned that the
Government seem not to want to do anything about them on either the
licensing or the planning side. Where will we be  in five
years’ time? What misery will be wrought on 
<?notus-xml column=39?>communities? Can it be right for the borough of Haringey to have more
bookmakers than bookshops? Is that really the message that we want to

people?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000048">Ministers
have said that they want local authorities to use article 4 powers to
designate an area to exclude a particular category of activity, such as
betting shops. The problem with article 4 is that it does not prevent
betting shops from opening in banks or estate agents, and it certainly
costs local authorities a hell of a lot of money that they do not have
at this time to use the powers. The Government must act, and they must
get serious about licensing. A fear is developing across the community
that the Government will not act because their receipts from taxation
on these activities are such that the Treasury is prepared to turn a
blind eye.</hs_Para>

up the tab in disastrous lives if we allow such activities to continue.
If we allow chicken shops and takeaways to open up next to schools
across the country, the NHS will pick up the tab for the resulting
obesity. If we allow betting shops to prey on poor people—the
latest evidence suggests that the proliferation is occurring in poor
and deprived areas—we will pick up the tab for broken marriages.
Wives and daughters in particular feel the pain. We will pick up the
tab for the consequences. Because my hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow (Stella Creasy) does it so successfully, I need not
articulate how much damage payday loan shops cause, with the huge
interest rates—up to 1,000%—that they are now charging in
this deeply recessionary period. If we allow that to continue, I am
afraid that the sorts of scene that one can see in parts of downtown
America will be visited on this country.</hs_Para>

when we talk about urban planning, it is important that we talk about
what is real to people in their lives today and on their high streets.
They want a place where they can go have a drink, which is why I
absolutely support the activity of the hon. Gentleman and the work of
the Campaign for Real Ale to highlight the loss of pubs throughout this
country. People want somewhere to shop. They want independent shops as
well as major retailers. Yes, they want to bet on the grand national,
but they do not want to be overrun with bookmakers. They certainly do
not want to be overrun with fast food shops, given that we know that
too many are particularly dangerous for young people.</hs_Para>

the Minister will say something in his response about those issues. It
is not the first time that they have been raised in the House; they

Otley, in my constituency, has received a share of the

town centre high streets in my constituency —in
Headingley, Otley, Yeadon and Meanwood. Those areas are all different,
but they all rely on a mix of retail, food and entertainment, including
pubs. It is important to acknowledge that, although the way people are
shopping is changing, retailers are taking up and working with those
changes; indeed, they are using them to benefit themselves, their
business and therefore their town centre and their community.</hs_Para>

important that we do not make the mistake of talking about the death of
the great British high street. Although some high streets might be
changing, some businesses on them are doing extremely well and
succeeding. A good example that is some businesses in Otley are
providing wonderful local goods, some of which are foodstuffs and some
of which are other things. Those goods are made locally and transported
short distances. That is the kind of thing people want to buy from an
independent retailer and cannot buy in the same way from larger
retailers.</hs_Para>

time, other businesses are using innovation and coming up with
different products, ideas and ways of retailing. Many small independent
retailers, unlike some of the large chains that have collapsed, have
shown that they can embrace the internet era. They can have a shop
front physically showing people their products or services, while
having an attractive online offering that allows them to sell to a far
greater area.</hs_Para>

accept that there are challenges, however, and the Government are right
to do so. The message that I want to get across to the Minister is that
we must not fall into the trap of thinking that the way to deal with
some of those challenges is simply to deregulate the planning system
and say, “If we allow developers to get on and do whatever they
want, that will regenerate the economy.” That is a mistaken
view, and I am glad that it is not taken by my hon. Friend, but it is
taken by some people. Simply relaxing planning could be disastrous for
many town centres. It would be entirely wrong simply to say that people

reasonable, but let us allow local

Penrose:</Member></B> I understand the case that my hon. Friend is
eloquently making. Does he agree, however, that if local communities
have a say, it is important that that say is genuinely representative
of what local people think? He, I and many others here could point to
local campaigns against this or that development—usually whipped
up by people who have something commercial to lose if the new
development is installed—that do not represent the views of
local people once the development has gone through. In some cases, a
vehement campaign is fought against Tesco or whomever it may be, but
not one year later, once the local Tesco or whatever it may be has been
built, everyone who signed up to the campaign ends up shopping there.
It is therefore important to make sure that the democratic voice
genuinely represents the actual behaviour of local people, rather than
the views of just a few vehement
protestors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Greg Mulholland" PimsId="4826" UID="13022670000240" xid="861" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000240">Greg
Mulholland:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, but
the simple point is that people should have a say, and they cannot have
a say if it is denied to them by allowing further relaxation of the
general permitted development rights. That is why I strongly urge the
Minister to make representations that such a suggestion could be very
unhelpful. With town centre developments, as opposed to other kinds of
development, we have the opportunity to get the view of local
retailers, town councils, chambers of commerce and chambers of trade
that is not simply about opposing development, but about building a
vision for the local area. Those people know best, and we must not deny
them the right to express their views.</hs_Para>

turn to pubs. I said that the British high street is changing. For many
years, the mainstay of our high street might have been the
old-fashioned post office or the butcher. Many of those things are
important, and they are surviving and, indeed, thriving, which is to be
welcomed. I pay tribute to the work the Government have done with the
Post Office network to ensure that the local post office remains a
mainstay. However, the mainstay of many high streets can and should be
the British pub. The pub has served a purpose in high streets and
marketplaces for hundreds of years. As many retail businesses
necessarily change around them, many pubs do not need to change; they
are still surviving and still thriving. Many of the issues that they
face are not about the amount of trade they do. It is important to
recognise that other issues affect them, but the problem with the
planning system is that it does not do that adequately.</hs_Para>

be the case with a supermarket. That is simply not acceptable. In many
areas up and down the country, people find that a local pub that is
wanted, used, viable and making money can be sold. Indeed, pubs are
being sold in their hundreds behind the backs of local communities by
indebted lease pub companies, whose model is now facing the end. Pubs
are sold direct to supermarkets, but the community has no say whatever.

Pub group warmly welcomed the call by the Department for Communities

guidance for pubs and other local services. Of course, some councils
have done that, and the Minister has taken a keen and direct interest

of a proactive council that considers pubs to be important. It has
introduced supplementary planning guidance to deal with some of the
problems that pubs face. I am extremely disappointed that the British
Beer and Pub Association, which unfortunately represents
Britain’s large pub companies and brewers rather than fighting
for the future of many British pubs, is seeking to overturn that
decision by judicial review. Not only is that disgraceful, but it shows
the organisation for what it is. I hope that through the work of the
Save the Pub group and the Department for Communities and Local

guidance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0001.htm#13022670000066">The
work that the Department for Communities and Local Government is doing
does not excuse the fact that it operates a planning system that does
not adequately and commonsensically prevent unreasonable moves from one
use class order to another. It is still possible to demolish a
free-standing pub overnight, even if the pub is wanted and a small
business man or woman wants to carry on running it. That is a permitted
development right, which is nonsensical. Likewise, a pub can be turned
into a supermarket, a betting shop or a solicitors’ office,
which are very different uses of the premises. Communities may lose a
valuable and wanted pub and have a supermarket imposed on them and on
local retailers.</hs_Para>

the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare, when
communities are genuinely opposed to such a change, they do not even
have the opportunity to comment on whether they want a local Tesco to

in a town centre and affect the mix of shops in the area, which is the
reason why people come and shop there in the first place. The wrong
kind of development can be extremely damaging.</hs_Para>

message is that much of what the Government have said and done has been
welcome and positive, particularly the work on the Portas pilots. The
national planning policy framework was a great piece of work, which has
hugely improved the planning framework. Will the Minister tell us why
officials and Ministers in the Department for Communities and Local
Government still refuse to amend use class orders or look again at the
general permitted development rights to clear up the absurd loopholes
that are damaging communities and town centres across the country? It
would be possible to make simple changes under secondary legislation to

<?notus-xml column=43?>give communities a say by requiring any change of use of a valued
community facility, such as a local pub, to go through the planning
process. Overnight, that would stop such assets being sold behind the
backs of communities; it would stop there being 22 betting shops on the
street in Tottenham that the right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)
mentioned; it would stop Tesco and Sainsbury’s stores being
imposed on communities without their having any say whatsoever; and it
would stop the nonsense of viable, profitable businesses being closed.
The damage that such changes of use do to the local economy is borne
out by the fact that twice as much of the money spent in a pub is
recycled into the local community as of the money spent in a
supermarket.</hs_Para>

a word of warning to the Minister, who is a big friend of pubs, and who
is passionate about them and about other small shops, business and
services. The Government have announced that they will introduce a
statutory code of conduct for the giant leased pub companies to stop
them overcharging their lessees year after year—a scandal that
has closed and is closing many otherwise viable, wanted businesses.
That is good news, but already some of the leased pub companies have
threatened to start mass disposals of their pubs. Around the country,
pubs are being bought up by small breweries, micro-breweries and local
entrepreneurs and by communities, some of whom are using the community
right to buy. Unless the DCLG takes responsibility and changes use
class orders and general permitted development rights, the leased pub
companies will be able to dispose of such pubs for other use, as they
have threatened to do, without giving the community a say in the
matter. Joined-up thinking is required, and my right hon. Friend the
Minister and his colleagues must take that responsibility seriously and
deal with the problem. It is a simple matter for them to ensure that,
where such pubs are viable and wanted and where a realistic offer is
made for them, they are sold as pubs, so that they can continue to be
an important part—indeed, the mainstay—of our high
streets and our communities up and down the
country.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_26_PT_1/B2C675645136A1CA6EB3E25EAACACE4D28C5D3E4" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="26 February 2013">Tuesday

Blackman-Woods</B> (City of Durham) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship again, Mr Dobbin. I begin by
congratulating the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) on
securing the debate. It is an extremely important debate, and because
the Minister and I serve beautiful city constituencies—in his
case Bath and in my case Durham—it is relevant to both of us.
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare made two important points that I
agreed with and want to emphasise. First, change is coming to the high
street and we need to think better how to prepare for and manage it to
ensure that the cityscapes that we treasure are not damaged. Secondly,
we must recognise that planning is important in shaping places and that
it can be positively used for the benefit of our communities. We do not
hear that very often; we usually hear that planning is a brake on
growth and that it is damaging. I was glad that the hon. Gentleman used
Milton Keynes as an example of what positive planning can achieve. We
might not see the outcome of planning decisions for several years, but
30 years on we can see that Milton Keynes has benefited from careful
planning.</hs_Para>

Members made important points about their communities and protecting
their high streets. I will, rather cheekily, pick up a point that the
hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers) made strongly. He said
that localism was important, and he was worried that some of the
changes that the Government are making might damage localism and take
decisions away from local planning authorities. The Opposition objected
to the changes contained in the Growth and Infrastructure Bill, which
will transfer many decisions to the Planning Inspectorate. It is a pity
that the hon. Gentleman’s colleagues did not join us when we
opposed the Government’s plans.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) and the hon. Member for
Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland) made powerful speeches about use
class orders, which picked up on the point made by the hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare. They made important points about the need for local
people and local authorities to have more control over use class
orders, which I will discuss in more detail later. The Government have
just produced a school food review report that suggests that fast food
outlets should not be available near schools. It will be interesting to
know whether the Minister has had any conversations with his colleagues
in the Department for Education about how that could be
implemented.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000073">More
generally, we heard a plea for more flexibility to be given to local
authorities on how use class orders are used, which I have been
advocating for a long time. I see no reason why use class orders cannot
simply be given to local authorities to use as they want. Local
authorities represent their communities and know about what use classes
should be available, how they should be used and how to rescind one and
to put another in its place. If the Minister wants to extend his
localism credentials, this is something I could give him on a plate:
take use class orders away, look at them and give them to local
authorities. That would be a much more sensible way
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000074">To
return to the comments made by the hon. Gentleman, he referred to how
local councils can already protect views through conservation areas,

of an entire skyline, which would be hard to preserve, protect or allow

or of the very narrow, specific example of a particular line 
of sight, perhaps on a small scale, down a particular street with
something that happens to be framed at the end of it, which would be a
criminal waste to allow to be got rid of but which is too small and too

happen to protect them. That facility is available to all local
authorities through their local plans, but I suspect that they are not
all using it as well as they might be. Perhaps this afternoon we should
be putting a big plea out to local authorities to ask them, when they
are putting their local plans together, really to think about
views—outside a particular street or part of it—that
might be important to the local community or area and that need to be
protected. They should outline what the views are and put additional
guidance in place. They could all learn easily from the London

local authorities to ensure that such views are protected. From time to
time councils have to be reminded, when a development application

want to pick up on one other point made by the hon. Gentleman, which
was about using additional regulations to pre-empt where developers
might want to develop. That is an extremely difficult thing to do:
always being one stage ahead of developers is probably impossible. Each
case is best dealt with on its merits, bearing in mind the protections
that can already be drawn down by local authorities. I am absolutely
not convinced that more regulation is needed in this
instance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000081">A
lot of hon. Members this afternoon have raised issues about the high
street, and it is worth picking up on a few points. Some of the figures
about use of the high street are interesting: high streets with strong
conservation areas are doing better. For example, Cambridge is doing
well in protecting its high street and the volume of commerce taking
place in retail there. That tells us something about how communities
are starting to think about their own high streets and how tourists are
thinking about them, because a high street is a lot more than simply a
retail experience. The hon. Gentleman brought out this point well: we
sometimes get bogged down in thinking about our high streets only in
terms of retail. It is tempting to do that because we get regular
figures about what is happening to the retail sector, which is
important because it is an indicator of the health of our high streets,
so we need to take the figures seriously. But what they tell us is that
we need to diversify the high street and to think a lot more about
community and housing use. This strays on to the point made by the hon.
Member for Leeds North West about  
<?notus-xml column=46?>the importance of pubs. They are part of the leisure offer that is
important on our high streets, but which we are very much in danger of
losing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000082">Again,
use class orders are important, because we need councils to have the
flexibility to decide whether the retail space that might not be fully
occupied can instead be office, leisure or housing use, and to be able
to change it back. One of the problems with use class orders is that it
is sometimes difficult constantly to change use, but we need that
degree of flexibility. I will be interested to hear what the Minister
says.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000083">No
one mentioned how complicated it is at the moment for local authorities
to draw down money to support regeneration of the high street, outside
of Portas. On that Portas money, even if local authorities got
£100,000, we know that only about 12% of the money has been
drawn down so far. There are lots of different tiny funding pots, and
we perhaps need to bring them together into a more coherent
regeneration framework, so that local authorities can find a
straightforward way to develop their high streets in line with the
local community opinion of what should be provided. I am probably
telling the Minister that Portas is good as far as it goes, but it is
not the whole
answer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000084">The

to diversify. We need additional tools to do that, but I am not sure

Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers) asked whether
planning was a help or a hindrance, and reminded us that he had five
years’ experience of being in charge of planning. He worried
about the speed of operation on some occasions and then chided the
Government for putting pressure on local planning authorities if they
did not act quickly. There was a slight inconsistency in his comments,
but he clearly cares as passionately as I do about the importance of
local decision making, and I suspect that he will be pleased to see the
amendments that have been tabled to the Growth and Infrastructure Bill
in another place to deal with the concern that he expressed. We are
looking for ways of speeding up some matters, not least, for example,
current consultation on the planning application procedure, and I think
that will be welcomed by him and other hon. Members here

his period of office as the Minister with responsibility for gambling
was to help ensure that the Government could announce a review of the
concerns that the right hon. Member for Tottenham raised in respect of
what he called bookmakers. That increasingly seems to be a misnomer as
more and more of them seem to do their business from fixed-odds betting
terminals, about which the right hon. Gentleman joined with me and hon.

earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes—the work
that we are doing on the Portas pilots and the town team partners, of
which Otley, as he reminded us, is one and is benefiting from that
scheme. He also rightly pointed out that not all regulation is bad. I
have made that point on several occasions. Those who seek to deregulate
merely for the sake of deregulation have missed the point. Although the
Government are seeking to remove unnecessary red tape, we are also
mindful that some regulations are critically
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000093">I

hon. Friend began by reminding us that we face various challenges. He
said that on the one hand we need to get more houses built, but on the
other hand there are pressures in achieving that without encroaching on
the green belt. He also pointed out what happens in our high streets
and the dangers that have existed, particularly in relation to
out-of-town supermarkets and developments. He rightly praised a former
Member of the House, Mr Gummer, for his work. I remind my hon. Friend
that we have gone further in the national planning policy framework,

necessary to meet changing demand. He was not putting his head in the
sand. He accepted that change has to take place. It has to take place
in the high street in response to, for example, online shopping. My
hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes gave the example of a street in

the hon. Member for City of Durham, I must say to my hon. Friend that
we already have in place measures that will deliver what he seeks to
achieve. Many local councils are already taking innovative planning
approaches to safeguarding urban views and are developing strategies to
support their high streets. There are many different ways in which that
is being done, but it is predominantly through local plans and the
supporting evidence that goes alongside
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000099">Others
have adopted sensitive approaches to heritage conservation—I
know my hon. Friend cares passionately about that—urban design,
designated conservation areas and so on. For example, South Kesteven
council has undertaken a townscape character assessment of Grantham,
which considers the town’s evolution and character to guide
decisions on new development, achieving what I think he seeks. The
document assesses the design of the buildings and the relationship
between them as a contribution to the distinctiveness of the town. It
details key views to landmark buildings and heritage assets, which are
issues of material consideration in various development
proposals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000100">The
right hon. Member for Tottenham referred to examples in London, where
he thinks we have got it about right. The supplementary planning
guidance in the London plan sets out protected panoramas, linear views,
river prospects and townscape views that contribute to the character of
the city. Other parts of the country 
<?notus-xml column=49?>have adopted a similar approach. The right hon. Gentleman praised my
constituency of Bath. Bath and North East Somerset council has already
done something along the lines that he seeks. Burnley, Hampshire,

hon. Member for City of Durham made a very important point. Powers
exist, but perhaps not enough councils are aware of the opportunities
to achieve the sort of thing that my hon. Friend the Member for
Weston-super-Mare wants. I will certainly talk to my ministerial
colleagues about her suggestion that we should do more to promote the
powers that already exist, and perhaps share with councils examples of
good practice that could achieve much of what my hon. Friend wants. I

hon. Friend raised issues to do with high streets. He suggested that we
look at the parapet above the shop with its often rather garish
colouring, where, very often, we see empty spaces. He will be delighted
to know that I recently announced a challenge to the Portas pilot and
to the town teams to make proposals for the large sum of money that I
have earmarked to bring back into use, for residential purposes, the
spaces above shops. I entirely accept that there are difficulties,
which he alluded to, including access to the space above shops and
security, which is why we have asked the many teams to consider
innovative solutions. We are on to the issue; we are providing some

Penrose:</Member></B> I may be pre-empting the Minister’s next
remark, but I urge him to think a little more radically. I welcome the
measures and steps that he describes as having already been taken. In
some cases, because buildings were designed for a different purpose 100
or 150 years ago, it is not possible to retrofit them in a way that
delivers the additional potential uses as accommodation, offices or
whatever. Therefore, the only way to get them to work, even without
public money, is to allow enough commercial headroom for entire
buildings to be
redeveloped.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000104"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Foster" PimsId="3294" UID="13022670000247" xid="209" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000247">Mr

the few minutes I have left, I have headroom to refer to that issue. He
made it clear that he does not seek new regulation. He talked about the
possibilities for townscapes and views. They already exist but they
could be promoted further. He suggested that having done that, we might
also increase the density of all sorts of developments and go higher

demolition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000105">I

development he proposes to ensure that such a possibility exists within
its local plan, and individual planning proposals can then be

peaceful

takes many forms. It ranges from the denial of Israel’s right to
exist to the abhorrent glorification of violence and infamous
Palestinian terrorists. PA officials readily speak to western audiences
about their determination to reach peace with Israel, but a very
different story is presented to their domestic audience. Official
Palestinian Authority media regularly paint a picture of a world in
which Israel does not exist. In its simplest visual form, that is

living side by side, residents on the west bank were being shown a map
carrying an unmistakeable message of Palestinian sovereignty over 
<?notus-xml column=52?>the whole area. In addition to denying Israel’s existence,

Palestinian school textbooks have included the same inflammatory
messages that I have mentioned. I read with great interest a recent
report into this matter by the Council of Religious Institutions of the
Holy Land. The US-funded report concluded that both Palestinian and
Israeli textbooks could do more peacefully to portray the other side.
The findings once again highlighted the fact that both sides in the

there are shortcomings in the report about which any reasonable and
unbiased person should have concerns. Those shortcomings could explain
why a number of the study’s scientific advisory panel and
leading stakeholders have refused to endorse the report. For instance,
the report fails to emphasise that the ultra-Orthodox school system,
which makes up only 8% of the Israeli student body, is not Government
regulated. It does not represent an official Israeli line and should
not be seen on a par with the PA-authorised textbooks. The
report’s other major failure is that it justifies the levels of
incitement found in Palestinian textbooks by asserting that perhaps it
is because the Palestinians are at an earlier stage of nation building,
are the weaker of the two adversaries and have suffered more hardships
in day-to-day life. We must not be distracted on the path to seeking
peace by that sort of moral
relativism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000130">Consistent
with the Palestinian Authority’s policy of glorifying
terrorists, the PA financially reward terrorism by paying a monthly
salary to Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons convicted of terror
offences. It pays a monthly salary of anything between £240 and
£2,100 to prisoners serving multiple life sentences for
involvement and facilitation of deadly acts of terrorism, including
suicide bombings. The longer the time in prison, the higher the salary.
To put it crudely, the more horrific the terrorist activity and the
more Israelis who are killed, the larger the salary. In total, the PA
is paying salaries totalling approximately £3 million each month
to 5,500 Palestinian terrorists in Israeli
prisons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000131">I
was shocked to learn that those payments are part funded by the British
taxpayer. Indeed, the payments come from the PA’s general
budget, into which the UK contributes more than £30 million each
year. I am unaware of any known safeguards in place preventing the use
of UK aid to that end. Previous attempts by my parliamentary colleagues
from all parts of the House to raise that issue have been met with

“welfare payments”. Crucially, that legislation
stipulates that a prisoner is not obligated to give his salary to his
family. Unmarried prisoners also receive the same basic salary as those
who are married and have children. Finally, a small stipend for wives

salaries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000133"><Member ContinuationText="Guto Bebb" PimsId="5521" UID="13022670000260" xid="1002" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000260"><B>Guto

However, in December 2012, a Palestinian Authority statement, which was
released through its official news service, explicitly stated
otherwise. That statement, which is made in the name of the Palestinian
Minister responsible for prisoners’ affairs, Issa Karake,
announced that those payments were salaries and not social assistance.
It went further by stating that any talk of social assistance was

conclusion, the PA’s failure to deliver on their commitment to
end incitement explicitly undermines the principles and conditions on
which the peace process is built. That incitement highlights the extent
to which Palestinian society has not publicly begun to absorb the
changes needed for a practical and genuinely peaceful co-existence with
Israel. I contend that incitement is a form of abuse of Palestinian
children. We must remember that those children are the next generation
of peacemakers and state-builders. Simply put, no peace agreement will
be able to guarantee peace in the medium to long term if a generation
of Palestinians is growing up indoctrinated to hate Israel, Jews and
the west.</hs_Para>

Government rightly hold Israel to account when Israeli policies stand
in the way of peace in the region. By the same reasoning, it is
important that they adopt a 
<?notus-xml column=55?>similar policy with regard to the Palestinians. The Palestinians will
take any British silence as a green light to continue this practice. We
must insist, as a policy, that the PA end the indoctrination of its

I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that the Government will
make, and will continue to make, representations to the PA that
incitement against Israel is unacceptable and in contravention of the
Oslo agreement. Widespread PA-endorsed incitement has gone unchallenged
for too long. The PA are clearly not making any effort to educate their
people in peace and co-existence with Israel. As we move forward into
this “year of peace”, the need to abandon all messages of
incitement is more important than

this opportunity to reiterate the Government’s position on
incitement. We oppose, in all circumstances, the advocacy of national,
racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to
discrimination, hostility or violence. We deplore incitement on either

say that we have a regular dialogue with both the PA and the Government

began his remarks, particularly his comment that Palestinians have been

Palestinians everywhere in the region. I also feel that to neglect any
sense of any activity that may 
<?notus-xml column=56?>have been perpetrated by Israelis during the occupation as any part of
popular anger against Israel misses an important

sufficient to deal with the underlying results of the study, which we
have only just been able to glance at. Our sense is 
<?notus-xml column=58?>that it is in line with previous studies, which have found that
incitement and extreme negative characterisations are very rare in both
Israeli and Palestinian textbooks. However, also in line with previous
studies, the report found a profound need for textbooks on both the
Israeli and Palestinian sides to do more to promote a positive
portrayal of each other, reflecting the principles of
co- existence, tolerance, justice and human dignity. We will
continue to engage both the Palestinian Authority and Israeli
authorities in relation to the background of that
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000162">My
hon. Friend has a number of issues in his back pocket. I had a briefing
on some of the material some weeks ago, through Palestinian Media
Watch. There are some tough examples. I think that I was expected to be
shocked, but I was not. Hon. Members should not mistake me. Some
material was shocking and offensive. It has no place in any political
or historical discourse in which any credible democratic authority has
a part. But my deep and genuine worry is that this incitement is not
simply a cause of separation between peoples and hatred; I am afraid
that it is a symptom of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000163">My
overwhelming feeling in looking at some issues, particularly in
relation to children, was sadness that those on both sides of the
divide who wish to emphasise difference and separateness are steadily
winning that battle. One example, which my hon. Friend may be aware of,
is a little girl of about seven years of age reciting with pride a poem
about a suicide bomber, or so-called martyr. If we see a child reciting
a poem about such a thing, instead of what ought to be filling her
mind, how do we react? Anger towards her is clearly not appropriate.
Whoever’s fault it is, it is not hers. I felt sadness for her,
but anger that those who possess the ability to take down some of the
barriers between Palestinians and Israelis simply do not do so, but
continue actions that perpetuate the
hatred.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000164">The
Palestinians should not praise the so-called martyrs and the suicide
bombers, and we will rightly condemn this, but progress in the middle
east peace process, perhaps, will play an even more effective part in
ensuring that what we all wish to see—the growing together of
people, without these barriers—comes to pass. Israel must
examine its own actions in the occupied territories, to ensure that it
does not allow an opportunity to fuel popular anger about Israel, which
has not come about solely because of exposure to the media, but by the
experiences of occupation of too many in those territories. To neglect
that is to miss something of considerable
importance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000165">Accordingly,
we believe that the only way to combat violence and incitement is to
reach a comprehensive two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. We are urgently working with both the US and the European
Union to start the peace process. This was a major subject for
discussion in talks between my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary
and Secretary of State Kerry yesterday in London. That is the most
important way forward. Incitement on either side of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is unacceptable and worthy of the
condemnation of the House. If we do not get progress in 2013 on the
middle east peace process, the context in which incitement and violence
takes root will not be truly dealt with. I urge all hon. Members to
focus the same determination on that issue as on their rightful
condemnation of incitement where they see
it.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_26_PT_1/39BFA0F1FDBE7CBBA7E862519942261FE83FBA47" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="26 February 2013">Tuesday

I explained in my Adjournment debate in September last year, trolling
first came to my attention following the tragic death of Liverpool
teenager, Georgia Varley, in October 2011. Since then, it has become
clear that there is no clear-cut definition of trolling. Too often,
this is confused with cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking or even child
grooming. Trolling is something very different. I would characterise it
as something said online that carries online consequences and poses no
offline, real-world risk to the individual in receipt of the message.
Trolls demonstrate immoral and unethical behaviour and, quite often, as
in the case of Georgia, they trade entertainment on the back of an
individual’s personal grief. In essence, the victims of trolls
suffer psychological, not physical,
abuse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000169">It
is a growing problem in British society and one that Parliament and the
legal process have been slow to recognise. I want to focus on concerns
regarding the advice given to prosecutors, suggesting that messages
sent that are of a grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false nature
do not meet the public interest test, inasmuch as they are unlikely to
lead to prosecutions. Indeed, Crown Prosecution Service rules
state:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13022670000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000211">“Just
because the content expressed in the communication is in bad taste,
controversial or unpopular, and may cause offence to individuals or a

should concentrate the minds of parliamentarians. There are rightly
concerns because the guidelines fail to articulate exactly what
trolling is or identify what kind of people are commonly victims of it;
instead, the guidelines attempt to issue a one-size-fits-all solution
that is not contextually bound and takes no consideration of personal
relationships between the sender, the recipient and/or the subject
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000171">The
guidelines set out by the DPP that most relate  to that issue
are referenced in section 127 of the Communications Act 2003. The
interim guidelines attempt to make a clear distinction between the
different degree of abuse sent via social media, and so instruct
prosecutors accordingly. For example, because of the seriousness of the
potential offence threatened in a message as outlined in paragraphs
12(1), 12(2) and 12(3), such misdemeanours would be prosecuted robustly
using, it has to be said, mainly legislation designed for offline
offences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000172">We
are advised that offences deemed to have been committed in accordance
with paragraph 12(4), which are likely to be grossly offensive,
indecent, obscene, menacing or false, are unlikely to lead to a
prosecution despite the distress, hurt and needless anxiety that such
contraventions can cause. That is where the guidelines have failed
adequately to address the growing problem. 
<?notus-xml column=60?>Indeed, the directive highlights one of the major problems for
prosecutors, because, in accordance with the guidelines, something said
online is not punishable in law in the same way as something
said offline. In essence, the guidelines fail to address the increasing
grey area of trolling: the difficulty of proving what a troll intends
and what a victim interprets the troll’s intention as being.
That, coupled with the ease with which anonymity is afforded to social
media users, has led to deliberately manipulative and deceptive
behaviours with which prosecutors have not been able to get to grips.
Put differently, there is a fundamental failure to grasp the intention
of trolls: namely, it is their sole purpose on the internet grossly to
offend with obscene messages. The DPP’s justification for what I
perceive to be leniency is that it is not in the public interest to
prosecute such people, which is germane to my critique of the
guidelines because, in my opinion, they misinterpret the public
interest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000173">In

do not profess to being legally trained, so I would no doubt fail the
Wilson test, but as the use of social media increases exponentially,
the exposure to such gratuitous activity increases in proportion. It
stands to reason, therefore, that the public’s propensity to
want to see such crimes dealt with by the criminal justice system will
have increased
consequently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000175">Paragraph
39 of the guidelines specifically addresses the question of public
interest. The guidelines advise that if a suspect has taken swift
action to remove the communication or has expressed genuine remorse, he
or she should not face prosecution. I broadly welcome that
clarification, but swift removal does not necessarily mean someone has
not already been grossly offended. The internet allows individuals to
build an audience of tens, hundreds or even thousands within a very
short space of time. Under the guidelines, an individual troll could
post a series of grossly offensive messages that are seen by many
people, but simply removing the posts within a short space of
time—and “swift removal” is not defined in the
guidelines—makes it hard for action to be taken against that
troll.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000176">Similarly,
deletion does not take away the possible psychological impact on
someone who has already seen the message. Deleting a message from the
internet does not delete it from someone’s mind. Additionally,
the guidelines advise that if swift and effective action has been taken
by others, such as a service provider, to remove the communication in
question, or otherwise to block access to it, prosecution is not in the
public interest. Surely that would depend on the particular type and
frequency of such transgressions. The guidelines are a “get out
of jail free” card that offers virtually no deterrent
whatsoever. To all intents and purposes, prosecution can be avoided
because of the discretion of others, which is something we should not
endorse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000177"><Member ContinuationText="Rehman Chishti" PimsId="5607" UID="13022670000274" xid="1077" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000274"><B>Rehman

First, he talks about people retweeting a message on Twitter. Does he
agree that, 
<?notus-xml column=61?>whether someone is the first or the fifty-thousandth person to retweet a
message, there should be equal liability? Otherwise some people would
not be prosecuted because they retweeted later than others. Does he
also agree that it is good to have a review of the guidelines? We need
to make the public aware of how defamation laws apply to social media,
otherwise people will say, “Well, I did not know.” The
message has to go out to the country: “If you commit a crime or
breach the defamation law, you will have to face the
consequences.” We need new guidance, but, equally, people must
be aware of the existing
guidelines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000178"><B><Member ContinuationText="Steve Rotheram" PimsId="5632" UID="13022670000275" xid="1123" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000275">Steve
Rotheram:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman will know that, in law,
ignorance is no excuse. So someone could be prosecuted for defamation
if they transgress the guidelines. On the first point, I believe that
anyone who engages in social media should be aware of the social
consequences of posting such tweets or Facebook statuses, as my
assistant, who is a regular Facebook user, tells me they are
called.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022670000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000179">The
guidelines advise that if a communication is not intended for a wide
audience, nor is that the obvious consequence of sending the
communication, the offender should not face prosecution, particularly
where the intended audience did not include the victim or target of the
communication in question. That is weak and, with respect,
misunderstands social media. In the case of an RIP memorial page on
Facebook, for example, a troll’s message on a status is not
directed solely at the person who authored the status but is also
directed at other people who have commented on the status and 
all those who have visual access to it. In the case of Georgia Varley,
more than 4,500 people had liked her page and were therefore able to
see a whole host of comments, unfortunately including those posted by
trolls. That calls into question how the DPP uses the term “wide
audience.” Does a prosecutor have to investigate the computer
literacy of a suspect to determine whether they knew the exact figure

an RIP memorial page on Facebook would, of course, be deceased. The
intended victim of the troll, therefore, is not necessarily the
deceased person but the reader of the
message.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000180">The
guidelines also advise that if the content of a communication does not
obviously go beyond what could conceivably be tolerable or acceptable
in an open and diverse society that upholds and respects freedom of
expression, no prosecution is necessary. Of course I agree with that,
but I also believe that greater consideration must be given to
enforcing the law when grossly offensive comments have been made. There
should be some online equivalent to offences committed offline. Only
two people in England have been successfully prosecuted and jailed for
sending messages considered to be grossly offensive, indecent, obscene
or menacing. Is that really an effective deterrent to the people who
are sitting at their computers right now, contemplating sending a
disgusting message that might cause gross offence?</hs_Para>

are talking about vile, insulting and unacceptable behaviour, such as
the comments that I have seen posted on RIP memorial pages on Facebook
and that were revealed in a BBC “Panorama” documentary.
We are not talking about someone’s legitimate right to express
themselves freely. There is a world of difference between a fair
comment and a wilful denigration without validity that aims simply to
cause as much hurt and offence as possible. If we try to protect
trolls’ freedom to offend grossly, we are essentially defending
the indefensible.</hs_Para>

guidelines clearly give preference to physical abuse or the risk of
physical abuse over psychological abuse. When I met the Crown
Prosecution Service, its view was that, given the complexity of online
abuse,  the police are not afforded enough time to compile the
evidence necessary to take a case to court. Often, a maximum of six
months is not long enough to gather sufficient proof of the alleged
offence for a successful prosecution. In any such investigation, the
police must routinely combat fake accounts, fake identities, fake
e-mail addresses and issues with mobile communications, such as
pay-as-you-go devices. Deception makes it difficult for officers to
know where to start when looking for a troll hiding behind the
anonymity of a
computer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000186">However,
that should not prevent us from trying to rectify the problem and
eradicate the grey area that I have described. In fact, as I have said,
I believe that granting the police and the CPS additional time to
gather evidence for court cases would allow them to obtain evidence
that meets the test of what is grossly offensive and even expose
patterns of behaviour in some individuals that could lead to criminal
prosecution.</hs_Para>

additional time to compile evidence, the police need innovative
approaches to assist them. For example, the university of Central
Lancashire is in the early stages of looking at ways to identify trolls
through written word patterns. Dr Claire Hardaker, a lecturer in
linguistics and English language at the university,
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13022670000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000214">“Everyone
has a unique way of writing, of putting certain words together, which
is subconscious. Many teenagers say they are able to identify who sent
a text to them just by the style of writing and word habits or the way
the words are written. Someone might be pretending to be someone else,
but by analysing the way they write online, we can determine a
probable, age, gender, even a probable region from where they come
from.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13022670000188" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000188">Such
creative approaches could be invaluable in convicting trolls. However,
it is also true to suggest that any such invention will be for nothing
until the DPP can adequately provide prosecutors with a definition of
trolling that is separate from cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking or
grooming and that can be robustly prosecuted where
appropriate.</hs_Para>

that I reached early in my investigations into trolling
is that a multi-agency approach is needed to tackle
the problem effectively. As I have repeated, I am of the firm belief
that the way to deter individuals from sending grossly offensive
comments on social media is to change the culture of online users. That
in turn requires a clear lead from the judicial system. That does not
necessarily mean changing the law, but it does mean changing the
application of the law, which the guidelines fail to do. The final part

thanking hon. Members for taking part and by asking the
Solicitor-General the following questions. How does he define internet
trolling? Does he agree with the DPP’s assessment that messages
sent via social media that are grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or
false are unlikely to warrant prosecutions because it is not in the
public interest to do so? Does he agree with the approach set out in
paragraph 12, which is to assess initially offences that may have been
committed using social media? What steps is he taking to work with
prosecutors to find new ways to identify trolls, such as the scheme
devised by the university of Central Lancashire? Finally, will he
consider my request to increase the period of time that the police have
to collect their evidence on trolls before a case must be brought
before the
courts?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_26_PT_1/CAB009040170D397E533E1A86633C0E6B1859CA3" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="26 February 2013">Tuesday

Solicitor-General (Oliver Heald):</Member></B> It is a great pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Dobbin. I congratulate the hon.
Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram) on securing the debate.
It is a topic about which he feels strongly and on which he has led and
campaigned for some time. I agree that the sort of behaviour that he
has described in this debate and on earlier occasions is completely
unacceptable and wrong and must be
tackled.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000193">My
hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham and Rainham (Rehman Chishti) and
the hon. Gentleman made the point that a multi-agency set of different
approaches are needed if the issue is to be tackled effectively. My
hon. Friend mentioned defamation, and the hon. Gentleman will be aware
of some of the constructive work being done with media sites to ensure
that comments are taken down quickly and effective action is taken, but
much more can be done.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022670000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000194">I start by
addressing the hon. Gentleman’s four questions. The interim
guidelines distinguish a range of different kinds of behaviour in the
social media field. I am sure he would agree that a prosecutor would
tackle a case where there is a credible threat of violence, for
instance, differently from another case. Similarly, if an individual is
being targeted and harassed persistently, that is another kind of case.
There are offences that can be used to prosecute particular kinds of
conduct.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022670000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000195">There are
cases involving activities such as credible threats or harassment,
therefore, and then all the other cases, which can vary widely in what
they involve. They  
<?notus-xml column=64?>do not necessarily have the aggravating factors that would lead a
prosecutor to charge someone with a serious indictable offence such as
threats to kill, or harassment, but it does not follow that the cases
in that other category, which are so different from each other, will
not be prosecuted. In fact, the guidance is designed to cover the whole
field.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000196">Secondly,
the wording of paragraph 12 is subject to public consultation. I will
ensure that what the hon. Gentleman said today is conveyed to the Crown
Prosecution Service, so that his comments are not only on the record in
this place but part of the consultation. The approach taken in the
interim guidelines is to distinguish offending of different gravity. A
case of trolling, which, broadly speaking, is social media jargon for
posting provocative or disruptive messages, can fall into any one of
the categories of offending set out in the interim guidelines,
depending on the
facts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000197">Thirdly,
I thank the hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to work in the
academic sphere to develop technology and expertise that might assist
the police in the investigation of such offences. The consultation
extends to those with an interest in such matters. The police,
certainly, are interested in the techniques. Finally, there is the
question of whether statutory time limits need to be extended. That
needs to be considered in the context of the consultation. The issue is
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000198">More
generally, I provide assurance that the CPS can and does prosecute
cases successfully. The CPS reports an increase over recent months in
the number of social media cases. Since the publication of the interim
guidance on 19 December, the principal legal adviser to the Director of
Public Prosecutions agreed that 15 cases should be proceeded with by
prosecution. The interim guidelines issued by the DPP have been
developed to assist prosecutors. They were also developed in
conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers. The idea is
that points of the sort that the hon. Gentleman made about the academic
evidence can be taken into account in the consultation. It is important
to remember that the police investigate offences and gather the
evidence, and that the guidelines are intended to help them as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000199">The
public consultation provides an opportunity for practitioners, other
interested parties and the general public to contribute to the framing
of the final guidance. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that we
should urge people with an interest in the issue to take part; I will
ensure, as I hope he will, that as many colleagues as possible and
those outside this place take the
opportunity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000200">The
interim guidelines set out four broad categories for prosecutors to
consider when deciding on the appropriate charges. Have there been
credible threats of violence? Are there communications that
specifically target an individual? Has there been a breach
of a court order? Finally, does the communication breach
section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988 or
section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, which the hon.
Gentleman
mentioned?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000201">Malicious
communication may warrant a far more serious charge being pursued. The
interim guidelines are aimed at requiring the prosecutor to consider a
range of potential offences that might arise. The hon. Member for
Liverpool, Walton rightly highlighted the deeply unpleasant practice of
trolling in the case of Georgia Varley—a website set up to
commemorate that 
<?notus-xml column=65?>young girl’s life was targeted. Under the interim guidelines,
prosecutors are reminded that communications used to threaten and
target others can give rise to a range of serious offences. The hon.
Gentleman is right: the person who died would not be the target in such
circumstances, but the relatives and the people who cared for that
individual are targeted, or can be. When a particular person is
targeted but a harassment charge is not possible, because of the legal
requirements, clearly prosecutors would carefully weigh up whether they
can take the case under section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act.
It might well be in the public interest to do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000202">Similarly,
section 127 of the Communications Act provides an important safeguard
against the misuse of social media, such as the sending of grossly
offensive messages. The wording of the legislation is broad enough to
encompass quite a range of behaviour. The guidelines should assist
prosecutors in assessing each individual case. We do not want to
restrict free speech but, as the hon. Gentleman said, with rights come
responsibilities. While recognising important principles of free
speech, the interim guidelines do not offer a charter for those who
want deliberately and repeatedly to harass and cause distress. It is
important to recognise
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000203">Another
point to make to the hon. Gentleman is  that paragraph 12.4 of
the interim guidelines, the large category of messages, is set out as a
particular category. There is then an analysis of the court cases
concerning sections 1 and 127—the judges’ comments and
how the 
<?notus-xml column=66?>cases should be looked at in the European context. All that is examined.
Finally, there is a paragraph that deals with what the threshold would
have to be in order to prosecute cases. It is therefore a more reasoned
and complex exercise than might have been
thought.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000204">The
requirement of prosecutors to prosecute cases of this sort has been
demonstrated in cases that the hon. Gentleman is aware of, such as that
of Sean Duffy, who was successfully prosecuted and sentenced to 18
weeks’ imprisonment following the death of a young lady. Matthew
Woods was prosecuted under section 127 of the Communications Act and
sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment for posting on a Facebook
page grossly offensive messages regarding the missing children, April
Jones and Madeleine McCann. It is wrong, however, to think that those
would be the only cases involving social media to be charged and
brought before the courts with the risk of imprisonment. Such offences
are very much the ones that do not involve threats to kill, blackmail
allegations or harassment charges. The hon. Gentleman should bear in
mind that there are offences involving indictment and Crown court
trials, with substantial sentences available, that could be used in
appropriate
cases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022670000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/halltext/130226h0002.htm#13022670000205">The

Heath:</Member></B> It has always been the case that meat passed as fit
for human consumption from TB test positive cattle (reactors) can enter
the human food chain subject to the outcome of post-mortem inspection.
Stringent post-mortem controls, which adhere to requirements set out in
EU food hygiene legislation, operate in British
slaughterhouses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022677000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0009.htm#13022677000132">All
cattle slaughtered for human consumption are examined ante- and
post-mortem for evidence of disease (including TB) by Food Standards
Agency (FSA) meat inspectors under the supervision of an official
veterinarian. Where signs of generalised TB infection are present, or
TB lesions are discovered in more than one organ or region of the
carcase, the entire carcase and offal are seized and disposed of. If no
visible lesions (or a single lesion) of TB are found, only the affected
part of the carcase is destroyed. This judgement rule applies across
the
EU.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022677000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0009.htm#13022677000133">A
good deal of research and risk assessments have been carried out in
this area. The FSA's own independent expert advisory panel (the
Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food) has concluded
that the risk, if any, from consuming meat from TB reactors sold as
fresh meat for human consumption is very low. TB is not typically an
infection of the muscle tissue, but any bovine TB bacteria that might
be found in the meat of infected cattle after post-mortem inspection
should be killed by thorough
cooking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022677000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0009.htm#13022677000134">For

(DFID) measures the success of its support for health in terms of
specific results and outcomes for poor people (such as reduced burden
of disease, improved child survival and better maternal health).
Isolating the impact of health systems strengthening investments on
health outcomes is complicated because many other factors (social,
political and economic) also influence outcomes. There is, however,
growing evidence that health systems interventions, such as improved
training of health workers or fairer health financing systems, can lead
to more use of better quality services, which in turn contributes to
better health outcomes. Countries with stronger health systems have
been shown to have lower infant, child and maternal mortality
rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022677000333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0009.htm#13022677000333">DFID

functioning market. It provides operational and investment signals and
helps build consumer trust. Recent market-led developments have
contributed to greater transparency. Trading on day-ahead exchanges
represented 40% of total GB demand in the month of January—this
represents a two-fold year on year increase in volumes. Still there is
more that can be done especially to increase transparency in the
forward
markets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022677000447" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0010.htm#13022677000447">The

improved liquidity is important in driving greater transparency. Ofgem
is currently taking forward proposals to improve liquidity in the

legacy spending. Legacy spending in year one of the scheme was
£102.9 million. This is due to fall in each year of the scheme

legacy spending will be offset by a rise in core group spending which

Soubry:</Member></B> In their guidance ‘The Care of Women
Requesting Induced Abortion’ (November 2011), the Royal College
of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that “Services
should be culturally sensitive and professional interpreters should be
available if required” and that “while women may choose
to use family or friends as interpreters, in gaining consent to a
procedure the provider needs to be absolutely certain that the woman is
fully consenting. This can be guaranteed only if an independent
professional interpretation services is
used.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022677000692" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0010.htm#13022677000692">The
guideline also states that services should make sure that
“written, objective, evidence-guided information is available
for women considering abortion to take away before the procedure.
Information should be available in a variety of languages and
formats.” It also says that services should identify issues
which make women particularly vulnerable including violence or abuse,
in particular girls under the age of 16 should be given “the
chance to disclose during a private moment when a parent or adult is
not present”. In practice, most abortion services have a policy
that all women should be seen on their own at some stage, without a
partner or family member present, to ensure there is no coercion or
other issue affecting the decision-making
process.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13022677000693" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0010.htm#13022677000693"><B><Member PimsId="5527" UID="13022677002241" xid="1049" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0010.htm#13022677002241">Fiona

This report is intended to help doctors and other health professionals,
within the law, to support women and their families when a fetal
abnormality is diagnosed. It is designed to be explanatory rather than
prescriptive. The report highlights that, following a termination
performed for a fetal abnormality, pathological examination of the
fetus may be undertaken in addition to that undertaken pre-procedure 
<?notus-xml column=253?>as part of diagnostic testing. This might be at the request of the
clinician, with parental consent, or the parents and is to ascertain

other medical procedure. Few cases of adhesive arachnoiditis, which is

birth at an obstetric-led maternity service. Mothers whose pregnancies
are rated as low risk can give birth in a stand alone midwife led unit

National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence suggest up to 60%
of women in England are suitable to give birth in a free-standing
midwife-led unit. However, based on historic patient choice elsewhere
in London, and an assumption that around half of the patients currently
using the co-located midwife-led unit at Lewisham will continue to
attend a stand-alone unit, the TSA has modelled that around 10% of the

estimated that the potential benefits from making all the changes it
recommended would add between £5 billion and
£8 billion to the UK economy by 2020. This estimate included
benefits from proposals that did not form part of the
‘Modernising Copyright’ response. The two biggest
elements in the overall Hargreaves impact package which were not in
Modernising Copyright were the creation of the single EU patent, and
the Digital Copyright Exchange (DCE). The estimates in Hargreaves'
report on copyright exceptions estimated that between £0.4

2020.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022696000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0012.htm#13022696000313">The
Government's most recent assessment of the value of the changes to
copyright exceptions, revised in the light of responses to the
Hargreaves review and subsequent consultations, is around £0.5
billion over 10 years. However, this is a net present value figure
discounted to today's terms, and does not use the same methodology as
was used in the original Hargreaves report. It should be noted that the
methodology for the impact assessment process, from which these figures
are derived, can underestimate the growth from potential new businesses
or new markets, and as such may not fully reflect the likely benefit of
the changes.</hs_Para>

from the Regional Growth Fund (RGF). These include global market
conditions; realisation through the due diligence process that the
project could not be supported (including on state aid grounds); and
changes in senior management or parent company strategy. Listing the

Trade Marks Act 1994. Its duties are primarily concerned with the
registration and maintenance

provision of a tribunal function for adjudicating on disputes relating
to such rights. In particular, the IPO examines all trade mark
applications to ensure their suitability for registration; publishes

use in trade; and maintains a register of
marks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022696000923" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130225/text/130225w0012.htm#13022696000923">The
IPO has similar statutory duties in relation to patents, which are laid
out in the Patents Act 1977. Its duties include the scrutiny of patent
applications, the publication of such patent applications, and the
granting of patents. The IPO is also responsible for maintaining a
register and providing information about patents and published patent
applications and for providing a tribunal function for resolving
disputes in relation to patent applications and patents. In addition

subsists automatically on creation of a new design, the IPO’s
statutory obligations are more limited, being confined to adjudicating
on the validity of a design, and on the terms of a licence of right.

the reforms to resolve workplace disputes earlier to help both parties.

Lidington:</Member></B> We are embarking on a substantial
reinvigoration of the diplomatic network to make it ready for the 21st
century; to expand our connections with the emerging powers of the
world. We are funding this expansion through the reallocation of FCO
resources, the withdrawal of diplomatic staff from some subordinate
posts in Europe, while retaining an UKTI and consular presence in many
cases. This will lead to fewer subordinate posts. We will maintain all
our existing embassies. Other savings will be found as we reduce our
diplomatic footprint in Iraq and Afghanistan over time; and we will
continue to reprioritise budgets to strengthen frontline foreign policy
work.</hs_Para>

working to raise standards

move weapons between two third countries. In February 2012, the

to the claimant. The notification advises the claimant whether or not
income-based employment and support allowance can be awarded
automatically on the basis of information already held. If this is not
possible, the notification provides advice about claiming income-based
employment and support allowance and provides a phone number if the
claimant wishes to receive a claim form. A reminder is issued to the

State pension is paid in full weeks and this means that for most people

age) and the day they receive their first payment of pension. The gap
could be anything between one and six days, depending on the person's

a person's birthday happens to fall on the same day of the week as the
first day of their benefit week, there is no gap between that birthday
and the first day for which payment is due. For most other people,

in line with expenditure on the current system as a proportion of GDP

expenditure is slower under the single-tier than under the current

Our suppliers are certified by either the British Retail Consortium

Food Safety Inspection Service. Our suppliers have long-standing ties
with English Beef and Lamb Executive and the British Pig Executive. The

that are fully traceable back to source. The Catering Service purchases
a small number of prepared dishes through a third party supplier. Four
of the products purchased: beef and onion pie, steak and kidney pie,
steak and kidney suet pudding and Italian meatballs have been tested

Sport is making rapid progress in taking forward the proposals
announced on 7 September to facilitate superfast broadband
roll-out in rural, and indeed, all areas of the
country. Legislation to enable the relaxation of prior
approval planning requirements for broadband street cabinets and
overhead lines is currently going through Parliament under the Growth
and Infrastructure Bill. We have asked the Law Commission to consider a
wayleave regime that supports today's communications infrastructure and
we expect them to make recommendations to Government by February 2013.
We are also supporting the Department for Transport's production of new
guidance to be published shortly on issuing permit schemes for street
works which will also simplify the process for superfast broadband
roll-out. All of these measures are part of a complementary package to
enable broadband roll-out in rural areas and are a vital support to the
Government's ambition to have the best superfast broadband network in
Europe by 2015.</hs_Para>

Heath:</Member></B> Since concerns were first raised on this important
issue, DEFRA has been clear that we will act in accordance with the
evidence. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reports published
on 16 January consider the risks to bees from these insecticides and
conclude that more data is needed to update the current risk
assessments. As the EFSA made clear in the reports, these assessments
used existing data against new regulatory requirements which have yet
to be finalised. As would normally be expected, the EFSA found that new
data requirements were not met by data produced earlier. The reports do
not state that these insecticides pose an unacceptable danger to bees,
although this impression is given by the accompanying EFSA press
release. It is also worth emphasising that the EFSA conclusions are not
new scientific information but report a stage in the process of
updating the developing new risk assessment and applying it to these
three active
substances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302274000388" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/text/130226w0001.htm#1302274000388">The
Government has taken research on effects to bees seriously and we have
not assumed that the existing controls are sufficient. The European
Commission has now indicated that it will propose measures on the three
neonicotinoids reviewed by the EFSA and has held an initial discussion
with member states. Our approach to any Commission proposal will
continue to be founded in a proportionate response to the science and
so we will seek clarity as to what the Commission are proposing, the
basis for this and the likely impacts. Our response will take account
of advice from the Advisory Committee on Pesticides, which considered
the latest evidence on the risks to bees from neonicotinoid
insecticides at its meeting on 29 January. They also received the EFSA
conclusions.</hs_Para>

that, whilst the UK agreed with the EU Commission that better
enforcement of existing legislation was the number one priority, it was
important that the rules on welfare in transport are updated where
there is sufficient scientific evidence to support a change. This
included the recommendation made by EFSA that the maximum journey time
for horses going to slaughter should be reduced from 24 hours to 12

Benyon:</Member></B> Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) is a
multi-objective scheme that supports a wide variety of environmental
outcomes. Funding is targeted at those agreements that are best able to
deliver a range of environmental benefits while ensuring maximum value
for money. This means difficult decisions are sometimes necessary in
assessing which proposals to fund. For this reason DEFRA and Natural
England decided in 2011 not to provide HLS funding for mainly
single-issue agreements such as those for grey squirrel control on
farmland. We anticipate that these same basic principles will continue
to apply to HLS in the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302274000922" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130226/text/130226w0002.htm#1302274000922">Without

all requirements which enter the UOR process, progress to a business
case and subsequent delivery stages. The reasons for the cancellations
shown in the table may include the fact that, while a requirement may
be extant, there is currently no equipment solution that can meet it.
In such cases, attempts will be made to mitigate the risk through a
non-equipment solution such as changing tactics, techniques or
procedures. In other cases, the requirement may be cancelled by
commanders in theatre because the evolving nature of operations means
it is no longer needed. The ‘Business cases under
development’ entry in the table represents those requirements
where a solution is still being identified or the details finalised
prior to
approval.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_26_PT_1/Index/DC12298AC39F43F765CB0BBC115EE3CE04C61AAF" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="5" cday="Tuesday" cmonth="March" cyear="2013" date="26" day="Tuesday" issue="119" maxparts="1" month="February" part="1" price="5@010c00" printing="daily" session="201213" type="back" volume="559" year="2013"><title col="151">Oral
