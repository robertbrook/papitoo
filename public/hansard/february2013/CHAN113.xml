debt advice, but information on a wide range of financial issues and
there is place for that. She highlights the huge importance of raising
the awareness of the free debt advice that is available. The new
protocol that has been published today should help to do that, because
debt management providers who charge for their services will have to

Lord Leveson’s recommendations, to ensure that the suffering of

astonishingly, the Prime Minister claimed that the Government’s
taxes and benefits were progressive. On that very day, the independent
Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed that the tax changes being
introduced this April were regressive, with the richest tenth gaining
the most while the bottom 50 % lose. At the same time, the IFS warned
that the social security bill was going up and that borrowing was going
to overshoot by £64 billion. The reason is that the

the motion on the Order Paper from the Leader of the House that the
House should sit on Friday 22 March was objected to. It is not
immediately apparent why Government business managers need the
House to sit on that day, so will he explain that in his reply?
The Government’s legislative programme is hardly packed, so that
cannot be the reason. I wondered whether, after last year’s
omnishambles Budget, the business managers might have been planning an
extra day of debate to give the Chancellor room to perform a few
U-turns. An extra sitting day on the Friday would, of course, enable
the House to rise on the Tuesday, meaning, conveniently, that the Prime
Minister could once again miss Prime Minister’s questions. Given
the Government’s mismanagement of the economy, it is little
wonder that the Prime Minister wants to duck out of PMQs after the
Budget. Will the Leader of the House now think again about

that appointing Robert Francis to undertake that public inquiry was

tax must be set in a way that optimises revenue while minimising the
adverse impact on economic performance. That is a constant effort on
the part of the Treasury, and it is one reason—this is not
specifically related to air passenger duty—why reducing the top
rate of tax to 45p makes good economic sense as well as revenue sense.

Minister rather better than I could yesterday, that we must meet the
requirement to control the ballooning housing benefit expenditure left
by the last Government. The Labour party have resisted every effort to
do so. When there is unused accommodation in the social housing estate,
it is important for there to be incentives for it to be better used.
There are nearly 1 million unused bedrooms. It is not a tax; it is a
deduction in housing benefit expenditure. Many of the examples that
have been presented by Opposition Members completely ignore the fact
that there are other deductions in housing benefit expenditure,
particularly in relation to private rented housing, which demonstrate
that Labour always accepted this as an
argument.</hs_Para><hs_2cStatement UID="13020759000004" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0001.htm#13020759000004">

September, we outlined plans for changes to GCSE qualifications that
were designed to address the grade inflation, dumbing down and loss of
rigour in those examinations. We have consulted on those proposals and
there is a consensus that the system needs to change. However, one of
the proposals that I put forward was a bridge too far. My idea that we
end the competition between exam boards to offer GCSEs in core academic
qualifications and have just one wholly new exam in each subject was
one reform too many at this
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0001.htm#13020759000312">The
exam regulator Ofqual, which has done such a great job in recent months
upholding standards, was clear that there were significant risks in
trying to both strengthen qualifications and end competition in a large
part of the exams market. I have therefore decided not to make the best
the enemy of the good, and I will not proceed with plans to have a
single exam board offering a new exam in each academic subject.
Instead, we will concentrate on reforming existing GCSEs, broadly along
the lines put forward in September. There
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:24:59"></hs_TimeCode> a consensus
that the exams and qualification system we inherited was
broken.</hs_Para>

first set of reforms were to vocational qualifications, which had been
allowed to become less rigorous options under the previous Government.
Alison Wolf’s report outlined how to improve the quality of
vocational courses and expand work experience. It secured near
universal support and it will soon all be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:25:26"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
also reforming apprenticeships. Under the previous Government, the
currency of apprenticeships was devalued alongside every other
qualification. The Richard report on apprenticeship reform will restore
rigour, as Andrew Adonis has explained so powerfully.</hs_Para>

are also reforming A-levels. Schools and universities were unhappy that
constant assessment and modularisation got in the way of proper
learning, so we are reforming those exams with the help of school and
university leaders. GCSEs will also be reformed in a similar fashion.
The qualifications should be linear, with all assessments normally
taken at the end of the course. Examinations will test extended writing
in subjects such as English and history, have fewer bite-sized and
overly structured questions, and in mathematics and science there
should be greater emphasis on quantitative problem-solving.
Internal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:26:17"></hs_TimeCode>

only where there is a compelling case to do so, to provide for
effective and deep assessment of the specified curriculum
content.</hs_Para>

the new GCSEs will be universal qualifications and I expect the same
proportion of pupils to sit them as now. This is something we believe
the vast majority of children with a good education should be able to
achieve. However, reformed GCSEs will no longer set an artificial cap
on how much pupils can achieve by forcing students to choose between
higher and foundation tiers. Reformed GCSEs should allow students to
access any grade while enabling high-quality assessment at all levels.
The appropriate approach 
<?notus-xml column=442?>to assessment will vary between subjects, and a range of solutions may
come forward—for example, extension papers offering access to
higher grades alongside a common core. There should be no disincentive
for schools to give an open choice of papers to their
pupils. </hs_Para>

have asked Ofqual to ensure we have new GCSEs in the core academic
subjects of English, maths, the sciences, history and geography, ready

country, equipping far more young people with the knowledge and skills

reforming qualifications alone is not enough to ensure higher standards
for every child, and we must also reform how schools are graded to
encourage higher expectations for every student. Existing league tables
have focused almost exclusively on how many children achieve a C pass
in five GCSEs, including English and maths, but that deceptively simple
measure contains three perverse incentives. It encourages schools to
choose exams based on how easy they are to pass, rather than how
valuable they are to the student; it causes a narrow concentration on
just five subjects, instead of a broad curriculum; and it focuses
teachers’ time and energy too closely on those pupils on the C/D
borderline, at the expense of their higher or lower-achieving
peers.</hs_Para>

English and maths, it will measure how well pupils perform in at least

to pursue English baccalaureate subjects. By measuring average point
scores rather than a single cut-off point, the new measure will ensure

schools, as well, of course, as schools in the independent sector.
Programmes of study in almost all subjects—subjects other than
primary English, mathematics and science—have been significantly

benefits of the national curriculum approach that we are taking today
is that one of the areas that matters most to heads and
teachers—how they teach—will be devolved to their
responsibility. It has been the case in the past that prescriptive
teaching methods and particular styles of pedagogy have sometimes
intruded into the national curriculum. We have stripped them out to
concentrate on the knowledge that every child should expect to have and
that every parent needs to know their child is

did exactly what the hon. Gentleman enjoined me to do: we consulted. We
put forward proposals, some of them very radical, for change to our
examination system. Many of those proposals have been welcomed. One of
them—one that was dear to my heart—was a bridge too far.

in favour of and against a particular proposition. This week,
six Members voted both in favour and against, in the same Division, on
the Government’s same-sex marriage proposals. Historically, the
House has always deprecated this because it creates a problem if, for
example, people are counted twice for a quorum. Moreover, we now have
new rules on what counts as a no-confidence motion leading to a general
election, whereby the number of Members counted is
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000417" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0002.htm#13020759000417">May

the Chair has deprecated intentionally voting in both

registering abstention in this House, and I would not wish us to have
an informal system that would not be understood by those outside this

are unfairly criticised for being absent. So I continue to deprecate
the practice, but if there is pressure to examine a formal alternative,
that would be a matter, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, for the

Department has chosen a particular method for locking in green
investment: the contract for difference. Contracts for difference are
normally a kind of bet on future asset prices that might be expected to
carry some kind of health warning, to the effect that those
participating in them could lose a significant amount of money. In this
case, of course, the potential loss is to British energy bill payers,
as the contracts for difference will effectively guarantee a certain
price for energy generated from particular sources even if the market
price falls lower than that price. The difference will not then be paid
by us as taxpayers, but as energy consumers through our electricity
bills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000423" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0002.htm#13020759000423">I
would still say, so far, so good. There are a number of justifications
for contracts for difference—for taking that risk on behalf of
energy consumers—in the case of renewables and carbon capture
and storage, and not just because they are low carbon. First, these are
new technologies, at least at scale, that represent a significant risk
to investors precisely because they are new and still emerging.
Investors in such a market need significant reassurance and reduced
risk, and contracts for difference can do just that by promising
predictable revenue streams which will in turn make it easier and
cheaper for energy generators or CCS developers to secure finance. In
the longer run, encouraging renewables will also help consumers,
because the cost of renewable generation is on an historic downward
trend, unlike fossil fuels or nuclear. Once established, renewables and
CCS should 
<?notus-xml column=459?>provide a cheaper and more diverse range of
energy supplies that will make British energy supply much
more resilient to fluctuating global energy
prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000424" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0002.htm#13020759000424">The
second reason why renewables and CCS need this kind of price-based
support is that they include many new and diverse technologies: from
good old hydroelectric to onshore and offshore wind; from geothermal to
heat exchangers in the air and in the oceans; from photovoltaics to
concentrated solar power; from tidal flow turbines to barrages, tidal
fences, tidal lagoons and wave power; from biogas and biomass to
anaerobic digestion and more exotic forms of energy from waste, such as
gas plasma. We might even one day be able to add artificial
photosynthesis and who knows what else to that list. Government should
not pick winners from among these myriad emerging technologies, let
alone the various suppliers and developers. Price-based contracts for
difference, properly negotiated, offer a means by which
technologies and developers can be supported, but still be incentivised
to keep on reducing costs and become more
competitive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:16:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000425" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0002.htm#13020759000425"><Member ContinuationText="David Mowat" PimsId="5728" UID="13020759001169" xid="1167" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0002.htm#13020759001169"><B>David

goal, of course, is to provide clean, sustainable and cheap energy
while meeting challenging but critically important greenhouse gas
reduction targets. Do these contracts for difference represent a
subsidy? Well, as the Treasury has confirmed to me in a written answer;
yes, of course they do. Every energy bill payer is a taxpayer in their
time off; but subsidy is justified for renewables, for all the reasons
I have given. However, would it not be extraordinary if into this
exciting, young, diverse and competitive energy market, a 56-year-old
freeloader—a tailgater, a leftover from another era—tried
to slip in unnoticed and pick up all the same kinds of advantages and
support? Would it not be even more extraordinary if that old freeloader
was not even represented by a diversity of competitive companies, but
just one or two; and more extraordinary still if the most significant
of those turned out to be the state-nationalised energy supplier of
another country, already subsidised by its own taxpayers?</hs_Para>

not going to touch these new nuclear plans with a bargepole—and
it is not hard to see why. I do not know of a nuclear power station

without public subsidy. The new third-generation pressurised water
reactors planned for the UK—sometimes called European
pressurised reactors or EPRs—are already in deep trouble
elsewhere. The Olkiluoto plant in Finland was begun in 2005 and should
have gone on line in 2009. The latest estimate is that it will not be
generating power before 2015, at least six years late. The first cost
estimate was €3.7 billion, 
<?notus-xml column=461?>but now that has risen to €8 billion. Construction in Flamanville

late and counting, while the costs have escalated even further and
faster than those in Finland, from an original guess of €3.3

and more research is questioning the cost-effectiveness of nuclear. The
Energy Fair group of energy consultants and academics has stripped out
all subsidies and says that the real cost of nuclear power is at least
£200 per MWh, which is much more than the cost of
offshore wind power at £140 per MWh or that of onshore wind
power at less than £90 MWh. If EDF has done similar
sums—there have been rumours in the industry of asks as high as
£165 per MWh for the strike price—that raises the
extraordinary possibility that nuclear power, a mature and not very
competitive industry started in 1956, might be asking for a
strike price comparable with or even higher than that of the newly
emerging wind industry. Frustratingly, even Parliament does not know
whether that is the case.</hs_Para>

come to the rather obvious point that nuclear is a
fossil-fuel technology. If the worldwide investment in nuclear
continues in China and elsewhere, despite all these risks, the price of
uranium also will inevitably rise, making nuclear here even more
uneconomic. Nuclear sceptics may have a very unlikely ally in this
debate. The Treasury’s levy control framework, which caps the
costs that can be added to consumers’ bills, currently specifies
a figure of £2.6 billion a year. Tom Burke, writing in <I>The
Guardian</I>, cites estimates that the cap would have to rise
to £12.5 billion or more to provide 16 GW of nuclear power by

in my constituency; it provides highly-skilled, well-paid jobs, and
those wages are then pumped back into the local economy. In the past
couple of years, the station has had its operational life extended to

difficult to avoid power cuts and brownouts. That will not help us in

new nuclear is unable to meet the free market test, showing that it is
competitively viable in the long term, it should yield to other forms
of energy, particularly green forms of energy. When it comes to
striking a price now, there are so many unknown variables that that
this can be done only by accepting that any price agreed will need

can cause decommissioning costs to jump. Current laws can be amended.
The 2002 White Paper “Managing a Nuclear Legacy”
identified exactly this point as being a factor in the Sellafield
costs. Secondly, fuel and waste management represent
additional unknown financial burdens. Fuel management is particularly
problematic. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority notes, for example,
that oxide fuel must be stored for decades before it is possible to
place the fuel in a geological disposal facility. That brings me on to
a crisis point: no GDF exists in any country. The UK Government have
yet to locate an appropriate site for one on UK land. The full cost of
constructing and operating such a facility is therefore unknown. Some
£400 million of Government funding was spent examining a
potential site for a GDF in Cumbria, only for Cumbria county council to
vote against the plans last month over safety concerns.</hs_Para>

the need for public funding is unlikely to abate over time. As the BBC
journalist Richard Black points out, with the full life-cycle of
nuclear power stations stretching over such long time frames, it is
impossible to guarantee that companies originally involved in the
running of the power plants will still be in existence or financially
capable of meeting some of the costs of the decommissioning processes.
Fourthly, aside from the decommissioning and other costs mentioned
previously, the financial burden that a nuclear accident would place on
UK taxpayers would be enormous, and this potential liability needs to
be built into any pricing structure. Operators have some obligation to
limited liability to cover accident costs, but these are capped, with
Government underwriting the costs above the

today’s wholesale price for electricity of around £51 per
megawatt, and a 30-year contract life for the two proposed plants at
Hinkley and Sizewell, it would cost householders and businesses or
taxpayers £155 billion by 2050, and that is without any of the
additional costs that I identified earlier. Imagine the renewable

Huge sums will be spent and Parliament is to be kept in ignorance of

the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee say that her Committee
has no responsibility until the contract has been signed. By then, it
will be too late and we will have committed ourselves to a period of
probably 30 years at least to pay an enormous cost to a company

history of nuclear power has been a story of false dawns all my life. I
can remember as a schoolboy going to an exhibition in Cardiff called
“Atoms for Peace”. I remember ZETA, a fusion reactor that
was going to produce electricity that was too cheap to warrant a meter.
We had the steam-generating heavy water reactor, one of the worst civil
investment decisions since the building of the pyramids—huge
investment that produced nothing of value. Margaret Thatcher had plans
to build 10 nuclear power stations, but only one was actually built. My
party was seduced by the pied piper of nuclear power fairly

Flynn:</Member></B> That is a very limited view of the history of the
matter, which I will come to. As recently as 2007, however, my party
took the view that nuclear was economically unattractive. That was in
one of our manifestos. But an event took place in Downing street where
there was a PowerPoint presentation to the then Prime Minister that
said, “Mr Blair, there’s going to be a gap in our
electricity supply because the advanced gas-cooled reactors are going
to become obsolete and that will create a problem in a number of years
that will have to be solved.” Within a year of the
Labour Government changing their policy on nuclear power,
having decided that what had been economically unattractive was okay,
the life of the AGRs was lengthened and the gap had disappeared. The
spin had taken place, and we were seduced into the view that nuclear
was inevitable.</hs_Para>

or by other considerations, and he has had some kind of ministerial
lobotomy whereby he can no longer see what is obvious—that

impractical. It is not necessary to build a brick wall across a tidal
flow to get energy from it. Water wheels work very simply: the water
flows and they tap the energy. The best way in which we could get that
energy cheaply and cleanly is through a series of small machines in the
water to tap the energy that could then be linked with a pump storage
scheme, possibly in the valleys of south Wales. That would provide
demand-responsive energy—base load energy—that was
entirely predictable and did not alter like wind or any other sources.

I begin my remarks, I want to address two of the points that the hon.
Gentleman made. First, on the subsidy issue, of course it is true that
we are paying more for nuclear than we would pay if we let the market
ride, because the market would take us to coal, and if not coal, to
gas. Whether we call that a subsidy or a price for carbon, I do not
know. I personally believe that we must address the decarbonisation
issue, that nuclear power is part of the solution, as is wind, and that
the contract for difference mechanism is a way of acknowledging a price
for carbon. If we want to call that a subsidy, I accept that.</hs_Para>

the hon. Gentleman said, as I have heard others say, that it is
reasonable to subsidise new technologies such as wind, solar and all
the rest, but not nuclear, which is an old technology dating back to
1956. That is a false argument. It is a little like saying that physics
is an old technology because it started in about 1900 and we have had
it for all that time. Nuclear is changing and evolving, just as wind
power did. There are different types of nuclear power. Is thorium
technology new, or are the different types of reactors new? It is a
very difficult argument to maintain. If we are serious about
decarbonisation, it is hard not to see nuclear as part of the
solution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:57:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

am of the view that we should not go nuclear if there are low-carbon
technologies that can outperform it at scale and within the time frames
that we need, because I accept that there are issues with nuclear. For
example, we have not solved the waste problem. The question for the
House, though, is whether that problem is more severe than global
warming. We must make choices. We need to decide whether the waste
issue is containable—no pun intended—whereas the global
warming issue is not containable. However, it is nonsense to pretend
that nuclear is not part of the decarbonisation of the

argument. On waste, the House needs to recognise that we are talking
predominantly about legacy waste that successive Governments have not
dealt with but needs dealing with now. That waste comes not only from
civil nuclear but from the defence industry and the health
sector. On the other hand, we will be some 50 years into the

the waste that is causing the difficulties in Cumbria is military and
health waste, rather than waste from nuclear power stations. However,

that the cost of renewables is coming down, albeit from a very high
base. We also need to consider the cost to our industries. I gently
tell the House that a large part of the GDP in the north comes from
heavy industries. If we want to rebalance

dangerous and we need to address it. If it is not addressed in time,
the default will be to use fossil fuel. Gas power is about the only

comparisons with Germany because it uses 20% more carbon per head and
23% more carbon per unit of GDP than us, and yet it has three to four
times more renewables. Why is that? The answer is that it burns
substantially more coal than us. The trajectory appears to show that it
will burn yet more coal than it has in the past. The way to decarbonise

making the UK the most attractive country in the world for nuclear
investment. Hitachi has not signed a cheque yet, but has

already a highly cost-effective option for energy projects. The annual

inquiry stated that nuclear power is the cheapest available generating
technology over the lifetime of a plant, at an average of £74
per MWh. The Department of Energy and Climate Change estimates that
projects starting in 2018 will generate energy for £64 per MWh.

was brought up on the Welsh side of my family in north Wales. In the
’50s, ’60s and ’70s, nuclear power became popular
in north Wales, because there was a power station to be built, which
produced jobs in Meirionnydd that would not otherwise have existed. The
power station gave both construction and nuclear power employment. I
therefore understand why colleagues who have nuclear power stations in
or near their constituencies become advocates for the cause.
The hon. Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn) made that case
adequately.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0002.htm#13020759000601">I

the House but went round the country to look at offshore and onshore

adequate, secure ways of holding waste in the short term, but there is
no scientific evidence that there is a permanent way to ensure that

and business of the few, rather than the energy of the many. It is not
something that a community, village, town, city, region or country can

The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, who has been a

obviously we had to come to a deal. We would have had to have the same
conversation in negotiations with the Labour party, because it is
overwhelmingly pro-nuclear too. It would not have been any different;
it would have been the same. I guess that we would have had the same
outcome and retained our anti-nuclear position as a party. The deal we
were willing to do in Government was that we would let it go
ahead if it was needed, provided there was no subsidy. When we voted on
the plan there 
<?notus-xml column=482?>was, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)

differently. The agreement said no subsidy for nuclear power. The
Government have to take a different view, if they wish to, on whether
they want to subsidise any other form of power and renewable energy. In
the past, we have subsidised renewables to get them off the ground and
get the market going. We do not believe there is any justification for

Flint</B> (Don Valley) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate hon. Members on
securing this debate. Even if we hold different views, it is important
that we find time to debate the role of nuclear power in our
energy mix. I think we have heard nine speeches in this short debate so
far, and all of them, in their different ways, were reasonable
contributions.</hs_Para>

the outset, I will make my position clear: we strongly support and are
absolutely committed to new nuclear build in Britain. In our view, the
challenge of climate change is so great that there will be a role for
new nuclear power in our energy supply in the future, alongside an
expansion of renewable energy and, we hope, investment in carbon
capture and
storage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:38:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Let me
set out why we support nuclear power, what assurances we are seeking
from the Government and the nuclear industry for future nuclear build,
and why we will not be supporting the motion before
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000620" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0002.htm#13020759000620">I
have always been clear that an effective energy policy must meet three
criteria: it must be secure, it must be low-carbon and consistent with
our climate change obligations, and it must be affordable. Let me start
with security. Today, nuclear power accounts for about one sixth of the
electricity we generate. In the next 20 years, however, all
Britain’s remaining nuclear power stations are scheduled to
close. Of course we support energy efficiency measures to reduce
demand, and we look forward to the Government bringing forward
proposals in the Energy Bill. However, even if demand does not
increase, which seems unlikely, we will still need new electricity
generation to replace power plants as they close.</hs_Para>

we replace Britain’s nuclear power stations as they come
offline, we will leave a significant gap in our electricity generation
capacity. As for what we replace them with, my view is that the best
way to secure our energy supply is to encourage a
diversified mix of generating technologies. A diverse energy supply
makes the system more resilient and reduces the risk of 
<?notus-xml column=484?>interruptions or sudden, large spikes in electricity prices. Not
allowing energy companies to invest in new nuclear power stations would
increase our dependence on fewer technologies and expose the
UK’s energy supply to risk.</hs_Para>

a secure energy supply must also be safe. Every Government have the
responsibility to remain vigilant and ensure that our regulatory regime
in the nuclear industry is robust. Although there is no room for
complacency, I draw the House’s attention to the Weightman
report, which was published after the Fukushima disaster in Japan. Dr
Weightman was tasked with investigating the implications for nuclear
safety in the UK. He found no fundamental weaknesses in the current
licensing regime or safety principle, and concluded that there were no
grounds to restrict UK nuclear reactors or stop building new ones. On
that basis, we believe that investing in nuclear power supports the
security of our energy
supply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:40:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Weightman was expressly forbidden from considering the costs of
Fukushima, which—it is quoted—could have been an extra

Flint:</Member></B> I was talking about safety, but I will come to
costs later. It was absolutely right for the Government to commission
that report. Regardless of that report, however, I believe we should
always be vigilant and not complacent. I feel assured that we in the UK
can be justly proud of the regulatory system, the way it operates and
our safety record.</hs_Para>

me turn to our climate change obligation. Based on the significant
evidence available, the life-cycle carbon emissions from nuclear power
stations are significantly lower than for fossil-fuel generation and
about the same as for electricity generated from wind. Investing in new
nuclear is therefore consistent with decarbonising the power sector by
2030 and reducing our carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. No one would
pretend that new nuclear alone can solve climate change; equally, no
one should deny that new nuclear power stations could make a
significant contribution to tackling it. By way of illustration, if our
existing nuclear power stations were all replaced with fossil
fuel-fired powered stations, our emissions would be anywhere between 8
million and 16 million tonnes of carbon a year higher as
result. As I have said, investing in new nuclear should come not at the
expense of demand reduction or investment in other clean energy, but
alongside it.</hs_Para>

me turn to affordability. There has been much speculation about the
strike price that the Government will agree for new nuclear
developments. Obviously I am not privy to the Government’s
negotiations, which are ongoing. Estimates of the future costs of
generation from technology are often uncertain and vary widely.
However, according to the most up-to-date research commissioned by the
Government, when we take into account the lifetime levelised costs of
the various sources of energy and the up-front capital, fuel,
maintenance, decommissioning and waste costs, the latest estimate still
has nuclear as the cheapest of the various clean technologies. At a
time when energy bills stand at a record high of more than
£1,400, we must secure and decarbonise our power supply in the
most cost-effective 
<?notus-xml column=485?>way possible. On the basis of the information we have today, I do not
see how we can do that without investing in new
nuclear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:43:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000627" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020759000627">Having
set out in broad terms why we support new nuclear, let me say a word
about what, in return for that investment, we should expect of the
nuclear industry and ask of Government. First, new nuclear build has
the potential to contribute to economic growth and job
creation—a point eloquently expressed by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:43:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright)—but developers have a
responsibility to support young people into work and provide them with
the skills and training that will allow them to progress in a career in
the nuclear industry. Secondly, I can assure the House that we take the
issue of waste seriously and understand that the public are rightly
concerned about it. As we established in the Energy Act 2008, and in
the light of the Public Accounts Committee report on Sellafield, which
was published on Monday, operators of new nuclear power stations must
meet the full costs of decommissioning and their full share of waste
management costs, not leave taxpayers to foot the
bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:44:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000628" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020759000628">Thirdly—and
perhaps most topically, given that the Energy Bill is being debated in
Committee as we speak—the process for agreeing contracts for
difference for new nuclear must be robust and transparent and deliver
value for money for consumers. We support new nuclear power, but it is
for energy companies, not the Government, to fund, develop and build
new nuclear power stations. The development of new nuclear capacity
must happen without Government subsidy. Having looked carefully at the
proposals for contracts for difference in the Energy Bill—which
do not involve any direct transfer of Government money to nuclear
generators or provide nuclear power with any support that is not also
available to other forms of clean energy—I am satisfied that
that is the case. Also, in the event of the market price being higher
than the price that nuclear generators have agreed with the Government,
generators must pay back the difference.</hs_Para>

there is a role for the Government in ensuring that we as a country
attract the investment we need to keep the lights on, cut our carbon
emissions and keep the cost of electricity as low as possible. That
means that safeguards must be put in place to ensure that bill
payers—who will ultimately be funding this investment—get
value for money. I do not think the proposal in today’s motion
is the best way of achieving that; however, I do think there are issues
that Ministers should address before the Energy Bill returns to the
Chamber on Report. From the exchanges at Energy and Climate Change
questions last week and from the points my hon. Friend the Member for
Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex) has made in Committee, the
Secretary of State knows what improvements Labour would like to
see.</hs_Para>

would like the investment contracts that are agreed to be laid before
Parliament within three days of being entered into. We would like
provisions to ensure that any change to investment contracts are
published and subject to proper scrutiny. We would also like greater
protection to ensure that if construction costs are lower than those
projected, a compensatory mechanism will ensure that the strike price
reflects a fair return to the 
<?notus-xml column=486?>company, but also a fair deal for bill payers. I
think those are all fair points. From what the chief executive of EDF
said when he appeared before the Energy Bill Committee, I think he
regards them as legitimate concerns too. With an eye to what we might
inherit in 2015, I hope the Secretary of State will consider those
ideas and amendments in the constructive spirit in which they are

summary, we recognise that new nuclear power cannot be a one-way thing,
where energy companies get the necessary planning permission and price
agreement from the Government without offering something in return that
benefits the local community where the plant is built, as well as the
wider economy. However, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to

I turn to the key issue of the cost of nuclear and of subsidies, let me
briefly address recent issues affecting nuclear policy and this debate.
The first is GDF—the geological disposal facility for nuclear
waste—and what will happen after the recent vote in Cumbria. It
was the priority of the previous Government, as it is of this
Government, to ensure the safe management of nuclear waste. Britain has
a huge legacy of nuclear material to store and dispose of, whether or
not we build a single new nuclear reactor. As we develop our new
nuclear build programme, it is right that we press ahead with tackling

Electricity market reform is the most transparent and most market-based

Joan Ruddock</B> (Lewisham, Deptford) (Lab):</Member> On a point of
order, Mr Deputy Speaker. In his statement on 31 January, the Secretary
of State for Health said that he had asked Professor Sir Bruce Keogh,
the NHS medical director, to review the recommendations of the trust
special administrator to replace Lewisham’s accident and
emergency department with an urgent care centre. The Secretary of State

We now know that nowhere in his report to the Secretary of State did
Sir Bruce mention the saving of 100 lives per annum. The Secretary of

behalf of all my Back-Bench colleagues who wanted time to be allocated
for this important debate, may I put on record my thanks to you, Mr
Deputy Speaker, and to the Backbench Business Committee for
today’s scheduled parliamentary time? The closure of accident
and emergency departments is a national issue and one that has profound
impacts on the current and future provision of health care across the
country. Concerns about the A and E closures and accompanying hospital
reconfigurations have been voiced by members of all political parties
including Back Benchers and Front Benchers on both sides of the House,
so it is crucial that we have this

decisions are being made about A and E closures across the country by
NHS bureaucrats, under the guise of localism and clinically led
decision making, without the democratic accountability that is vital
for decisions of such importance. In order to bring these decisions to
the Secretary of State for Health, local council scrutiny panels have
to refer such decisions to the independent reconfiguration panel, which
then reports its findings to the Secretary of State. Why are primary
care trusts in their dying days making such critical decisions and not
clinical commissioning groups? It is vital to have democratic
accountability for these decisions and, although it is not sufficient,
this debate will shine some much-needed light on these huge decisions
that will have profound impacts on all our
constituents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:07:44"></hs_TimeCode>. I
am pleased that the Government have belatedly announced a national
review of A and E services, but I am horrified that the review is

rush, and it cannot be the considered review that we need.</hs_Para>

pressure is unacceptable. It is targeting the poorest and most
vulnerable, and it is unfair on the hospitals that have been

me now raise some of my specific concerns—as well as welcoming
you to the Chair, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have very grave concerns about
the way in which the consultation was carried out in north-west London.
It was carried out over the Olympic summer months, with an impenetrable
document of 80-plus pages and a response document with leading
questions that set community against community, doctor against doctor,
and hospital against hospital. There were also significant parts of the
consultation period when no translated materials were available for
many of my constituents who speak various community languages. That was
totally unsatisfactory.</hs_Para>

those difficulties, some people in Ealing were able to complete
the consultation and overwhelmingly rejected the preferred option that
means 
<?notus-xml column=495?>the closure of Ealing’s A and E, maternity, paediatric and other
acute services, and the closure of Central Middlesex, Hammersmith and
Charing Cross A and Es. Moreover, a majority of respondents
across the whole of north-west London rejected the fundamental premise
of the proposed changes—that acute services should be
concentrated on fewer sites. I fear that such an inconvenient
consultation response will be ignored and ridden roughshod
over.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000692" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020759000692">Equally,
I fear that the clinical opinion of Ealing’s GPs and hospital
consultants who opposed the preferred option will be ignored, despite
this being one of the Government’s four tests for such
reconfigurations. The clinical concerns are real and should not be
brushed over. Let me address some of the key
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000693" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020759000693">First,
the scale of change being proposed in north-west London and the
associated risks of such large-scale changes is causing great concern.
Taking out in one go four of nine A and Es that serve a population of
2 million—set to grow continually over the next
20 years —is a high-risk strategy. Concerns over A
and E capacity are growing, as hospitals up and down the country say
that their A and Es are full and that they are putting patients on
divert to other hospitals. This has happened recently at Northwick Park
hospital—one of the hospitals that Ealing patients are meant to
be treated at if the four A and Es close. If these proposals go
through, yes, there are plans for some increased investment at both
Northwick Park and Hillingdon A and Es, but there are well over 40,000
patients a year using Ealing hospital’s A and E alone, in
addition to those currently attending Central Middlesex, Charing Cross
and
Hammersmith—</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000694" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020759000694"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3149" UID="13020759001285" xid="192" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020759001285">Mr

the importance of ensuring that A and E provision remains accessible to
the high-tech, highly skilled industries in which this nation must
continue to lead the world. Barrow’s A and E department is not
yet under immediate threat of closure, but there is grave concern about
the impending review of services throughout the Morecambe Bay area,
which has been driven at least partly by the trust’s need to
make significant cuts in its operating budget in the years
ahead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020759000716" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020759000716">A
trust covering 300,000 people would often be served by just one A and E
department, but in the Morecambe Bay area there are two. That is due to

it crystal clear why no one should get the idea that Barrow’s A
and E department could move. Not only would every single resident in
the geographically isolated Furness peninsula suffer unacceptably long
journey times if it were closed; its removal would be a significant
blow to industry in the area, and would ultimately threaten our
potential to become a national cradle for advanced manufacturing. The
manufacturing companies on which our local economy
depends—including shipbuilding, nuclear engineering and
pharmaceutical companies—have enviable safety records, but they
nevertheless carry a small but inherent risk of industrial injury. As
responsible business men, local employers seek to mitigate and manage
that risk, but part of their management includes access to a full
accident and emergency service in the locality.</hs_Para>

administered within the first hour following incidents is critical. A
number of minor incidents, particularly associated with foreign object
ingress to eyes, are referred to Furness General Hospital per week.
Therefore additional ambulances would be required to transfer injured
personnel, significantly increasing the ambulance demand within the

appreciate that that sits uncomfortably with my last point. The
Minister understands the country and its dreadful road systems. May we
please take a flexible view of these things? Could clinical cases be
assisted in places such as Newark, so that minor injury units can
indeed provide other critical services than those they currently
provide? We do not need to be hidebound by these things, but we do need
to be regulated. We do not need to be narrow-minded, but we do need to

not so in Lewisham. I should not be part
of today’s debate, because the A and E at

under the unsustainable providers regime, was sent into the
neighbouring South London Healthcare NHS Trust. I do not believe that
the trust special administrator had the powers to take in Lewisham

proposes to close the A and E, downgrade maternity and sell off two
thirds of the land to support a separate, failing trust. My colleagues
and I argued that this was a back-door reconfiguration. In response to
my urgent question of 8 January, the Secretary of State acknowledged
just that. He said that the four tests for reconfiguration would have

twice-daily consultant ward rounds and access to diagnostics on
Saturdays and Sundays. None the less, the Secretary of State has
decided to remove the ICU, to remove consultant cover and to displace
about 30,000 seriously ill patients—those who are likely to be
admitted to the A and E —and take them by ambulance to another
hospital. He is creating a smaller, less effective A and E, but there
is no capacity at any other A and E in south-east London. Ambulances
are often directed away from hospitals like King’s to come to
Lewisham. Recently, a 76-year-old waited 18 hours in the A and E at the

debate is badly needed. Not a month seems to pass without another NHS
trust announcing that it will close one or more hospital
departments, and at least 15 NHS bodies in England are
pursuing major reconfiguration plans. There is, however, increasing
concern in the medical field that NHS care for emergency patients might
be going wrong in too many instances. Essentially, this is a debate
about specialism and generalism. Rare complex surgery, for example for
brain tumours or severe multiple injuries, is clearly best done in
large volumes in specialist centres. I do not dispute that—nor
do the overwhelming majority of clinicians—but it is not true
for the common types of emergency surgery that are best done within

October, a group of 140 senior doctors wrote to the Prime Minister
expressing alarm over proposals to close and reconfigure A and E units
around the country. In their open letter, they said that they had yet
to see evidence that plans to centralise and
downgrade A and E services were beneficial to patients. A 2010 report
by the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient
Outcome and Death showed that the reason people often die after surgery
is not that the surgery was difficult but that there was a
delay in getting them to an emergency operation. I fear that that will
be worse if more A and Es are 
<?notus-xml column=504?>closed as there will be no surgeon on site, or the patient will face an
over-long travel time to a fully functioning and adequately staffed
emergency department. The report was clear, suggesting that applying
one-size-fits-all medicine to a heterogeneous population with varying
needs fell short in ways that were both predictable and preventable.

Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Dame Joan Ruddock) has already listed
them, so I do not need to repeat them. In Eastbourne, my local hospital
is run by East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which also manages the
Conquest hospital in Hastings. Last year, it consulted on the provision
of orthopaedics, general surgery and stroke care in East Sussex. In my
view and that of the cross-party Save the DGH campaign group, led by
our remarkable and hard-working chair Liz Walke, it was clear from
early on that the trust’s aim was to remove core services from
my local hospital, the Eastbourne district general hospital,
irrespective of the consultation.</hs_Para>

was not the first time the trust had tried to remove core services from
Eastbourne. Only five years earlier it had tried, unsuccessfully, to
downgrade our maternity services. At the time the trust claimed that
that would provide safer and more sustainable services for the people
of East Sussex. However, after much local opposition the independent
reconfiguration panel found against the trust’s proposals, so
when my local hospital trust again consulted on health services in East
Sussex, my constituents and I were very worried. I was uneasy, as so
many local clinicians started to share with me confidentially their
deep concerns about the trust’s
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:55:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

a smokescreen to hoodwink local communities. I do not believe for a

going wrong and why? It is clear that many very experienced and expert
clinicians believe that most areas must retain emergency departments,
with co-located essential core services to manage the bulk of common

conclusion, I am far from confident that the current process

and E are being done in the best interests of local people is working,
irrespective of the four tests that I talked about earlier. This must
be addressed and that needs to be done quickly because if we
get it wrong, lives could quite literally be lost unnecessarily. The
NHS is our most cherished institution, often referred to as the glue
which binds our society together. I pay tribute to the coalition
Government for protecting NHS funding at a far higher level than was
the case in any other Government Department but—and this is a
“but” laden with real anxiety—I fear we may be
getting the reconfiguration elements wrong. I hope the Minister will

how many hospitals up and down the country are under threat is evident
from the Members who are present this afternoon. In many cases, the
accident and emergency unit is the heart of a buoyant and thriving
hospital. So much else stems from the work of A and E units. My hon.
Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock) outlined the
point that in many parts of the country outside London, it is as much a
question of geography as the number of people because of the threat
that people will have to travel great distances to get the treatment
they need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:05:05"></hs_TimeCode>. A and
E units have such a critical function that Professor Sir Bruce
Keogh, the medical director of the NHS who has already been mentioned,
has highlighted the scale of the problems across the country and, I am
led to believe, is undertaking a review into A and E
units.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020777000014">I
am somewhat less reassured by Sir Bruce’s view of democracy and
the role of local representatives. He is not alone in holding that
view. Many medical professionals and particularly
administrators—Sir Bruce straddles both roles as he is an
administrator and a clinician—believe that they should decide
what is best for people and that people must put up with it. They
believe that local representatives, whether they be Members of
Parliament, local councillors or the local council, have no right to
interfere. I have to say to Sir Bruce and the other professionals at
the Department of Health who operate under that illusion, that that is
not how a democracy works. In a democracy, people need to be persuaded
that what is being done is in their best interests. If there is to be
change, the result must be a system that is safer and more reliable
than the one that it replaces. Simply turning to people in a
patronising and condescending fashion and saying, “You
don’t understand what we understand,” is not the way to
treat the citizens of this

my constituents were let down by the promise of investment from the

before May 2005 we were told that we would have £80 million
investment in our district general hospital. Sadly, that investment did
not materialise, and shortly afterwards, in 2006, a programme of
downgrade—reconfiguration, as it is known—was started,
particularly in our maternity and A and E units. That was confirmed in
2008, but judicial review by the local council held it up. Hopes were
just beginning to rise, and with the change of Government those hopes

drive for, and some of the benefits of, centralisation.
However, I oppose the 
<?notus-xml column=510?>reconfiguration because of the inconsistency in what we have

that point, the PFI situation emerged. The PFI deal sealed for North
Middlesex hospital—a neighbouring hospital in the south of the
constituency—meant an investment of £129 million over 31
years, meaning a total repayment of £640 million.
That £2 million a month comes off the operational budget. On 22
November, the then Secretary of State was quoted in the very reliable

because of unsustainable PFI
debt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020777000032">One
reason often cited for the proposed downgrade of my hospital is that
GPs support it. Three hospitals—Barnet, North Middlesex and
Chase Farm—were part of the downgrade plan, and GPs from
Haringey, Barnet and Enfield were asked about the proposals. The vote
was organised like a communist meeting. If we ask people in Haringey or
Barnet whether they have a problem with the downgrade in Chase Farm, I
suspect they will say no if it benefits their hospital. The figures
show that only 44% of Enfield GPs approved, but of 129 GPs asked, only
48 responded, so only a positive 16% recorded their support. I hope the
Minister asks her officials to reflect on that
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020777000033">I

taken. Eight Members of Parliament from north-east London campaigned
together on a cross-party basis to save the A and E at King George
hospital, yet in 2011 the Government announced that, after the previous
decision, they were going to go ahead with a recommendation to close
the A and E and the maternity unit at King George hospital in Ilford.
There will be no more births there at the end of March. We will no
longer have children born in Ilford, unless they are born in the back

them to Queen’s hospital Romford. However, I want to concentrate

two years from October 2011. Patients would then have had to go to the
A and E at the already over-pressed and stressed Queen’s
hospital. Frankly, that policy was always insane and foolish. We fought
against the first such proposals in 2006—the misnamed
“Fit for the Future” proposals—right the way
through, in cross-party unity with neighbouring MPs, under the last
Government. We managed to get implementation halted for reconsideration

increase from 2011, with 26,859 additional attendances in the A and E
unit at Queen’s hospital. In addition, there were 73 patients a
day more than in the previous year, with 23 days on which
there were more than 470 compared with only three days in the previous
year. The pressure on Queen’s hospital today is getting bigger
and bigger, yet the plan is still to close the A and E unit at King
George hospital. Where are all the patients supposed to go? Presumably
not to Queen’s hospital, because it cannot cope. What is already
happening? Although the figures are not being made public, I am told
that on a number of occasions over recent weeks, in December and
January, ambulances have been diverted to other hospitals from
Queen’s hospital, including Whipps Cross hospital, which is part
of the Barts Health NHS Trust—and it has its own problems. We
are facing a real

also understand that performance at Queen’s hospital has fallen
off drastically. Only 65% of patients have been seen within four hours
since the end of last year. The figure at King George hospital was much
better, yet it is King George—the better-performing hospital in
this trust—that is supposed to be run down. I spoke to
the Care Quality Commission this afternoon, which is now proposing a
potential cap on the numbers of patients in the “majors”

Throughout my 30 years as an MP for north Oxfordshire, the one thing
that has been of greatest importance to me, practically above all else,
is ensuring that the Horton hospital in Banbury remains a general
hospital—that is, one with consultant-led maternity and
children’s services, 24/7 A and E services, and a facility for
people to see doctors on a 24/7
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0003.htm#13020777000063"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:34:57"></hs_TimeCode>I
also readily recognise, however, that certain specialist trauma
services cannot be provided at hospitals such as the Horton, and that
they are best provided at hospitals such as the John Radcliffe in
Oxford. That was best demonstrated to me by a constituent, a friend of
mine, whom I met the other day. He had suffered a ruptured aorta. My
paternal grandmother died of a ruptured aorta, but this constituent
survived. I said to him, “You were jolly unlucky to have a
ruptured aorta, but you were fantastically lucky to live.” He
told me that the only reason he had survived was that the ambulance had
taken him from Banbury directly to the John Radcliffe in Oxford, where
he received the specialist treatment that he needed.</hs_Para>

echo the point that has been made by several hon. Members that we need
total clarity about what people can expect from major trauma units, and
what is meant by the terms “accident and emergency
department”, “urgent care centre” and
“major injuries unit”. We need national standards so that
we can all be confident that we are comparing like with like. We could
then be confident about the protocols that the ambulance services
use—when they are dealing with major road accidents on the M40,
for example—and patients, GPs and people generally in my
constituency would know what to expect from the accident and emergency
services in Banbury, and when it would be more appropriate for them to
be directed to the major trauma unit at the JR in Oxford. People would
also be clearer about when they ought not to be bothering the accident
and emergency department at the Horton at all but should really be
going to see their GP. All too often people tend to treat the

been evolution in health care for a long time. The Horton

the pace at which  
<?notus-xml column=515?>patients can be treated. In the past, women who had
hysterectomies might have had to stay in hospital for 10 days,

are also resulting from the fact that we have a much larger older
population, many of whom have age-related dementia issues, who need to
stay in hospital much longer. We have to reconcile those two growing

really put a block on the plans was the sudden collapse of another
nearby hospital. Epsom hospital has long had financial troubles. In the
1990s, they were 
<?notus-xml column=516?>so bad that it was forced to merge with the more financially viable St
Helier to form the Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS
Trust. The merger was never ideal, as Epsom has more in common with
other Surrey hospitals than with St Helier. In 2011, it was finally
decided that the Epsom and St Helier should de-merge and that Epsom
should merge with a hospital in Surrey—Ashford and St
Peter’s hospital.</hs_Para>

was going well until last year, when it was revealed that
Epsom’s debts were far worse than originally thought. The merger
deal with Ashford and St Peter’s collapsed, and Epsom was left
out in the cold. This made Surrey panic about what BSBV was planning.
After all, if St Helier lost its A and E and Epsom
collapsed, there might be no hospital between Tooting and
Guildford—so BSBV was put on hold again. In retrospect, that
only made matters worse. Instead of closing one A and E out of four
hospitals, the local NHS has just decided to close two out of five.
That will be catastrophic.</hs_Para>

of the financial problems of a hospital miles away. We thought things
were bleak before; they are even bleaker now. With St Helier singled
out for service closures even before this latest development, it is
going to be even more difficult for our community than ever before. The
argument remains the same, and my local community will not stop

one is under the impression that everything is rosy and that the way
health care is delivered in north-west London is absolutely perfect.
Clearly, in the longer term we will need to encourage more people to
sign up to local GPs rather than depending on A and Es for all their
health care needs, but that requires time and organisation. We cannot
just close the A and E and expect people to cope. Looking forward, we
clearly need to make sensible decisions on how we fund health care
provision locally, to ensure money is available to meet all the rising
costs associated with people living longer, new medicines coming
on-stream and new costly treatments, but we have to take people with us
as we approach change.</hs_Para>

Middlesex A and E departments. My constituency is served by Northwick

teams at the north-west London trust have noted that the strategy
behind the proposed closure of the four A and E departments assumes
that thousands of people can be persuaded not to go to A and E but
instead to use their GPs and other community services. I am a little
sceptical about the idea that that will work, not least because the
numbers using Northwick Park A and E are already significantly
greater than before the 2010 election.</hs_Para>

of the strategy, to prevent the possibility of patients who shift to
Northwick Park not getting the services they need, is, as I
said, to use community services. The decision to downgrade the
Alexandra Avenue polyclinic, a walk-in service open 8 am to 8 pm, 365
days a year in the south Harrow part of my constituency, to just
Saturday and Sunday opening, 9 am to 3 pm, has led to greater
use of Northwick Park hospital A and E, as a number of doctors have
said. So the decision to close that polyclinic, supported,
incidentally, by the Conservative party in Harrow, seems particularly
surprising, given the appetite for community services to solve the
problem of lots of people potentially going to Northwick Park A

alternative site for such a facility in order to reduce the pressure on

for Darlington who was then Secretary of State for Health, was to
ensure that that four-hour wait was a reality across our country. I
would sit with chief execs and we would go through the so-called
sitreps to ensure that those hospitals were meeting the four-hour
waiting target. That was the key element of my
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000146">I
decided to look at the sitrep for the past four weeks across London.
There is a target, and if hospitals are doing badly they are flagged as
red, while if they are doing well and meeting the target, they are
marked as green. I was startled. Ealing, Hillingdon, Imperial, North
West London Hospitals, West Middlesex, Barnet and Chase, Whittington,
Barking, Guy’s and St Thomas’, King’s College,
Lewisham, South London, Epsom and St Helier, Kingston, Croydon and St
George all currently fail.
Yet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:16:01"></hs_TimeCode> it is

the years, Trafford General has experienced financial and management
problems, and last year it was absorbed into Central Manchester
University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. We all expected that there
would be a reconfiguration of services following that acquisition, and
that is what happened. Last month, following public consultation on the
so-called new health deal for Trafford, NHS Greater Manchester
announced its intention to proceed with a downgrade
of the A and E at Trafford General, first to an urgent care centre open
from 8 am until midnight, and in due course to a nurse-led
minor injuries unit, alongside other changes to
services. I expect those changes now to be referred to the Secretary of
State for
decision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000152">Nobody<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:18:25"></hs_TimeCode>
in Trafford is opposed to change that can improve clinical care.
Already, major trauma cases are diverted away from Trafford General,
while serious stroke and cardiac cases go not to Trafford but to
centres of excellence at Salford Royal, University Hospital of South
Manchester and Manchester Royal Infirmary. That approach is widely
understood and accepted by the public. Equally, plans to develop a
model of integrated care locally are popular, and it is recognised that
they could help to keep people out of hospital for
longer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000153">However,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:18:48"></hs_TimeCode>there are
consequences to the reconfigurations that have already taken place and
to what is now proposed. More than half of Trafford residents now
attend an A and E other than Trafford General, partly because more
specialist and complex cases are rightly diverted to other centres,
partly because local people are choosing to attend other nearby
hospitals that offer them greater convenience or the kind of care they
want, partly because it is widely believed that ambulances will not
take people to Trafford General unless they specifically instruct them
to do so, and partly because the whole downward spiral in activity is
reinforcing public behaviour so that they are increasingly even less
likely to decide to go to Trafford General. In other words, reducing
activity levels are, to a degree, a self-fulfilling prophecy.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins) has been
raising concerns about capacity at the University hospital of South
Manchester in Wythenshawe since we first knew about the proposals last
summer. Its A and E is already coping with tens of thousands more
admissions than the 70,000 for which it was designed. It simply cannot
absorb more patients from Trafford without additional
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:20:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000155">Commissioners
assure me that there is progress in the development of integrated care,
but that is pretty well invisible to local people. Recovering patients
report long waits and great difficulty in getting rehabilitative care
and support at home. In the meantime, many of the admissions to our A
and E are elderly and frail patients, which is undoubtedly in part the
result of the gulf between the ambition for integrated preventive
services in the community and the
reality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:20:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000156">There
are concerns about the capacity of the North West ambulance service. If
there is a reduction in hours and capacity at Trafford general, there
will clearly be more patient journeys to other hospitals.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:20:51"></hs_TimeCode> are also
worries about what will happen if mental health patients present at
Trafford general’s urgent care centre and it does not have the

of that is taking place against the backdrop of a wider planned
reconfiguration across Greater Manchester. Last year, in the middle of
the consultation on the changes at Trafford, we learned about Healthier
Together, a major redrawing of health care provision across Greater
Manchester, including A and E provision. If, as is likely, that leads
to further closures and reductions in A and E services across
Manchester, there will be further capacity questions that will have a
significant effect on
Trafford<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:21:31"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
in an invidious position. It has been said that the new health deal for
Trafford offers the best hope of a secure future for Trafford general,

clinical safety is paramount in all health reconfigurations. There was
clear consensus among senior medical staff that there were significant
safety issues with the A and E at Hartlepool. The number of medical
staff was insufficient to cover two rotas at Stockton and Hartlepool,
and the supervision of junior medical staff was inadequate and did not
meet modern guidance criteria. When senior clinical staff say that
lives will be saved if changes are made, it is irresponsible for
anybody, whether elected representatives or others, not to listen to
those expert
voices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000166">Despite
the paramount importance of clinical safety, however, it is clear that
people of Hartlepool did not and do not want the closure of their A and
E department—no community does. More provision can be made
outside the hospital setting and in the local community to make
services closer and more convenient to where people live. A One Life
centre—a minor injury unit—has been built in the heart of
the town centre and should be more easily accessible to a greater
number of the town’s population. That is a welcome step. During

area has seen bitter disputes about the reconfiguration of acute
services for the best part of 20 years. There is real tension between
the views of professionals, who are best placed to consider the safest
and most clinically effective means of providing a service, including
in specialist concentrated centres, and the general public who will be
the recipients and beneficiaries of that service, and who will pay for
it through general taxation, even though they may often disagree with
the means and location of that service. Successive Governments over two
or three decades have failed to reconcile that basic tension. The
concept of “No decision about me, without me” and the
four tests of reconfiguration that are often bandied about are a
fallacy. It is an understatement to say that Hartlepool would have
preferred to maintain a full A and E service. People do not feel as if
they have had a proper say in the
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000169"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:26:05"></hs_TimeCode>Safety,

was my second point. My third point concerns communication about where
a patient should go. If a child bangs his or head in Hartlepool
tonight, where should their parent take them? Previously, it was a
relatively simple choice—they went to A and E. Now, a parent is
confronted with going perhaps to the A and E at North Tees hospital,
perhaps the One Life minor injuries unit and urgent care centre, or
even the university hospital of Hartlepool. The new arrangement seems
more complex and fragmented, and surely if the system contains greater
complexity and fragmentation, there is greater
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:27:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000171">Some
18 months after the A and E closure, the system is bedding down; it was
not perfect from day one, although that is another matter. However, I
am not convinced that the risk is being adequately managed. There is
inadequate communication and subsequent misdiagnosis, leading to
obvious and understandable alarm among my constituents. What will the
Minister do about
that?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000172">My
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:27:22"></hs_TimeCode>fourth point
concerns the pressing and persistent need to link reconfiguration of
health services with transport policy. Such is link is just not there
at the moment. How on earth will my constituents be able to travel to
North Tees hospital 13 miles away? The hospital is long way from many
of them and difficult to get to. Hartlepool has low rates of car
ownership and poor public transport links, and bus services are
virtually non-existent, certainly at weekends and evenings. I would not
have thought that the Government or local NHS trust would want the
public to rely solely on ambulance services.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:28:05"></hs_TimeCode>The point I wish
to stress, and which I hope the Minister will address, is that any
reconfiguration of services requires transport and accessibility at its

final point is about the wider reconfiguration of health
services north of the Tees. Although, as I said earlier, much
of the decision to close Hartlepool A and E was based on
immediate clinical safety grounds, it is fair to see that decision in
the context of the Momentum programme, which is designed to move health
services out of the hospital setting and into the community. The
Momentum programme culminates in the building and opening of a new
hospital in Wynyard, which is designed to incorporate the most advanced
equipment and medical and surgical practices and serve the acute health
needs of the populations of Hartlepool, Stockton, Sedgefield and
Easington. The original plan was for construction to start last year
and for the first patients to be admitted by 2014-15. Soon after taking
office, however, the Government withdrew public funding for that
hospital, and despite warm words and a series of announcements from the
Foundation Trust Network, no alternative source of private funding has
been approved. We do not appear to be any further
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:29:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000174">Two
procedures are running dangerously out of parallel. We have the
Momentum programme, with the reconfiguration of services, and the
funding programme for the new hospital. That is now three years out of
date and there is no concrete indication that private funding 
<?notus-xml column=530?>is on the table. Services have been moved without
any clarification about the endgame. My big fear is that my
constituents will have the worst of all possible worlds with services
moving to North Tees and no new hospital. Something must be

debate goes to the heart of what the NHS is about. Many Members of
Parliament are deeply frustrated about health plans being hatched in
their constituencies, but they have very little power to influence
events. The health service is being atomised by a large number of
private interests through private finance initiatives, and by a large
number of trusts with competing interests. We need a properly planned
health service rather than the internal market and competition, which
are at the heart of so many of our
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000177">If

for Enfield North (Nick de Bois) were still in his place, I could tell
him something that would make him even more depressed about the future
of Chase Farm hospital. As a former member of the late Enfield and
Haringey area health authority in the 1970s, I recall debates on
whether Chase Farm should be closed. There are
agendas—colleagues will recognise such agendas all over the
country—that live on beyond past directors, trusts and
reconfigurations: somebody always has an aspiration to close something
and centralise something else. If hon. Members think politics in the
House of Commons is robust, they should try NHS politics, which is far
more robust and nastier than anything we experience
here.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000178">I

the House to consider what

Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) said. London has a fast
growing population, great health inequalities and poverty, and a fast
growing number of people in the daytime: the population of central
London goes up phenomenally during the day because of people commuting
to work, going to cultural or sporting events, or simply passing
through the capital city. If we start closing A and E
departments and saying that everything should go out into the
community, and thus that hospitals can be reduced and closed, we are
making the future very dangerous for our
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000179">As

the A and E department was due to be closed. As ever, there were
denials all over the place. I tell
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:32:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

become a trust and has begun putting together a financial package, to
which my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:33:33"></hs_TimeCode> right
hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham referred. The package involves the
sale of a quarter of the site—apparently, £17 million is
to be made from that—the loss of 500 jobs and a reduction of
the number of beds in the hospital to 177, which is about
half what it was five years
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000181">We
asked whether an A and E department with a hospital of only 177 beds

reported on this with great alacrity last week. I congratulate Tom Foot
and all those who put the story together, because I suspect the issue
would not otherwise have reached the light of day. At a public meeting
next Tuesday, friends, neighbouring MPs and many others from the local

all face issues of health care. I think there is a consensus that we
all respect and value the principles of the national health service,
but if we allow buildings to be sold off and A and E departments to
close, we will end up with the health service becoming a service of
last resort and with the promotion of private medicine at the expense
of the NHS. We will end up with much poorer societies and much greater
health inequalities, and that is in nobody’s interest. Let us
get control of this in a democratic way, so that we can control what
goes on in the health service in our name.</hs_Para>

get involved in a hierarchy of misery. Many Members have spoken
passionately about their own experiences, but I will say that both the
A and E departments at the world-class hospitals—Hammersmith and
Charing Cross—in my constituency are marked for closure. Charing
Cross hospital, which in many ways has the best site and
some of the best facilities in north-west 
<?notus-xml column=532?>London, is marked for almost complete closure. All 500 beds will
go, the A and E will go and the specialist services will go, leaving an
urgent care centre and other services high and dry, such as the
Maggie’s cancer centre and the mental health
services. To its shame, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust is
supporting those closures because it will provide a very valuable piece
of real estate for it to sell and thus improve other
campuses.</hs_Para>

the Member for Harrow West (Mr Thomas) said, it is not the case
that community services have been improved before these closures will
take place. Indeed, the White City collaborative care centre, which
should have been the first polyclinic in the country is, thanks to a
Conservative council, six years late and with a fraction of the
services it should have. It is still not open and will not
adequately replace any of
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:37:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000187">What
is happening in north-west London flies in the face of the facts. Most
hospitals in the area do not meet the four-hour target, owing to the
demand on their services. Ambulances are less safe and effective
than A and E care. For patients, it is clearly better to be
in A and E than in an ambulance. Longer journeys and journey
times need to be avoided. There is no evidence that when a good A and E
closes most cases get dealt with better via centralisation. There is
good data suggesting the opposite is true, as local A and Es have the
capability to select patients who require more specialised care, easing
the pressure on large units, and to stabilise those patients in the
critical intermediate period.</hs_Para>

a nutshell, my constituents are being offered a second-class service.
There is no clear demarcation. The health service itself cannot tell us
which conditions should go to an urgent care centre and which should go
to an A and E. The majority of my constituents will have a worse health
service, and that particularly applies to poorer constituents who do
not have access to private transport.</hs_Para>

this now becomes a political decision for the Secretary of State. In
the early-day motion that I tabled last June, I referred to the fact
that the health service locally was saying it would run out of money if
it did not make these cuts. Services are already being run down by
sleight of hand. The buck stops with the Secretary of State and the
Government. The ball is in their court. I hope the decision will be
taken, first, by the independent panel and, secondly, by the Secretary
of State. The Government cannot dodge this issue. This is about cuts,
as it was in the 1990s, and the denigration of our local health
service. The buck cannot be passed beyond this point. I call on the

needs and best interests of patients were at the centre of the
inspiration to create the national health service, almost 65 years ago,
from the ashes of the second world war. The needs and best interests of
the patient must remain at the centre of any discussion about health
services today. This is the crux of the issue. With that in mind, the
recent decision that the Secretary of State for Health took on the A
and E department at Lewisham has set the NHS on a dangerous path
whereby the core principle underpinning and shaping the design and
delivery of hospital services—that which is in the best
interests of patients—now looks set to be redefined. This
Government have introduced a new basis on which to take
decisions—namely, that financial considerations 
<?notus-xml column=534?>should take precedence over clinical considerations. Any A and E
department in the country is vulnerable to change on that
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:43:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000200">Those
two fundamental points—financial considerations taking
precedence over clinical considerations and the Government allowing the
reorganisation of well functioning hospitals on that
basis—create a toxic mix that could have consequences for
patient care and well-being. As we have seen—today’s
debate is testament to this—the new emerging principle has
consequences for the legitimacy of the decision-making process for
reconfiguration and the accountability of those behind such processes.
We must return to the first principles of health care provision. The
patient comes first. Their health care and well-being are paramount.
The needs of the patient must always take priority over the needs of

right hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), the shadow
Health Secretary, has made clear the massive challenges facing our
health-care system. It is a 20th-century system struggling to answer
the questions asked of it by a 21st-century society. There is a huge
sustainability challenge characterised by an era of economic
austerity, for which there is no line on the horizon, and rapidly
rising demand. However, any community that is experiencing
reconfiguration without clinical evidence should know that the
Opposition will be by its side fighting with it every step of the way.
The NHS is our greatest achievement and we guard it

are important progressive principles at stake. First, every penny of
the taxpayers’ money should be spent to its maximum effect, even
more so in austere times. As arguably the nation’s most valued

services throughout the country. The scale of demand and the pressures
on the system are frightening. In the financial year to date about
100,000 more patients are being left to wait for more than four hours
in A and E waiting rooms before being seen. That does not show the full
scale of the pressure, as an extra 23,000 patients were left waiting on
trolleys for more than four hours after being seen and before being
admitted to A and E.

the lack of capacity in A and E, patients are being left
waiting in the back of ambulances for, in some cases, many
hours<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:45:59"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
an issue of capacity or, to be more accurate, lack of capacity. It

unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000205">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:46:16"></hs_TimeCode>
distinction between the different forms of reconfiguration is
important. If a change in services is supported and motivated by
clinical evidence, it can offer real improvements to patient
satisfaction and to 
<?notus-xml column=535?>overall levels of care; but if a closure is motivated purely
by financial reasons—and if it is taken in the absence of
clinical evidence or consultation—that is simply a cut to
services hidden beneath the label of reconfiguration, and that is not

figures that I have quoted show a system that is on the brink. Further
increasing pressures by reducing capacity without clinical reasons has
the potential for truly dangerous consequences. Closing without
clinical evidence an A and E department that is relied upon can be
damaging to local patients and a community, but it also has wider
implications for the health care system as a whole. Performance
in A and E departments is a barometer of how the wider NHS is
performing. Patients on trolleys indicate lack of capacity on wards,
and the increased number of delayed discharges shows that patients are
being kept in hospitals when they could be receiving care in their
communities, but there are clear gaps in primary care provision. A and
E departments are under immense strain. Department of Health figures
show as much and there is simply no justification for the financially
driven closure of services or the downgrading of
facilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:48:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000209">At
the heart of the health care service is patient need, and ensuring the
right provision of health care services can only be done by speaking
with patients and clinicians. That is why it is crucial that
consultation is undertaken at every level in any process relating to
reconfiguration. A and E services should first of all be about
people and not pound signs. Those of us who care about the
national health service must guarantee that people are engaged at every
possible juncture in the decision-making process. That will ensure that
they have a stake in the future design of services, that, crucially,
they have the services they need and that they are not subject
to back-door, cherry-picked reconfigurations, such as that in
Lewisham<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:48:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000210">Pressures
in A and E departments are felt across the whole health economy
of a local health service. Removing an A and E department without
clinical support or evidence is hugely disruptive and will
have a profound effect on the provision, level, quality and
type of every associated service in any and every local health economy.
A reconfiguration of emergency services without sound clinical guidance
is not a reconfiguration— it is a cut. It is a cut in
services and in provision that will be detrimental to the
people who rely on those services. In real terms, national health
service spending has been cut, and £3.5 billion has been wasted
on a reconfiguration that was not voted for by anyone at the last
general election. It is not wanted by anyone in this country, including
medical professionals, and it has caused chaos in the NHS and in the
delivery of its key services.</hs_Para>

Anglian and the Norfolk economies. I am delighted to have an

thank the Minister for his support for the work of all the Norfolk

me first thank the Minister and his colleagues in the Department for
Transport for their encouragement. Last summer we went to see the
Minister’s predecessor as roads Minister, my hon. Friend the
Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), who told us that
historically the road had not been supported by the regional
development agency and that we had our work cut out to make the case.
The Government’s approach now is to invite local parties to set
out a clear business plan for roads, and to make the case that
Government investment will be more than matched by significant
co-investment along the route.</hs_Para>

Henry Bellingham</B> (North West Norfolk) (Con):</Member> I
congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate, and I am delighted
that he has supported the Minister, who has taken a great interest in
the issue. We in west Norfolk were delighted by the
Minister’s recent announcement that we would indeed be given the
Middleton crossing for which we had been pushing for a long time. Does
my hon. Friend agree that the A47 really does need more dualling to
ensure that Norfolk fulfils its full potential? He may be aware that
the White Paper “Roads for Prosperity”—published
in 1988, before he was born—recommended that the entire road
should be dualled. After all those years, we really must make more
progress.</hs_Para>

have initiated this debate in order to highlight the key strategic
importance of this route to our economy, to raise its profile
nationally and to build the momentum of the important campaign and the
work that is taking place locally. The road is of key strategic
importance to our region and our nation, but it is also a dangerous
route for those who use and cross it. I believe, and I know that the
other local Members believe, that it could act as a catalyst, enabling
East Anglia to become a genuine centre for innovation and enterprise
focused on 
<?notus-xml column=540?>the greater Norwich economy. I hope that the Minister will provide
further reassurance this evening that the Government will make the
route a priority in the next round of funding, will look kindly on my
request for pinch-point funds, and will view sympathetically my concern
about some of the bottlenecks that need particularly urgent attention
because they have the greatest potential to unlock
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020777000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000242"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Richard Bacon" PimsId="3840" UID="13020777000417" xid="21" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/debtext/130207-0004.htm#13020777000417"><B>Mr

which is dualled. As my hon. Friend knows, however, the road
stops being dualled very slightly to the west of that. People whom I
have employed in my office for years knew people—often they were
at school with them—who were killed in accidents on that
extremely dangerous stretch just to the west of the point at which the
dualling ceases. Does my hon. Friend agree that of all the various

north of England, and linking our regional clusters—Cambridge,
Norwich, Yarmouth and Ipswich—of innovation and science and new
business growth. As the business plan makes clear, over the 20 years
for which it sets out the programme of work, we have the potential to
generate 10,000 jobs, to increase the economic output of our county by
£390 million a year, to attract private investment worth more
than £800 million, to recruit an extra 500 investment-related
jobs and to cut journey times by 30 minutes, delivering savings of
£42 million to road users. These are significant numbers, and
they are not, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be pleased to know, plucked
out of the air but put together by professional consultants and
officials at the county council and the LEP who constructed the

infrastructure as a top priority. We set out in the coalition agreement
a commitment to a low-carbon transport infrastructure as an essential
element of building a dynamic and entrepreneurial economy. We

A47 is part of the strategic road network, which is worth about
£100 billion and covers some 4,350 miles of motorway and
all-purpose trunk roads. The fact that we recognise the importance of
its maintenance and enhancement can be seen through the history of this
Government’s spending. In the 2010 spending review, we announced
the investment of £1.4 billion in starting 14 major road
schemes. In the 2011 autumn statement we identified for accelerated
delivery two Highways Agency major road schemes and introduced six more
schemes, making eight in total, and we allocated £1
billion of new investment to tackle areas of congestion. In the 2012
autumn statement, the Chancellor announced additional capital
investment in this Parliament that would enable four further new major
Highways Agency schemes to be introduced as well as making moneys
available for pinch-point schemes in the strategic and local road

on local authority major schemes. They will deliver significant
improvements to local road networks and public transport across the

Norwich northern distributor road, and I hope they acknowledge the
money that will go into that project.</hs_Para>

is important to recognise that our investment commitment is not only in

the most important announcement was the £170 million for a new

elements of it are not. There have been previous and significant
improvements to the A47, but it is fair to make the point that the
previous Government curtailed a number of improvements that would have
helped Norfolk: the Acle straight, the Blofield to North Burlingham
dualling, the North Tuddenham to Easton and the East Wynch-Middleton

hon. Friend the Member for Mid Norfolk rightly recognises that we are
developing route-based strategies as a way of analysis. Three are
already being trialled. In considering major future enhancements to the

Committee’s report for debate, because we want to keep pressure
on the Government. To echo the words of the Liaison Committee, we have
a real resolve to achieve change, and we cannot think of a more fitting
way to achieve change than in our work to protect the Arctic. Committee

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:31:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stroud (Neil Carmichael), who has done a lot of work on the

one of the last pristine wildernesses left on earth, but it is changing
rapidly due to climate change. Last year, the Arctic sea ice melted to
an unprecedented all-time low. Satellite measurements of its extent and
volume showed that between 2003 and 2011, the ice volume decreased by
50%—much more than previously estimated. At that rate of
decline, we will completely lose summer sea ice in the Arctic within a
decade. Much scientific work is still ongoing into the matter, and we
heard during our inquiry from a range of scientists. I hope that our
report can serve as a textbook for many people, including in schools
and universities, who are trying to understand what is happening in the
Arctic.</hs_Para>

matter for us in the UK? As we reported, the effects of climate change
are already being felt in the Arctic and are likely to continue to be
felt more profoundly there than perhaps anywhere else on earth. Climate
change in the Arctic may affect our weather, making colder winters in
the UK and northern Europe possible in future. It is worth pointing out
that, although climate change and environmental issues are not at the
top of everyone’s agenda, the effects of severe weather change
on food production and supply and the implications for health and
safety, as well as access to food, make it clear that changing weather
patterns and what is happening in the Arctic affect all of us in one
way or another, so we should be concerned.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020745000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000011">The Arctic is
the last outpost for a number of species with global significance, and
we share much of the Arctic’s migratory biodiversity.
We have a strong and well-regarded 
<?notus-xml column=148?>scientific community working on Arctic issues, and I believe that that
gives the UK great influence. As the ice melts, shipping routes will
open up through the Arctic, cutting journey times between continents.
Access from Europe to the northern sea route across the north of Russia
will be through the North sea.</hs_Para>

is also encouraging oil and gas drilling in the region. The UK has a
large oil and gas sector, and many UK companies will undoubtedly seek
to exploit the Arctic’s predicted fossil fuel reserves. London
is the global finance capital and a world centre for insurance, both of
which will be needed for any future development in the Arctic, which
also gives us
influence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000013">The
UK is an observer at the Arctic Council, the body set up to aid
co-operation in the region, and the Committee has made copies of our
report available to the Arctic Council. The Arctic Council is now seen
as the primary international forum for co-operation on Arctic matters.
While we wait to see whether the Arctic Council will give observer
status to the EU and China later this year, the UK’s
long-standing role in the council gives us the scope to help shape the
future of the Arctic.</hs_Para>

that that all adds up to a strong UK interest in the Arctic that,
sadly, the UK Government are not embracing to the extent that we think
they should; that was one of the recommendations of our report, which
was timely. When we started to examine the evidence last summer, Shell
was due to start drilling in the Arctic and Cairn Energy had been
drilling off the coast of Greenland for a couple of years. As more ice
melts year on year, we can expect many other oil companies that have
invested heavily in licences to seek to start operations. That is a
desperate and perverse irony: climate change is opening up the region
to oil and gas exploration, which is being driven by burning oil and
gas. That inconsistency needs to be examined and acted
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000015">The
world does not need more oil and gas. There are already more proven oil
and gas reserves than we can burn, while still avoiding more than a
2ºC global temperature rise. I was interested by the comments
made by Professor Nicholas Stern at the Davos conference last month. He
basically said that if he had realised earlier what he knows now, he
would have focused more on even greater climate change targets. The
International Energy Agency says that no more than one third of proven
reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed before 2050 if the world is to
achieve the 2ºC goal. We sought clarity from the Government on
how looking for new oil and gas in the Arctic can be reconciled with
commitments to limit temperature rises to 2ºC. The Government
responded that the world will still need some oil and gas in the
low-carbon transition, that Arctic oil will fill that gap when proven
reserves are used up and that we will still keep within the 2º
rise.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020745000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000016">We heard a
few weeks ago from Greenpeace and others that the Government are
cherry-picking statistics from the International Energy Agency’s
2011 world energy outlook to justify their position, not least because
the 2012 edition assumes a minimal Arctic oil contribution to
production in 2035. Rather than the IEA’s 2011 data, what does
the Minister make of its 2012 data? It is important that we have
up-to-date data on which to base our evidence and policy. What does he
make of the 2012 data showing that already discovered oil and gas
fields will meet future demand, and what does that 
<?notus-xml column=149?>mean for the Government’s position on oil and gas exploration in
the Arctic? He must spell that out. Whatever the arguments, it is clear
that the Government are not prepared to set a global example on climate
change while profits are still to be had.</hs_Para>

report, we called for a moratorium on further oil and gas operations in
the Arctic. From the extensive evidence that we took, it was clear to
us that drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic is simply too risky at
present. The Arctic, as we know, is a harsh environment in which to
operate. The short Arctic summer allows only a limited window for
drilling before the ice re-forms. Last year, Shell had to stop
operations a day after drilling began when an iceberg encroached on its
drill site.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020745000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000018">Each phase of
oil and gas development will have unavoidable impacts on ecosystems. If
there is an oil spill in the Arctic, little of the spilled oil is
likely to be recovered. Only 6% to 7% of the oil spilled in the Exxon
Valdez incident was collected, and toxic oil is still to be found on
beaches more than 20 years later.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>The traditional
spill response techniques used around the globe have not been proven to
work in the cold and remoteness of the Arctic, and we received striking
evidence on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000019">There
are different regulatory regimes across the Arctic for oil and gas
drilling, and there is no region-wide requirement to use the best and
safest available technology, which is important. Given the risks, oil
and gas companies should be required to drill in the best and safest
way possible, regardless of
cost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000020">We
believe that much more research is needed to understand the full
consequences of such techniques. On balance, and applying the
precaution principle, the Committee feels that it is too soon to use
geo-engineering techniques, but further research should start now.
However, action to address black carbon, or soot, particles would be a
quick win. Soot from industrialised countries flows north and lands on
the snow and ice, hastening its
melting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:40:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000021">Many
people have given scientific evidence to our Committee, and there is an
ongoing debate within the scientific community on whether there could

am pleased that the Government have gone some way towards addressing
our recommendations. A strategy is needed to bring together the
UK’s diverse interests in the Arctic, environmental as well as
economic and diplomatic, and to engage all stakeholders. Without a
strategy, there is a risk that Departments might not work in a
cross-cutting way. The Government, in their response to our report,
were too nervous to use the word “strategy”, preferring
to call it a “policy framework”, but I am pleased that it
will be developed in a consultative fashion and seek to address some of
the issues that we have
raised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:41:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000023">I
am conscious that other Members wish to speak. Overall, I am
disappointed that the Government have not gone further by accepting our
other recommendations. As our report demonstrates, it is in all our
interest that the Arctic is developed sustainably. The Arctic is too
important to be left to those states that have set their economic
future on the development of fossil fuels in the region. We shall not
be leaving the matter with our 
<?notus-xml column=150?>report; we intend to return again and again to consider issues such as
the amount of time that it has taken the International Maritime
Organisation to introduce proper shipping policies and our calls for a
moratorium on drilling. We will certainly bring Shell back before our

speak in this important debate, Mr Sheridan, not least because I
thoroughly enjoy being a member of the Environmental Audit Committee,
particularly when producing our report, which is both inspiring and
slightly alarming at times given our
findings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:43:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000025">I
thank virtually everyone in the room, because, in one way or another,
they have contributed to my other great passion: the Antarctic. The
Antarctic Bill is progressing through Parliament, and I have been
greatly supported in that endeavour by a large number of my colleagues
on the Environmental Audit Committee. I am grateful, too, to our
Chairman for remarking on that work at the beginning of her
speech<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:43:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000026">There
are some obvious differences between the Antarctic and the Arctic. One
is location, and the other is that polar bears live in the Arctic and
penguins live in the Antarctic. Another important difference is
jurisdiction: we have jurisdiction in the Antarctic. We are part of a
treaty structure, and we have taken a strong leadership role in
promoting not only Britain’s interests, but those of the
Antarctic through that mechanism, which, ironically, is what my Bill is
all about and what the British Government’s work supports. The
British Antarctic Survey does a huge amount of excellent work in
logistics, science and maintaining British presence through its several
bases. The recent opening of one base, Halley VI, was celebrated by a
large number of people this
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:45:08"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
doing a huge amount in the Antarctic, which is excellent and should be
saluted and recognised.</hs_Para>

jurisdiction in the Arctic is, of course, a different kettle of fish,
because we are not an Arctic state. We are not on the Arctic Council,
and, therefore, we are at a disadvantage when making policy statements
about the Arctic. I can find nothing to disagree with in the report
when it comes to the overall interest in protecting the Arctic and the
danger that various measures might exacerbate the already serious
threat of climate
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:46:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000028">The
fundamental question is this: what can we do? The Government made that
clear in their response to our report, which was published on 9
January. Essentially, the Government recognise the difference in
jurisdiction between the Antarctic and the Arctic, and, as our Chairman
mentioned, they go on to talk about a framework for the
Arctic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:46:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000029">We
must recognise our limitations, but also the challenges we need to meet
to do something about them. There is another paradox, which is that
Norway is an Arctic state. Many people talk about Norway’s
non-membership of the European Union: Norway pays a lot of money to be
involved with the European Union, and it salutes virtually all EU
regulations, but it has no say. Perversely, 
<?notus-xml column=151?>that is the problem we have in the Arctic that, as an Arctic state,
Norway does
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000030">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:47:32"></hs_TimeCode>
am making two points: one is about Europe and the importance of being a
member of the European Union, and the second is about the Arctic and
our relatively weak position in delivering some of the report’s
promises and
expectations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000031">Recognising
all that, because they are statements of accepted fact, what can the
Government really do? We must apply appropriate pressure. We can signal
what we have already achieved in the Antarctic as an example. Do not
forget that there is no exploitation in the Antarctic, which is a
demilitarised zone. We agree on who owns what, and we are taking
further steps to protect the Antarctic. That is British leadership at
its best, and we will have to apply such leadership not directly,
because of the jurisdiction problem, but collectively with others. That
is the task before us. Basically, we must say to Arctic states, and to
other states that have indicated their interest, that there is a
problem we must work together to
solve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:48:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000032">In
summary, protecting the Antarctic is important. The problems are
enormous, the threats are great and climate change must be tackled. In
many ways, the report points to how that should be done. The difference
between the Arctic and the Antarctic must be recognised, and we must
respond in a slightly different way. I have set out my thinking along
those lines, which the Minister may want to consider. I hope we can all
agree that this is a working-together operation, and if British
leadership can be exerted through the European Union and our other
international relationships, that would be
good.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13020745000087" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000087"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:49:26"></hs_TimeCode>1.49

of the importance of the issues covered in the report can be seen in
the fact that since the Committee first announced its inquiry, when it
was regarded as an esoteric subject for investigation, it has risen a
long way up the political and public policy list of concerns, both in
the UK and internationally. The report combines a useful summary of the
facts and issues with an outline of policy choices facing the UK, the
wider world community, international networks and
organisations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:50:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000036">Some
might ask why a UK parliamentary Committee should be interested in
Arctic policy, given that our country is not physically in the Arctic
circle. That question was answered to some extent
by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:50:58"></hs_TimeCode> the hon.
Member for Stroud. Leaving aside the fact that when one represents and
lives in a constituency 400 miles north of London on the east coast of
Scotland, one can 
<?notus-xml column=152?>feel that one is in the Arctic circle, particularly at this time of the

my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent North pointed out, UK
companies are increasingly involved in a big way—and potentially
even more—in drilling for petroleum and gas in Arctic waters.
That raises many issues about how they are controlled and managed, as
they are UK-based companies. My hon. Friend also referred to migratory
biodiversity. That includes birds, marine life and fish stocks. That is
important to the UK’s commercial interests. There is some
evidence that, as waters warm, fish stocks may move further north.
There are also some suggestions that, if the thermohaline circulation
were to change even in a minimal way, they might actually move south.
That is an indication of how the scientific evidence is inconclusive on
the effects of climate change on the Arctic. The point is that it is an
area in which we have direct and immediate interests, both commercially
and in our wider concerns about climate
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:52:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000038">I
know that we are not within the Arctic circle. However, the UK is the
nearest state to the Arctic of those that are not the Arctic nations.
We are the furthest north, with Shetland only 400 miles from the Arctic
circle, which is 1,000 miles from London. It is not that we are so far
from the Arctic circle; as a state we have a direct interest in what
happens in that area. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent
North pointed out, we in the UK have a long history of research and
expertise in Arctic matters. The report showed that the Arctic
community, including many of the Arctic nations, respects what UK
research institutions and universities have been doing in the area over
many years. We can certainly contribute to the research that is clearly
needed by the expertise that we have in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:53:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000039">As
the Minister will know, the UK is a signatory to the 1920 Svalbard
treaty. As such, the UK has equal right to participate in commercial
activity in territories covered by that treaty within the Arctic
circle. He will also know that there is an argument about whether that
applies just to Svalbard and territorial waters, which is the Russian
position, or to the entire exclusive economic zone, which would greatly
extend the area in which the UK would have a legal right to
participate, if that line were followed by the international
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:53:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000040">I
believe the position we should support is the one taken by Norway,
rather than Russia, but I am interested to know the UK position on the
implications of the different interpretations of the Svalbard treaty. I
make that point because it illustrates that we do have a legal and
territorial interest, even within the Arctic circle itself. Above all,
if we were to see the acceleration of sea ice melt, the Greenland ice
cap, accelerated release of methane and other points made by my hon.
Friend, the Chair, that would have major consequences for sea levels,

issues are, of course, linked to climate change and our report rightly

any more detail. However, I do want to endorse the comments made
by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:55:02"></hs_TimeCode> the hon.
Member for Stroud. There is a need for international action on Arctic
issues. I fully accept that it is not just a question of our not having
a direct sovereign interest in the Arctic areas. There is also the fact
that the Arctic nations would be rightly concerned if non-Arctic
nations were seen to be interfering in their national interests.
Indeed, it would be counter-productive if we were seen to attempt to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:55:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020745000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020745000043">On
the other hand, we have various obligations under international
treaties, and legitimate interests under the law of the sea and
conventions such as the one on migratory species. We need to be
actively involved in putting forward the correct position in the
international arena. I would go further. I think we should be aiming to
seek some type of international regime, similar to that of the
Antarctic treaty, while taking into account the real differences
between the Arctic and the Antarctic.</hs_Para>

way to move towards that would be to try to develop the idea of an

I would like to see a move towards an Arctic treaty. I accept that the
UK Government do want to pursue what might seem an unlikely
international agreement. However, there is some interest, not just
among some Arctic nations, in having a wider international regime.
There is also a growing move internationally among many environmental
organisations, NGOs, civic organisations, to put the arrangements for
the Arctic on a much wider international footing. That is something
that should be welcomed by the Arctic nations as it would protect their
interests against activities in the Arctic that might be less

one can be in any doubt that climate change is the greatest threat
facing the Arctic, and the consequences of climate change are driving
the changes we are seeing there. The UK is a global leader on pressing
for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and understanding their
impact. We are, therefore, leading the fight on tackling the underlying
cause of the threats facing the
Arctic.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020763000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020763000009">Climate
change is not the only issue. The UK can and does play a leading role
in a wide range of international policies that could affect the Arctic.
For example, we are pressing for global agreement on an implementing
mechanism for designated marine protected areas in the high seas, and
for reduced emissions from global shipping. The Government’s
response to the Committee’s report outlines those in more

is wrong to say that we do not lead and that we have no role to play. A
second central tenet of the Government’s approach to the Arctic

and co-operatively with the Arctic states and others on the issues
facing the Arctic. The Government are keen for the UK to continue to
engage bilaterally and multilaterally with all Arctic states,

hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan Walley), who chairs the
Select Committee, was publicly lauded by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:18:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith) and clearly does a good
job. She raised some important points, and I will address them in turn.
The first point she wanted me to respond to was the International
Energy Agency’s figures. Under the new policy scenario in its
2012 “World Energy Outlook” report, the world will
consume 99.7 million barrels of oil a day in 2035, compared with 87.4
million barrels  a day in 2011. Over the same period,
production from existing sources of crude oil will have declined from 
<?notus-xml column=160?>around 65 million barrels a day to 26 million barrels a day, so new
sources of oil will be needed to make up the difference. While seeking
to limit emissions, we have to accept that major economic developments
in parts of the world will result in greater energy use in the medium
term. For example, while oil consumption is expected to fall
significantly in the OECD, it will rise elsewhere, notably in India and
China. What we can realistically seek to achieve is to limit the growth
of emissions through international agreements, notably the United
Nations framework convention on climate change, and by encouraging the
increasing use of low-carbon
technologies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:20:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020763000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020763000013">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:19:57"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Stroud—I pay tribute to his work on
the Antarctic Bill; I was privileged to take part in the

jurisdiction in the Antarctic, in contrast to our lack of
jurisdiction in the Arctic. However, he is right that we can, by using
examples of best practice and leadership, show those who have a
responsibility and a role in the Arctic what we are seeking to achieve
in the Antarctic. That is a valuable lesson.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:20:52"></hs_TimeCode>I would say
that, although the Committee’s response is critical on the whole
of the Government’s response, others are not. Denmark’s

the Arctic Council as the pre-eminent regional forum, which provides an

that the Arctic Council could benefit from greater participation and
exchange of expertise from the UK and other state observers.</hs_Para>

that science is an excellent lever for influencing the development of
Arctic policies. Promoting UK science in forums such as the Arctic

hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) asked about
the Svalbard—or Spitsbergen—treaty. Just to remind hon.
Members, the 1920 treaty of Paris set out the conditions under which
Norwegian sovereignty over Svalbard was recognised. Those include
non-discrimination between the parties to the treaty and a limit on the
royalties chargeable on minerals extracted. The UK is a party to that
treaty. No country disputes Norwegian sovereignty in the Svalbard
archipelago, although there are different interpretations of the
treaty’s applicability to maritime zones surrounding Svalbard.
We consider that the treaty applies to the maritime zones generated by
Svalbard, but Norway disagrees. However, we support the careful
stewardship that Norway exercises in protecting the Svalbard
environment. There is no hydrocarbon activity currently taking place on
the Svalbard continental shelf.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman also asked whether the UK supports the negotiation of an
Arctic treaty. That would depend on the scope and objectives of any
proposed 
<?notus-xml column=161?>treaty. Comparisons are sometimes made with the Antarctic treaty, but
that treaty deals with matters of territorial sovereignty, which are
not relevant in the Arctic. The United Nations convention on the law of
the sea provides the framework for the international governance of the
areas of the Arctic ocean beyond national jurisdiction. The Arctic
states have recently, through the Arctic Council, agreed a legally
binding framework on search and rescue and are negotiating on an oil
spill response agreement. We believe that the international governance
arrangements in the Arctic are sound, and it is the rules and policies
underneath those that require greatest attention.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park asked about oil spill falls.
Of course, we all have sympathy; the idea of an oil spillage occurring
in that part of the world—I think it has happened
there—is absolutely abhorrent and has terrifying consequences
for the environment. However, determining how to ensure that those
liable in the case of oil spills meet their liabilities, as he will
well know, is a matter for the relevant countries. It is a matter for
those jurisdictions to determine both the scope of such liabilities and
the levels of compensation and penalties payable in the event of a
spill.</hs_Para>

reasonable to imagine the British Government adopting as their formal

Swire:</Member></B> I do not think my hon. Friend would be arguing for
that, seeing as the Government are limited in their jurisdiction in the
area, and seeing as they do not own any oil companies exploring in the
area. For the British Government to make a unilateral proclamation
about unlimited liability in that area would be seen by some as
somewhat condescending and interfering. However, clearly, environmental
protection should be at the forefront. That is why a lot of British
companies—in terms of deep sea drilling, and the kind of
measures and safety measures that we have learnt over years in the
North sea—could have a very real application to safe drilling in
that sensitive part of the world.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Bristol East asked a technical question about the
threat of methane released from permafrost. Continued warming of Arctic
land masses will lead to a large-scale melting of permafrost, which may
well release large quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
Although the magnitude of any release is uncertain, it has potential to
significantly accelerate global warming. While the amount of methane
currently being released is small compared with other sources, that
contained below permafrost and land ice is thought to be huge. The
Arctic Council’s Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme is
looking at methane release in the Arctic as part of its Task Force on
Short-Lived Climate Forcers.</hs_Para>

definitely an issue for consideration. The United Nations Environment
Programme report into black carbon produced last year concluded that
emissions of black carbon particles into the atmosphere can have a
significant impact on human health and both direct and indirect climate
impacts. For example, some emissions can be transported long distances
and deposited as soot on Arctic ice or snow, which decreases surface
reflectivity—albedo—and increases ice melt because of the
additional warming effect. The Arctic Council’s AMAP produced a
report in November 2011 on the effects of black carbon and has a task
force that is following up that work. It is currently drawing up its
work programme.</hs_Para>

to engaging with the Arctic Council since it was formed in 1996. The UK
understands the Arctic Council’s desire to set such criteria,
but encourages the Arctic Council to support applicant states to meet
the requirements. In the view of the UK, there are likely to be
benefits for the Arctic states in engaging constructively with all

patrol aircraft as the solution in the short to medium term, but on the
other hand, a maritime patrol aircraft is not in the equipment

making any decisions or assessing options. It seems to regard the risk
as tolerable, on the basis that such equipment could be bought with
unprecedented speed and efficiency. I have high hopes for the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:53:00"></hs_TimeCode> Committee

programme. Despite all the associated problems that the Chairman
rightly mentioned, its cancellation involved a vast waste of public
money; even so, as he also said, the MOD described that as the least
worst option—I dread to think what the other options would have
been. The cancellation has been analysed and re-analysed by the Public
Accounts Committee and others, and in any case it is a fait accompli,

an effective ASW platform when operating relatively close to their base

processing capability as well as restricted weapon-carrying capacity.
Modern underwater detection systems using arrays fixed to the ocean bed

classify maritime surveillance as the ability to see and understand
what is happening above, on and below the sea, as well as along the
coastline. We need to do that not just around the United Kingdom, but
throughout the NATO area of responsibility. We also need to support our
deployed operations when they are outside the NATO area.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:06:36"></hs_TimeCode>Maritime
surveillance involves a combination of platforms and sensors to provide
a 3-D picture of what is happening, and it uses the combined work of
satellites, aircraft, helicopters, ships and submarines. Our maritime
surveillance capability has been eroded 
<?notus-xml column=173?>gradually since the end of the cold war, and significantly reduced since
the 2010 strategic defence and security
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:07:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020763000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020763000101">What
capabilities have we lost? Most importantly, as we all know in the
Defence Committee, we have lost the Nimrod MRA4 maritime patrol
aircraft programme. We all understand and accept the reasons for that,
but it does not stop us worrying about it. The Nimrod would have been
the lynchpin of our maritime surveillance capability if it had been
brought into service. The Ministry of Defence says that the UK has a
maritime surveillance capability gap; it acknowledges it a little
grudgingly but accepts that that gap cannot be covered by the assets
that we have in service at the moment. Getting a maritime patrol
aircraft back in service is probably the key to solving the problem. A
large maritime patrol aircraft fitted with modern sensors, weapons and
systems is operationally very flexible. The old roles of the
UK’s maritime patrol aircraft fleet included strategic tasks
such as intelligence gathering and, as my friend
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:09:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Sandra Osborne) said, the protection of
our continuous strategic nuclear deterrent at sea with the Royal
Navy’s Trident submarines. What does that mean? It means that a
maritime patrol aircraft would ensure that our one ballistic submarine
at sea providing our deterrent was not tailed by an enemy submarine
without its knowledge. The need for that has not diminished.</hs_Para>

1,200 nautical miles into the Atlantic. Right now, however, we can only

our international Atlantic oversight obligations.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:10:50"></hs_TimeCode> course, the
Ministry rightly maintains—I would say the same if I was in the

Friend the Member for North East Hampshire said. Of course, we must not
forget that the coastguards also have some search and rescue
helicopters. In effect, short-range search and rescue
operations—by short range, I mean out to 240 nautical
miles—are conducted by a mix of military and contractor-operated
helicopters, which do an excellent job. They are aided hugely by those
incredible men and women of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution,
who regularly put their lives at risk when there is a need, regardless
of the foul weather, to help people in distress. Everyone in the House

resurgent Russia and the proliferation of smaller submarines in many
areas of the world, it has arguably got worse. To counter such threats,
the UK has reduced its capability and capacity by removing maritime

I respectfully disagree with his analysis yesterday in <I>The Daily

as I say, I have known for many years and regard as a friend—has

rather a lot of sense—it is unlike me to compliment him, as he
knows—but the whole point of the white board is that we look at
things that we want to have and then we assess whether we can afford
them, and if everything that we thought that we would like to have was
revealed to everyone else, I am afraid that we probably would not be
mentioning a white board at all, because we would not want to have our
internal thinking announced before we have got as far as making
decisions. These are not decisions; these are things that we want to
have.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Beckenham made a point about seedcorn. On pages 41 and
42 of the Committee’s report, we very clearly tackled the point
about seedcorn and future remuneration. We welcome seedcorn as a
principle; we very much welcome the notion that we would use our
international allies to provide training and personnel support.
However, we are also very clear that we do not believe that that can
continue beyond 2019, and we actually say that there is huge scepticism
about it continuing until 2030. The more that we have examined the
issue—again, the Minister can correct me if he wants
to—the more that it looks as though 2030 is the realistic time
line now, in light of both our inquiry and of course our recent
correspondence with the Minister, before we will get back that full
capability. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>
wonder whether the Minister has absolute confidence that our
partners—particularly our Five Eye partners—will be able
to continue to provide that support to us for effectively 17 years, or
perhaps even
longer?<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:38:15"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

replacement platforms, I hope that one of the things that the Minister
reflects on, particularly given the BAE Systems debacle, is that there
are other ways to procure replacement platforms. Of course, he will be
aware of the model of Saab aircraft. In effect, an existing, tried and
proven airframe is taken and then the software is fitted on to that
system. Obviously, that model needs to be considered in the light of
our report on Tuesday about the need for a defence industrial strategy.
Can the Minister confirm whether or not the MOD is actively considering
that model as one of the options?</hs_Para>

has also been mention of what the MOD has now called remotely piloted
aircraft, which we know as unmanned aerial vehicles, and their future
role. Again, there was talk about joined-up Government. When we had the
debate before Christmas, with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:39:01"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the hon. Member for
Ludlow  (Mr Dunne), who is the Minister with responsibility for
defence procurement, the point was made by a number of colleagues that,
in relation to maritime surveillance and the role of RPAs, a number of
Departments that 
<?notus-xml column=181?>clearly have an interest in maritime surveillance. The Minister might be
able to correct me if I miss any on the list, but my note would say
that, as well as the MOD, other Departments that have an interest in
maritime surveillance include the Department for Transport and the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which has lead
responsibility for fishing and ensuring that Icelandic boats or,
indeed, those of our European partners do not break the law. The Home
Office has a role for maritime surveillance, as has the Foreign Office,
with its responsibilities for overseas
territories.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:39:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:35:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:35:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:34:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:33:01"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:33:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:32:08"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020763000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020763000165"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:40:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:49:20"></hs_TimeCode>I
hope that the Minister takes this as genuinely helpful advice: the
Committee believes that we need a much more joined-up Government.
Perhaps the Minister can clarify, in a way that the Minister with
responsibility for defence procurement could not, what proactive steps
the Department is taking to bring other Departments together to discuss
whether we can have a shared acquisition policy for RPA, rather than
having four
Departments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:40:33"></hs_TimeCode>

think that, up to now, this has been a genuinely consensual debate, but
the final issue I want to raise, which we touched on in the report, is
slightly contentious with the Department. It is about the wide area
maritime underwater search project. My colleagues know more about it
than I do, so I will not go into any great detail. The Committee feels
that WAMUS is an exercise that should have been carried out before or

hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon) that we discovered that
the RAF and the Ministry of Defence had failed to tell us that the

am not suggesting that the RAF, the MOD and the Minister were malicious
in withholding information, but I do suggest that there was either
arrogance on  the part of the Department—not the
Minister—or incompetence. I think that it is fair to say that
the Chairman of the Committee expressed his disappointment with both
the Royal Air Force and the Minister. Mr Brady, I am sure
that when the Chairman of the Committee was Chief Whip you never gave
him the opportunity to express his disappointment in you. As one of the
members of the Committee to whom that has occasionally happened, I can
assure you that the Chairman’s disappointment is something that
one does not seek to invoke. I hope that, in his response, the Minister
will set out how the MOD has learnt the lesson of that mistake and how

Friend the Member for Beckenham pointed out, has a civil dimension. We
have responsibilities under the international convention on maritime
search and rescue. I think that is what it is called; I tried to
establish the exact title, although I seem to remember from my days in
the Department that it is called the Chicago convention. As my hon.
Friend said, the United Kingdom has an obligation to provide search and
rescue right out into the Atlantic, but currently we are not able to
provide that capability. It is important to see this as part of a
jigsaw. It is not just the United Kingdom providing support for the
United Kingdom and the international waters for which we have
responsibility, but part of an interlocking NATO
capability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020763000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0001.htm#13020763000173">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:46:17"></hs_TimeCode>

Friend the Minister need not worry; I came back safe and sound. I had
the Norwegian Defence Minister as a passenger. It was an interesting
experience because it enabled me to see not only what the maritime
patrol capability delivers, but the role played by our allies. I pay
tribute to the royal Norwegian air force for its part in policing the
sea lanes between the Russian port of Murmansk and these islands. At 2
o’clock in the afternoon, when one is in complete darkness
there, 1,000 feet over black, black water with no horizon and just
endless water stretching to the Arctic, it is interesting to realise
that without those people the sea lanes would not be patrolled.

that although the Ministry of Defence was a key part of the whole

think this was the most serious capability gap that we created, but I,
at least, did not create it without understanding its significance. I
asked the National Security Adviser, Sir Peter Ricketts, “Does
the National Security Council understand the significance of the loss
of the capability?” I was given the wonderful mandarin response,

that I am in BAE’s pay. Lady Thatcher once said to me, “I
hope BAE is still paying you.” BAE Systems has never paid me a
penny piece in my life. I think that it is a great company, but on this
project, as successive major project reports and National Audit Office
reports showed, it failed to deliver. For those who do not understand
what I mean when I say that BAE was the design authority—I speak
as an aviator—the company is responsible for the design of every
bit of the aeroplane. BAE did not even know that the wingsets were
about 4 inches different, so it had to more or less hand-make whole new
wingsets for each aircraft. That is why I believe the company to be
culpable. Yes, I take the point that perhaps more diligence should have

installing software to make the elevator go up and down. Forgive me,
but that is metal against metal. I said to the then Chief of the Air

He said, “You don’t need to worry, Gerald,” but I
do worry, and I did at the time. I was also told, although I do not

work on a cross-party basis. I concur with the remarks about the
Committee’s current Chairman, although I remember that, when I

today. As the Chairman and others have argued, the threats are wide. We
are a maritime nation, and we depend on open sea lanes for trade and
security. As a former Defence Minister, I am aware of the threats to
our independent nuclear deterrent. The idea that, somehow, the end of
the cold war means that Russia has gone away is incorrect. A maritime
surveillance capability is vital to our defence needs, and not only

Yes, I think there was. Our report from the early 2000s suggested that
there should have been that option. When spending public money, we get
to a point where people think, “A little bit more might get this
done.” In hindsight, had there been some revision of the project
in the early 2000s, Conservative Members would rightly have thrown
criticism at us for wasting large amounts of public money. Making the

to rapidly search large maritime areas, a capability relevant to long

strategic intelligence and protecting the nuclear deterrent. The NAO

next question is why was the decision taken? Again, I am interesting in
what the hon. Gentleman said: the decision had to be taken because of

sometimes use that figure, but sometimes they do not. We must recognise
that those decisions had to be taken because of the 9% cut in the
defence budget introduced by the SDSR. The decisions were not
strategic; they were budgetary. Knowing the defence budget as I do,
there are only two simple ways to take out in-year cash. The first is
to take out capability, as happened here, and, for example, with the
Harriers. The second is to sack people, which has happened over the
past few
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020763000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0002.htm#13020763000219">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>

usually non-partisan in such matters. If we do not know what is on the
whiteboard, what the budget is or the state of the remaining 55% of the

claims last week when they got the figures mixed up and did not
understand that the 1% applies only to the equipment budget, not the
remaining 55%. Even the NAO report says that that might be swallowed up
just  
<?notus-xml column=190?>by the risk in the existing programme. We need to know such things.

my right hon. Friend the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)
on the work he and his Committee have done in this area. Since we are
all being nice to those who help us, I add my thanks to the huge number
of serving personnel and civil servants who came to fill in one or two
knowledge gaps in my portfolio. I have already made that point. They

is an important and wide-ranging subject and it is right to give it
serious attention. As has already been pointed out, maritime security
is vital to the defence of our nation and our interests around the
world. The military and non-military dimensions of maritime
surveillance are key elements. We highlighted our position as an open,
outward-facing island nation in the national security strategy and
placed an emphasis on surveillance and intelligence in the SDSR. Put
simply, we cannot protect ourselves against existing and anticipated
threats if we do not understand and cannot detect them. Doing so
successfully requires a range of capable platforms and sensors, highly
trained personnel and procedures to ensure effective action is taken on
the information they
provide<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:17:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020763000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0002.htm#13020763000233">The
geography of the United Kingdom means that we are dependent on the sea
for our economic prosperity. Maritime security and surveillance
underpins our trade: the vast majority of our imports and exports are
transported by sea. As much as 90% of world trade is carried by sea, so
we not only need to secure our own territorial waters but to contribute
to protecting key global sea lanes and our vital interests
overseas.</hs_Para>

think everybody here would agree that we also wish to be able to
project military power with our allies through the use of expeditionary
forces. We rely again on maritime surveillance assets to protect those
forces wherever they are deployed. Closer to home, the Government have
responsibility to protect our people, our borders and our exclusive
economic zone. I have always said that the first duty of Government is
the defence of the realm. That requires that the different agencies
charged with doing so—the police, borders, immigration,
intelligence agencies, coastguard, Department for Transport, search and
rescue providers and the armed forces—have the capabilities they
need and work closely

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:19:59"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for North East Hampshire said that he did not wish to
concentrate on Nimrod, but I am afraid that it has been largely about
Nimrod, which I will therefore have to deal with in some detail. I
asked the officials present—this huge number of serving
personnel and civil servants—at what date the original Nimrod
decision was taken, so I knew before his confession that it was, sadly,
taken under the previous Conservative
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:20:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020763000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0002.htm#13020763000242">We
should not forget the background to the decision to cancel Nimrod.
There were no maritime reconnaissance aircraft flying in the RAF when
we came into government. We did not create the capability
gap—the capability did not exist. Owing to cost growth in the
programme, the original plan to convert 21 airframes for the MRA4 had
by 2010 been scaled back to only nine. The in-service date had been
delayed from 2003 to 2012, costs had none the less risen from
£2.8 billion to £3.6 billion, there were still
outstanding technical problems which would have taken further large
sums of money to solve and we knew that it would cost about £2
billion to operate over the next decade. While the capability’s
role in support of anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, strategic
intelligence gathering, and search and rescue remained important, in a
financially constrained environment dominated by the operations in
Afghanistan among other threats, it made the most military and
financial sense to discontinue the programme, however unhappy that made
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:21:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020763000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/halltext/130207h0002.htm#13020763000243">I

Revised plans and operating procedures are in place for other platforms

submarines, which have been much discussed. Submarines use their
stealth and global reach to collect information, indications and
warnings of threatening activity; where appropriate, they operate in
support of naval taskforces. Bringing in the Astute submarine is a
major step forward; it is a quieter submarine and gives us greater
capabilities. Also, internationally we are not operating alone. Not
only the French and 
<?notus-xml column=193?>Norwegians, but the Americans and Canadians can provide support through
maritime patrol aircraft. We have existing agreements with some of
those countries and have recently signed a memorandum of understanding
with Norway to co-operate on maritime air surveillance. We are also

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:27:15"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for North East Hampshire asked five questions. We see
co-ordination of maritime surveillance as being done by the maritime
security oversight group, up to the National Security Council. I agree
that further development is needed, and I think that it will develop
further. His second question was on the strategic analysis of maritime
threats and the need for surveillance. I do not have a specific answer,
because that is something we are doing the whole time. If he wants to
ask a specific question later, I am happy to answer it. On progress on
developing maritime ISTAR, some is classified, but optimisation study
is going on as we speak. The air ISTAR optimisation study will consider
the potential contribution to maritime surveillance of lighter-than-air
vehicles, which were mentioned earlier; the initial report will appear
in April this year, for consideration of options by April next year.
His fourth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:28:17"></hs_TimeCode>
question was the general ability to deal with contingency operations.
Generally, contingency—a 
<?notus-xml column=194?>much overused word in the MOD—seems to rule everything at the
moment. After Afghanistan, that is very much where we are looking. His
fifth question was on updates, which we will continue to provide. If we

making a joint statement with my right Hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. Together we

this new strategy will maximise the contribution that defence can make
towards the achievement of our foreign policy
objectives.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020746000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/wmstext/130207m0001.htm#13020746000020">The
national security strategy and strategic defence and security review
(SDSR) in 2010 set out our goal to bring together and use all the
instruments of national power in a co-ordinated and coherent manner,
ensuring that the sum of our efforts to safeguard our security, extend
our influence, and build our prosperity is bigger than its component
parts.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020746000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/wmstext/130207m0001.htm#13020746000021">The
international defence engagement strategy sets out how defence assets
and activities fit within this goal, and how they can better contribute
to wider Government objectives. It looks out over a horizon of 20 years
to identify both the major risks that we will face and opportunities
that we will
have.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020746000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/wmstext/130207m0001.htm#13020746000022">In
implementing this strategy we will use our network of defence
attachés and other defence representation overseas, together
with our diplomatic network and the Defence and Security Organisation
of UK Trade &amp; Investment, to ensure that we are developing the
right relationships and achieving the right influence for the
challenges and opportunities of the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020746000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/wmstext/130207m0001.htm#13020746000023">On
occasion, we will cement these relationships in the form of a treaty,
as we did with France in 2010. But the influence we can achieve through
defence engagement goes far broader than this. This strategy therefore
includes traditional defence diplomacy activity of senior-level visits
and international defence training; Ministry of Defence contributions
to regional stability, conflict prevention and stabilisation
activities; security and non-combat operations; and MOD support for
defence and security exports. The scope of this strategy is ambitious
and it will be implemented in conjunction with other related Government
initiatives, such as the building 
<?notus-xml column=22?>stability overseas strategy, the Gulf initiative and the emerging
powers initiative. The implementation of the
international defence engagement strategy will build on existing
relationships and on work already under way, but we will also be making
some significant advances in the development of our relationships with
some
states.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020746000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/wmstext/130207m0001.htm#13020746000024">We
have already taken steps to ensure that we use our defence engagement
to promote our values through contributing to the institutional
capability of other nations. We will have an accredited non-resident
defence attaché for Burma next month and will establish a
defence section in our Embassy in Rangoon later this year. The Burmese
Government have taken some very positive and welcome steps towards
reform which we should assist. The Burmese military continues to play
an influential role in government, so we will use military to military
dialogue where we can, complementing diplomatic and development
efforts, to encourage reform and support democracy. During her meeting
with the Prime Minister in June 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi specifically
recommended the appointment of a defence attaché to Burma as a
key channel for engagement with the Burmese
military.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020746000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/wmstext/130207m0001.htm#13020746000025">We
are increasing our efforts to support security and justice sector
reform and capacity building, which contribute to regional peace and
security. We will be opening a defence section in our embassy in Libya
this year. During the transition in Libya we established a defence
advisory team to assist the national transitional council in developing
their organisational and planning capacity. This team has remained in
place post-conflict, to support the democratically elected General
National Congress. The defence section will build on relationships
established by them. Also, we have recently established a defence
section in Juba in South Sudan. We are working alongside other
Government Departments to assist this newly independent state to
establish national institutions and implement security and justice
reform, contributing to regional security in a relatively unstable
region.</hs_Para>

when the British embassy is opened in Mogadishu this year we will be
establishing a defence section there, enabling us to provide a greater
focus for our support to the Government of Somalia and to AMISOM, the
African Union force in Somalia, as they make progress in driving out
al-Shabaab. Importantly, taking advantage of our transition from combat
operations in Afghanistan and the resulting increase in available
forces, we are exploring innovative ways of using some army
capabilities on a wide range of defence engagement tasks and intend to
pilot this as the army restructures its adaptable brigades. We will
exploit our recent operational experience, develop our capabilities,
our cultural understanding and language training, and demonstrate our
commitment and support for our allies and partners including the UN,
NATO and EU.</hs_Para>

recognise the importance of developing our bilateral relationships with
emerging powers—nations we see as growing long-term partners in
regional and global defence and security issues. The international
defence engagement strategy allows us to focus our efforts, and as
examples of this over the last two years we have signed defence
co-operation and defence technical arrangements with Japan, Indonesia,
India, Vietnam, Turkey and Brazil. Supporting our Gulf initiative and
security in the middle east region we have intensified defence
co-operation across the region and we are increasing our training and

are continuing to develop our bilateral relationships more broadly, and
have recently signed defence co-operation agreements or
memoranda of understanding with Canada, Norway,
Denmark and Mongolia. Since the SDSR in October 2010, the UK has signed
no fewer than seven new defence treaties and over 50 new memoranda of
understanding and other subordinate agreements which contribute to our
network of international alliances and partnerships in line with the
vision set out in the SDSR. The most recent new agreement is a defence
co-operation treaty with Australia, signed in Perth on 18 January 2013.

senior personnel serving in advisory or command positions in US
headquarters. Approximately 200 British officers are on exchange with
all four of the US services, developing capability and increasing
interoperability. As close allies the US and UK host each
other’s forces in order to conduct training, be prepared to

in September 2012 and will establish a further five posts by 2015. We
are increasing our joint exercises. This was exemplified by the
Corsican Lion exercise last October, building towards the final
validation of the concept of the combined joint expeditionary force in
2016. Our ambassador in Paris, Sir Peter Ricketts, has been consulted
during the preparation of the French livre blanc security review and

Government are on course to spend £2.3 billion on flooding and
coastal erosion risk management in England over this spending period
(April 2011 to March 2015). This is being supplemented by up to
£148 million, contributed by local councils, businesses and
private investors under the new partnership funding system introduced
in May 2011. This extra investment is helping to deliver better
protection to more communities than previously thought possible. Risk
management authorities are now on track to deliver better protection to
165,000 homes by March 2015, exceeding the target set at the

can also announce that nine schemes, including Leeds, Sheffield,
Ipswich, Exeter and Derby, will receive a share of the funding
announced in the autumn statement last year. These schemes will unlock
economic growth, create jobs and grow the economy. For example,
Exeter’s new flood defences will create over 1,000 jobs and
protect businesses which employ 4,700 people. The defences will provide
better protection to land for business development as well as major
rail and sewerage infrastructure and over 2,000 homes. In Ipswich, a
tidal barrier will improve flood protection to 10 hectares of
development land attracting more business to the area and creating

year I announced that the new partnership funding system had brought
forward £72 million of contributions over the three years to

£148 million over the same period. This is enabling
more schemes to

system had remained. Schemes with significant
partner contributions include the £50.5 million growth scheme in
Leeds that will protect 250 businesses and create over 18,000 jobs. To

combination of extra funding in the autumn statement, backed by
partnership funding contributions, will allow a £9.7 million
scheme to go ahead in Skipton, North Yorkshire. This will reduce
flooding to over 350 residential and 165 business properties in the

how the negotiations on the MFF would be handled on 7 and 8 February.

tool. They support the use of overt surveillance in a public place
wherever its deployment is in pursuit of a legitimate aim, necessary to
meet a pressing need, proportionate and compliant with any relevant

an important parallel with the well-established concept of policing by
consent, which is based upon a presumption of transparency and
accountability to assure the integrity of police officers and staff in
exercising their powers on behalf of their fellow citizens. This
Government will ensure that, for the first time, there is a robust

the licensees of the spectrum used to provide 4G services to take.
However, the 4G auction includes one licence with a demanding 98%

McVey:</Member></B> Under the 'Moving Around' activity, it has always
been the policy intent that individuals who are unable to walk more
than 50 metres should be entitled to some rate of the Mobility
component. Within this group we wanted to ensure that the enhanced rate
was focused on those who face the greatest barriers to mobility, with
the remainder receiving the standard
rate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020782000530" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/text/130207w0002.htm#13020782000530">In
the second draft of the assessment criteria we intended to
differentiate within the group of people who are unable to walk more
than 50 metres by considering the types of aids that individuals used.
However, it was clear that we did not succeed; the descriptors were
unclear and resulted in misconceptions about how the activity would
work. This was apparent from the responses we received to our
consultation, which indicated that most people believed that only those
people who used a wheelchair could receive the enhanced rate, which has
never been our
intention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020782000531" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/text/130207w0002.htm#13020782000531">Therefore,
we needed to change the criteria to make them clearer and easier to
apply. We did so by differentiating within the eligible group by
considering the distances that individuals can walk. We did this by
introducing a 20 metre measure linked to the enhanced rate, ensuring it
is focused on those who have the most limited mobility. We feel is much
clearer and achieves the original policy intent. By taking this
approach, individuals who cannot walk 20 metres can be certain they
will receive the enhanced rate, regardless of whether they need an aid
or appliance. I must also stress that this must be looked at in context
of whether individuals can complete the activities safely, to an
acceptable standard, repeatedly and in a reasonable time
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020782000532" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/text/130207w0002.htm#13020782000532">Our
analysis of the second and final drafts of the assessment criteria
shows that the projected number of people who will score 12 points

intervene in underperforming academies. Academies are autonomous from
LAs and their performance is a matter for the Department through the
Office of the Schools Commissioner. If a local authority (LA) has
concerns about an individual academy, we expect the LA to raise these
concerns with the Academy Trust in first instance. If the LA feels that
the Academy Trust is failing to take sufficient action concerns can be
raised with Ofsted or the Secretary of

and other professionals to decide how best to meet the needs of every
child. The Department has not issued any guidance, over and above the
requirements in the School Admissions Code, on the admission of
prematurely-born children. The School Admissions Code requires school
admission authorities to provide for the admission of all children in
the September following their fourth birthday. Paragraph
2.17 of that code makes it clear that parents may defer their child's
entry to school, or request that they attend part-time, until they
reach compulsory school age at the start of the term following their
fifth birthday. Children whose entry to school is deferred continue to
be entitled to 15 hours a week of funded early education until they
reach compulsory school age. Where a parent requests 
<?notus-xml column=409?>that their child is educated out of their normal age group, the code
requires admission authorities to make a decision based on the
circumstances of each
case.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13020782000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/text/130207w0002.htm#13020782000643"><B><Member PimsId="2370" UID="13020782001004" xid="78" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130207/text/130207w0002.htm#13020782001004">Richard

heavy snow, the Department expects head teachers to keep schools open
for as many pupils as possible whenever it is reasonable for them to do
so. In September 2010 the Department made changes to the law to address
the perverse incentive for head teachers to close the entire school if
a proportion of their pupils could not travel in because of adverse
weather. Where a pupil is unable to get in the school can mark the
register using absence code ‘Y', which means that the pupil's
absence will not affect the school's absence figures.</hs_Para>

or FE colleges will generally not have to carry out DBS checks when

England or Wales with a “host family” (private fostering)

such short term foster carers so long as the child's parents approve
the choice of carers, and carers are unpaid volunteers; although they
can carry out criminal records and barred list checks on the carers if
they wish to do so. A barred person would be committing an offence if

to in-cell television is restricted to those at standard and enhanced
