of the assertions made in that excellent report from the

time when the “Whitehall state” will be cash-strapped for

work always pays. That is why we are introducing much-needed reforms,
which were ducked by the previous Administration, to the benefits
system. We have introduced universal credit, which means that even if
someone works for only a few hours a week, it always pays to do so. In
that way, we get rid of some of the disincentives to work, such as the
16-hour rule in the benefits system, at the same time making sure that
when someone works, even on low pay, they keep more of their money. On
this side of the House, we are immensely proud that, as of April,
because of the lifting of the point at which income tax is
paid, we will be taking 2 million people on low pay out of
paying any income tax at

dramatically increasing, precisely in line with Andrew Dilnot’s

to reach out to create alliances with other countries, including the

Taking the second matter first, let me say that the CPS’s
guidelines are crystal clear that a victim or witness giving evidence
should not be prevented from accessing the care or counselling they
might require. Indeed, I believe that Mrs Andrade was specifically
referred to the possibility of counselling when it was seen that she
was distressed prior to the case taking place. On the issues in court,
protocols are in place to try to familiarise people with the court
process and to ensure that the trauma of giving evidence in court is
lessened, including of course the possibility of special

CPS gets it references from the police, so unless a case is referred to
it, it cannot carry out an investigation. It works closely with the
police, however, both to improve the conviction rates for
rape—it has been consistently successful in doing that for some
years—and to encourage people to come forward by ensuring that

Thornberry</B> (Islington South and Finsbury) (Lab):</Member> Has the
tragic suicide of Frances Andrade after giving evidence as a victim of
rape not shown us that we have a system strewn with high-minded codes,
pledges and guidance to victims that are brushed aside in practice? She
was refused counselling and, as already stated, her PCC has said that
victims will not and should not be referred for counselling until after
they have given evidence. That is clearly in breach of the agreed code.
Is the CPS in charge of these cases or not? It clearly did not know
what was happening in the case of Mrs Andrade. In how many other cases
has the victim not been properly supported and does the CPS simply not
know what is going on? I welcome the fact that the Home Secretary has
stated that she will look into this and that the Attorney-General has
stated today that he will too, but is it not time that we had a proper
review that overarched all the agencies to ensure that we have a decent
rape prosecution policy in this country, not one that just looks good

although I am not sure I entirely share the sweeping generalisations
that she derives from them. As I said earlier, the evidence is that,
under the last Government  
<?notus-xml column=708?>and the present Government, through the work of the CPS, the conviction
rate for rape has consistently been improving. The House will want to
bear that in mind. On the very serious suggestions that Mrs Andrade was
somehow misled, yes that is a matter of concern to me. As I indicated
in an earlier answer, the information I have been given supports my
view that both the CPS and the Greater Manchester police correctly
advised her and recommended routes by which she could obtain
counselling. The suggestion that some other organisation or police
force might have said something to the contrary
is obviously of serious concern and will be looked
into.</hs_Para>

When it takes on an investigation, wherever it can, it publishes that
on its website, but there are sometimes circumstances where it cannot
do so without prejudice to the investigation. If I may say to the hon.

are a whole series of protocols in place in prosecutorial organisations

carry out such investigations.</hs_Para>

of our existing police reforms address those challenges. The new
College of Policing will improve the quality of police leadership and
drive up standards. Police and crime commissioners are making the
police more accountable to their communities. Direct entry into the

reforms will help, but we also need to take further specific measures
to root out corruption and misconduct from the police. First, in line
with the recommendations made by Lord Justice Leveson, national
registers of chief officers’ pay and perks packages, gifts and
hospitality, outside interests, including second jobs, and their
contact with the media will be published online. Secondly, the college
will publish a new code of ethics, which will be distributed to

I want to make sure that the Independent Police Complaints Commission
is equipped to do its important work. Over the years, its role has been
evolving and the proposals I announce today develop it further. Public
concern about the IPCC has been based on its powers and its resources,
and I want to address both
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0001.htm#13021255000194">Regarding
its powers, last year Parliament legislated, with welcome cross-party
support, to give the IPCC the ability to investigate
historic cases in exceptional circumstances. In the same legislation,
we gave the IPCC the power to compel police officers and staff to
attend interviews as witnesses. In addition, I have already said that
we will legislate as soon as parliamentary time allows to give the IPCC
the power to investigate private sector companies working for the
police, along with other powers that the IPCC has asked for to improve
its effectiveness and increase public confidence. I am prepared to
consider any further legislative changes that the commission says it
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0001.htm#13021255000195">I
believe that the main difficulty for the IPCC is its capacity to
investigate complaints itself. Last year, the commission investigated
just 130 of the 2,100 serious or sensitive cases that were referred to
it independently, while supervising or managing another 200. Individual
police forces investigated the remainder, but 31% of appeals against
forces’ handling of complaints were successful. That is simply
not acceptable. I will therefore transfer to the IPCC responsibility
for dealing with all serious and sensitive allegations. I also intend
to transfer resources from individual forces’ professional
standards departments and other relevant areas to the IPCC in order to
ensure that it has the budget and the manpower that will enable it to
do its work.</hs_Para>

Government’s police reforms are working well, and crime is
falling. Corruption and misconduct are thankfully the rare exception
and not the norm among our police. However, that does not mean that we
should not act. I believe that this is a comprehensive plan to address
public concern about the integrity of the police, and I commend my
statement to the House.</hs_Para>

thank the Home Secretary for giving me a copy of her statement. This is

whole House will wish to recognise and show support for the
international reputation of British policing, which is respected
globally for low levels of corruption, high standards of integrity and
our tradition of policing by consent. As the Home Secretary said, the
vast majority of police officers join the force to help the public and
keep people safe from crime and harm, and they take great risks when
they do so. We think of the two police officers who were shot down when
answering a routine 999 call in Greater Manchester, but also of
officers who go the extra mile every day to help the
public—perhaps stepping in to rescue people and save their
lives; perhaps sitting with bereaved parents whose teenager has been
killed in a traffic
accident.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0001.htm#13021255000199">Police
officers themselves are deeply concerned about serious cases that
undermine confidence in policing: hacking, the Hillsborough tragedy,
the problems with undercover officers, and cases in which policing has
failed to protect the public or to deliver justice. That is why the
vast majority of police officers also want action to be taken against
officers who let their force and the public down, as well as action to
improve
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0001.htm#13021255000200">Many
of the Home Secretary’s measures are sensible. We support the
implementation of the Leveson recommendations, and also the
introduction of greater transparency. We support the establishment of a
code of ethics and higher professional standards, and we support
stronger action when those are breached. We have also argued for
stronger action in relation to retired officers when things go wrong.
The Stevens commission on the future of policing has taken evidence on
issues involving codes of ethics, national registers, the role of the
College of Policing and proposals for striking police officers off, and
is likely to make new proposals in that
regard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0001.htm#13021255000201">However,
can the Home Secretary clarify what she means? Will there be a national
professional register that all police officers must be on, will there
be standards that they must meet, and will they be struck off from the
register if they do not meet those standards? If so, by whom will they
be struck off? Will it be the IPCC or the College of Policing, and will
that be underpinned by legislation? Or does the Home Secretary simply
propose to put together a list of officers who have already been sacked
by their local
forces?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0001.htm#13021255000202">I
do not believe that the Home Secretary is going far enough on the IPCC.
As she will know, I have argued for the last 12 months that it does not
have enough powers and resources to deliver for the public. I welcomed
the action that she took and the legislation, which we supported, to
strengthen powers, but her reforms of the IPCC still seem to be
incremental. Increased resources are welcome, but can she tell us how
much there will be and where it will come from? Is she top-slicing the
budgets of police forces across the country, and if so, by how much?
How many extra police officers does she think those forces will lose as
a result?</hs_Para>

passage of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011,
Ministers argued that more cases should be dealt with by individual
forces rather than by the IPCC. In the Act the Home Secretary
downgraded the IPCC’s capacity, halving the minimum number of
commissioners. Now she seems to be saying that more cases should be
dealt with by the IPCC rather than by individual forces. Has she
changed her view since the passage of the Act, and can she clarify her
proposals?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0001.htm#13021255000204">I
am also not convinced that the Home Secretary is doing enough to
strengthen the powers and the culture of the IPCC to restore public
confidence and ensure that lessons are learnt. Nothing is being done
about the confused and overlapping bodies that are supposed to act when
policing goes wrong. Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary,
the IPCC, individual police and crime commissioners, police and crime
panels and, now, the College of Policing all have a role, but it is
still unclear who does what, and as a result, who should act when
things go wrong and ensure that lessons are learnt. I therefore think
that the Home Secretary has not been sufficiently radical. May I urge
her to look again at the possibility of replacing the IPCC altogether
with a new police standards authority, along with a new, coherent
framework of standards and
accountability?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0001.htm#13021255000205">Finally,
I hope that the Home Secretary agrees that the best way to ensure
rising police standards is to have well-motivated, professional police
officers who are keen to do a good job and serve the public. She will
know that there is a massive problem with low morale among police
officers, who do not feel valued, and I am keen to hear how she intends
to address that.</hs_Para>

will look at how best to address the issue in terms of its general work
with police officers and others on standards and development. I expect
that there will at least be a list of those officers who have been
struck off, and whom one would not expect other police forces, here in

serious and sensitive allegations made against police officers. Last
year, just 330 out of 2,100 such cases were independently investigated
or supervised and managed by the IPCC. I think it should be able to
look at all the serious and sensitive allegations against police
officers, which is why we are looking to transfer resources from police
standards departments in police forces to the IPCC. We will look at any
manpower or funding implications and ensure that the IPCC has

the police that will set standards and take on many of the ACPO
business areas in looking at those standards, as well as dealing with
the ethics of policing for the area that it covers and with the
training and development of officers, will give a boost to officers in
terms of their professionalism and the regard in which they are held. I
am pleased that Professor Shirley Pearce, former vice-chancellor of

The role is changing slightly from the one she first came to, but she
is addressing it with great distinction and commitment, as one would
expect from her. Indeed, in her time overseeing prisons she built up a

particular investigation that is taking place. We accept that such
occasions do occur, but it is right that we say to the police that they
have to be more considerate of the implications of their talking to the
press in other circumstances. That is why ACPO had, prior to the
Leveson report—this is picked up in the

One is to have direct entry at superintendant level, where it would not
be necessary for the individual to have police experience, but it would
be necessary for them to go through an appropriate training period
before they were able to take on their tasks as superintendant. Another
is to open up the opportunities for chief constables to those with
relevant policing experience—such experience would be necessary
in those cases, but in a common law country. My hon. Friend asked what

addressed it yesterday. It is important, and one thing that the College
of Policing will be examining across the board of policing, in due

deal with, certain types of crime and certain types of victim. A huge
amount has been done in recent years to improve the way in which police
forces deal with allegations of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and
rape, but of course, as I said yesterday, we will be looking at the
lessons that can be learned from that particular

companies concerned who knew that the writing was on the wall before

decisions, one must consider the negative impact on the rest of the

prompted a response from those involved in insolvency, which would give
greater consideration to consumer protection. The Association of
Business Recovery Professionals, known as R3, has been in touch with me
with suggestions for ways in which consumers could be protected in the
event of a business collapsing, including purchase of protection bonds

remaining assets. Those categories currently include a range of tax,

considerable growth of this form of payment in the past decade or so.
Certainly when the Insolvency Act was conceived in 1986, the voucher

sufficient issue to be included in the priority list. However, that is
no excuse for failing to prioritise the issue now. By way of analogy,

increase in the number of horses and the decrease in horse prices mean
that putting horses into the food chain is attractive. At the abattoir,

the game with respect to what I will say in my speech. I said yesterday

the contents of the pallets are marked on the manifest and the

discussed that yesterday and again this morning with the noble Lord

lessons. I will be keen to establish more systematic testing of
products so that we actually look at the material. That answers some of
the hon. Lady’s questions about the freezer plant in Northern

lessons that has already been learned is that it is a fallacy that
people can have cheap food and quality food? The two do not go hand in

country who want to buy a product for speed and convenience, but who do
not want to pay a premium price. They deserve exactly the same rigorous
quality standards and exactly the same adherence to what is on the
label as everybody else. If they buy a cheaper product marked
“processed beef”, they should jolly well get processed
beef. They should be as aggrieved as anyone who buys the most expensive
sirloin steak if what they buy is not what it says on the label. If
people 
<?notus-xml column=741?>in this country buy a cheap product, they should get
a good product that conforms to the label. That is an important

for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and the Opposition on securing such a
timely debate on the eve of the discussions that the Secretary of State
will have in Europe with his counterparts, and on the back of two
meetings with industry. Today, we should be celebrating the food

from now on to take British-sourced beef into processed and frozen
foods, that would be the speediest way to restore confidence in the
food industry. Retailers accept their responsibility and have risen to 
<?notus-xml column=746?>the challenge set by the Secretary of State. My concern is this. I am
proud to have the Food and Environment Research Agency headquarters in
my constituency at Sand Hutton near York, but it seems perverse that we
continue to accept contaminated and suspect meat consignments, testing
within a week and with results by Friday, yet we now may have to
re-export some of the suspect meats to Germany and elsewhere for
testing. That is a little bit gross and I hope that that will not be
the case.</hs_Para>

found to be less than 1%. Under present rules, that is not deemed to be
contaminated meat. It would help everybody if we stopped talking about
contamination when there is a trace. We need to move the debate on to
what is a trace, and at some stage the FSA or the Department will have

at the costs of two separate lines, one for beef and one for pork. We

belief that if product checks had taken place, food contaminated with

have huge support from all other member states in the European Union,
but until we can again inspire confidence in the food industry and
allow the retailers to get on with what they are good
at—delivering safe, healthy food to our supermarkets—then

provisions, the traceability and the additional animal welfare
conditions that we in this country uniquely impose on our producers
have increased cost. Farm-gate prices are going down. Feed costs have
gone up. The cost of transporting animals to slaughter has gone up.
Slaughterhouses are fewer and further apart. We ought to use this as an

beef for their processed and frozen

celebrate the contribution of the beef industry and other meat
industries to the UK, not just to locally sourced food. Much that is

debate is timely. Perhaps the FSA has been caught on the back foot.
When in November the FSA was told by the Food Safety Authority of
Ireland that DNA tests were to be conducted on particular products
entering the food chain through our supermarkets, it was a wake-up call
to the FSA here to do similar tests. It was of concern to the Select
Committee to hear that the original contamination could have been in
the food chain for up to one year—who knows, it might have been
longer. We need to get to the bottom of this. I accept the assurance
that criminal proceedings will follow, but we all know that the wheels
of the law move extremely slowly. The Secretary of State has the
opportunity tomorrow to take this argument to Europe. It is a
Europe-wide problem so we must have a Europe-wide solution. I believe
that the answer lies in our food-labelling provisions and European law.
I hope that this debate will give him every power to his elbow in
tomorrow’s
negotiations.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_12_PT_1/9473736154C34B68376481E839E263F62EB7B1F7" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="12 February 2013">Tuesday

incident involving Findus UK is instructive. I am speaking today
because, when I asked the Secretary of State a question yesterday, his

this occasion, I have a reasonable suspicion that it was not his fault.
I think at best it was because very clever crisis public relations
people had obfuscated the facts, but it might also be possible that
people have been deliberately withholding the facts from the Secretary

State and his team to redouble their efforts when they scrutinise what
happened at Findus. In the past 24 hours, since yesterday’s
Question Time, I have assembled a timeline of what I think happened. On
Tuesday 29 January, Findus Group received initial test results from the
Eurofins lab in Germany suggesting that horsemeat DNA had entered its
beef lasagne products. By Wednesday 30 January, Findus UK had decided
to quarantine the beef lasagne in its wholesale warehouses. At some
point over the next few days, it would have had confirmation of the
initial lab results. Experts in the industry tell me that would usually
happen within 48 hours, so I am working on the assumption
that it had confirmation of the test results by Thursday
31<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T14:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>
January.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000422" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000422">On
Saturday 2 February, Comigel wrote to Findus UK asking it to withdraw
its beef lasagne products, explaining that it could not guarantee the
integrity of the supply chain of its products from as early as the
previous August. It wanted its beef products withdrawn. On Monday 4
February, Findus communicated this information to major UK retailers,
and I understand that the big retailers started to withdraw those
products late on Monday evening. The rest of us understood that on
Wednesday 6 February, because <I>The Sun</I> revealed it in a news
report. Late afternoon on Thursday 7 February, the company confirmed
that its beef lasagne products contained horsemeat.

morning, my researcher in West
Brom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T14:34:01"></hs_TimeCode>wich bought
a Findus frozen lasagne in a shop in my constituency—so they
were still available to my constituents—and yesterday the
Secretary of State announced that on Saturday 9 February he had a
conversation with Leendert den Hollander, the boss of the sister
company to Findus UK,
Young’s.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000423" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000423">From
that timeline arise several searching questions that we need to put to
Findus, and I would like to share them with the remaining Ministers on
the Front Bench. I know that they cannot answer them straight away, but
I would like to get them on the record. First, given
that the company had a reasonable suspicion that its supply
chain was contaminated—or whatever word we want to use—on
Tuesday 29 January, why did it not issue an immediate withdrawal of
products, a product recall and a refund strategy for its customers?
These were frozen goods that people stored in their freezers
to eat at some point in the future, so the refund
strategy would have been important.</hs_Para>

test results were obviously important enough to the company for it to
decide to quarantine products as early as Wednesday, but not for it to
remove products from the retail section. On what day did the lab
results confirm beyond doubt that there was horsemeat in Findus food?
That would have been the day when any company adhering to basic forms
of corporate social responsibility would have pressed the red button.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T14:35:48"></hs_TimeCode>The company said
that it was informed, in writing, on Saturday 2 February by Comigel
that its supply chain was contaminated. When was it told by telephone
and/or e-mail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T14:36:05"></hs_TimeCode>?
Finally, given that the company was told on Saturday 2 February that
its second and third-tier suppliers could not guarantee the ingredients
in the product, why did it not urgently and immediately issue a product
recall on the Saturday, but instead leave it until the Monday
evening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T14:36:25"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000425" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000425">Why
do I think this is important? I honestly say to both Front-Bench teams
that our respective views of the markets do not matter
here—obviously, Ministers 
<?notus-xml column=749?>and I will differ about the markets—because
even the driest economist and greatest adherent of laissez faire in the
market would still consider this a market failure that needed
addressing. On my side of the political and economic debate, this is
probably the most perfect example of predatory capitalism I have ever
seen. Findus UK was a company in crisis. Private equity investors took
possession of the company a few years ago, started putting pressure on
the supply chain and refinanced the company. I think that that pressure
led to corporate failure and its failure to do the right
thing.</hs_Para>

contained 29% horsemeat, which was clearly the result of deliberate
fraud in order to make an exorbitant profit. It was then, and is now,

other forms of criminal activity include introducing unfit meat that

products, but there must be a co-ordinated effort to stamp out this
crime. It is up to the retailers, the Food Standards Agency, trading
standards, port authorities, the European Food Safety Agency
and, in particular, the police, including Europol, to work together to
root out these offences. I cannot emphasise enough the role of the
police and their investigative skills in working across borders to
combat this trade.</hs_Para>

find out, we will not complete the work. However, it is worth

Diane Abbott</B> (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</Member> We
have heard a lot in this important debate about producer interests. I
want to detain the House for a few minutes to talk about the interests
of consumers and to remind the House that, even as we speak, there are
mums—and dads, too—hovering over the frozen food cabinets
of their corner shops, supermarkets or favourite frozen food stores,
looking at their favourite processed meat product and saying,
“Is this what it says it is? Is it even safe?” For those
ordinary mums and dads up and down the country, it is not enough for
Ministers to hide behind this or the other quango, as this horsemeat
scandal has clear public health implications—possible
implications, but implications none the less. There is a public health
dimension, so responsibility falls fairly and squarely on
Government.</hs_Para>

are relieved in the House today to understand that at this point there
is no evidence that antibiotics or other drugs have entered the food
chain. That is what we know today, but we know from previous food
scandals that what we know this week may change week on week. It is the
public health aspect that makes this an issue for Government. It is the
public’s belief—it is a belief as old as the Chamber
itself—that when it comes to the adulteration of foodstuffs,
whether it is watered-down milk in the Victorian era or horsemeat in
lasagne in 2013, they can look to Government to take some
responsibility.</hs_Para>

other point to make is that we should not forget that this scandal
affects the very poorest in our community and their children. Who,
really, is eating £1 lasagne and so-called value burgers? Who
buys those things, except the very poorest in communities such as mine?
Often they feed them to children. I hear people saying, “Oh,
you’d have to eat an awful lot of these things for there to be
any discernable effect on your health,” but I put it to
Ministers, who might not be aware of this, that there are families in
communities such as mine who eat an awful lot of cheap, processed food.
They deserve absolute assurances about its quality, not Ministers
hiding behind quangos.</hs_Para>

must concern anyone taking an interest in this debate that the whistle
was blown not by the Food Standards Agency in England, but by the Food
Safety Authority in Ireland. What does that say about the processes and
procedures in the British Isles? There are issues with the break-up and
reorganisation of the FSA and the loss of trading standards officers
locally. Serious issues have also been raised for some time about the
cuts to the Meat Hygiene Service, so for Ministers to say that the
ultimate responsibility lies somewhere else is not something that the
British public accept or believe for a second. It is no coincidence
that this issue has been headline news for some days in the British
media, whether they ostensibly support the Government or not. I believe
that it will continue to be headline news until it plays itself out,
because historically there has been no issue of greater concern to
British families than the quality of the food that they eat.</hs_Para>

fundamental issue arising from the horsemeat scandal is the price of

means pressure on quality. Instead of cutting back institutions such as

hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich East (Mr Watson) made an
important point that relates to my points about pressures on costs and
business pressures. He mentioned the delay in Findus withdrawing its
products. It seems to be the case that Findus delayed withdrawing its
product until after the weekend so that it could move another 100,000
units and bolster its profits. This is what I mean about the pressures;
they are inimical to ensuring that our people can purchase a quality
product, even at the lowest cost.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T14:52:36"></hs_TimeCode>My hon. Friend
referred to the chief executive officer of Findus, Dale Morrison. Even
as we are debating the issue in Parliament and our constituents are
wondering whether the processed meat product of their choice is safe,
he is sitting in his skyscraper in Manhattan, apparently oblivious to
our cares so long as he can see the share price of Findus going in the
right direction.</hs_Para>

to run. The Government should not be hiding behind civil servants or
quangos. They must accept their moral responsibility for the quality of
the food that our people purchase in the shops, and for any possible
threat to public health.</hs_Para>

That is just one of the symptoms of the crisis relating to the cost of

Over the past 15 years, they have more or less devolved the

re-engineer our food policy around consumers, not around producers or

Sandys:</Member></B> I think that that is a false choice. The issue is
that we have stopped valuing, understanding and being able to use food.
One thing has been a huge asset: this week, the Secretary of State for
Education announced that food preparation and food cooking will be part
of the national curriculum. Through such moves, we are creating a more
resilient public. We cannot get away from the fact that global food
prices are rising. We must support the poorest families in that
transition. I do not believe that we need to eat less well, despite the
rise in the food prices. What we need to do is to have greater
transparency, much more resilience and greater skills to be able to use
food more effectively.</hs_Para>

tightening some of the regulations on food promotion. Products that are
less expensive are going on promotion at more expensive prices.
Retailers are shortening the period in which a product needs to be on
full price before a discount is a true discount. That is another form
of consumers absorbing price rises, but not absorbing them
transparently.</hs_Para>

saw Jamie Oliver appearing on American TV decrying its use. There was a
real backlash, and companies such as McDonalds, Burger King and Taco
Bell announced that they would discontinue its use. There was also an
outcry about it appearing in meals in the public sector, and promises
were made that that would no longer happen. Once consumers knew that
there was pink slime in their food, they did not want it and wanted the
meat industry to stop producing
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000471" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000471">There
is also a substance that has become colloquially known as “white

highly processed meat products such as burgers or pies. It is a
paste-like product produced by forcing beef, pork, turkey or chicken
under high pressure through a sieve to get every last little scrap of
meat off the bone. Questions have been raised about its safety and some
have argued there should be limits on how much of it should be used in

products came from a factory in Luxembourg, which was supplied with
meat by a company in south-west France, which had acquired frozen meat
from a Cypriot trader that had subcontracted the order to a trader in
the Netherlands—who was then supplied from an abattoir and
butcher located in Romania. As John Harris says, how messed up has our
food system become? All this is a far cry from the sort of meat that
many Members praised during yesterday’s statement on horsemeat.
The advisability of buying local meat from a local farm sold by a local
butcher was highlighted, where the path from the pasture to the plate
is a matter of public record. Indeed, I have heard people saying that
they take local sourcing so far that they even know the name of the cow

is very easy to say that, and in ideal world, people would be looking

food and source it locally instead of buying ready-made meals, but I am
sure many MPs grab a ready meal from 
<?notus-xml column=757?>Tesco or Marks and Spencer on their way home after a vote. We should not
be too judgmental about people who turn to value ranges and ready-made
meals, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney North and Stoke
Newington (Ms Abbott) said. If someone has only a couple of pounds left
in their purse and there is a £1 lasagne ready meal
or an eight-pack of Tesco economy burgers left in the shop, they will
buy one of those rather than buying the mince, the sheets of pasta, the
flour, the butter, the tomatoes, the herbs and the cheese that they
would need to make a lasagne from scratch. Many people do not even have
the necessary cooking facilities in any case. I have seen single men in

ahead and try to cook their own meals, they would still not be buying
premium “best of British” mince. They would be buying the
sort of mince that was mentioned just now by my hon. Friend the Member

they will buy the packet of eight Tesco value burgers for £1,
because they have no other option. According to statistics released

now buy budget ranges, as opposed to just one in five back in 2008. We
cannot insist that everyone should buy the premium, locally sourced,

entirely endorse the policy of 100% testing of the carcases of horses
that have been slaughtered in the United Kingdom for phenylbutazone, or
bute. It is impossible to establish whether a horse has been fed bute
by looking at its passport. The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh)
suggested that horses might have been injected with bute, but only very
rarely is the substance administered intravenously. It is fed to horses
in feedstuff. Not only is the possibility of cross-contamination
incredibly likely, but bute is a very useful drug which is often given
to horses that are elderly or slightly lame. It prolongs their useful
life, and enables them to enjoy a better quality of life.</hs_Para>

extremely cheap, which means that, among both veterinary surgeons and
horse owners, it is incredibly popular. If the life of a much-loved
family pony can be extended by a further five or 10 years by one sachet
of bute a day, those sachets will be administered. However, therein
lies some of the problem. Bute is readily available from veterinary
surgeons. While I would not suggest that horse owners are
irresponsible, if a ready supply is prescribed for one horse—as
might happen in the case that I have identified—what is to
prevent me from giving it to another
horse?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000488" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000488">I

complete veterinary record of every drug and vaccination given to that
much-loved pony, but there is no record of its ever having been given

commend the last Government for introducing the horse passport
regulations, and for tightening them in 2009 with the introduction of
microchipping. That was an important step forward, However, it is
important to remember that the microchipping of foals was compulsory
only from 2009 onwards. The odds of any horse over the age of four or
five being chipped are fairly long. A competition horse that is
regularly used and transported around the country, if it has been
measured by the Joint Measurement Board, will have been microchipped,
but that is unlikely to apply to an ordinary pony that has stood in the
New Forest for many years of its life, or has been kept at home and not
used in competitions. A horse that is presented for slaughter may or
may not have a microchip.</hs_Para>

Member for Wakefield said that it was perfectly legal to buy a
microchip on the internet for 12p. That is true, but it is illegal to
insert the chip into an equine. The check is there, but I would argue
that it is much more common for horses to be presented at UK
slaughterhouses without a microchip, and with a passport that may or
may not have come from a recognised stud book. I can show the House two
passports. One is fully pukka, and has come from a fantastic, historic
equine charity—the oldest in the country—and the other is
Irish, for a beast that has been through goodness knows how many sales
in Ireland. However, it is the British passport that does not show that
drugs have been administered, and the Irish one that does.</hs_Para>

say something about the national equine database. There are some 1.3
million horses in the United Kingdom, some of which were registered on
the database and some of which were not. I do not know whether the hon.

record, but it did not show where a horse had been kept, what drugs had
been administered or what the horse had been used for. There was simply

lament the loss of NED because I cannot establish whether a competition
record has been recorded accurately and therefore cannot boast about
the potential and ability of a pony, but did the database show where I
kept the pony? No. There are 10,000 licensed livery yards in the UK and
many more unlicensed yards, and only about 70% of those 1.3 million
horse owners keep their horses at home. There are, of course, all the
other horses all around the country which may be in racehorse training
or may be show jumpers or eventers. NED was utterly useless at showing
where a horse was at any one time and what drugs had been administered
to
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000493" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000493">I
have made the plea that we should not necessarily regard phenylbutazone
as an evil. It is not; it is a very useful drug. However, we must
ensure that it is not in the human food chain, and the only way to do
that is to adopt 100% testing. I would argue that given what has gone
on abroad, all meat coming into this country should be tested. Who

the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee on 30 January that he
thought this was a rogue event and that FSA Ireland chanced to do DNA
testing on precisely the day when a rogue consignment of horsemeat just
happened to be present. What is most extraordinary is not his pathetic

from south-west France, from a company called Spanghero, whose parent
company is Poujol, which acquired the meat from Cypriot traders, who in

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:35:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer), who made some strong points about
the traceability of the product in this country. From when animals are
in the farmers’ field to the time they are slaughtered and
processed, we know exactly where they have come from: the red tractor
mark identifies farm assurance, giving us certainty that we are buying
the right product and that it is beef.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021255000527" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000527"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:35:47"></hs_TimeCode>I
wish to say clearly to hon. Members that we have not suddenly got to
this situation, as these things have been happening for years. I was a
Member of the European Parliament for 10 years, serving on its
agriculture committee. Time and again, we said, “We want greater
traceability. We want to be able to follow these products across
Europe. We want to be confident that it is not just a paper
trail and that we actually have physical inspection of this meat and
meat product.” None of that has happened. If there is a silver
lining to this situation, it is that it is a wake-up call. We can
therefore make sure we put in place a process whereby we identify the
product and consumers can be absolutely confident that they are buying
beef and not horsemeat.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021255000528" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000528"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:36:27"></hs_TimeCode>That
leads me on to the fact that what has been happening is fraud—it
is criminal activity—as we should be able to buy a beef burger
in the shops, even a cheap one, and have confidence in it. We have
talked a great deal about educating people on how to cook meat, and
that is a great step forward, but we have reached a stage where,
rightly or wrongly, many more people eat processed food. We in this
Chamber are not going to roll that back, so when a consumer buys a beef
burger, even a cheap one, he or she should be confident that it
contains beef and not horse.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021255000529" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000529"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:37:21"></hs_TimeCode>People
no longer want to spend their time cooking the types of meat
we have used over the years—the slow-roasting joints and so
on—or perhaps they do not have the time available, so much of
that meat and meat product can go into cheaper burgers. There is
therefore no excuse for what has been happening. I say clearly, making
the same point as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:37:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sherwood did, that in 1970 we were spending more than
30% of our income on food whereas the figure now is about 12%. Although
the percentage of their 
<?notus-xml column=765?>income that people are spending on food has dropped dramatically, they
should still be able confident of what they eat.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021255000530" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000530">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:39:42"></hs_TimeCode>
expect the food industry to stand up and be counted, and to be certain
that the product it is selling is exactly what it says it is. We have
seen supermarkets use a great deal of muscle in the past, and they will
do so again, to try to drive prices down. In many ways, one could argue
that that is of great benefit to the consumer, but that is only if the
consumer gets a product they can trust and be confident in. We must be
careful of the day when we go against all processed food, because
processed food is not necessarily bad for us. If it is processed in the
way it should be and it contains what it says it should on the label,
we can eat it with confidence. We can do that if we are eating British
food produced under our farm assured
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:39:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255000531" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0002.htm#13021255000531">I
look forward to what the Minister is going to say in reply, because we
now need to ensure that we have confidence in our food industry. We
need to bring in a food labelling system that will clearly identify the
country of origin of the principal meat ingredients in a processed
product, so that we know where they come from and so that if we are
concerned that they have come from other parts of Europe or across the
world where we do not have the same confidence in the food chain, we
will not buy that product. At the moment, we have only
“processed in the EU” and “processed in the
UK”, and we do not know where the principal ingredients came
from. I urge Ministers, when they go to Europe, to make sure that we
finally get proper labelling, so we can identify where our food came
from. We can then act much more quickly to bring criminals to book.
That is what they are: criminals who have put the wrong meat in a
burger, which may bring problems. I look forward to hearing what the

at Asda or Tesco. It is also too easy for the Secretary of State to
dismiss his responsibilities by saying repeatedly that retailers have

McDonnell</B> (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</Member> On a point of
order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Government lost in the High Court this
morning. The High Court ruled that the Government’s
Jobseeker’s Allowance (Employment, Skills and Enterprise Scheme)
Regulations 2011 are unlawful. The regulations forced people into
unpaid work—workfare—and, if they refused that work as
unsuitable in assisting them in gaining employment, they lost their
benefits. This morning the regulations were declared unlawful. At
midday, the Government put out a written
statement:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13021255001306" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255001306">“we

is, back on to workfare. Those regulations have not been published yet.
I am told that they may be subject to the negative procedure and so
will come into immediate force without a vote in the House and with no
opportunity to debate them. Could we ask the Government to make a
statement to clarify the current position? A large number of people
will, as a result of the regulations being ruled unlawful, be able to
claim back the benefits they lost as a result of the unlawful penalties
that were levelled against
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255001118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255001118"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3149" UID="13021255002193" xid="192" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255002193">Mr

in the National Infrastructure Plan are yet to start work; further
notes the admission of the Deputy Prime Minister, in the House Magazine

deeply, and that figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility show
that in the first three years of this Government’s term it has
spent £12.8 billion less in capital investment than the last
Government had planned; further believes that private sector investment
has also been hit by weak demand and confidence in the UK’s
flat-lining economy, and uncertainty resulting from the
Treasury’s dithering, delay and lack of leadership; welcomes the

for 2012-13, the amount was £48.4 billion. In the plan set out
by this Government, it is £41.7 billion. We had a
plan to halve the deficit during the course of this Parliament. This
Government wanted to go further and eliminate the structural deficit in
that time. The reality is that they are borrowing more than the amounts
set out in the plans left by the last Labour Government. They are not
borrowing it to invest in infrastructure, either. They are spending
£12.8 billion less on infrastructure than the last Labour
Government, but they are spending £13 billion more on social
security. Why is that? It is because there are more people out of work
and more people claiming tax credits as a result of this
Government’s failure to get the economy growing again. They are
spending £13 billion more than they had planned to on social
security. Is that really what they came into power to do? No, but the
reality is that their decision to cut as far and as fast as they did
has choked off the economic recovery. The result has been an economy

Governments are stewards of the country that elects them. The test of
their stewardship is whether they leave their country better equipped
and better prepared to prosper in the future through having taken the
long-term decisions on which major infrastructure investment depends.
In two short years, Britain’s reputation for infrastructure has
been transformed. Having plummeted down the international league table
of countries rated by their infrastructure, we are now climbing it
again. The rest of the world has seen this country shaking off the
torpor of the past. After more than a decade of inaction, we are once

Davies</B> (Swansea West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> What a ragbag of
complacency and distorted history we have heard. All of us will surely
remember that, pre-1997, we were under a Government with problems of
massive unemployment, repossessions, companies going bust and people
dying as they waited for operations. The reason was that people were
not working and paying tax—debt and taxes were going up and
public services were being cut. From 1997 to 2008, there was an
unprecedented period of economic growth, thanks to a Labour
Government’s getting people back to work. People were then
paying tax and the money was reinvested in jobs and public
services.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021255001255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255001255">In 2008, the
sub-prime debt tsunami hit our shores; if it had not been for Mr Obama
and my right hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr
Brown), who invoked the fiscal stimulus, we would have gone into a
world depression instead of a mild recession, which ended in 2010 with
the fragile growth inherited by the coalition Government. They then
wasted that opportunity by immediately announcing that half a million
people in the public services would be sacked. They did not say when or
who, so people stopped spending money. Consumer demand went down to the
floor and since then growth has stagnated. The result, of course, is
that tax revenues have fallen, debt has risen and more people are on
the dole.</hs_Para>

figures that claim that more people are in jobs, but how are more
people in jobs when there has been no increase in production? The
simple answer is that people who used to be in full-time jobs now have
two part-time jobs. The situation is a complete mess. The amount of
infrastructure investment was cut in the first two years of the
Government. There are proposals for more infrastructure investment,
which I want, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating—we
will believe it when it comes.</hs_Para>

make a couple of quick comments about my own area. It is my firm
contention that Wales should get its fair share of
HS2—£1.9 billion. I welcome the electrification to
Swansea, which has been mentioned. I am also interested in city regions
and more investment in those, and I welcome those thoughts. More
investment is needed in the M4 in south Wales, around Newport and Port
Talbot, to speed up business, commuter and tourist flows and to spark
more investment. I would like 
<?notus-xml column=794?>to see an evaluation, which has been promised to me by the Chief
Secretary to the Treasury, of the Severn bridge tolls. If the
Government paid for them, would they recover the money from more income
tax and lower benefits because of increased jobs? The tolls are simply
a tax on trade between Wales and
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255001258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255001258">I
move swiftly on. As I said in an intervention, we should look further
afield to the emerging economies, which are growing at an enormous
rate. I appreciate that we do not have the Chinese political system,
but we could look closely at the Chinese commitment to, and focus on,
investment in research and development. Brazil has; it is investing
$5.3 billion in renewable energy and biotech and becoming a world
leader. China’s investment has meant that certain US and
European companies that used to lead in solar power are being taken
out. We need to think strategically about how to invest in both the
infrastructure and the innovation
agenda.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255001259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255001259">I
make no apology for again mentioning Swansea, where, in a fine example
of strategic investment, the European Investment Bank is investing to
enable an overall investment of £250 million in a second campus
at Swansea university. The university is linked up with industrial
partnerships in modern manufacturing, green technology, biotech, and so
on—new, cutting-edge, exportable technologies which,
interestingly, are the very areas that Brazil and China are looking
at.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255001260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255001260">This
is not just a matter of spades in the ground, and roads and railways. I
welcome roads and railways, as well as flood defences and the like, but
it is also about making rational choices and investing in
infrastructure alongside innovation. When we look at the migration of
global companies and where they go, it is clear that it is partly about
infrastructure, partly about cutting-edge research and development, and
partly about markets. We need to get our mix
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:15:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255001261" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255001261">On
housing, the Government need to remember that when one looks at the
accounts, one needs to look at the balance sheet. If we invest in
housing, then clearly we have an asset. Looking at the balance sheet
and the net liabilities, we see houses as assets for the future that we
need to drive down people’s rents and give them somewhere to
live and the stability to work and have jobs. I encourage the
Government to look at more innovative housing schemes in the United
States whereby a local authority will provide the land and then a
property company will come along with a shared equity and spend the
money on building houses, half of which will be social housing and the
other half private houses. The public sector then ends up with free
council houses, an income stream from the private houses, and half the
overall equity. This is also supported by pension funds for long-term
rental opportunities.</hs_Para>

are enormous opportunities for bringing in outside capital investment
from countries with surpluses, be it from oil or trade. Countries such
as Qatar are looking to invest in tourism infrastructure and cultural
infrastructure so that downstream, when the oil runs out, they will
have alternative income streams. We should be creatively looking at
that rather then saying, “Oh no, we can’t afford
it.” We need to invest to increase our trajectory of economic
growth, and that includes things such as schools. It is very sad that
the preparatory work done by the previous Government through Building
Schools for the Future was dashed, and it is now being 
<?notus-xml column=795?>looked at again. Investment in hospitals, keeping workers in work and
keeping people in good condition, is clearly a good investment as
well.</hs_Para>

other key strategic investment is the internet. People running
companies in costly and congested London can now consider the
possibility of going down a high-speed route on an electrified railway
to sunny Swansea and locating there on the internet, outside the cost
and congestion, helping us to spread out our economy. This is the
strategic approach that we need to take, but we very much need to up

Anne Main</B> (St Albans) (Con):</Member> I profoundly disagree with
the motion, particularly what it says about “dithering”
and “delay”. I am all for a bit of dithering and delay,
but I would call it caution and sensible planning. I am speaking up for
the environment because I want us to take a considered approach to
planning as well as kick-starting our economy. Carpenters have the old
adage, “Measure twice and cut once.” We should be very
careful that we get our infrastructure right rather than just dashing
forward and building on any old

motion stresses the need to get Britain building, but we need to have a
cohesive approach, not a mad dash for growth without considering local
communities or what is actually needed. I am concerned that we are
intrinsically entwining planning and the Treasury. I want to make sure
that we are giving these matters due consideration and are not
trampling over communities, historic landscapes, and, importantly, the
green belt, but getting our infrastructure right and getting it in the
right place.</hs_Para>

want the infrastructure debate to be associated with economic benefit,
local regeneration and jobs, but never to lose sight of the
environment. The two are intrinsically linked. Local communities need
to ensure that plans are not granted in a hasty fashion just to join
the ranks of unimplemented or badly located permissions. The absence of
a joined-up approach to getting our infrastructure right and ensuring
that there are full appraisals of alternative sites for large,
private-funded proposals, such as those for rail freight interchanges,
is likely to result in a developer-led scramble to see who can get
their project through first, and it will often not end up on the best
site for the local area or for national economic growth. That can also
affect investment in other sites that may be more suitable, but which
are starved of potential investment as investors are holding fire in
case another rival site gets permission through the planning
system.</hs_Para>

obvious that large infrastructure projects can create jobs and they
should, if possible, be based in those areas where there is a need for
those jobs, while at the same time doing minimum harm to the
environment. That would be a win-win situation for
everyone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:20:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255001268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255001268">There
has been a “minded to grant” decision on a rail freight
terminal in my constituency. According to the developer of the site, it
will create more than 3,000 jobs, the vast majority of which will be
blue collar. Such a development could—I agree with the Labour
party on this—provide a considerable boost for a struggling
local area if it had the work force. It would be a shot in the arm for
an area that needed those jobs. In St Albans, 
<?notus-xml column=796?>however, we are fortunate to have an unemployment rate of just 2.5% and
the vast majority of those 1,155 people are white-collar workers. In
fact, we have a deficit of blue-collar workers. Beyond that, neither my
constituents—some of whom would be situated 100
metres from the development—nor Hertfordshire county council
want the site, we are not a regeneration area, and the site will
depress our local house prices, concrete over 10% of our green
belt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:20:58"></hs_TimeCode> and

site has had three refusals, but on the Friday before Christmas, there
was a volte-face and the “minded to grant” decision was
made. Residents were stunned, because, if we compare and contrast the
situation with that of a nearby site in Upper Sundon, just a few miles
north of St Albans, we will see—this may be coincidental
—that it has all the supposed national benefits that I believe
we should be looking for and none of the drawbacks, or very few of
them. The site is located in an old quarry—it is not on the
green belt—and a ready, accessible work force, who would not
need to travel in an unsustainable fashion, want it. It is also on the

we are going to allow the development of much-needed housing, we should
also look at why we have 142,000 unimplemented planning permissions
that have already been granted. Across England, the figure is up to
400,000. Our priority should be to look at what has already been
granted and ask why it was not built in the first place or why it was
not built according to the planning permission that was granted to it,
as in the case of Alconbury. If we do not make sure that infrastructure
is correctly located, future generations will judge whether we had

infrastructure developments and large housing developments, that have
not come to fruition. We must not just speed up the planning process

clear-sighted strategic decision-making process that was more
“steady as she goes” would give investors confidence that
they would not end up with permissions granted but never see the
developments delivered properly in the way that was envisaged. If
people want to get involved in strategic rail, there are many spin-offs
such as people working on the site and promises of additional
infrastructure upgrades to support the development. However, all those
things fail if the developer never puts a spade in the ground and does
not deliver the site as it was envisaged. All the potential jobs that
are linked to such planning permissions never actually
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021255001283" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021255001283">That
has happened under previous Governments, and not only the last
Government. However, the Opposition are now arguing that we should rush
through more planning permissions and accuse this Government of
dithering. I ask the Treasury to please be a bit more cautious and not
to do what the previous Government did in allowing loads of permissions
to be granted that never deliver what they should deliver. We should
consider applications slowly, cautiously and carefully to ensure that
instead of a developer pushing the area where he would like to build,
developments are built where we want them to be built and where
communities want them to be built. That would be in the best interests
of this country as a

Radlett. I hope sincerely that the “minded to grant”
decision is suddenly reversed to match the original three refusals,
because those refusals were sensible. Two of them came under the
previous Government, so I hope that Labour Members would approve of
them as well. The harm that will be done by that development certainly

Lodge Park school in my constituency under Building Schools for the
Future was cancelled—one of the Government’s first acts.
The Secretary of State for Education later apologised for his bungling
and mishandling of that, but his apology means nothing to the young
people whose education is suffering, or to the construction workers who
otherwise would have had employment in my town. It is all part of the
story of the past two years. This Government’s policies took
Britain back into recession—one of only two G20 countries to go
back into recession. The very people who counselled that Britain needed
a plan to reduce its deficit over time—the previous Government
set out a reasonable, sensible plan—are now telling the
Government that they got it wrong and reduced the deficit too quickly,
and that the plan has been hugely damaging to our economy. The
Government’s economic arguments present a false divide between
the public and private sectors. The public sector and the private
sector are intimately interconnected in my constituency, as in any
other. The Government create a false divide between the role of
Government and Government spending and prospects for growth.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Leeds West is absolutely right to press the
Government for action to get young people back to work. There are
specific projects in east Northamptonshire and Corby, such as the
Chowns Mill roundabout, investment in the A45, the Rockingham northern
orbital route, getting the Geddington road reopened again and
broadband. The previous Government promised 2 megabit broadband for
every household in my constituency by 2012, but those plans were
cancelled. We are now hoping that that might happen by 2015, but it is

expanding Heathrow, there can be no doubting the benefits of making
better use of existing and potential capacity at airports outside

would increase spare capacity to 50 million passengers per year,

we need to look at how we can make our roads better. My constituents
are pleased that the Government are investing more in local
roads through the highways maintenance block grant to councils.
Unfortunately, Labour’s record in local government highlights
the hypocrisy of the Opposition’s motion. People in Dudley
borough have benefited from £2 million of additional investment
in local road maintenance. Unfortunately, the new Labour administration
is cutting the road maintenance budget by the same amount, pound for
pound, as the additional funding from the Department for Transport.
Labour in local government has shown time and again that, as far as it
is concerned, infrastructure spending is a very low priority, but
residents know that we cannot build a strong local economy with

Minister that it was completely unfair to say that there had be no
worthwhile investment, particularly in rail, under the previous
Government. Let us look at the history of High Speed 1, the link
between the channel tunnel and London. That link was not constructed
when the channel tunnel was built, because the then Government, headed
by Baroness Thatcher, did not believe in rail investment. The French
did, and there was a high-speed link between the tunnel and Paris. The
Belgians did, and there was a high-speed link between the tunnel and
Brussels. But there was no high-speed link between the tunnel and
London because the then Conservative Government did not believe in it.

Major Government had a last-minute change of heart and began to
recognise the importance of such a link, but they could not get it
together and the scheme was in a state of financial uncertainty when
the Labour Government came into power. The Minister is a fair-minded
man, and I hope that he will recognise that High Speed 1, an important

would also like to remind the Minister about Crossrail. The scheme had
been talked about for a very long time, since the mists of antiquity,
but it was the Major Government who introduced a Bill to enable it to
be built. However, rather characteristically of them, their political
management in this place was so poor that they entrusted the project to
a hybrid Bill Committee, which rejected it. So the Bill never
progressed, the infrastructure was not built and, once again, it was
left to the Labour Government to introduce the Crossrail scheme, to
take the Bill through Parliament and to begin the work.</hs_Para>

know very well that Infrastructure UK was set up by the previous
Government, and that all the preparatory work for the national
infrastructure plan was done under that Government. That is why his
Government were able to publish the national infrastructure plan in
October 2010. If he thinks about it, he will realise that it would have
been completely impossible to put together and publish the plan within
four months or so of his party coming into government.</hs_Para>

should also like to focus on the ambivalence that exists in relation to
whether housing constitutes infrastructure. The national infrastructure
plan does not define housing as infrastructure, but the Government have
made provision in their Infrastructure (Financial Assistance) Act 2012
for £10 billion of support for investment in housing schemes. I
would be interested to hear the Minister’s view on whether
infrastructure should be defined so as to embrace housing and, if so,
how quickly he thinks housing might benefit from that Act.</hs_Para>

summer, Lord Sassoon, who was then the responsible Minister, talked
about £40 billion-worth of schemes that were shovel
ready—all ready to go—in the autumn. We are now well past
the autumn and to the best of my knowledge not a single housing scheme
has been given the go-ahead. Indeed, we have got to the point only of
defining the criteria by which schemes may be assessed. This does not
look like speedy progress. I would welcome some clarity from the
Minister on when he expects that financial support mechanism to have
any impact in the housing sector, which is facing a terrible problem of
undersupply.</hs_Para>

personally believe that it is impossible to consider infrastructure

and all the other things essential for economic development.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:55:43"></hs_TimeCode> would
therefore include provision for housing within infrastructure
development. I would do so particularly at the moment because the
output of housing is appalling. In the last 12 months, only 98,000
housing starts were made. I put it to the Minister, who was critical of
the previous Government’s failure in this respect, that if he
goes back to 2007—the last year before the recession
hit—we started 185,000 homes. If his Government get anywhere
near the level of output of the previous Government, they will be doing
very well. They are not there at the moment; they need to go very much
further and rather faster than they have. I hope they will think about
how this scheme can be used to stimulate housing
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:56:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021273000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021273000069">The
one other area I want to touch on is aviation. The Minister was
interestingly coy about aviation. We know perfectly well—we are
constantly reminded of it, not least by the Mayor of London, who I
believe is of the same party as the right hon. Gentleman—that
there is a chronic problem of undercapacity for aviation in London and
the south-east, and an urgent need for new investment. There are and
will be differences about where we believe this increase in capacity
should be located. I believe that the Thames estuary is the right
location and I have advocated that for a long time—I am with the
Mayor on that. Other people believe that Heathrow should be expanded,
while others believe Stansted is the right location. But no one who has
looked at this seriously believes that we do not need to expand
capacity. What have the Government done? Kicked it into touch until
after the next general election. That is simply not an adequate
response. I put it to the Minister that the Government will have to be
more serious and should approach this issue on a more cross-party basis

all the way to Wigan, the link that will go almost as far as York, and
the link that will allow trains to come on from Crewe. All those will
provide huge benefits for Newcastle, Liverpool and Scotland, which, as

Stansted, because it has one runway which is only half used. It has the

kick-starting the construction industry? I would expect the Liberal

the end of plans for Chesterfield high school to be integrated with

halted the roll-out of broadband in England. The Labour Government had

widely as possible, but what the Government are doing by failing to
invest in broadband disadvantages rural communities in particular. That
is extraordinary in view of the fact that both coalition parties claim
to represent the countryside; neither is doing so effectively. By
breaking up the large areas on which we were letting the contracts for
broadband and instead adopting a policy of fragmentation by local
authority area, this Government made it uneconomic for many providers
to bid for the contracts; consequently, they have produced a market in
which there is almost no competition. Clearly the slogan is,

economy. They put some of that spending into housing, particularly
affordable housing. As a result, for a brief period, they were able to
increase the proportion of spending on affordable

Gilmore:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend makes an important point.
The spending in Scotland enabled the Scottish Government to announce
that unemployment was not rising as fast as in the rest of the UK, and
they took great pleasure in that. Sadly, the situation has not been
maintained, and we are hearing less of how wonderful the Scottish
Government are at dealing with unemployment; at present, the opposite
is happening. I would argue that one of the reasons is that the
investment in infrastructure, particularly in housing, has not been
sustained. The figures are stark. In Scotland, there were 7,915 new
affordable housing starts in 2009-10; in 2010-11, the figure fell
slightly to 6,460; and in 2011-12, it fell to 3,405—a halving in
less than two
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021273000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0003.htm#13021273000122">There
is a consequence for the construction industry, its employees and
unemployment in Scotland. The Scottish Government showed that such
investment worked, but they have not been able to sustain it. They
would probably argue that that is solely because of what has been
happening at the UK level—investment in housing and in capital
has been falling. They would be right to some extent, although I would
add that they are not particularly interested in showing that the
situation can be overcome. I suggest two ways in which they could
overcome it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021273000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0004.htm#13021273000123">First, the
Scottish Government could use the tax-raising powers given in 1999 as
part of devolution. They have not chosen to use those, although I think
people in Scotland would be prepared for them to be used if they
thought that the money could be invested as it was previously. They
have also put a stranglehold on local government by having a five-year
council tax freeze, 
<?notus-xml column=816?>which has meant that local government cannot make the choice to say to
its local population, “We desperately need more housing. We will
put up council tax so that we can borrow”—that is
perfectly possible—“and build that much-needed
housing.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021273000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0004.htm#13021273000124">So
there are ways in which the Scottish Government could continue with
policies that for a brief period showed that investment in
infrastructure boosts the economy and employment. I urge them to go
back to doing that, rather than allowing things to deteriorate so that
they can always blame London; that, I am afraid, is what they tend to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021273000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0004.htm#13021273000125">Some
of the discussion is fascinating. If someone had fallen asleep in 1997
and woken up watching this debate, they would have wondered which party
was talking. Government Members want to argue, “The last
Government didn’t do anything on infrastructure and when they
did, it was all this horrible PFI.” I seem to recall that PFI
was not a Labour Government invention, but was enthusiastically put
forward by the preceding Conservative Government. I am interested to
know when that conversion happened. We can get that sort of investment
better, but my city is a lot better for some of the public-private
partnerships that we put in place—the schools that were built
and the investment that was taking
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021273000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0004.htm#13021273000126">A
lot of things seem to happen in Scotland first these days, which are
then followed, not always for the better, here. In 2007 a Scottish
Government of a nationalist persuasion took over, and in my city a Lib
Dem-Scottish National party council took over. They both decided that
they did not like public-private partnerships and so would instead come
up with some magic way of creating these investments. As a result, not
one new school was started in the five years of that Lib
Dem-SNP administration—not one. Several were
finished, and councillors were very pleased to go and open them and
have their name put on the opening plaque, but those schools had been
planned and funded through PPPs.

Many accusations were made by Opposition Members. They said that, had
they won the election, they would have miraculously invested more. The
reality is that, had they won the election, they would have continued
borrowing recklessly, which would have led to much higher interest
rates. They would probably have led this country into the hands of the

this House notes that the previous administration’s final Budget
planned to cut capital investment by 6 per cent more than this
Government’s latest plans, in the period 2010 to 2014; further
notes that this Government has increased capital plans by
£20 billion 
<?notus-xml column=827?>at the Spending Review and at the last two Autumn Statements, by taking
tough but necessary decisions to cut current spending, with a result
that public investment as a share of GDP will be higher on average over
this Parliament than it was under the previous administration; further
notes that this Government announced £5.5 billion of extra
infrastructure investment in the last Autumn Statement, including
£1.5 billion for roads, £1 billion for new schools,
£900 million for science and £1.8 billion for housing and
local infrastructure; further notes that it has supported the largest
investment in the railways since Victorian times under the High Level
Output Specification; further notes that no national infrastructure
plan existed under the previous administration whereas this Government
has set out for the first time a multi-year long-term strategy for the
UK’s infrastructure, with over 50 per cent of the
Government’s top 40 projects and programmes due to be in
construction, procurement or completed by the end of 2014-15; and
believes that sweeping away red tape and developing new finance
initiatives such as the UK Guarantees Scheme will also support up to
£40 billion of extra important
projects.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T18:57:48"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_2BusinessWODebate UID="13021273000001" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0004.htm#13021273000001">Business

would like to thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing time for
today’s debate on common agricultural policy reform. It is
important that the House is able to discuss these issues that will
affect farmers across England and Wales—and Scotland, Northern
Ireland and, indeed, the whole of Europe—for the seven years

2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021273000744" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0004.htm#13021273000744">Last
week’s deal to reduce the overall EU budget by €58
billion will have a considerable impact on the direct payments to
farmers and on the rural development budget that makes up the common
agricultural policy, now said to be worth €373 billion over
seven years. The funding for the CAP will be in the region of 13% less
than the 2007 to 2013 deal. Relative reductions will be made to direct
payments, falling from €283 billion to €277 billion, with
rural development reduced from €91 billion to
€85 billion. While I am pleased that the deal has
been agreed on the €908 billion budget, it is important that
these cuts are applied equally across the EU.</hs_Para>

and farming representatives such as the National Farmers Union believe
that these reforms are an excellent opportunity to simplify, reduce and
eliminate competitive distortions within the common market, to continue
the process towards market orientation and to encourage farmers to
become more competitive. I must emphasise once again that these
reductions should be equal across the single market or else distortions
will disadvantage UK farmers. It is pleasing to hear that the capping
proposal to limit direct payments to larger farms will be used on a
voluntary member state basis.</hs_Para>

issues need to be addressed. Under the current agreement, England and
Wales—and, indeed, Scotland and Northern Ireland—receive
less direct payment support than our main competitors in western

the Netherlands needs to be narrowed, or at most kept at current
levels, especially if the situation is made more difficult by
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs proposals to remove
up to 20% of the direct payment that farmers now receive, especially at

Does he agree that the issue is not so much about a reduction in the
level of support as about securing a level playing field, particularly
in respect of the greening policy? On a number of issues, British
farmers might well be seriously disadvantaged as compared with their
European competitors unless we get that level playing field. That must
underpin what we do.</hs_Para>

greening measures on the regions was also raised with me by the FUW.
Greening accounts for 30% of direct payments. Analysis by the
Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board suggests that Wales,
Scotland and northern England would be worst hit by the European
Commission’s crop rotation greening proposals. That impact is
likely to be due to the particular climatic and topographical
challenges faced by farmers in those areas, which, as the Minister will
know, are limited in terms of what arable crops can be grown in them,
and are therefore at an instant disadvantage in relation to other
regions. There is a fear that the greening measures will be perceived
as too prescriptive and therefore unhelpful.</hs_Para>

difficult to ensure that the greening measures that generate 30% of
direct payments will have an equal impact in countries whose climates
and agricultural systems vary as much as Finland and Malta. I fear that
DEFRA wants to impose one form of greening on English farmers, namely
the ELS-light approach in pillar one. It is one thing to say that a
farmer who participates in the entry level stewardship scheme should be
exempt from greening, and another to say that the only way in which he
can receive his greening payment is to participate in the scheme. We
see DEFRA’s approach as an interesting addition to the
Commission’s proposals, but only as an accompaniment, not as a
replacement. Forcing farmers in England to take part in ELS management
measures when, say, Scottish, Irish or French farmers have access to
choice and the various “green by definition” derogations

for our wider environmental responsibilities. I also believe that our
rural programmes are of enormous value and want to ensure that they are

the distribution per farm and the distribution per hectare. Scotland
has a distorting factor, because there are very large holdings that are
“lightly farmed”; these holdings sometimes fall within a
definition that I know the Scottish Minister is keen to look at to see
whether they are actively farmed at all. There are specific issues to
address there.</hs_Para>

spent the past two days in Scotland talking to Scottish farmers and to

carefully, for instance on the issue relating to the highlands, the
definition of permanent pasture and how heather is treated. We have now
secured a workable definition, which includes heather. That is
important for Scotland and for Scottish agriculture, and it was secured
by the negotiations in which we took part. I assure hon. Members from

us examine some of the other issues. The first is greening, on which we
still have a lot to negotiate. The one thing that all member states
were agreed on was that Commissioner Ciolos’s initial thoughts
were not the answer. They were far too prescriptive and far too
inappropriate in many areas. They displayed a lack of recognition that
hugely different farming procedures are used, even in various parts of
this country, let alone in the wider European family. What we want is a
continued orientation of the CAP towards rewarding farmers for the
public goods they deliver, which includes environmental benefits and
protecting and enhancing wildlife, but not in a form that is
over-bureaucratic and over-demanding in implementation, which may
result in a tick-box mentality that does not help the environment and
certainly does not help farming.</hs_Para>

believe that some of the proposals simply do not represent good value,
whereas some of our existing agri-environmental schemes do. I hope
everyone agrees that what we need is flexibility to allow local
definition of environmental benefits and schemes that do not force
people into inappropriate farming practices. I am hopeful that we will
secure that degree of flexibility, but we should not take it for
granted. The other thing we do not want is duplication, so that people
are paid twice for doing precisely the same thing. There is a risk that
the outcome of some of the European Parliament proposals will be
farmers being paid once under pillar two and once under pillar one for
doing exactly what they are doing now. I doubt our taxpayers would
thank us for that. It is important that we reach a successful
outcome<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021273000784" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/debtext/130212-0004.htm#13021273000784">My<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

concerns in relation to intervention in the market have been well
rehearsed. We have been clear over the years about our desire to reduce
the reliance on trade-distorting measures and the importance of the CAP
sticking to that path of reform. That is where we part company with the
European Parliament Agriculture Committee, because many of the
amendments voted through there would move us backwards, away from
market orientation, and increase budget pressures for old-style market
support. There is a place for recognition of the need to support some
farmers, especially hill farmers and those in less-favoured areas. I
stress that and argue in favour of doing that, but when it comes to
providing subsidy for European farmers to start growing tobacco again
and get taxpayers’ money to do so, I draw the line, because that
is clearly not in the interest of taxpayers or of the

right solutions for our farmers. At one point, my hon. Friend praised
high-level agri-environmental schemes, and we want those to continue.
We may need that flexibility to ensure that we can achieve that within
our pillar two framework, but at the same time I want the level playing
field with other countries that he seeks, so that they do some of the
same things that we do, and do well, in their domestic agriculture. I
am not convinced that they are doing that yet. The thrust of our
argument is: yes, we want public money to support public good, but we
do not want public money to support distortions of trade and
agricultural production which result in a regression across the
EU.</hs_Para>

am clear that to achieve that we need flexibility not only in
definitions, but in being able to move cash

period of transition—it would be disastrous for British
agriculture were we to move too fast and in too rigid a way to a
solution that is not appropriate for many of our farmers. We need to
make sure that the implementation period is sufficiently long to allow
an orderly transition, so that we do not repeat the chaos of 2005 with
the Rural Payments Agency—I am determined that we will not do
that again. Most of all, we need to listen to what our agriculture
industry needs, relate that to what our taxpayer needs in value for
money, and make sure that we have prosperous and sustainable
agriculture right across the UK in the future. That is what we are
trying to achieve from CAP reform, and I believe it is possible to do
so, but I do not underestimate the difficulties in reaching a

recognise how difficult it is to strike a balance between energy prices
to consumers and to industry. It could be argued that logically, the
more energy one buys the more cheaply one should get it; that would
have a knock-on effect on our consumers and constituents. It is
difficult to strike that balance and ensure that energy-consuming

comes down to energy security as well as price. Within the east
midlands, the Trent valley provides a lot of electricity generation, so
at least we are not far away from a power station, but we need to do
more. The Government particularly need to consider carbon leakage.
Energy-intensive industries are under pressure and looking to relocate
elsewhere in the world. We talk about reducing the carbon footprint of
industry and manufacturing, but it would be wrong to push out
industries to other parts of the world where energy is probably bought
from higher-carbon sources than in the UK, and then to import the
goods. We should be aware of that.</hs_Para>

Governments. Had we bitten that bullet much earlier, we would not be as
concerned about energy security as we are today. I am glad to see that

pursuing. I also think coal has a role to play. Sherwood sits not only
on a former coal field but on great reserves of shale gas, which could
assist us. We also have a great deal of water, which can be important
to manufacturing. Nottinghamshire sits on Bunter sandstone with
aquifers. However, at the top of the list must be a willing and ready
work force, which we in the east midlands have. We have great skills.

congratulate the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer) on
securing today’s debate and on giving us the opportunity to
highlight the strengths of, and the challenges faced by, the

employs a higher proportion of people than in any other region: within
the D2N2 local enterprise partnership, covering Nottingham,
Nottinghamshire, Derby and Derbyshire, 16.7% of full-time jobs were in
manufacturing, compared to 14.5% in the east midlands and 10.5% in the

employment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000053">The
largest manufacturing subsectors in the D2N2 economy are transport
equipment, metals and food and drink. I will say a bit more about the
local firms involved and their needs shortly. In the 19th century,
Nottingham was at the centre of the world’s lace industry, a
legacy that recently once again received national attention when it was
featured in Mary Portas’ “Mary’s Bottom
Line” programme. Sadly, there are no lace manufacturers left in
the
city.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000054">During
the 19th century, world-famous names were founded in the city, some of
which have been mentioned already, including Boots the Chemist, the
Raleigh Bicycle Company, and John Player and Sons. I cannot resist
mentioning Frederick Gibson Garton, who recorded his secret recipe for
HP Sauce in the Meadows in my constituency in
1894.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000055">Life
in those industries was immortalised by local writers, including D.H.
Lawrence and Alan Sillitoe. Although we do not make bicycles in Radford
now, the Saturday nights and Sunday mornings of Arthur Seaton are still
familiar to the city. Thousands of visitors come to Nottingham every
weekend for a great night out in our purple-flag city centre. That
shows that it is not just the manufacturing industries that are
important; there is knock-on for the other industries in the
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000056">In
the 21st century, Nottingham faces both opportunities and challenges.
Government policy has led to the loss of some 53,000 public sector jobs
in the east midlands. With three in 10 people in Nottingham city
employed in public service, we must diversify if we are to become more
resilient and avoid the damage wrought by high unemployment and a lack
of opportunities for our young and growing
population.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000057">“The
Nottingham Growth Plan”, published in 2012, aims to reconnect
the city with its proud history and create a manufacturing renaissance,
rebuilding our international reputation as a place that designs and
makes things. Some of the elements needed for that renaissance are
already in place. We are fortunate to have two universities that
produce world-class research and a highly educated work force, and we
already have highly successful companies and emerging sectors in areas
such as digital content, life sciences and clean technology, which can
provide prosperity and sustainable employment if we give them the right
support as set out in that plan.</hs_Para>

city’s new growth sectors is digital content—a far cry
from the grease and noise of the Raleigh factory, perhaps, but it
already employs 6,400 people. That sector offers huge opportunities for
growth. The games developer, Crytek, located on Canal street in the
heart of my city, employs almost 100 people in the lucrative video
games market. Many smaller gaming industry companies are locating in

stood to gain from Labour’s tax break for video games
developers, but the incoming Government scrapped it in 2010, only to
reconfirm it two years later, by which time the UK’s advantage

in Nottingham’s creative quarter is BioCity, the UK’s
leading bioscience incubator, established 10 years ago as a joint
initiative between Nottingham’s two universities and the
regional development agency. BioCity builds on Nottingham’s
long-standing expertise in biosciences. It is on the site where
ibuprofen was discovered by Dr Stewart Adams in the 1960s, and provides
lab accommodation, facilities, expertise and access to finance. It
currently sustains more than 80 fast-growing
businesses —biotech, pharmaceutical and health care
start-ups—and is looking to expand further to meet demand. The

£105 million for the north-east and £88
million for the north-west. That put it in a worse position than before
the scrapping of our regional development agency; we were allocated
8.9% of total regional funding in the RDA’s last three

represent the High Peak which, to many of my constituents, does not
necessarily feel part of the east midlands. We are the most northerly
constituency, and much of the High Peak looks to the north-west: we
have north-west postcodes and north-west television, and many of my
constituents travel to the north-west to work and shop and for their
recreational needs. Another part of the High Peak faces east, and the
Hope valley gravitates towards Sheffield, parts of it receiving their
media from the Yorkshire region. Forgive the geography lesson, Mr
Hollobone, but I want to get over that the High Peak, far from being
remote and miles from anywhere, as people sometimes think we are, is
not only in the east midlands but is very much the cockpit of the north
of England. Ideally situated between the cities of Manchester and
Sheffield—live 24 miles from either city—we are in
striking distance of many other cities, including Leeds, Doncaster,
Barnsley and Liverpool. Consequently, a huge variety of manufacturing
businesses have grown up in the High Peak over many years. I want to
talk about one or two of them, to stress how the High Peak as part of
the east midlands is ideally placed for
manufacturing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000066">We
have many household names. Many people watching the Formula 1 Grand
Prix will have seen the name Ferodo, manufacturers of brake linings.
Ferodo was founded in 1897 by Herbert Frood in Chapel-en-le-Frith, in
my constituency. Those brake linings are still produced there, in the
east midlands, to this very day. Some of the manufacturing was
outsourced abroad, but it is now coming back into the High Peak because
we are doing such a good job. Despite Ferodo being acquired a couple of
times since the name came out, anyone coming off the roundabout and
going towards the factory will see the name “Ferodo”
still proudly emblazoned on the front of the factory. I should probably
declare an interest at this point, because I supplied that illuminated
sign in a previous life, when I had my own business. The sign, which
has been there for many years, is still working, which is testament to
the quality of the goods that I supplied in my heyday—I am not

Bastion and saw two huge overhead cranes with “Street

company is Otter Controls. We all use and see many of the goods
manufactured in the High Peak, but we are not necessarily aware of
them. This morning, many of us put our kettle on, and there is a good
chance that the thermostat in it was manufactured by Otter Controls.
The company was founded at the end of the war to manufacture snap
action thermostats that—to get technical—are used in a
three-legged bi-metal blade. Those who did science at school should
remember the bi-metal strip and how it moves with heat. The concept
behind the switch was developed when the founder of Otter’s
experimented with the strips for heated suits for RAF pilots during the
war, because the pilots got either very cold or very hot in their
aircraft. Having come up with the idea of the thermostat in the suit,
after the war he decided to roll it out into other areas. The company
was all about making people a little ’otter—that is where
the name Otter came from. This is a High Peak product that people use

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000069">Valentine’s

throughout the world, also manufacturing in the High Peak. Many years
ago, on holiday abroad, sitting in a little wooden hut having a cup of
coffee with a friend of mine with some children, the guy behind him

want to repeat some of the points made about the importance of
manufacturing to the east midlands economy. Manufacturing makes up a
greater part of the economy in the east midlands than in any other
English region. According to figures I have seen, manufacturing gross
value added was around £12.5 billion, or 15.8% of total regional
GVA output—a higher proportion than any other
region—compared with an average of 10.3% for the UK as a whole.
Manufacturing employment in the region amounted to 265,000 or more than
13% of total employment—again, the highest proportion of any
region, and it compares with a UK average of about 8.5%. Our
manufacturing firms score highly on productivity, with many of our
sectors outperforming national averages. We have already heard not only
about many of the big ones, such as Toyota, Rolls-Royce, Bombardier,
Caterpillar and Walkers, but about the many smaller manufacturers that
make up our huge manufacturing
base.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000077">The
hon. Gentleman talked about food and drink. In Leicester and
Leicestershire, more than 11,000 people are employed in food
manufacturing, so it is important for our region. As he said, some of
the reasons our region does well is that we are central, our
development in the past has been driven by coal in the north and
ironstone in the south, and we have concentrations of grade 1
agricultural land. We do not have any major, dominant economic centre.
I would, of course, argue that Leicester is the premier city in the

that, although the Prime Minister came with his whole Cabinet to Derby
in March 2011 to make the point about the importance of rebalancing the
economy towards manufacturing, three months later a decision was taken
to appoint Siemens as a preferred bidder for the Thameslink rolling
stock programme? Will he join me in calling on the Government and the
Minister, even at this late stage, to think again about that decision?
If they cannot reverse it, can they at least ensure that, whenever
Government contracts are concerned, notwithstanding EU procurement
rules and so on, they take appropriate steps to ensure that British
manufacturing has a fair chance of winning
them?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000085"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jonathan Ashworth" PimsId="5971" UID="13021244000248" xid="5971" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000248">Jonathan
Ashworth:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend; he is absolutely right.
I want pay tribute to the work that he has done on Bombardier. The
Bombardier decision was tragic not only for Derby and Derbyshire, but
for manufacturing in the east midlands. The whole supply chain was

trade and increasing exports are an important part of the rebalancing
of the economy that we want to see, and supporting our manufacturing
base is vital to our exports. The regional growth fund is 
<?notus-xml column=207?>supposed to be part of driving that rebalancing, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood) mentioned,
yet, consistently and sadly, the east midlands has
lost out. In round 1, £450 million was allocated. The east
midlands made up 13% of the bids and won just 4% of the successful
awards. In round 2, £950 million was allocated. The east
midlands made up 11% of the bids and was given just 8% of the awards.
In round 3, over £1 billion was allocated to private sector

2%.</hs_Para>

is not good enough. Given that manufacturing is so important to the
east midlands region, and that it is the leading region in
manufacturing, why are we not getting a fair deal on the regional
growth fund bids? I would be grateful if the Minister said a word or
two about that. It has been suggested in the media that the quality of
our bids was not good enough. I do not accept that, given the strength
of our manufacturing base. To be honest, it is a bit of an insult to
our manufacturers.</hs_Para>

the Minister shed some light on why the east midlands has done so
badly? Some have suggested that the reason is that a lot of the bids
have focused on the cities. The Department for Communities and Local
Government has been keen to focus growth through the core cities
initiative. For example, 47% of round 2 of the regional growth fund
money went to core cities. Leicester, of course, went along with the
great vision of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government and the Prime Minister. We went for the directly elected
mayor model; not many places did. Although we are now in discussions
about a core city deal, we were left out in the first round, although
parts of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire have been covered by a city
deal. That has meant that the majority of the east midlands region has
been left out. Perhaps that is another reason why we have not done so
well at getting our fair share of regional growth fund
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000090">We
no longer have a regional development agency, and I do not think that
my party is arguing for its return. There may be such an argument, but
everyone accepts that the development agencies have gone, and it is not
our policy to argue for their return. Given that the east midlands
region has 36 local authority districts, five county councils and four
unitary authorities, that fragmentation leads to a lack of a consistent
voice on such matters. I do not necessarily know the solution, but we
should all be banging the drum as a group of east midlands MPs. We must
think about what more we can do collectively to ensure that our region
gets its fair share of
bids.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000091">I
am conscious that I am taking a lot of time. I want to say a couple of
things quickly about Leicester. It is a city with a strong
manufacturing base and deep links, as everyone will know, with India,
Bangladesh, east Africa and Pakistan. In Leicester, we have
manufacturers exporting to those parts of the world. Asian food made in
Leicester is exported to the middle east, Europe and India. When 
<?notus-xml column=208?>I meet exporters, they tell me of the difficulties of accessing export
finance, especially for smaller volume exporters. When people raise
UKTI issues with me, they talk about the fees involved in the overseas
market introduction service. One matter is always being raised with me:
given that cities such as Leicester have communities with deep cultural
ties to parts of the world where we now want to export more, should the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills not be doing more to
work with organisations such as Leicester’s Indo-British trade
council and other groups to leverage the expertise of those
communities?</hs_Para>

want to mention our higher education sector. De Montfort and Leicester
universities do great work linking with local manufacturers. There are
lots of great examples of how they are adding value to many firms and
supporting our manufacturing base. Most of those projects, however, do
not lead to any financial benefits to the universities. Given the
importance of such projects to our economic future, will the Minister
think about financial incentives to support the HE sector to link up
more with manufacturers? I know that De Montfort university, having
done a lot of projects in the past, is now thinking of scaling back, as
such work is not in its financial interests.</hs_Para>

the HE sector is so important to our economy and exports—worth
£15 billion nationally—will the Minister, who was brought
in with great fanfare and was going to shake things up, deal with the
crazy policy of the immigration cap on student numbers, which is doing
huge damage to our economy? We need to support our HE sector at the

pioneering a bi-local campaign whereby local companies can register,
and not only will the local authority look to procure from local firms
offering services, but that website facility is then open to other
companies in the district, and it is hoped that they will join in.
However, I bring the hon. Gentleman back to the point that we cannot
have the situation we inherited, where 50% of the economy is public
sector and 50% is private sector, and we are asking the latter to
support itself and pay taxes to support the former. That is
unsustainable. That is why we have a huge deficit and why we need to

I will not allow him or any other Labour Member to rewrite history. The
fact is that under the previous Labour Government, manufacturing as a
proportion of GDP in this country fell by 50%. It is not a record that

encouraging signal for the sustainability and growth of east midlands
manufacturing is the fact that the latest figures from Her

the future once and it is still a very sizable chunk of the market, but

goods, both in the UK and throughout the world. East Midlands airport,
which is located in my constituency, is the largest dedicated
cargo-handling airport in the UK, currently handling over 310,000
tonnes of flown cargo every year, with ample room to grow. The airport
is another advantage for our exporting manufacturers. Together with the
proposed strategic rail freight interchange, which will get more
freight off the road and on to rail—if HS2 does not run straight
through the middle of it—that again illustrates the advantages
and opportunities for manufacturers in the east midlands. It is worth
pointing out that the strategic rail freight interchange will involve
£500 million of private sector investment in my constituency,

the east midlands is leading the way in manufacturing growth in the UK,

manufacturing entrepreneur and well known in the east midlands at the

colleges. In Erewash, we face the prospect of two schools merging in
Ilkeston. In my view, to continue the site with an educational use, a
UTC would be an ideal project. That project is in its infancy, but I
will be doing all I can to encourage the site to become a UTC in the
near future. With national apprenticeship week fast approaching, I
think we are all spending time—I certainly am—visiting
many businesses that take on apprenticeships in our manufacturing areas

course Derbyshire, as Members will be pleased to know. I certainly
spent a happy morning learning the art of brewing—trying not to

not only one of the world’s leading car manufacturers; as a
leader, it is committed to the environment and the economy. In fact,
Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK was the first British car manufacturer to
achieve zero waste going to landfill and has recently embraced solar
energy at the plant, too. On top of that prodigious achievement, Toyota
has provided employment and training opportunities for people
throughout the region. On a recent visit to the factory in Burnaston, I
was delighted to hear that Toyota is expanding its apprenticeship
programme. Toyota also has a charitable trust. That funds the Lucy

from Rolls-Royce and Toyota, which respectively focus on jet engines
and cars, Bombardier is a world-renowned manufacturer of rail vehicles.
In fact, including Bombardier, there are 230 rail engineering companies

successful, and if there is an equivalent in the UK, I suggest that it
is in the east midlands. Mid-sized firms employ 290,000 people in the
region. I agree with the conclusion in Grant Thornton’s report

have a number of questions for the Minister. My first is on how
Government procurement can help manufacturers and their supply chains.
I am pleased to see my hon. Friend the Member for Derby North here,
because he has been a strong champion of Bombardier. We are all aware
of it, because it is probably the most vivid example of Government
procurement policy failing British manufacturing. The Department for
Transport looks specifically at price, rather than thinking about wider
value to the supply chain; that illustrates that the Government do not
seem to be joined up. What has the Minister learned from the Bombardier
example? How can procurement back British manufacturing? I do not
believe in protectionism at all, but we can have patriotism in
procurement policy to create, as my hon. Friend the Member for Derby
North said, a level playing field for British companies. Other nations
do it; we should too.</hs_Para>

If Bombardier or any other company fails to win a contract, we should
consider the wider economic consequences, in terms of lost taxes, the
money that could have been pumped into the local economy and the losses
in the supply chain. Those important factors should be part of
procurement decisions.</hs_Para>

point I want to mention relates to a particularly distinctive strength
of the east midlands economy and its manufacturing firms: the supply
chain. I am interested in it, because it is an important part of
improving competitiveness. In November last year, the Minister

are now on round 2. Despite the importance of mid-sized firms in the
east midlands and their potential, will he confirm that no east

not just for UK manufacturing but for growth in the wider economy. Its
location at the geographical heart of the UK, an abundance of natural
resources, and a spirit of invention put the east midlands at the
centre of the industrial revolution. As we have heard, inventions that
have come out of the region include the jet engine, ibuprofen, DNA
fingerprinting and the MRI scanner. My hon. Friend’s
constituency has a long history of mining, and it has been home to

in this debate has been under any illusions about the scale of the
wider economic challenges we face as a country. The continuing
sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone is affecting the real economy and
depressing demand, which has caused uncertainty for British businesses

pronounced under the previous Government, which presided over the
fastest ever decline in manufacturing as a share of the economy:
manufacturing fell by nearly 10% as a share of gross domestic product,
and almost 1.7 million jobs were lost in the sector. Under this

Lumley</B> (Redditch) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr Hollobone. I thank the Minister for being here to
listen and, I hope, to answer some of my questions about the Alexandra
hospital. I pay tribute to the staff who work at the Alex. As you
mentioned and as you can see, Mr Hollobone, I visited the accident and
emergency department at the Alexandra hospital during the past couple
of weeks.  I had a good experience and was looked after well,
and I did not spend too much time there. I want my constituents to
receive what I received, and I hope to outline the need for a vibrant
hospital in Redditch that serves not only my constituents but those in
surrounding areas such as Bromsgrove, Mid Worcestershire,
Stratford-on-Avon and Kidderminster.</hs_Para>

history of the hospital is vital to understand the context in which I
speak, because, sadly, we have been here several times before. I will
be brief, but it is important to understand how many times this
hospital has been under threat, and how unsettling that is for patients
and staff alike. Three attempts have been made during the past 15 years
to downgrade the accident and emergency ward and the maternity wards at
the Alex. On each occasion, the argument has been made that the
downgrades were crucial for sustaining a high-quality, properly staffed
service, and that it would better for residents if some services were
concentrated in Worcester. At each attempt, the people of Redditch have
fought to save their hospital, and once again they have joined together
in a cross-party campaign to do so.</hs_Para>

Garnier</B> (Wyre Forest) (Con):</Member> I congratulate my hon. Friend
on securing the debate, which affects my constituents as well as hers.
She will be aware that a number of years ago, the same fear was in
prospect for my constituents when the A and E department at
Kidderminster hospital was closed. The outcome was truly tremendous,
with an enormous campaign to save the hospital and the election of an
MP dedicated to trying to do so. Sadly, he did not succeed, but those
events reinforce the point that people feel very strongly about their
local services and should be listened to.</hs_Para>

campaign, Ian Dipple, the editor of the <I>Redditch Standard</I>, and
the leaders of my local councils, Bill Hartnett, Roger Hollingworth and
Chris Saint, who have all worked tirelessly together with me to save
the Alex. The Minister will remember his visit from members of the
“save the Alex” campaign before Christmas, when he
listened to the justification for retaining services at our hospital. A
petition to save the hospital has received more than 50,000 signatures
and there was a  
<?notus-xml column=222?>major rally in Redditch town centre, all of which goes to show that the
residents of Redditch are united in trying to secure services at our
hospital.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000187">I
want to look now at the current and historical financial position of
the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. In 2002, the trust posted
large deficits, which rose to more than £14 million in 2003-04.
The trust came back into surplus, however, and since then it has posted
alternate deficits and surpluses, including in each of the past three
years. The trust had a cumulative legacy debt of £18.4 million
from 2000 to 2007. The Government provided a £12 million
emergency loan in December 2012 to deal with the problem, but it is
obvious that the situation cannot continue. For too long, the easiest
course of action has been to kick the can further down the road without
addressing the root causes. The current situation is a ticking time
bomb. A £1.9 million deficit has to be met by April of this
year. Many operations are being cancelled because of the terrible
norovirus in our wards, and times will be tough for the
trust.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021244000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000188">Part of the
problem is that we have an expensive private finance initiative
hospital that was built in the wrong place fully to service all of the
residents of Worcestershire. The Worcestershire royal hospital opened
in March 2002 under a PFI deal that costs the trust £13.6
million a year at the best estimate. Indeed, Patricia Hewitt, the
former Health Secretary, described the PFI deal as a disaster in 2006.
The deal will, however, run until 2032, by which time it will have cost
the taxpayer more than £700 million. The Alexandra hospital is
not a PFI hospital; it is owned by the NHS.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021244000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000189">I understand
that the trust needs to save money, and that certain services in our
country must be centralised to provide centres of excellence. I also
understand the difficulties of recruiting specialist consultants, and I
realise that as a result of an ageing population and changing
lifestyles, patients have more complex needs. We must recognise,
however, that the trust employs more than 5,600 staff across the county
and has approximately 940 beds with 140,000 A and E
attendances —of which I was one—and about 500,000
out-patient appointments. The people of Redditch deserve a sustainable
future for their health service. They are realistic, but they need to
know what is going to happen. One of the reasons for the difficulty I
have just mentioned of recruiting specialist consultants, which is a
major problem facing the trust, is that the hospital cannot provide the
job security that specialist consultants need because it is constantly
under
threat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021244000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021244000190">As
I have said, this is the third time we have been in this situation, and
if we do not find a solution, I have no doubt that in a few years we
will be here again. Repeatedly experiencing such circumstances is
damaging to the public, staff and patients, and we need a lasting
solution. I welcome our Government’s introduction of clinical
commissioning groups. I recognise that without them we would be in a
very different place and I certainly would not be standing here asking
the Minister to look at the future of my hospital. I have been working
closely with the local commissioning group for Redditch and Bromsgrove,
and would like to place on record its hard work on the future of the
Alex, especially its support on the joint services review; it has
continually stood up for Redditch in circumstances that have often been
difficult.</hs_Para>

others in the community, we love our local hospitals and we always want
to stand up for them, but we have to be careful to look at the results

is not.”—[<I>Official Report</I>, 6 February 2013; Vol.

that to heart, as I know many of my colleagues did. I know that the NHS

me to some good news about innovative thinking that is going on in our
town. Redditch is situated in the north of our county and the majority
of my constituents look to Birmingham rather than Worcester. The
Minister cannot be expected to know about transport links in our
county, but the links between Redditch and Worcester are fairly
dreadful. If someone has to go to Worcester by train, they get on a
train to Birmingham, get off at the university stop—where the
university hospital of Birmingham is—and double back to
Worcester. Buses are also a nightmare and often involve two or three
changes. I was delighted to meet Dame Julie Moore, the chief executive
of the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, before
Christmas to talk about the trust providing some services at the Alex.
I look forward to meeting her again next week, and to meeting Penny
Venables, the chief executive of the Worcestershire
trust.</hs_Para>

understand that as we look at the options for the future of the
hospital services in Worcestershire, particularly for the Alex, we must
be certain that no decisions that are taken in relation to the Alex
have the unintentional consequence of reducing the critical mass of the
health economy in the wider county and, therefore, damaging the service
provided to my constituents and to those of my hon. Friends the Members
for Worcester (Mr Walker) and for West Worcestershire (Harriett

We look forward to welcoming him in April to see for himself what a
fantastic hospital we have—a hospital that we must not forget
belongs to the residents of Redditch. We are realistic about what has
to happen, but I want to put on the record today that there are two
options on the table, and it is only fair to my constituents that both
be looked at in a fair and open way. That is all we are asking for, and

for paying tribute herself to the hard-working staff at her local

the next few months, we can come to a conclusion that will not only be
of benefit to local patients but bring higher-quality care to people in

that private finance initiative deals in the local area have been
problematic and have left a very damaging legacy; that has happened not
only in her part of the world but throughout the NHS. We must learn
lessons from that in the future. It is distressing and regrettable that
bad PFI deals sometimes have an impact on neighbouring hospitals, and
it is a position that we, as a Government, have inherited. We will

Redditch, for the local trust more broadly and for the local health

Poulter:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right to praise the
high-quality work done in Worcester to look after cancer patients. It
is exactly the point that I was making in response to the intervention
from my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Worcestershire (Peter Luff): the
high-quality day-to-day services that patients need must be delivered
locally, but more specialist operations—such as for head and
neck cancer—might be carried out at a specialist site that is
geared up for such operations. Day-to-day oncology care, however, is
often best carried out locally, particularly when people are unwell
with cancer and receiving sometimes very intensive treatment. In those
situations, they need to be looked after locally.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021251000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021251000015">It does not
benefit patients, for medical and many other reasons, to have very long
distances to travel. However, when surgical outcomes might benefit from
operations being carried out at specialist centres, we 
<?notus-xml column=226?>must differentiate day-to-day treatment from the more specialist care
that may be required as a one-off surgical intervention. We should do
that when the evidence stacks up that specialist centres for such
surgical interventions often deliver better results and better care for
patients. Nevertheless, my hon. Friend is absolutely right to pay
tribute to his local trust for the work that it does on cancer care in
Worcester, which I know is very important to him personally.</hs_Para>

respond specifically to some of the points that have been made in the
debate, and consider how we go forward from where we are now. Hon.
Members, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Redditch, have made
us well aware, through their articulate contributions, of the
challenges that are faced by the local health care economy. Such
ongoing uncertainty about the future of local health care services is
wrong and completely undesirable. When local commissioners bring
forward proposals for the two options that are likely to be considered
later in the month, I urge them to move forward as promptly as possible
to bring certainty to the situation. That will allow consideration of
important issues, such as the need to have high-quality professionals
working in hospitals. When there is uncertainty about the future of a
trust or a particular site within a trust, it can be difficult, as my
hon. Friend rightly outlined, to recruit high-quality staff to work in
that trust. That is not in patients’ best interests, so the
sooner we can have certainty, the better. I know my hon. Friend will
join me in urging local commissioners to bring things forward as
expediently and quickly as possible.</hs_Para>

the trust is committed to providing the best-quality care for patients.
That is essentially about finding the best solution for the people of
Worcestershire so that they receive the best care in the future. As my
hon. Friend outlined, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust and the
West Mercia cluster have jointly commissioned a strategic review of
services in the area. The review is essential to secure the clinical
and financial sustainability of high-quality services for local people.
That is about looking not just at getting through the next couple of
years, but at what will be right for the local health economy in five
or 10 years’ time.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend’s concern that there have been delays with the
review, and I once again urge local commissioners to take things
forward as expediently and quickly as possible. The Worcestershire
joint services review started in January 2012, and it was expected to
be completed by November 2012. I hope my hon. Friend is somewhat
reassured that we will move forward more quickly, notwithstanding a
patchy history on resolving local health care issues. There is a need
for certainty locally, and we must make sure that the time line is met
and that we have a firm conclusion.</hs_Para>

the review involves clinicians and commissioners across the area and
the NHS. It engaged with local people last summer to inform the
development of proposals. As we know, developing proposals for the
future of local services is about clinical leadership and about
clinicians saying what is important and in patients’ best
interests, but it is also about local involvement and engagement. When
I met my hon. Friend before Christmas, we discussed that. The local
newspaper has played a tremendous role in promoting local
patients’ needs. My 
<?notus-xml column=227?>hon. Friend and the local population should be proud of the cross-party
consensus on the importance of Redditch’s future.</hs_Para>

voices and views clear. That is important for the Government and for

their views are informed by what local patients want and need and by

interests.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021251000021">The

NHS Foundation Trust and Birmingham Children’s Hospital NHS

important to note that, although the services the trust provides need
to be seen holistically, the ongoing discussions are about the specific
future of Alex’s site in Redditch. That is an important
distinction, and I hope it gives my hon. Friends some reassurance that
any proposals are unlikely to disrupt local services to the patients
they care about.</hs_Para>

next steps? If agreement is reached on a clinically and financially
sustainable solution in the interests of local people, a robust process

We are then likely to have two options regarding the way forward. One
is likely to involve Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust

However, the local NHS has assured me that it will continue to engage
with people while proposals are finalised. Of course, I would expect
any proposals to meet the four tests for service change that we have
clearly outlined—principally, that any changes are clinically
led and have strong patient and public engagement. The local NHS
expects final proposals to be ready for public consultation later in
the summer. However, it is vital, as we have stressed throughout the

is designated as part of a trust. It is a non-foundation trust, so
there is direct regard to the Secretary of State in some matters
relating to the trust. I hope that gives her some reassurance. Of
course, the NHS is owned by all of us, which is why it was so important
when we set out our four tests for reconfiguration that we made sure
they were about strong clinical leadership in the best interests of
patients, as well as strong patient and public engagement, so that
patients and the public can clearly see that any changes to local

delighted and dismayed in equal measure to open this debate on food
banks in Wales. I never thought, when I entered public life as a
Cardiff councillor a long time ago, in 1991, that this topic would
become a priority for discussion. I never thought I would see, in my

the people of Wales, on a scale unprecedented since the

consumer prices index figures were released today. CPI is 2.7%, which
is 1.2 percentage points above rises in income for people in work.
There is an impact on everyone, including people in work. As we know,
as VAT is a regressive tax, it has the greatest impact on those on the
lowest incomes. Also, because their marginal propensity to consume is
much higher than that of people on higher incomes, VAT is a
particularly hard tax on
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0001.htm#13021251000082">Some
90% of the food in food banks is donated, mainly by the public via
supermarkets, churches, community centres, schools and other
organisations. I pay tribute to the efforts of food banks, many of
which are run by the Trussell Trust, including the one in Ely in my
constituency, which I have visited. They are intended as a crisis
intervention for families in need. As I said in response to an

distribution centres, where food bank volunteers gather, weigh, account
for and suit the food. Food is issued only to recipients with vouchers,
and vouchers are issued by front-line service officers trained in the
assessment of need. Issuing organisations include, among others,
citizens advice bureaux, Jobcentre Plus, GP surgeries, social services,
housing officers and now, as I said earlier, Members of Parliament and,

23 food banks across Wales, nine of which opened in the last year, and
four

more than 270 food banks across the UK. In 2011, some 7,173 adults and
4,038 children in Wales used a food bank, and in 2012, the numbers rose
to 18,721 adults and 10,328 children. The trust forecasts that the

trust collates information about the people using food banks. The
consistent main reason cited for using a food bank, accounting for
between 40% and 45% of usage, is benefit changes and delays in benefit
payments. About one quarter of usage is accounted for by low-income
families, and about one tenth by debt. As we have heard, food bank
usage has exploded over the past two to three years. It is sad but
typical that the Prime Minister recently tried to suggest that food
banks expanded by a greater amount under the last Government than under
this one; that abuse of statistics was skewered by Channel 4’s

The Welfare Up-rating Bill alone will hit 400,000
low and middle-income households in Wales,
including 170,000 families in Wales who currently receive
working tax credits. It is estimated that 140,000 people in Wales will

of the highest energy bills in the UK, and more families are having to
choose between heating and eating. As I said, the VAT hike alone added
£450 a year to average household bills. Low economic growth has
created fewer opportunities, and unemployment is forecast to rise in
the next two years. Public sector job losses are forecast to reach 1
million by 2017. Meanwhile, in April, the Government will give more

to quote No. 10? On the “Politics Show” this weekend, the
Welsh Office Minister in the House of Lords, Baroness Randerson, said
that the Government are reducing the deficit in the fairest possible
way. What exactly is fair about the bedroom tax, which will hit 40,000

Morden</B> (Newport East) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate my hon. Friend
the Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan) on securing this important
debate and on his compelling contribution, in which he painted a stark
picture. As he said, the Government’s response to the increasing
despair among Opposition Members about the growth of food banks has
been to say that food banks grew under the last Labour Government, that
they are a sign of the big society, that they are somewhere for people
to go if, as the Downing street source said,</hs_Para>

thank them for the work that they do. I certainly agree with the last
part. I thank Raven House Trust and King’s Church in Newport,
which do a superb job with the little resource that they have. They are
hugely dedicated, and I thank the volunteers in local churches who
collect on their behalf. I am not sure that I know what a big society
is, but I can certainly recognise examples of the good society
operating in Newport.</hs_Para>

Friend said, we must all agree that the huge growth in food banks is
sobering and a terrible reflection on how bad things have become. Raven
House Trust, based in my constituency, became a charity in 1994,
helping Newport’s homeless with furniture and food. In December,
it gave out 850 food parcels, and this week it told me that in the last
six months of last year, it had seen a marked increase in demand due to
welfare changes, and that it is bracing itself for a dramatic increase
from April. That trend is confirmed by the Trussell Trust, which is
based in Newport and operates food banks elsewhere. It says, as my hon.
Friend said, that 40% to 45% of those who ask for help do so because of
changes to benefits and delays in benefit payments, although, as my
right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr Hain) said, many working
families on low pay are also in
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000094">Everyone
who needs a food parcel will have a different story, but it is true to
say that those in desperate need and asking for help have often been
the homeless, those with drug and alcohol problems and, in my area,
asylum seekers. That is absolutely awful, but Raven House says that,
increasingly, families with children are relying on food banks to
survive. Changes to the benefit system—which often leave people
with reduced payments while claims are processed—low pay and
rising fuel and energy bills are causing the cost of living to rise the
fastest for the poorest households.</hs_Para>

Morden:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. Yesterday, as he will
know, we heard evidence from charities working with people with mental
health issues in Wales. They said that for their clients, not being
able to do things online was a huge problem, as many clients had
difficulties opening the letters. That is a big
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000097">Recently,
food banks in my constituency have seen a marked change and desperate
need. Let us remember that families must be referred by an agency or an
advocate, such as a citizens advice bureau, social services, Newport
City Homes, Women’s Aid, and others. However, help is not
unlimited. People are expected to use the parcels to tide them over and
get back on their
feet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000098">The
picture is much the same at King’s Church, which collects food
to donate back out to agencies. When it set up it did not feel best
placed to assess the need, and did not want to interrupt the
established process between, say, a social worker and their client. It
collects the food to pass on to agencies, which decide who to give it
to. King’s Church opened in 2009 and at that stage gave out 50
food hampers a month. It has expanded the areas it covers across south
Wales and now gives out in excess of 1,200 a
month.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000099">In
2012, King’s Church gave out 12,500 hampers. It expects to
deliver 18,000 in 2013 and forecasts a need for 24,000 in 2014. It is
important to remember that in the King’s Church model the
official agencies identify the need. Demand is going up. King’s
Church feels that it is just scratching the surface. Both King’s
Church and Raven House are gearing up for the benefits changes, and we
can see why. A study by Bron Afon housing association into those
affected by the bedroom tax in Torfaen quotes tenants—it visited
every one of them—saying that they would rather go without meals
to find the money to stay in their home. Teachers report seeing hungry
pupils each day and food banks are working with
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000100">Providers
in my constituency know that things will get worse. The trend has been
a steep rise in demand, even before the Government’s austerity
measures really hit. When FareShare Cymru, which is based in Cardiff
and does an excellent job, is reporting that charities are finding it
hard to pay the membership fee to join its organisation, and that it is
finding it difficult to maintain the service, the Government need to
open their eyes to see how their policies are hurting. They should not

there is poverty. There is poverty in Monmouthshire and in the whole of
Wales. I spent many years in the Welsh Assembly making the point that
there is a great deal of poverty in Monmouthshire, although that
usually fell on deaf ears among Labour Members of the Welsh Assembly,
who assured me, practically, that the place was full of millionaires,
although it never has been and it certainly is not at the moment. There
is a great deal of poverty in rural areas. I hope that matter will be

of the most important things that can be done to address this matter is
dealing with the completely unfair local government funding formula,
brought about by the Welsh Assembly in about 2000, which has caused a
catastrophic loss in income for local authorities, particularly those
in rural areas. As the hon. Gentleman will no doubt be aware, the local
government funding formula for Wales, introduced by a Labour Welsh
Assembly Government in about 2000, does not take proper account of the
costs of dealing with rurality or the extra costs involved when trying
to deliver goods and services in rural areas, and it does not take
proper account of the age of the population. Sadly, those who live
longer are much more likely to incur costs on the local authority than
those of us who are younger and in better health. If those two issues
were addressed in the local government funding formula, it would go a
long way towards stamping out poverty in parts of Wales, particularly
in the rural areas. I hope that the hon. Gentleman joins me in
campaigning against that disgraceful, unfair local government funding
formula, which did so much to remove cash from rural areas of
Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000104"><B><Member ContinuationText="Albert Owen" PimsId="2226" UID="13021251000305" xid="461" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000305">Albert

East, we have a food bank that started off covering one area of
Swansea, but then had to stretch its services right across the city
because of the increase in people who needed its help. I have worked
closely with the food bank from day one, and I have come to know the
volunteers and have seen the dedication and effort they put into their
work. They are very clear about why they have to do that work: they
have to fill a gap the Government have created. There are pressures on
our communities and on family incomes. It is not just the unemployed we

help.</hs_Para>

some of the nice extras that might be in the bag, but because they have

or have not managed their income properly, but because something has
happened that means they need immediate help. That is where the food

demands on income, but we just cannot let people fall behind. A measure

the demand on food banks has increased, and not just over Christmas. In
September and October, they distributed two tonnes of food, which I am
sure equates to many dozens of bags. It is hard even to grasp the idea
of weighing out two tonnes of food on to pallets. Thank goodness the
churches and schools were having their harvest festivals; it meant we
met the demand. However, we were really concerned about Christmas. I
was so concerned, and the issues raised with me were so concerning,
that I went to local employers and shopkeepers and asked, “Will
you donate food?” The response was magnificent, and we got the
additional food. Through a concerted effort with other organisations in
Swansea, we managed to help people over the Christmas period.</hs_Para>

“My mother is too poor to buy the flour and my father is too ill

that song had a message for

congratulate the hon. Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan) on
securing the debate. As he said, there are 23 food banks in Wales, and
four of them are in north Wales. They operate in disadvantaged areas,
although I am sometimes at a loss to decide which areas of Wales are
disadvantaged and which are not, given that disadvantage is so
widespread. As I said in an intervention, nine food banks were opened
in the past 12 months, and I understand that there are a further four
in development. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the number of adults and
children who have at some point been dependent on food banks. The
significant fact is that in 2011 there were 11,000 people in that
position, and in 2012 there were 29,000; 2,500 families a month were
referred in 2011, and in December 2012 that figure was nearly 5,000.
There is a trend there.</hs_Para>

reasons why people go to food banks, as we know, are that they have
benefit problems: either their benefits are not paid, or they are paid
late. That accounts for almost half the people who go to food banks.
Others go because of debt or because they are homeless. Significantly,
about 20% of those who go to food banks are working poor people. As
someone else said, these are not the scroungers of the popular
newspapers. The growth of food banks in Wales is a symptom of a much
more fundamental problem: the growing inequality that I mentioned
earlier, and a failure of wages and incomes to match the
ever-increasing cost of living. There is a fundamental mismatch between
people’s wages and what they need to pay for such basics as
shelter, warmth, food, and clothing.</hs_Para>

currently provide a vital short-term service and are not a long-term
solution, even for the individual who goes to them. That must be borne
in mind, if we think that there will be more dependence on food banks.
However, they can be a life-saving service. I was glad to open the food
bank in my constituency last year, and to meet the good people who give
their time and effort to make the place work in the service of their
fellow citizens. Their aims and the outcomes that they achieve are
entirely laudable, but this is a matter on which the Government should
lead. Food banks, if we have them at all, should supplement public
provision; they should be a marginal support. It is astonishing, and a
disgrace, that in the second decade of the 21st century,
when we produce more food than we consume, and after all the advances
that have been made in science and technology, we cannot make sure that
people get sufficient
food.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000147">Food
banks, obviously, are a marker of inequality. As I have said, benefits
and tax credits have not risen in line with real inflation. However, in
Wales there has also been a consistent decline in economic performance
and in people’s ability to buy the food they need. The figures
are quite stark: Wales’s gross value added per head compared to
the UK average in 1997 was 78.1%, and in 2011 it was 75.2%—a
decline of about 3%. For west Wales and the valleys—the poorest
areas as defined by the European Union—the figure was 67.2% in
1997. 
<?notus-xml column=244?>It is now 65% and it is, alas, on the way down. Recent
analysis by the Resolution Foundation has shown that between 1975 and
2010, the average annual year-on-year change for the bottom 10% was
only 0.2%; for the top 1% there was a 2.4%
year-on-year increase. Thus there is local decline, and also a decline
in relation to class and income sector. As I have said, inequality
grew, and has been growing since the 1970s. Some of that was perhaps
partly affected by Mrs Thatcher’s policies, but that growth has
been
consistent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000148">Unfortunately,
average household income in Wales is 12% lower than in the country as a
whole. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills has forecast that
Welsh economic growth will continue to lag 0.5% behind that of the UK
as a whole; so there is a substantial historical problem that is
growing. Food banks are not the answer to all that.
The remedies are fairly easy to list: we need better
economic growth and income distribution, particularly in the poorest
areas. We in Plaid support the living wage, as we supported the minimum
wage. We need to take steps to end fuel and food poverty.</hs_Para>

ask the Minister a long list of questions that he would find it
difficult to answer, or demand that he fleece the rich and distribute
the largesse to the poor, which he is clearly not in a position to do.
I want to ask him for a tiny little step. Let us see whether as a
matter of good will he can reply for the Government. It is about
something that my hon. Friend the Member for Angus (Mr Weir) and I have
been pursuing recently: a small step in relation to winter fuel
payments. In response to an intervention by the hon. Member for
Aberconwy (Guto Bebb), the hon. Member for Cardiff West talked about
the importance of disposable income. If people could spend a bit less
on fuel they would have a bit more to spend on food, so I ask the
Government for a commitment to pay winter fuel payments a bit earlier.
Then older people and people with disabilities would get their money to
spend earlier in the year, and could get a better deal on coal or a
tank of gas or oil. It is not a huge thing, and it would not cost a
lot. Will the Minister give a positive answer to that question, as a
measure of good
will?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000150">A

is missing from the debate, however, is any attempt by the Labour party
in Wales to provide a context. It has been a self-indulgent debate in
many ways, in which attacks on Government welfare policies have been
made completely out of context. We heard no comments whatever on the
fact that in April 2007 there was one food bank in Wales, but by May
2010 there were 10; now there are 24 to 26, depending on which
statistics are accepted, but the reasons are much more complicated than
changes to benefits. If we look at benefits payments in Wales, my
understanding is that when the Labour party came to government in 1997,
the average employment and support allowance payment for a benefits
recipient was 20% of the Welsh average income. By 2010, when the Labour
party left power, that proportion was down to 17.2%, and it has since
increased to 17.6%. Last year, benefits went up by 5.5%, the highest
for some
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000165">We
have to provide the context for why household budgets are being
challenged. They are being challenged by forces beyond the control of
any Government. Food prices have gone up 27% between 2007 and 2012;
that is beyond the control of the Government. When I was in Washington
last year, a crisis was hitting corn prices because of drought in the
mid-west, but that type of thing is not in the control of our
Government. Look at electricity and fuel prices. Prices that are
subject to VAT at 5%, just as they were throughout the entire period of
the Labour Administration, yet electricity prices have doubled and gas
prices have tripled since 2000. No Government can deal with that type
of effect on people’s household incomes. No Government can
respond in a sufficient manner to that type of price increase, which is
beyond the control of any Government.</hs_Para>

lowest paid in society and who was quite happy for capital gains tax to

every single Member in the Chamber would acknowledge that they could
not and would not want to live on £71 a week. That is why it is
so important for the Work programme and the support offered by the
Government to get people back into employment. That is the real way to

Griffith</B> (Llanelli) (Lab):</Member> We have had a wide-ranging
debate in which many extremely important points were made. I start by
congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff West (Kevin
Brennan) on securing the debate. He reminded us of the strong tradition
in Wales of translating our concern for the well-being of 
<?notus-xml column=248?>each and every member of our communities into reforms in society that
enshrine the dignity of the individual by organising our collective
wealth for the good of all, whether through the pension reforms of
Lloyd George, the creation of the NHS by Aneurin Bevan or the
far-reaching reforms of my predecessor, Jim Griffiths. Those things
were done precisely so that people would not have to rely on handouts
such as those given by food banks.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Newport East (Jessica Morden) paid tribute to
FareShare Cymru and to the King’s church in her constituency,
and made the point that food banks are well run, with proper systems of
referral for those in genuine need. My hon. Friend the Member for
Swansea East (Mrs James) spoke of her personal experience helping
people who are in distressing circumstances. The hon. Member for Arfon
(Hywel Williams) raised the issue of rural poverty and the widespread
nature of deprivation. He contrasted the wealth of food produced with
the abject failure to distribute wealth and food equitably.</hs_Para>

Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies) focused on the formula used to
distribute money—the rate support grant—to local councils
in Wales. My hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans) emphasised
the dire need that many people find themselves in, and the hon. Member
for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) did not come up with a solution to the
question of how to eliminate the need for people to rely on food banks.
That is a matter I would like to return to
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000174">The
dire statistic is that the number of people relying on food banks in
Wales has trebled over the past year, rising from just over 10,000 to
just under 30,000, with forecasts of 40,000 next year. Across the UK,
food bank usage has doubled in the past year from around 125,000 to
around 250,000. The growth of food bank usage in Wales is therefore
twice that of the UK average.</hs_Para>

Trust operates 23 food banks across Wales, nine of which have opened in
the past year. Four more food banks will open in Wales by Easter this
year. In 2011, a total of 11,000 people—7,000 adults and 4,000
children—used a food bank, but in 2012 it was 18,000 adults and
10,000 children. That is a very grim message
indeed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000176">I
would like to pay tribute to the excellent work of volunteers who run
food banks up and down Wales. Nothing I say in my remarks is intended
to criticise their immediate response to a growing need. In my
constituency, the Antioch centre and the Elim church do amazing work. I
was with them a couple of weeks before Christmas at the entrance to the
Tesco superstore in my constituency, and the response from the public
was tremendous from people of all walks of life. The members of Elim
church had lists of items that were suitable for people to purchase for
the food bank and to include in their shopping. As they came out the
store, people willingly gave the food they had purchased especially for
the food bank.</hs_Para>

ask why we are seeing this increase in the number of families in need
and what the Government can do about it. I want to see us tackle the
causes of poverty and hunger, to look at what is wrong with the
structure of our society. When it comes to giving aid to developing
countries, we have long since learned that it is no good just giving
people handouts. That is the whole point of the Fairtrade movement: the
customer 
<?notus-xml column=249?>pays a fair price for goods so that the people who grow or make those
goods can receive a wage that enables them to make ends meet, so that
they do not have to rely on charity. How much better to have the
dignity of being in charge of their own lives and budgets, not having
to
beg.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000178">The
same is true for people in the UK. I want to see the Government take
measures that will tackle the causes of poverty. Why has there been an
increase in the number of people turning to food banks? Quite simply it
is because more and more people are suffering financial hardship. Let
us see what can be done about that. We need policies that determine
income distribution in this country, and those are very much a matter
for the UK Government. While the Welsh Government can try to provide
services to mitigate the effects of lack of income, they do not have
control over some of the main factors that affect
income.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000179">As
specialists in the House of Commons Library have pointed out, there has
never been an absolute correlation between the amount of money that
someone can receive on a benefit and their actual needs. It has always
been a bit of a compromise—a bit of political expediency as to
what was acceptable. What they are clear about is that there has never
been a time when those benefits have not been uprated in line with
inflation, whatever the colour of the Government in office. It is has
been a tremendous sadness this year that the Welfare Benefits Up-rating
Bill will effectively bring real cuts into people’s income. That
is on top of the many additional costs that they have already had to
face. We have already discussed the fact that while benefit increases
have been limited, there has been rampant inflation, particularly on
essential food items, ranging from 17% to 36%, depending on which food
items are considered, over the past five years.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021251000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000180">There has
also been the increase in VAT. VAT is charged on a range of items,
including toilet paper and bathroom products that are not luxuries but
items that every family needs. While VAT is not put on food, it is on
many essential items. That was a valid comment made by
colleagues.</hs_Para>

face the difficulty of delays in receiving benefit, or have it cut off.
We have unfortunately seen some disastrous behaviour by Atos and the
problems that has caused. When 40% of its decisions go to appeal, there
is something very wrong. I ask the Minister to pass on to his
colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions our very real
concerns about that. Benefit changes are one of the key reasons why
people end up at a food bank; they account for 40% of the people who go
there.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021251000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000182">The other
major concern is low income. Many people on low incomes are claiming
working tax credit. There have been horrendous changes to the working
tax credit by the Government, which have left people with much less
money. The point of those credits was to top people up so that work
would pay. I was shocked to hear the Minister of State, Department for
Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb),
say not only that people could do a few hours’ extra work, when
we know how difficult it is to find extra  
<?notus-xml column=250?>work, but that he thought that would compensate for the changes in
housing benefit. He did not realise, of course, that for every extra
pound earned, a person would lose 65p in entitlement. It is not a
matter of equating three hours’ work at the minimum wage
to  £15 extra in housing benefit. I again ask the
Minister for Wales to speak with his DWP colleagues about the worrying
effects that those changes in housing benefit will have on many of our
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000183">We
have already seen the cutting of the pension credit and the savings
credit, cuts in the health in pregnancy grant, and the change from the
retail prices index to the consumer prices index. We are asking the
Minister to prevail on his colleagues to not simply accept the
situation as it is, but look at ways of putting it right. For example,
they should rethink the welfare benefits uprating legislation to
restore the link between benefits and inflation. As I have said, the
bedroom tax and the cuts planned to the working tax credit are both
areas we would like him to look into.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021251000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000184">We would also
like the Government to get a grip on energy companies. We understand
that some energy price rises are due to the worldwide energy market. We
also know that there are a number of measures that could be taken.
There could be a lot of tightening up with the regulator, and the
Minister could look at what can be done about energy prices for
low-income households. What we want from the Minister now is not
simply, “Oh well, it cannot be changed. Nothing else can be
done. That is how society is. Prices just go up.” We want an
interventionist Government who can devise a redistribution plan that
will ensure that we do not have an increase in the number of people
going to food banks. In fact, we want a fall in the number doing so in
Wales. The Government could then be proud of bringing about a situation
in which there was no need for any more food banks in
Wales.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_12_PT_1/24C20F261249C82F2427F8342889513BD3D73C32" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 February 2013">Tuesday

because I understand that he was the successful one of a number of
Labour MPs who were encouraged to put in for it. What the debate
represents, as has been highlighted by some of my hon. Friends, is the
latest stage in a political campaign by the Labour party to use the
food bank movement as a vehicle for its political attack on some of the
changes and challenges that we are facing as a coalition Government.
The hon. Gentleman did exactly in his speech what my hon. Friend the

West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), as well as a certain individual

banks were very much an issue under the previous Government. However,
the conspiracy of silence that existed around food banks extended
beyond this place to Jobcentre Plus, because one thing that Labour
Ministers refused to do was allow Jobcentre Plus advisers to signpost
people facing particular financial need to use food banks. That is
something that we changed. In 2011, we altered the guidance to allow
Jobcentre Plus advisers to refer people and advertise the services of
food banks. Among the underlying causes and reasons for the expansion
in the use of food banks in recent years, one reason is that, in
contrast to the previous Labour Government, we see them, up front and
unashamedly, as a good thing, and we encourage people who are facing
points of financial crisis in their lives to use them.</hs_Para>

Member for Cardiff West mentioned a “cost of living
crisis”. He used that phrase several times, and it was picked up
by other hon. Members as the 
<?notus-xml column=252?>reason for the expansion in the use of food banks. Of course, that is
true. People use food banks because they face a financial crisis at
that time. I have met people  who use them for a whole variety
of reasons: some  are young, homeless people; some are
struggling with addictions, and they are spending money as a result of
addictive behaviours that they are seeking to address; and some are
victims of domestic violence who find that they have to flee their
family home—they are fleeing an abusive relationship and need
that extra support. People use the resources for a variety of different

to spend too much time picking holes in the remarks made by the hon.
Member for Cardiff West, but he did say, slightly patronisingly, that
he suspected that the Minister would stand up and say that he has
visited a food bank. Well, I have actually. In fact, I served as a
trustee on a charity that ran food banks. The charity set up its food
bank in 2008, and its services have expanded. It now provides not only
food but a basic bank of clothing, because as hon. Members have rightly
said, people face a whole range of financial needs. As well as that, it
runs an annual toy appeal to ensure that the poorest families in

constituencies. I would like to pay my own tribute on the record to the
volunteers and people who work in those organisations, because they are
doing a fantastic job. When I speak to them, the last thing they want
is to be dragged into a party political football match. This issue is
bigger and more important than that. We could have had a sensible

to use food banks as a reason for having a go at Government policies
that are widely supported, we should all be supporting those volunteers

debt was only mentioned briefly in the debate, but it is one of the key
reasons why, in recent years, the number of people using food banks has

the consumer credit boom, which was encouraged—egged
on—by the policies of previous Labour Governments. Household
indebtedness has started to fall in the past two years, but there is
still a long way to go to see people with sustainable debt levels in
their lives. That is one reason why some of the organisations that are
at the forefront of setting up food banks are also at the forefront of
tackling the debt culture. Some of the same organisations run debt
advice counselling services alongside their food banks. The Government

At the end of this week, London fashion week will dominate the media
with news of the latest trends on the catwalk, but if we look beyond
the perfect seams of the catwalk shows, there lies the beating heart of
an industry. It is an industry that contributes £21 billion to
the UK economy and supports 816,000 jobs, making it the largest
employer of all the creative industries, so it is definitely an
industry worth talking
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000209">For
all that significant contribution to the economy, there is also huge
potential to grow, to flourish, to be better and to create more jobs.
Excellent foundations are in place. Our fashion colleges are
exceptional, and London has a worldwide reputation as the creative
launch pad for the industry. My constituency, Hackney South and
Shoreditch, has had a long love affair with the industry. It is
embedded in both the history and the culture of the borough. From the
arrival of the silk weaver Huguenots in the late 17th century to the
present day, generations of aspiring designers have settled and set up
their businesses in the east end. It is the natural hub of an industry,
its beating heart, which today provides 1,500 jobs in design and
manufacturing.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13021251000255" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000255">4.1

fashion week alone generates £30 million for the city’s
economy, showcasing about 250 designers to a global audience and
generating £130 million-worth of media coverage. London and the
UK benefit from fashion tourism too, which is estimated to have
accounted for 0.5% of tourism spending in 2009. However, the debate is
not just about Hackney and London; in 2009, the fashion industry
directly provided more than 800,000 jobs across the UK, and indirectly
accounted for 4.5% of total employment. Today, I want to talk about how
we can sustain and build on that success in the future, in both London
and the rest of the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000214">Sustaining
the industry and securing its future starts with education, so we must
ensure that that is working well. I am incredibly proud of the fashion
colleges and institutions across the country and in my constituency.
They have an international reputation for excellence and year-on-year
produce many talented graduates from around the globe. The London
College of Fashion, which has a campus in my constituency, is a shining
example of that. It has been running for over 100 years and has
produced incredible talent, including: Linda Bennett from L. K.
Bennett; Emma Hope; Jane Brown; and Jimmy Choo, the famous shoe
designer, who also had his first studio in Hackney.</hs_Para>

success stories of the future? How do we make sure that the graduates
of today have the support to succeed? Along with other higher education
establishments, our fashion colleges face squeezed budgets, so we
cannot assume that they can continue to do as well as they have been
despite the cuts. Other countries understand that and are pouring money
into their own fashion colleges. We face increased competition and
cannot fall behind. Education is the foundation of the industry; it is
where talent is moulded, encouraged and allowed to flourish. We must
ensure that our young people continue to be able to study at
world-class institutions here in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000216">The
Government’s plans for the EBacc, although now abandoned,
reflect a mindset that downgrades the importance of creative skills. I
hope that the Minister will disabuse me of that notion and say that
that is not the case in the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills, but we have certainly seen that attitude from other parts of
Government. We need a clear path laid out from secondary school
onwards, so that young people can see the career opportunities before
them. We also need to see the end of unpaid internships. I am pleased
that both the British Fashion Council and the UK Fashion and Textile
Association are putting their weight behind proper training,
apprenticeships and real jobs. Unpaid internships cannot be justified
in an industry that generates so much money for the UK.</hs_Para>

from education to the skills needed; there is a skills deficit in
business and manufacturing. Fashion, first and foremost, is a business,
so however talented a designer, he or she needs business skills, but
too often the creatives do not have such skills. I have met some
amazing people in my constituency from companies in which there is a
good relationship between a creative and someone with a business head.
Many people do not have such a relationship automatically, so they need
support. Like those in any small company, they cannot do everything in
the business. Creative businesses start at a disadvantage, because they
find it harder to get funding. Financial institutions are much less
likely to lend money to creative businesses, which are more likely to
have new, innovative business models and younger owners, and are
therefore seen as more
risky.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000218">To
give an example, Not Just a Label is an innovative and exciting new
business in my constituency. Based in a small office in Shoreditch, it
searches out fresh new designer talent, and promotes and sells their
products on an online platform. When it started, it was given no
funding from banks or investors. Now, as it tries to expand, banks will
still not lend to it, despite its success, saying that online
businesses are too risky. Such businesses are not necessarily looking
for a grant or a subsidy, but simply for a loan—sometimes just
an overdraft facility—to help them start up or
expand.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000219">With
all those barriers, how do new designers get off the ground? Happily,
some support is available from the British Fashion Council and the
Centre for Fashion Enterprise, which is based in Hackney. The Centre
for Fashion Enterprise—its director, Wendy Malem, used to be a
designer—and NewGen, a programme run by the British Fashion
Council, both offer the business support that is so needed by
designers. NewGen is currently sponsored by Topshop, and last year it
celebrated its 10th anniversary. Without that programme, we would 
<?notus-xml column=256?>never have heard of Alexander McQueen, who started his business in
Hackney and whose legacy gave Kate her wedding
dress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000220">However,
both schemes are vastly oversubscribed. From speaking to those in the
industry, I know that there is an appetite to expand such partnerships,
but no funding for it. Incidentally, Not Just a Label provides a
platform for new designers. It is a business that has recognised not
only a gap in the market and been a success, but the importance of
fuelling new designers and showcasing and supporting new talent to grow
businesses as a whole. Its business has helped many designers grow
substantially, which shows what can be achieved when talent is given
the right
tools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000221">When
designers get the support and funding they need, they face another
hurdle: where to manufacture? There is a real desire to manufacture
more in Britain. Volume manufacturing may have gone, probably
irrevocably, abroad. However, I am not talking about grubby, backstreet
sweatshops, but high-end manufacturing—the top end, which is the
true craft that involves artisanship, local production and traditional
techniques. Throughout the country from London to Scotland, there are
established and specialised manufacturers producing exactly such
top-quality products. In the east midlands alone,  about 10,000
to 15,000 jobs are provided by fashion
manufacturing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000222">Many
manufacturers set up in the UK to create those high-quality products,
but they are struggling to expand and grow because of a lack of skilled
machinists. Currently, the industry needs 150 more skilled machinists a
year just to sustain itself, and companies can barely afford 
to take on and train new apprentices, because the cost of mistakes in
high-end manufacturing is too great to be worth the risk. The
Government have a programme to support apprenticeships, and it would be
good to hear from the Minister how that might be better applied to the
fashion
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000223">Instead,
manufacturing businesses are forced to work around the clock with a
skeleton staff in the build-up to London fashion week, and they often
close their doors for months afterwards. It is no wonder that there is
a temptation to use unpaid interns. British designers want to make
their samples and garments here, but there is not currently the
capacity to do so. The UK Fashion and Textile Association has recently
secured £2.7 million for the Textile Centre of Excellence in
Huddersfield to support skills training throughout the UK. The industry
is therefore giving much support, but a bit of focus on how the
Government might support it better would be
welcome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021251000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021251000224">The
Designer-Manufacturer Innovation Support Centre—also known as
DISC—was launched last year with European regional development
fund money. Its goal is to create links with designers and
manufacturers, and to offer support and advice to manufacturing
businesses. DISC has proposed the creation of a machinist school that
would train 25 machinists a year and provide the manufacturing industry
with a new, young generation of highly skilled professionals with
relevant skills. It is here that we hit one of the challenges of how to
fit fashion into the models that the Government are promoting. To be a
good machinist, someone needs not a short apprenticeship but lots of
practice, which means a longer training course than some of the
apprenticeships now being funded by the Government.</hs_Para>

establishment of such a school, which we are keen to host in Hackney,
would sustain the industry, but there are other opportunities to
expand. When the elements of excellent education, design support and
the ability to manufacture come together, the industry will have an
opportunity to flourish and grow further. In New York, fashion zones or
clusters have been created to encourage industry growth by offering
cheaper rents and loans. Encouraging growth in those areas of the

DISC’s funding will run out in 2014, which is only next year.

I have previously raised with the Treasury the issue of small business

have stayed, because they could, and have grown their small businesses
into bigger businesses, creating jobs and wealth in the UK. I do not
mind who creates jobs and wealth, but I want that to happen here. With
the current visa regime, the danger is that those people will have
better opportunities to travel to and be poached by countries that see
the advantage of doing so. We have already seen adverts in Australian

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills (Jo Swinson):</Member></B> I welcome the opportunity to serve
under your chairmanship, Mrs Riordan, and congratulate the hon. Member

the topic of which is both important and timely, as London fashion week
starts this Friday.</hs_Para>

fashion have a long history in the UK, and their importance has been
felt even in these august premises, in the Houses of Parliament. Back
in the  14th century, the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords
sat on a Woolsack to demonstrate the importance of 
<?notus-xml column=259?>the wool trade to the nation. In the 18th century, textiles were the
single biggest economic interest after grain. Throughout our history,
from the Stuarts to the sixties, fashion has added definition to our
society. Today, the UK is home to some of the most inspiring fashion
designers in the world, some of whom were mentioned by the hon. Lady.
Hackney is right to be proud of its strong fashion heritage. With
strong mayoral support for the creative industries,
the fashion business has a great deal to offer London and
indeed the rest of the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021267000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000004">Fashion
remains an important part of the economy. Its wider
contribution is estimated at more than £37
billion —the hon. Lady mentioned £21 billion as
the direct figure for fashion—and more than 800,000 jobs are
supported more widely throughout the industry. As the hon. Lady rightly
says, this is an industry that is worth talking about and that perhaps
does not always get the profile that it deserves in this
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021267000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000005">Today,

UK companies are thriving by supplying top-end, exclusive products.
British designers such as Stella McCartney, Paul Smith and Vivienne
Westwood continue to lead in global markets. The UK’s economic
success is due in large part to our ability to participate in global

our reputation for quality and excellence, which forms the foundation
of our international success.</hs_Para>

Government perspective, we want to ensure that this sector continues to

capacity, a skilled work force, and support for the many small
businesses emerging in the sector. Those key challenges were all
outlined in the hon. Lady’s opening
speech.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021267000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000008">Manufacturing
is crucial to economic recovery. Working with business, we are taking
steps to strengthen UK manufacturing capability. We want to create a
better business environment that will address barriers to growth;
encourage innovation and technology commercialisation; increase exports
and business investment; improve skills; and build UK supply chains.
Last October, as part of the Government’s “Make it in
Great Britain” initiative, my Department hosted the UK fashion
and textile manufacturing showcase. It was designed to dispel the myth
that the UK does not make anything
anymore.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021267000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000009">We
are encouraging manufacturers and retailers to work more closely
together to identify opportunities  to bring business back to
the UK. Already we have seen some retailers sourcing products from the
UK, where they have opportunities to benefit from shorter lead times.
Debenhams, for example, recently pledged to increase its use of UK
manufacturers as it launches a new “Made by Great

range.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021267000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000010">Lord
Alliance from the other place has recently commissioned work to look at
the feasibility of bringing back textile manufacturing to the UK, and

UK products and services 
<?notus-xml column=260?>to customers abroad and encouraging foreign companies to invest in the
UK through the GREAT campaign, which focuses on exactly why the British
fashion industry has been considered No. 1 on the world stage, with its
well-established tailors of Savile row and its exciting young start-up

hon. Lady was right to say that skills are  essential to
support the UK fashion industry, and that apprenticeships, in turn, are
at the heart of our skills ambition. Just last week, Creative Skillset,
which is the sector skills council for the creative industries,
launched its first higher-level apprenticeship in fashion and textiles
to meet skills needs in advertising, creative and digital media, and
fashion and textiles. Working with the industry, including with
companies such as Burberry, Creative Skillset is planning to deliver
500 apprenticeships. The hon. Lady was right to say that employers are
best placed to know the skills that they need, which is why
apprenticeship funding is demand-led. Companies and employers in that
sector need to come forward and commit to employing and training an
apprentice; then they can access the funding.</hs_Para>

pleased to note that the UK Commission for Employment and Skills has
provided nearly £7 million to Creative Skillset to
develop targeted skills interventions. That will bring greater
collaboration between the industry and higher education to overcome
structural barriers to new skills acquisition, tailor products and
services for the sector, and benchmark the very best training that is
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021267000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000014">The
government are giving business access to a significant skills funding
opportunity through the “employer ownership of skills”
pilot programme, the first round of which saw more than £2
million awarded to the Textile Centre of Excellence. Round 2 of the
pilot is now open, and we welcome and encourage bids from companies in
the fashion sector that are seeking to identify innovative solutions to
their, or the wider sector’s, skills challenges. The deadline
for bids is Thursday 28 March
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021267000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000015">Higher
education also plays a vital role, with our internationally recognised
universities offering a wide range of fashion courses. Figures for 2011
show that there were almost 18,000 students registered on fashion and
textile courses. Of course London is seen as a global centre of
fashion, with our universities, including the campus in the hon.
Lady’s constituency, attracting students from around the world.
Higher education is also leading the way on supporting positive body
image. The Edinburgh college of art’s centre of diversity
project, which is a collaboration of fashion colleges from up and down
the country, is working with All Walks Beyond the Catwalk to develop
innovative educational methods and to promote a positive attitude to
body diversity within fashion education. They are teaching student
fashion designers how to cut to a wide variety of body shapes, sizes
and styles. Given my campaigning on this issue, the scheme has
particular resonance for me.</hs_Para>

the power to inspire and define whole generations. The images that are
created are iconic, and if we harness that power, we can achieve great
things. I pay tribute to All Walks Beyond the Catwalk, and to Debra
Bourne and Caryn Franklin, who set it up. Of 
<?notus-xml column=261?>course Caryn rightly and deservedly received an MBE for services to

Swinson:</Member></B> I am happy to address the matter of visas. The
hon. Lady is right to say that talented individuals come here to study.
We want to ensure that we can use that talent in the British economy.
Of course discussions are ongoing between the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills and the Home Office on those issues, as with all
issues to do with business and the visa system, to make sure that we
have a proportionate and fair regime that enables people to contribute
to the economy in a way that helps overall UK growth.</hs_Para>

of unpaid interns, it is absolutely the case that there is,
unfortunately, exploitation of young people in the fashion industry,
and this Government are clear that anyone who is entitled to the
minimum wage should receive it. We expect employers to play by the
rules and pay their interns at least the minimum wage, as long as there
is no exemption, as there is for volunteers. Anyone who finds
themselves in the kind of situation that we are talking about should
know about the pay and work rights helpline, which is 0800 917 2368.
There is now a fast-track system in place for any calls from
individuals who appear to be in an unpaid internship that is in fact a
job. Any such call is dealt with promptly, and it is also important to
highlight that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs can enforce
arrears of pay going back to six years. I recognise that there is an
issue with individuals who are at the very early stages of their career
and who may feel that it is more difficult for them to speak out.
However, if this is something that has happened to them—even up
to six years ago—they can still come forward and make this
point.</hs_Para>

HMRC is also working to try to ensure greater awareness of the issue,
so we are working alongside Intern Aware and key stakeholders such as
the British Fashion Council to inform and educate interns and employers
about when someone should be paid the minimum wage. In the spring, we
will be delivering a campaign to support this work, aimed particularly
at educating university students about these matters. Recently, there
has been a particular focus from HMRC on interns in the fashion
industry, and we are expecting a report back from HMRC on that activity
shortly.</hs_Para>

other element of exploitation that happens in the fashion industry that
is worth discussing. It is very positive that London fashion week has
now committed to featuring only models who are over the age of
16, and <I>Vogue</I> magazine has pledged to do the same.
Unfortunately, however, that positive step has not been replicated
across the fashion industry as a whole. Away from the spotlight of
London fashion week, there are still concerns, as has been highlighted
in a number of documentaries, about dangerous situations that
vulnerable young people—many of them still children—can
find themselves in, 
<?notus-xml column=262?>particularly when there are trends for models who are in their early
teens. It is important that the welfare of people working in the
fashion industry is taken very seriously. I pay tribute to the
excellent work done by Erin O’Connor, who has championed this
issue within the industry by setting up her “model
sanctuary” to give models somewhere that they can receive advice
and support, and a place to be themselves, during London fashion week.
That has been so successful that it has now been taken on by the
British Fashion Council as part of the model lounge, which is part of
London fashion week itself.</hs_Para>

to the potential for growth in the fashion industry, because it is of
course vital that we nurture the entrepreneurship that is so important
to the fashion industry. The hon. Lady was right to point out that
people who have the fantastic creative skills to be world-class
designers may not automatically have the business acumen to go
alongside those skills. We also need to recognise some of the
challenges that small businesses face in accessing finance. That is why
we are continuing to make a priority of improving access to finance for
small and medium-sized enterprises. We have put in place a package of
measures to improve the supply of affordable credit to SMEs, including
the funding for lending scheme and the £1.2 billion business
finance partnership, to stimulate the development of alternatives to
bank
finance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021267000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Meg Hillier" PimsId="4739" UID="13021267000093" xid="845" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000093">Meg
Hillier:</Member></B> On that point, businesses in my constituency tell
me that it is often still difficult for them to get money. We know that
funding for lending is actually fuelling a lot of buy-to-let landlords,
which is a different issue altogether. However, there is also a real
need for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to look at
licensing alternative forms of funding, such as crowd funding, which
are popular for some of these small businesses. If the Minister cannot
answer me now, perhaps she could write to me about her
Department’s attitude to that issue and what it will be
doing.</hs_Para>

Swinson:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention. She
is right to say that we need to be innovative in considering a range of
different ways to free up finance. There is already a range of
different ways in which the Government are doing it, but I am more than
happy to take on board her suggestion and consider whether there are
further steps to be taken along those lines.</hs_Para>

Government-backed business bank, which will receive £1 billion
of new Government funding, with £300 million being invested by
the Government alongside private investors during the next two years to
provide diverse sources of funding for SMEs. The bank will address
long-standing structural gaps in the supply of finance to businesses.
We also have the Get Mentoring

Naturally, I understand that the Minister who is here is only
responsible for treatment and care in England, and that health is a

do not want this debate to be party political; this issue is far too
important for that. I want to compare the facts and to recognise
success, wherever that may be found. The starting point for the debate
must be mortality rates or, to put it another way, the success of any
medical intervention. Overall, life expectancy among men in Wales is
77.6 years, and in England it is 78.6 years. Among women,
life expectancy is 81.8 years in Wales and 82.6 years in England. I am

62 days, and in cases deemed non-urgent, the patient should expect
treatment to start within 26 weeks. I
want to underline this situation: a woman in England who is concerned
about the risk of breast cancer will be reassured, or have her case
elevated to the next level, within 10 days. In Wales, however, a

is 93%, so I am pleased that we have exceeded our own high standards.
Some 87.3% of people treated began their first definitive treatment

such a thing, I am afraid they are either deliberately not telling the
truth or just plain ignorant. I am  happy to explain how the
coalition Government have funded the cancer drugs fund in England.
Raising the threshold for national insurance effectively saved the NHS
£200 million. That £200 million was not
secreted away or given to the Treasury or anybody else; it was the
start and has been the continuation of the cancer drugs fund. I hope
that that is clear. I know that it will be recorded in <I>Hansard</I>,

the last minutes available to me, I will explain cancer networks. The
NHS Commissioning Board has set out its plans to establish a small
number of national networks from 1 April to improve health services for
specific patient groups or conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular
disease. The cancer networks have existed for some time, and they have
worked extremely effectively. It seems a bit odd, but those involved in
the delivery of care and treatment for people suffering from cancer,
for example, were not always the best at communicating among
themselves, so the networks were set up, with great success. We are
building on that
success.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021267000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/halltext/130212h0002.htm#13021267000078">We
have increased the amount of money going into the new strategic
clinical networks, and we are confident that they will continue to work
closely with providers and commissioners in the new health system and
to play an important role in improving cancer care. I understand that
transition arrangements, which concerned a number of people, are now
well developed, and good progress is being made, with appointments in
key positions in the clinical networks.</hs_Para>

committed, however, to improving the experience of cancer patients. It
is not all about early diagnosis, screening and treatment; it is also
about cancer patients’ experience. The 2011-12 national cancer
patient experience survey found that 88% of cancer patients in England
rated their care as excellent or very good; of course,
we  
<?notus-xml column=271?>aim to increase that figure. The results are helping trusts to identify
areas in cancer care that need improvement locally and to raise
standards across the service.</hs_Para>

can begin later this month; it looks like a bit of a typing error. That
will get me into trouble with my officials. Any such survey is about to
commence. It is an important piece of work, because it will enable us
to identify and build on progress already made. From April,
responsibility for such surveys will move to the NHS Commissioning
Board, but hon. Members can be assured that this Minister will
keep  a close eye on it. The clinical commissioning

Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) is doing excellent work in supporting
victims of sexual and gender-based violence during conflict. The TFV
was established by the states parties of the ICC in 2002 to benefit the
victims of crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction. It is
entirely funded by voluntary donations. The focus of its work so far
has been in northern Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
where its project work provides assistance to the victims of the most
serious crimes, including torture and sexual violence. It is making an
important difference in helping the victims of serious crimes rebuild
their lives. The Government are calling upon G8 countries for similar
support to initiatives such as the TFV to help alleviate the
significant suffering caused by these horrific acts of violence and
take action to prevent these crimes from

Javid:</Member></B> As set out in the December Public Sector Finances
release. Public Sector Net Debt (PSND) (excluding the temporary effects
of financial interventions) was £770 billion in 2009-10,
£910 billion in 2010-11 and £1026 billion in 2011-12. As
published in its December 2012 “Economic and fiscal
outlook”, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that
PSND will total £1186 billion in 2012-13. As a percentage of
gross domestic product, these figures are 53.1, 60.4, 66.8 and 74.7%,
respectively. The Government are taking decisive action to return the
public finances to a sustainable position and to provide protection
against uncertainty from the global economy. The OBR has judged that
the Government was on track to meet its fiscal mandate (to balance the
cyclically-adjusted current budget within a rolling 5-year period) a
year early, in
2016-17.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021278000384" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/text/130212w0001.htm#13021278000384">The
Government inherited an exceptional fiscal challenge. The financial
crisis of 2008 and 2009 resulted in the largest deficit since the
second world war and unsustainable public spending. The state was
borrowing one pound in every four that it spent. The coalition
Government took action and set out a clear, detailed and credible
consolidation plan to tackle this historically high level of public
borrowing, ensuring that the public finances are restored to a
sustainable path. As a result, the Government have made significant
progress in reversing the unprecedented increase in borrowing between
2008 and 2010 with public sector net borrowing cut by a quarter,
falling from £159 billion (11.2% of GDP) in 2009-10 to
£122 billion (8.0% of GDP) in
2011-12.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13021278000045" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/text/130212w0001.htm#13021278000045">Tax

colony or what was the DSTL colony and now is owned by the Health
Protection Agency. This reflects our commitment to animal welfare by
ensuring that we take responsibility for the breeding and husbandry of
these animals rather than having them transported from around the
world. In turn, we can then maximise their environmental enrichment and
general care and know that the animals to be used in experimentation
are of the highest quality and produced under ethical regimes regulated

previously attempted to fill these gaps using administrative data on

is important to note that comparisons of the number of people

£530 million of the Government's total of £680
million has been made available to projects covering rural areas. The
programme continues to move at pace. A total of 11 local projects have
now signed contracts, and are either in delivery or about to commence.
The remainder should have completed their procurements by this summer.
Complementary to the wider rural broadband programme, the Rural
Community Broadband Fund, jointly funded by DEFRA and Broadband
Delivery UK (BDUK), is aimed at improving access to broadband for the
hardest to reach rural areas and

slow-down in film production globally and film budgets have tightened
in response to international market forces. However, we have seen
significant private sector investment in facilities such as Warner Bros
£100 million commitment to Leavesden, and Elstree Studios and
Pinewood Studios are both seeking to expand capacity. Last October,
Disney announced that it is to create a permanent base at Pinewood
Studios. All of this underlines the long-term confidence in the UK film

Lamb:</Member></B> The Department does not recommend the use of
conversion therapy and it is not a National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence recommended treatment. I do not believe it would be
appropriate to commission conversion therapy using public funds. It is
for commissioners of NHS services to ensure that treatment and care,
including therapy, is provided to every patient without any form of
discrimination. Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) will in future
commission the majority of health care services. As public sector
organisations, they will be subject to the specific duties of the
public sector Equality Duty under the Equality Act 2010. Therefore CCGs
must, in the exercise of their functions, have due regard to the need
to eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and
other conduct prohibited under the

Agency (MHRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety of all medicines
including vaccines used in the United Kingdom and has robust systems in
place to achieve this. Healthcare professionals, patients and carers
are asked to submit reports of suspected adverse reactions to medicines
and vaccines via the Yellow Card scheme. The MHRA uses data from the
Yellow Card scheme alongside evaluation of data from clinical studies,
medical literature and use of statistical and epidemiological tools to
assess possible risks. The MHRA works very closely with regulatory
authorities from other countries and seeks independent expert advice
from the UK's Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) when evaluating
potential new risks or medical conditions suspected to be side effects
of vaccines and medicines. When there is sufficient evidence that a
vaccine or medicines may be associated with a new risk, regulatory
action is taken to ensure that the balance of benefits and risks
remains
positive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021285001414" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/text/130212w0003.htm#13021285001414">As

Poulter:</Member></B> The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC)
advises Ministers and the national health service in all four United
Kingdom countries about all aspects of screening policy, including
screening policy for group B streptococcus (GBS) carriage in pregnancy.
On 13 November 2012 the UK NSC recommended that a national screening
programme to test for GBS carnage in pregnancy using the enriched
culture medium test should not be offered. This is because there is
insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the benefits to be gained
from screening all pregnant women and treating those carrying the
organism with intravenous antibiotics during labour would outweigh the
harms.</hs_Para>

Government does not have any plans at present to introduce new
legislation to improve the responsiveness of local authorities in
dealing with cases of child neglect. The Children Act 1989 introduced a
duty for all local authorities to safeguard and promote the welfare of
children within their area who are in need (section 17). Local
authorities also have a duty to make enquiries to decide whether and
what action should be taken to safeguard the child from significant
harm (section
47).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021285002301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/text/130212w0004.htm#13021285002301">We

local authorities, working closely with their Local Safeguarding

appropriate services in their areas for children and young people,

the safety and wellbeing of all children and protecting them from abuse
and neglect remains central to this Government's policy. In his speech
to the Institute of Public Policy Research last November, the Secretary
of State for Education, my right hon. Friend the Member for Surrey
Heath (Michael Gove), reinforced this message and spoke about the need
for further improvement to the child protection system. He called for
action: “for

and local Government—in social work, schools, the police, the
health service—to work together to improve our child protection
system”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021285002307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130212/text/130212w0004.htm#13021285002307">The
reforms we are implementing to the child protection system, which
started in June 2010 with a wide ranging consultation and review by
Professor Munro, remain a high priority. We are committed to working
with all interested parties including other Government Departments,

education, police, health and the voluntary and community sectors to
improve the care and support of all children, and in particular the
