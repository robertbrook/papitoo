against women and girls is a top priority for the coalition Government.
The Department for International Development has significantly scaled
up its efforts to tackle this issue overseas. The department is also
supporting the One Billion Rising campaign by working with partners on
the ground to raise awareness of the campaign and highlight work to
prevent violence against women and girls.</hs_para>

</B><B>Northover</B><B>:</B></Member> The noble Baroness is absolutely
right that the figures on this are appalling. Globally, one woman in
three is beaten or sexually abused in her lifetime, which is utterly
unacceptable. We are working with all international organisations, and
nationally as well, to try to raise this issue. It is a focus, as the
noble Baroness will know, of the UN Commission on the Status of Women
in New York in March. My honourable friend Lynne Featherstone is
leading the delegation from here; that commission is focusing on
violence against women and girls. The Foreign Secretary is focusing on
this as part of our leadership of the G8 this year and, of course, it
forms part of the discussions on the MDGs as we take them forward. It
is extremely important. It is about time that it is on the agenda and
we seek to tackle it.</hs_para>

</B><B>Chidgey</B><B>:</B></Member> One of the cruellest and most
insidious forms of domestic violence is that among young girls, some as
young as four, who are subjected to female genital mutilation, or FGM,
as it is known. There are more than 100 million women in the world
suffering from the effects of that, mostly in Africa, and as many as 3
million young girls a year are at risk from this form of mutilation.
Can my noble friend the Minister say whether the Government, in their
development  
<?notus-xml column=770?>programme, are helping NGOs such as AWEPA on the ground—in the
villages and at the grass roots—to try to stop this rather
revolting and dangerous form of
mutilation?</hs_para>

this is a terrible practice, which we seek to counter both in the
United Kingdom and overseas. We are funding civil society organisations
which are working to end the practice in Ethiopia and Kenya, and my
honourable friend Lynne Featherstone is developing a major new
programme to address FGM. We know that work with communities, as my
noble friend says, including affected women and girls is key to ending
the practice. Organisations such as AWEPA, which engage
parliamentarians, are crucial in bringing about the change that we all
need to see.</hs_para>

Nye:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree that when one in
two boys and one in three girls in the UK think that there are some

society hold these points of view, and I know that it is prevalent. The
noble Baroness will be pleased to hear that today we are putting
increased effort into a teenage relationship abuse campaign, because it
is extremely important that we get across to teenagers—girls as
well as boys—that this is unacceptable and what actually
constitutes abuse so that it does not then lead on into domestic
violence. That campaign will need to be targeted in every possible

every reason to believe that only a fraction of very serious cases of
domestic violence find their way to the courts, due very probably to
the fear of reprisal, the consideration of the situation of children

Of course, this is very complex. Relationships are very complex. Quite
often, people are unwilling to come forward. If one were to apply the
same kind of test to another group—say that it was an ethnic
minority that suffered in that way—it would be crystal clear
that something was unacceptable. I think there has been something of a
sea change in the attitude of the judiciary and the police, but we need
to see that go much further. We are seeking to support those
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T11:11:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Jenkin of Kennington" PimsId="5927" UID="13021468000497" xid="2137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000497">Baroness

the campaign that is occurring today, and DfID is supporting the
campaign that will be seen in Cape Town today—which, in the
light of the news this morning, is perhaps particularly relevant. My
noble friend is right to highlight the way that we have taken this
forward; there are, for example, two specific criminal offences of
stalking that came into effect in March 2012, and the DPM announced in
September the widening of the definition of domestic violence to
include 16 to 17 year-olds and coercive behaviour. We are working very
hard to bring greater protection for victims and to bring more
offenders to justice. It is also important that we work with criminal
justice professionals to ensure proper guidance and training so that we
can support these changes in the

Walton of Detchant:</Member></B> My Lords, when the NHS began in 1948,
most major hospitals had private wards and private consulting rooms.
The great advantage of this was that they generated income which
supported the care of NHS patients. The other advantage was that the
consultants who were entitled to undertake private practice were
geographically whole time. When the late Lady Castle was the Secretary
of State, the Labour Government removed the private beds from NHS
hospitals, resulting in a massive development of private wards outside
the NHS. Are the Government now embarking on a programme to improve the
facilities for private care in the NHS, thus generating more income for
the support of NHS

domestic and international private patients, including Great Ormond

However, it is important to emphasise that Healthcare UK is about much
more than private patients. In fact, that will not be its primary
focus. It is about sharing this country’s expertise, technology
and knowledge to support healthcare systems and infrastructure with

would have to eat 500 to 600 burgers a day that are 100% horse meat to

crisis and potentially could impact on consumer confidence in the
products that we produce here in the United Kingdom. I was involved in
the 1990s in dealing with the deep concerns about food safety and the
various crises that occurred at that time. We set up internal systems
of traceability through insurance schemes. This is now known as the red
tractor scheme. This crisis has led to a much deeper level of testing
being required through DNA. That throws up a real issue around the
thresholds to which we are prepared to accept tolerance of DNA testing.
If we insist on zero tolerance, then butchers’ shops would have
real difficulty in complying. Are the Minister and the department

primogeniture in the line of succession. Secondly, it removes the bar

Throne—a legal barrier that applies to Catholics and only
Catholics and no other faith. Thirdly, it replaces the Royal Marriages
Act 1772—an Act that requires any descendent of King George II
to seek the reigning monarch's consent before marrying, without which
their marriage is void. This clause has attracted some debate. It may
help the House if I set out briefly why we have added this clause to
the other principal planks of the Bill.</hs_para>

consent but, in limiting it to the people who could feasibly assume the

issue of hereditary peerages. Moreover, there are some key differences
between the law on hereditary peerages and the rules governing
succession to the Crown. First, the Crown does not become extinct if
there are only female heirs. Secondly, the succession of the elder
daughter or her descendants is automatic in the rules governing
succession to the Crown, as indeed we saw when Her Majesty succeeded
her late father, King George VI.
Changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T11:54:49"></hs_TimeCode> to the

the legitimate expectations of those in the line of succession. Changes

the Bill would require further consultation with the realms before it
could be agreed. But that should not, and indeed it must not, prevent
us having a full debate and giving this important constitutional change
the scrutiny it deserves and requires. I fully concur with noble Lords

further issue that was raised in another place was whether the children

Roman Catholics. I should like to be clear that Roman Catholic teaching
requires the Catholic partner in a mixed marriage to do their best to
have the children raised as Catholics, but if there is a “just
and reasonable cause”, and it is certainly my view that the
protection of the place of the Established Church would qualify as a
reasonable cause, then the local bishop can grant permission for the

was also discussion in another place as to why the Royal Marriages Act

marriage of the first six in line to the Throne. I should make it clear
that the power of monarchical consent to marriage should be limited to
avoid undue restrictions and penalties on people who are not in the
immediate line of succession. However, there remains a public interest
that consent be given for the marriage of someone who may well become
our head of state. Consent of the monarch to the marriage of the first
six in line to the Throne provides, in the Government’s view, a
modernisation of the rule. Since the Royal Marriages Act was passed,
the Crown has never passed to anyone more than five steps removed from
the reigning sovereign at the time of their birth, the furthest removed
being Queen Victoria. Given that, the Government believe that the
consent for the first six in line provides sufficient proximity to the

spiritual and temporal position of our monarchy while also removing two
long-standing pieces of discrimination currently entrenched in law

line of succession. Looking back to our great female monarchs, not
least to our own sovereign, Her Majesty

the Throne being occupied by other than a member of the Church of
England. The dynamics of the Bill create an inescapable collision

neither a Catholic nor an Anglican myself, I have tried to view
objectively the potentially destructive tension that is built into the
Bill, but it seems to me that in a hereditary monarchy such as ours,
the line of succession should be secure, settled, transparent, wholly

the monarchy at risk at some time in the

would like to focus my remarks on two issues: first, the repeal of the
Royal Marriages Act 1772, which could easily have been updated and
modified, and its replacement with an arbitrary designation of the
first six persons in the line of succession as requiring the
monarch’s consent to their marriages; secondly, the change
introduced in Clause 2, which will relax the ban on marriage to
Catholics. Confining the requirement of marriage consent to six
certainly narrows the field, but it increases the focus upon them. It
thus condenses the problem. It jars with the relaxation of the ban on
marriage to Catholics in a way that is at best unsettling.</hs_para>

ask my noble and learned friend what the rationale for this number is.
In his opening speech, he mentioned Queen Victoria, who started life at
five removes from the Throne. Well, six is one more than five, but that
is hardly a considered basis for long-term constitutional change. The
Deputy Prime Minister described the decision as being arbitrary but
pragmatic. With great respect to him, I suggest that “ill
considered” and “wrong” could equally well
describe it. I believe that the number is inadequate because it does
not bring certainty. There is a tendency to think of the succession in
a linear way, with the Crown passing down tidally through the
generations, but that is not the way it happens. Initial expectations
often go unfulfilled. Henry VIII, for example, was a second son,
Charles I was a second son, George V was a second son, and George VI
was a second son.</hs_para>

in times to come, perhaps many years from now, the example of an heir

pressure is bound to grow over time to allow our sovereigns to have a
free choice of religion. Whether that is right or wrong, that would
bring with it a sea of troubles. Church and monarchy in this country
have been closely linked since almost as long as these two institutions
have existed, long pre-dating the matters that we are tinkering with in
the Bill. In each reign, the bonds are renewed and made manifest in the
coronation oath and the anointing of the new monarch. This little Bill,
hurried through Parliament, could well turn out to be a halfway house.

even in Europe rulings made by Governments about other religions, about

English Catholics of any responsibility to obey the laws of the English
realm, and indeed placed any English Catholic who so obeyed under the
possibility, indeed, the likelihood, of excommunication. It was 
<?notus-xml column=792?>that bull that was used as the justification for the rebellion against

Luce:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as a former Lord
Chamberlain of Her Majesty’s Household and I welcome this Bill.
I find it difficult to be quite as gloomy as some of the
remarks we have heard so far from noble Lords because
essentially, as the Minister said, the heart of this Bill is to remove
discrimination against females and against Roman Catholics. This issue
has been debated, as we know, over many decades. For the past three or
four decades, we have been debating this and support for this removal
of discrimination, particularly against females, has been 
<?notus-xml column=793?>widespread in Parliament and in the community. It seems that successive
Governments have waited for an event to happen in order to feel the
need to introduce measures of this kind, but I welcome them all the
same.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021468000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000143">The
strengths of the monarchy, as we know, include not only the service
that the monarch gives to the community, which is its most important
strength, but the ability of the monarchy to adapt to new
circumstances. This Bill is an indication of just that. Whether we have
had enough time to debate these issues is a matter for discussion but I
am glad that the Government are dealing with this in a typically
British, pragmatic fashion. The Bill is limited in scope, principally
because, as we have already heard, 16 realms had to be consulted and
had to pass similar measures through their legislative assemblies. That
also means that it does not tamper, I am glad to say, with the whole
question of the establishment of the Church of England, nor with the
question of succession for, for example, hereditary Peers. The
commitment goes back to October 2011 and that agreement in Perth. Once
all the Parliaments have implemented that, it will be retrospective to
that date.</hs_para>

the Bill that I would like to pursue, partly along the lines of the
issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Lang. It relates to Clause 2,
under which marriage to a Roman Catholic will no longer result in a
member of the Royal Family losing his or her place in the line of
succession. If we look back over the centuries, as we as we have
discussed, discrimination and prejudice against Roman Catholics has a
very long history. Looking at the Act of Settlement 1700, the threat to
the Throne from Louis XIV of France and the strains in those days with
Rome, I find it difficult to envisage today President Hollande posing a
similar threat to our Throne. We live in a different age of greater
tolerance between the

as the noble Lord, Lord Lang, pointed out, for children to retain their

have used the term “best endeavours” to describe that

children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T12:32:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13021468000146" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000146">We
have a precedent to go on: their Royal Highnesses Prince and Princess
Michael of Kent, who are of a mixed marriage but whose children are
both brought up in the Anglican faith. We hear that there is more
flexibility in the Roman Catholic Church on these issues. If we go back
to the Perth agreement in October 
<?notus-xml column=794?>2011, it was the former most reverend Primate the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who said that there needs to be “a
clear understanding” that the heir is brought up in the Church
of England environment. Alongside that, the Archbishop of Westminster,
Archbishop Nichols, as I think the Minister said, welcomed the
proposals and recognised the importance of the role of the Established
Church.</hs_para>

are presented with a mixed marriage and are deciding about their
children, they will be well aware that a Roman Catholic upbringing for
their child would remove their right to be monarch. However, I ask Her
Majesty’s Government whether they would consider exploring with
the Roman Catholic Church, but perhaps particularly with the Archbishop
of Westminster, whether it will clarify further its attitude to this in
order to minimise the risk of misunderstanding. I have in mind here a
statement along the lines of a reference to the importance of the role
of the Established Church; acknowledging the special circumstances that
might arise for the children of a mixed-faith marriage involving the
line of succession; referring to the precedent of Prince and Princess
Michael of Kent; and accepting that the children of such an interfaith
marriage would be likely to be brought up in the Anglican faith. I
would like see a clearer statement from the Roman Catholic Church in
order to minimise misunderstanding, and I hope that the Minister can
give us an assurance that this matter could be explored over the next
few
weeks.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_14_PT_1/75B0BBC3865069A8080F490AA4FCA4FA3F403132" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 14 February 2013">Thursday,

Lord Bishop of Worcester:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the Bill.
The Church of England, as has been intimated, is, broadly speaking,
content with the Bill as drafted. We understand the concerns expressed
by some about the fast-tracking of constitutional legislation and would
usually share them, but the Government are entitled to point out that
these proposals have been worked on over a long period, discussed
carefully with the church and, as has been observed, agreed with other
realms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000149" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000149">The
vast majority of people would surely agree that male primogeniture is
not appropriate and it is right that this should be changed. The Bill
marks a necessary stage in the evolution of the relationship between
the monarchy and the people of this country. Such evolution has helped
to ensure that the monarchy has been sustained in the affections of the
people of this nation. We are all delighted about the impending birth
of a child to the Duchess of Cambridge, and it is timely that this
change should take place
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000150" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000150">As for
male primogeniture, so for the prohibition on marrying a Roman Catholic
and remaining in the line of succession to the Throne. The relationship
between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church, as has
been pointed out in your Lordships’ Chamber, has changed
drastically, I am pleased to say, since the 15th and 16th centuries,
but it is worth noting that there has been a sea change in ecumenical
relations between the two churches in recent years, as evidenced by the
warmth of the relationship between Pope Benedict and the former most
reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, a warmth
that I would say extends over the realm. For 
<?notus-xml column=795?>example, the Archbishop of Birmingham has recently accepted my
invitation to become an honorary canon of Worcester cathedral. This

Trefgarne:</Member></B> My Lords, in rising to intervene in this
debate, let me start by saying that a powerful case can be made for the
line of descent for the Crown being through the sovereign’s
eldest child rather than the eldest son in the first instance. That
said, I am not sure that the Government have really considered all the
implications of this proposal. For example—the 
<?notus-xml column=796?>Minister referred to this—most hereditary peerages descend
through the eldest male heir, where there is one, or sideways if there
is not. Against that background, what will happen in respect of the
hereditary peerages held by the sovereign other than the Crown itself?
For example, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is also the Earl of
Chester, the Duke of Cornwall, the Duke of Rothesay, the Earl of
Carrick and Baron Renfrew. What happens to them? They are all
hereditary titles. They will also presumably descend with the Crown.
Does that mean that they will now go through the female line as the
Crown will? I hope my noble friend will be able to explain
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000157">His
Royal Highness Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh holds at least two
other hereditary titles: the Barony of Greenwich and the Earldom of
Merioneth. These, likewise, are hereditary titles which will presumably
one day be inherited by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. What
will happen to those titles thereafter if there is a female heir in due
course?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021468000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000158">If
the principle of descent through the first-born child rather than the
eldest son is important, then surely the same arguments apply in
respect of the hereditary peerage. While a very few
peerages—mostly Scottish ones—can and do descend through
the female line, most do not, but the principle is the same and ought
to be applied to hereditary peerages as to the sovereign. I hope the
Minister will be able to explain in more detail why this Bill does not
deal with hereditary peerages. I recognise that he touched on this in
his opening remarks, but this matter cannot be left
unaddressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000159">Clause
2 removes disqualification from succeeding to the Crown arising from
marriage to a Roman Catholic. Again, I am not persuaded that the
Government considered all the implications of this apparently simple
change. Is it not the case that when a Protestant marries a Roman
Catholic—the noble Lord, Lord Luce, referred to this—the
couple are required by Roman Catholic law to bring up their children as
Roman Catholics, as has been mentioned already? The pressure upon
people in a two-faith marriage to bring up their children as Catholics
is pretty strong. I know that from within my own experience. Thus it
follows, it would seem to me, that in certain circumstances the heir to
the Throne and future Supreme Governor of the Church of England could
be a Roman Catholic. Although it is apparently the case that at one
point in the Middle Ages a former Archbishop of Canterbury was
appointed to the Holy See, that is hardly a suitable
precedent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000160">Clause
3 relates to the sovereign’s consent in respect of certain royal
marriages. This provision apparently replaces earlier provisions
relating to royal marriages, mostly in the Royal Marriages Act 1772,
which is to be repealed. Has any consent required by the 1772 Act ever
been refused, and if so, what were the consequences? Under the new
arrangement, the consent, if granted, must be confirmed as provided in
Clause 3(2). Could the consents required under Clause 3, or more likely
refusal of consent, be challenged by, for example, judicial review?
Such a consent once granted cannot, I suspect, be so challenged, but
perhaps a refusal could be. I hope that my noble friend can offer some
guidance on that.</hs_para>

relates to the commencement and Short Title. This is an important
constitutional measure that changes the law going back many centuries.
For such a measure to come into force purely as and when the Lord
President may decide is, to say the least, unusual. Nobody is a greater
admirer of my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister than I
am—most of the time, anyway—but such an important
constitutional measure should surely come into force when Parliament
decides, not on the whim of a single Minister, no matter how senior.
Should the Bill not come into force on Royal Assent? I appreciate that
that cannot happen until all the Commonwealth nations have given their
formal assent, which includes parliamentary approval in most cases, so
perhaps some time ought be allowed for that, but I do not think it is
right that it should simply be decided upon by my right honourable
friend the Deputy Prime Minister.</hs_para>

I am not overly enamoured by the Bill. It seems that much of it has not
been as carefully thought through as it should have been. I referred to
the Bill coming into force. I think there ought to be a sunset clause
to the Bill so that if some of the Commonwealth nations do not decide
within a reasonable period that they wish to be guided by the

sure George Bernard Shaw and the Webbs would have been delighted if
they had known that this would happen. The Fabian Commission included
two Members of this House and a former Clerk of the Parliaments.
Indeed, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop gave evidence to it. So

the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. The Government have remembered in
the Bill to amend the Regency Act 1937 so that a person who fails to
obtain the consent of the Queen to their marriage cannot be regent.
This is reasonable. The Regency Act also prevents a Catholic from being
regent by reference to the Act of Settlement 1700. However, the Bill
provides that the Act of Settlement is now subject to the Bill. The
result is quite simple: a Catholic can now be regent.</hs_para>

that it is not quite so simple, because the Government appear to have
forgotten another Act of Parliament: the Roman Catholic Relief Act

the 1829 Act, we will have one Act that allows a Catholic to be regent,
and one that does not. I do not know if anyone will brief me to apply
for judicial review if we ever have a regent, but it seems that this is

opposite view—that six is too large a number—on an
entirely different point of principle. However, we should be able to
debate this issue and determine it in relation to this Bill. It is a
right in modern times for a man and a woman to marry whom they wish.
Indeed, according to my rather dog-eared copy, the European Convention
on Human Rights did not design that right but it makes clear that that
right exists, not just in the United Kingdom but throughout the

marrying whom they wish is quite an intervention in their human rights.
To extend it to as many as six people is to extend it too far. I say to
my noble friend Lord Lang that we live in a different era from the one
in which Queen Victoria became the monarch. I have my doubts as to
whether what happened then could happen now, or is in the realms of
reality given the welcome size of our modern Royal

I suspect that the Government may have forgotten another law. Even
before the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the sovereign had a right, and
exercised it, not under statute but under the common law, to prevent
marriages of other members of the Royal Family—for example, to
prevent a dowager Queen from remarrying. It is possible that that right
still applies and that, under the common law, the sovereign could
enforce his or her consent in the case of the marriages of brothers,
sisters, cousins et cetera. Therefore, I respectfully suggest to my
noble friend the Minister that any anomaly in the common law should be
abolished in this Bill so that we do not have another unforeseen
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T12:59:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000185">My
fourth point arises mainly from the fact that I was brought up in east
Lancashire in the county palatine, where at every dinner I would be
shocked if I did not hear the loyal toast made to the Queen, the Duke
of Lancaster. Of course, that is a sovereign’s title, but there
are other titles which the sovereign’s eldest child inherits,
which already have been mentioned by my noble friend Lord Trefgarne. I
would have drawn particular attention to the Duchy of Cornwall and, as
someone who represented a constituency in mid-Wales, the earldom of
Merionethshire, which is regarded with great value in that beautiful,
if hard to access, part of rural

understand why the Government do not want to get involved in this Bill

would not wish to interfere. But surely we could engage in titles that

if it needs adding, that what I say represents my own views alone. I
share the general view that any constitutional change needs to be
approached with great caution and infinite care. Laws and conventions
shaped by centuries of history should not be idly adjusted according to
fashion or passing trend. Much hard thought needs to be given to
digging deep into the longer term or the indirect effects of doing
things differently.</hs_para>

is essential to ensure that what may seem to be the benefits of
constitutional change are not in fact outweighed by unforeseen,
unintended or undesirable consequences. This is certainly the case with
such a central element of our constitution as the laws of succession to
the Crown. The issues around change in this area are perhaps compounded
by the fact that the Queen is Queen not only of this country but of
15 other realms. Changing the rules is not a matter for us
alone. If such a change is to work, 16 realms need to be signed up.
This makes it a complicated matter and one not to be undertaken
lightly. I can understand why Governments in the past may have left

me comment briefly on three elements of the Bill. Central is the change
to the existing system of male preference primogeniture; male heirs
take precedence in the line of succession over their female siblings,
regardless of relative ages. In this day and age, I do not think that
most people would consider this to be fair. If in the future within the
line of succession a younger son were to take precedence over an older
daughter, it would seem to be at least controversial and at worst
discriminatory, out of date and out of touch. To make this change now,
therefore, strengthens the monarchy because it avoids any risk of such
deep
controversy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000193">However,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:06:27"></hs_TimeCode>there are of
course consequences that need to be worked through. As many noble Lords
have already mentioned, there are the rules governing royal titles and
the much wider question of succession to hereditary peerages. I do not
think that there is a problem with the Duchy of Lancaster, which
remains with the sovereign whether male or female. As to the Duchy of
Cornwall, I draw attention to the fact that the financial aspects of
the duchy and parity were foreseen and are covered in the Sovereign
Grant Act
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000194">On
succession to hereditary peerages, the Government have stated that
changing the rules governing succession to hereditary titles would be
more complicated to implement fairly, which is probably an
understatement but prudent. I think most people will understand that it
is reasonable to ring-fence issues of royal succession from these
difficult wider
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000195">Clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:07:42"></hs_TimeCode>
2 has been the subject of much of this debate. There is a balance to be
struck between reducing discrimination against Roman Catholicism while
at the same time upholding the position of the Church of England as the
established church. On reflection, I support this change, and I declare
an interest as a member of the Church of England and that my wife is
Catholic. The law against the heir to the Throne marrying a Catholic
has looked ever more anomalous in our increasingly multifaith society,
as there is no such ban on him or her marrying someone from any other
faith. Clause 2 removes this ancient bar, which might be seen at best
as a historical curiosity and at worst as specific
discrimination.</hs_para>

I would argue that there is a much more positive reason for welcoming
this change. The legislation as it stands limits, in perhaps a
significant way, the choice of a lifelong partner, husband or wife, for
the heir to the Throne, who is destined to take on the
onerous responsibilities of being the monarch of our country. Removing
this limitation might make it just a little easier for him or her to
find that ideal partner and a source of lifetime love and support in
his or her difficult calling. That is in all our interests, and it is
why I believe that, despite the difficulties that we have heard about
today, this change strengthens the institution of monarchy and makes
the world a little

raises the question of whether the children of an Anglican-Catholic
mixed marriage would be raised within the Anglican faith. I have
listened with great interest to the most interesting contribution by
the noble Lord, Lord Lang, on this. It is my understanding that over
the years the Catholic Church has become more flexible on this issue.
However, I draw attention to what my noble friend Lord Luce said: we
need to 
<?notus-xml column=803?>look at whether ways can be found to ensure greater certainty that an
heir to the Throne does not have to choose between the Throne and his
or her faith. I am strengthened in the belief that this can be done

third element of the Bill, the repealing of the Royal Marriages Act
1772, seems to be an obvious rationalisation, and I think is widely
supported. Most of the discussion has focused on whether the
sovereign’s permission to marry should be required at all and,
if so, why it should be the first six in the line of
succession<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:11:15"></hs_TimeCode>. I
have heard the arguments that no one should be prevented from marrying
in this way, but my reading of the Bill is that failure to obtain
permission simply means that the person and the person’s
descendants are no longer in the line of succession, not that they
cannot marry at all. I would argue that the retention of this element
of permission is recognition that the choice of partner by someone who
may become our sovereign is not simply a private choice; there are
wider consequences for the Royal Family and for the country. To have
that seeking of permission is what I would describe as something of a
pause button, and it may not be out of place. I look forward to hearing
what the Minister has to say about whether six is the right number of
people who must seek that
permission<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:12:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000199" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000199">In
conclusion, I look forward to supporting this Bill. It is an example of
evolutionary and incremental constitutional change, and I welcome it.
One of the great strengths of the monarchy is its ability to change and

it came as no surprise at all when this coalition ministry decided that
the immensely popular marriage of the second in line to the Throne
should be followed by fundamental reforms of the monarchy, which had
been under discussion for some years—indeed, as the noble Lord,
Lord Luce, reminded us, for decades. The reforms overturn some of the
principles on which our monarchy has rested, for the most part
securely, since the Reformation nearly five centuries ago, principles
strengthened and extended under the 1689 settlement. The changes are
therefore of profound

nation’s heritage: the Duchies of Cornwall, Lancaster and
Normandy; the Scottish titles of Rothesay, Carrick, Renfrew, Lord of
the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland; and the title of

Mr Ben Wallace, who contributed so powerfully to the debates on the

about the historic title, Lord of Mann? The people of the Channel
Islands will want to know whether there are any implications of change

The country is not short of learned peerage lawyers; should they not
now be consulted? For in all this is there not a clear principle to be
identified and upheld: that any woman who is first heir to, and then
succeeds to, the Throne as Queen of our country under the terms of this
legislation must possess and enjoy all the titles, dignities and

third and final consequence of this legislation on which I would like
to touch differs from the other two in that it has not so far been
evaded or left in a vague condition by the Government. Here again, I
follow my noble friend Lord Trefgarne. As soon as the Government made
clear their intention to set aside the principle of male primogeniture
in the royal succession, they were at once asked whether this hallowed
principle would also be endangered in respect of hereditary peerages.
They replied that this was an entirely separate issue, which they had
no plans to address. That at once raises the spectre of acute
disagreement at the centre of the Royal Family itself. It would be
wholly unsurprising if, in the years to come, Lady Louise Windsor, the
first-born child of the Earl of Wessex, did not view with perfect
equanimity the prospect of the succession of her younger brother to the
earldom when the principle of male primogeniture had been set aside in
the main line of royal succession. The wider ramifications are already
obvious. This legislation has given determined ladies of blue blood and
their male supporters the opportunity to secure greater publicity than
ever before for the incompatibility between the principle of the
equality of the sexes and the rules of succession attached to the
overwhelming majority of hereditary
peerages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:23:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000214" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000214">The

the Bill. My peerages currently descend 
<?notus-xml column=807?>on the same pattern as the monarchy. My grandmother, who held the
titles, was a campaigner for gender equality, as was my mother, who
held the titles after her, and, indeed, my father, so it is not
surprising that I think that it is wonderful to have lived the past
60 years in a period of such change and progress. We clearly
have some way to go yet and I do not think we have yet realised what
the full consequences of gender equality will be, but we have made
great progress. It is wonderful to be standing here at last
contemplating the change to the succession of the Crown, which means
that our head of state will now enjoy the same gender equality that the
rest of us expect in the course of our ordinary

is important to focus also on the tidying up that follows this crucial
change. Generally, it is never good enough to think that we have got
80% of the way on gender equality and we should be satisfied with that.
The Church of England will be aware of how difficult it is to tidy up
some of the difficult corners of this matter. None the less, we must do
it because until the symbolism of male dominance is gone we will not
have granted gender

of my noble friends have touched on the subject of the hereditary

Office. It will not be debated in this Session but I hope that we will
get around to it in the next. This is a difficult area, as several
noble Lords have mentioned, not least because one is dealing with a
succession of expectations. This Bill is well timed for the monarchy
because we know exactly what the expectations are, but you cannot
spread that over 1,000 plus hereditary peerages, let alone the
baronetage, which probably ought to be wound up in it too. There are
also in many cases, but, sadly, not mine, substantial properties tied
up with titles. One does not want to do something which means that
those diverge any more than we want the hereditary titles to diverge
from the

suspected that we would reform this House a couple of years after 1999.
I have been proved very wrong on that and perhaps the present system
will see me out, but eventually we will get around to it. Even if
hereditary Peers have no place in this House as of right, it is still a
considerable thing to be called “Lord” or
“Sir” because so many people now have these titles
through their own virtue. For that matter, I imagine that it is a great
thing to be called a duke,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:28:23"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
useful. It opens doors. On one occasion my wife rang The Ivy to see
whether there was a table. She used her maiden name of Rubinstein and
they said no, so she got her assistant to ring up five minutes later
and ask whether Lord Lucas might have a table. The answer was yes, so
titles, even those which are unearned, are not without consequence in
this world. They are part of the historical pattern of the nation. As
someone who enjoys having a title but also appreciates that in others,
I think it is a nice part of the fabric of the nation which should not
be largely restricted to men. This is a reform which we should seek to
make. The imperfection in the Bill, in that it does not deal with the
royal hereditary titles, gives me hope that the Government may find the
motivation to support my Bill, or something like it, in the next

whatever we discuss in the longer term, as my noble friend Lady Hayter
said, the Queen has a fine record in what she has done and does, but
that should not prevent us from having a full discussion about the role
of the monarch and the established church. In addition to the contents
of the three main clauses, I have concerns about the requirement to
seek approval of certain legislation from the Queen or the Prince of
Wales if it affects their private interests. I have a problem with why
they should get that consideration but other people with private
interests do not. It is reported—because one never officially
hears about these things—that the Queen actually blocked a Bill
some years ago that would have required Parliament to vote before the
Government declared war. That is a serious issue; the Bill is one of
the few that clearly needs the Queen’s approval, and that is
appropriate.</hs_para>

role of the monarch and a constitutional monarchy, I have always had
worries about why so many members of the Royal Family, 12 of
them, get free travel around the country—usually in a helicopter
because we are told that it is needed for security and they have to get
to the next fete opening more quickly. From what I remember from when I
was a kid, the King, the Queen Mother and their two daughters when they
grew up were the only ones who performed any serious royal duties. I am
sure that they had their travel paid for, but is it right that the
taxpayer should fund all this? I make the comparison with dear Queen
Beatrix of the Netherlands, who announced her retirement and abdication
last week and is regularly seen going around Amsterdam on a bicycle,
whereas our lot, depending on their status, have either five or three
motorcycle escorts. I can understand why the security people recommend
that because it means more jobs for them, but is it all necessary, or
is it hyped up a

succession issue in Clause 1. This is clearly a good thing. I am not
going to get involved in the debate about the succession to peerages,
although some of my cousins were splashed across the <I>Sunday
Times</I> last weekend—that is fine. I do not know whether the
succession of a peerage goes along with succession of property; I am no
expert. However, the noble Lord, Lord Lexden, mentioned the question
about the Duchy of Cornwall and whether a female heir would become the
Duchess of Cornwall and the Princess of Wales. The Duchy of Cornwall is
a bit of a money-spinner because its annual accounts for 2011-12 show a
total income of £26.5 million, of which £18.3 million is
surplus, distributable to His Royal Highness. That 70% profit in any
other business would normally attract a very large amount of tax,
unless one was on a tax fiddle—which I am sure does not apply in
this 
<?notus-xml column=809?>case. However, it is questionable why anyone in the Royal Family should
have this benefit when other landowners do not. There is a strong
argument for merging the duchy with the Crown Estates and ensuring that
the money allocated to the monarch for public duties also covers the
eldest child. The only other organisation that I can think of that
makes such hefty profits is the Macquarie Bank, which we mentioned in a
debate in your Lordships’ House last week. There is time to look
at issues such as that and perhaps make proposals in the long
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:34:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

succession, I hope that gender does not matter, but there has been the
resignation of the Pope this week. It made me think of the story of the
female Pope, if it is true, back in 800 AD. She was found out only when
she had a baby that fell from underneath her surplice or cassock, or
whatever it is called. Ever since then, there has apparently been a
medical method of checking whether the Pope is a man or woman. I do not
think that they have found any women since then. I do not even know if
the story is true, but in Tudor times it was normal to have a Minister
present when the Queen had a baby, just to check that it was in the
proper line of succession. It may well be, if we are that keen to make
sure that one inherits after the other in the proper succession, that
the modern equivalent would be a DNA test on the heir to the throne
before they succeed. As a noble Lord said earlier, we need certainty,
and that would certainly confirm the lineage of the prospective heir to
the Throne.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0001.htm#13021468000225">As
to whether the monarch can marry a Roman Catholic, I have listened
carefully to the debate and I really cannot see what difference the
religion of the head of state makes. We can consider the latest surveys
of the proportion of people who go to which church and so on, but, as
the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, reminded us, there are two established
churches in this country—the Welsh have been sensible and do not
have one, as far as I know. It is quite possible to separate the head
of the Church of England from the monarch. An election could be
interesting if the church decided to do that, and I suppose that the
alternative is the Catholic way of going into a huddle and then
producing a smoke signal when you have chosen someone. However, it does
not make any difference to the monarch or the churches whether they are

they have to give themselves permission to divorce and remarry? It is
an interesting question and I am sure that the Minister will be able to
give me an answer. It is pretty odd that the whole edifice of the
monarch and the constitution relies on who they are permitted to marry.
What happens if the heir becomes King or Queen and then decides to get
married? I suppose that he or she would have to take the advice of the
Prime Minister of the day in considering whether the future bride or
bridegroom was suitable and, presumably, came from the right background

out, even after the passage of the Bill, it will not come into force
until, under Clause 5, an award is made by the Lord
President of the Council. Why does the Deputy Prime Minister want to
retain this power? I presume it is because of possible delays in
Commonwealth Parliaments. Should not the Bill come into force only
after the countries involved have all passed their retrospective

I said, the Bill will allow the heir to the Throne to marry a Catholic

Church’s canon law to promise to try to bring up their children
in the Catholic faith. That is absolutely clear from talking to any
member of that faith. Should that happen, it will cause upset and
distress to all those involved. Should the heir to the Throne wish the
child to be brought up a Catholic, either we will have to disestablish
the church or the child will lose the right to succeed. I am sure that
noble Lords can imagine the outcry there would be in this country if
the then Archbishop of Canterbury tried to stop the heir to the Throne
succeeding because he or she was of the wrong religion. It simply would
not make sense in modern Britain—in particular as, under current

that the Bill seeks to establish. However, as we have heard this

serious doubts about whether we in this House have the legitimacy to

reasoning is that I believe very strongly that we have been caught
out—as I always feared that one day we would, although no other

us to decide whether this is in breach of the coronation oath. I submit
that it is, and therefore that any noble Lord who votes for the Bill
now should walk through the Lobby and out of the front door and should

my noble friend Lady Perry. She said: “You’ve got it

it any time we want. We need have no concern about what is in the

further reflection, and having taken further advice, I decided that
they were both wrong—and I will show why in a moment. I sat down

said: “Yes, you are definitely going down the path of
treason”. I do not wish to commit treason, but the situation at
the moment with the Bill is that if we are to proceed, we need to know
what we are doing in the context of the delegation of the prerogative.
I can think of only four reasons why we might have it, and this is
where I am treasonous. The first, I believe, is that Her Majesty might
very well have decided that this was an issue of such public concern
and interest that it should not fall to any member of the Royal Family

I said, 325 years ago, William and Mary accepted the throne. The

the Declaration of Rights. Every aspect that is supported by that oath

present law, whereby an elder daughter is displaced as heir to the
Throne by the birth of her younger brother is an affront to women
throughout this nation and the Commonwealth. Of itself, it damages the
identification between the monarchy and the people, particularly women,
as the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, movingly pointed out. I am
delighted that we are to change
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:59:23"></hs_TimeCode>. It is also a
great tribute to the Commonwealth as an institution that we are

for a moment the important constitutional point made by the noble Lord,
Lord James of Blackheath, who has explained why he believes that this
Bill is a breach of Her Majesty’s coronation oath and therefore,
for us, a breach of our oaths of allegiance. As I understand his
argument, he believes that because the Declaration of Rights in 1688
obliges the monarch to reject Roman Catholicism, it follows that she
would be in breach of her oath by assenting to this Bill. In my view,
the noble Lord’s argument gives insufficient weight to the
doctrine of the sovereignty of Parliament and to the general rule that
Parliament cannot bind its successors. The Declaration of Rights, made
on the arrival of Prince William and Princess Mary in the kingdom, did
not of itself have the force of law, as has been pointed out. It was
enacted as an Act of Parliament as the Bill of Rights in 1689 and has
been an important part of our constitutional settlement ever since. It
is true that it was expressed as intended to remain the law of this
realm for ever. However, the doctrine that Parliament cannot bind its
successors was already well established by the late 17th century. In
fact, the Bill of Rights has already been amended on a number of
occasions. In the context of this Bill, the most notable amendment was
made by the Act of Settlement 1700, just a decade or so after the Bill
of
Rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T12:40:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:01:07"></hs_TimeCode>—</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000259" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000259"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord James of Blackheath" PimsId="5103" UID="13021468000610" xid="1943" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000610">Lord
James of Blackheath:</Member></B> My Lords, I had anticipated the
argument concerning the alteration of the Declaration of Rights, but I
think that the only occasion on which it has ever actually been amended
was in 1825 when it was found that there were insufficient jurors
available to fulfil the obligation to run the courts. On
that occasion the threshold for serving on a jury was
reduced to include £10 rental holders. Nothing else has
been
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:01:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, I am afraid that I
disagree with the noble Lord because the Act of Settlement expressly
changed the line of succession by introducing the Electress of Hanover,
who was a 
<?notus-xml column=816?>granddaughter of James I and the mother of George I, into the succession
just 10 years or so after the Bill of Rights was passed. A further
amendment to the Bill of Rights was unwittingly mentioned by the noble
Lord in the form of the Accession Declaration Act 1910 which
brought in the very declaration he has read out to noble Lords. It
changed the coronation oath which had been prescribed by the Bill of
Rights. The present declaration, which he read out, reflects the
present position: the sovereign promises to uphold only the enactments
that procure the Protestant succession to the Throne. There is nothing
inconsistent in this Bill with that declaration, and I have absolutely
no doubt that this Parliament is as entitled to enact this Bill now as
was the Parliament convened in 1689 to enact the Bill of
Rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the arrangements made for succession in the other royal houses of
Europe. The position is as follows. Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg,
Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands all adhere to equal primogeniture,
with no male preference. Indeed, in Sweden the heiress apparent is a
woman, Crown Princess Victoria, who will become Queen of Sweden in due
course. She was born in 1977 as the eldest child of King Carl Gustav.
Her younger brother Carl was born in 1979, and Princess Victoria only
became heiress apparent again in 1980 as the result of a similar change
in the law to that which we are enacting now. I suggest that this
demonstrates that it is plainly preferable to make such a change as
this in advance, if we can.</hs_para>

Monaco and Spain have male-preference primogeniture as we do at
present, although in Monaco the next in line is actually a woman,
Prince Albert’s elder sister, because Prince Albert has, as yet,
no legitimate children. Spain also plans to change its rules of
succession in the same way as we are now. This will entail a
constitutional amendment which needs to be passed by both Spanish
Houses of Parliament with a two-thirds majority in each House, and then
it would be put to a referendum. This has not happened yet, perhaps
owing to the requirement in Spain that when a major constitutional
change is passed, Parliament must be dissolved and new elections
called. However, the proposed change in the law enjoys widespread
public support in Spain, notwithstanding the difficulty caused by the
fact that Juan Carlos’s two eldest children are women, and it is
their younger brother who is currently his
heir.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000263" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000263">Without
getting too technical, Liechtenstein has an old system of succession
called agnatic primogeniture which completely excludes women from the
order of succession. This was specifically criticised by a United
Nations committee looking at gender equality in 2007. Luxembourg used
the same system until June 2011, when equal primogeniture was
introduced. As here, this change made no difference to the immediate
order of succession, so Luxembourg is a good example of a country which
has reformed its rules even more significantly than we are doing now.
All this goes to show that the present succession arrangements for our
monarchy and our Commonwealth are well behind the times.</hs_para>

of the ban on the monarch and his or her heirs to the Throne marrying
Roman Catholics. One can see that the monarch’s position as 
<?notus-xml column=817?>Supreme Governor of the Church of England suggests, even if it does not
dictate, certainly for the time being, that he or she must be a
Protestant. However, there can be no justification for any religious
discrimination going beyond that requirement, and the Bill rightly
gives effect to that principle. Clearly, marriage to a Catholic would
present a monarch or an heir to the Throne with a stark choice, a
difficulty even, in respect of the children. However, my view is that
the approach of my noble friend Lord Lang of Monkton sacrifices the
principles of tolerance and understanding that are enshrined in this
Bill on the rather hard altar of certainty and stability, as he put it.
For myself, I prefer the approach of the noble Lords, Lord Luce and
Lord Janvrin, which I believe may in time lead to an accommodation
being reached on this issue. I have to say that the intervention of my
noble friend Lady Falkner on my noble friend Lord Lexden raised an
interesting point. She pointed out that there is no bar to the monarch
being married to a Muslim and that there are similar rules for Muslims
on the upbringing of the children of such a marriage as there are for
marriages between Protestants and Catholics. Exactly the same issues
would arise with such a marriage as would arise with a marriage to a
Catholic. That simply highlights the anomalies of the present rules,
the fact that they are rooted in history, and the need for these
changes to help our country to continue to evolve in a tolerant and
non-discriminatory
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000265" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000265">Before

Thomas of Swynnerton:</Member></B> My Lords, even as the 18th speaker
in this distinguished and very interesting debate, I have an
observation to make about each of the questions at issue. The first is
what happens when an heir to the Throne marries a Catholic. I believe
that that is the most difficult question because, as the last speaker
pointed out, it will cause difficulties. However, I would suggest to
noble Lords that they are not impossible to overcome. Perhaps we should
approach the issue in the spirit of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord
Luce, who pointed out that it would be desirable for discussions
between the Church of England and the Church of Rome to be held now on
what might be done in those
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:08:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021468000267" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000267">The second question
relates to the number of people who have to ask permission to marry if
they are close to the succession. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, thought
it intolerable that anyone should have to ask permission as to whom
they should marry, but the noble Lord, Lord Lang of Monkton, in a
far-reaching and important speech, thought that 12 would be a good
limit. I am also of that point of view. However, perhaps we could
arrange a compromise whereby the number of people to consult relates to
the number of descendants of the reigning monarch. Thus, if, for
example, as is now the case, the monarch has eight grandchildren, there
should be eight persons who should ask permission to marry X or Y.
Given that there have been many occasions in 
<?notus-xml column=818?>the past when monarchs have had many children—Queen Victoria had
nine; it is difficult to remember quite how many King George III had
but it was certainly more than that—I feel that it would be
desirable to consider a figure larger than
six<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:10:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the gender of the heir to the Throne. Of course, this is an appropriate
change and it takes into account all the attitudes that enlightened
people have these days. However, I think it is fair to say that, had we
done this in the past, we would have lost a certain number of important
monarchs. I do not suggest at all that we have had bad female monarchs,
but we have had monarchs who would not have succeeded in the
circumstances that are now being suggested. For example, King Edward
VII was the second child of Queen Victoria. Both Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert would very much have preferred their eldest daughter,
Vicky, to be the heir to the Throne, and that is one reason why they
treated Bertie so badly in the early days. It is fair to speculate what
would have happened if King Edward VII had not been King. I can
certainly suggest that the entente cordiale, which he so greatly and
beneficially influenced, would not have come about had it been up to
Vicky to arrange it. Of course, she would not have married a German
emperor if she had been the heiress but, still, it is most doubtful
whether she would have gone over to Paris and had the benign and
creative relationships which King Edward VII
had<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:12:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

as the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, pointed out, King Henry VIII was not
the eldest son. In fact, he was the third child. He had an older
sister, Margaret, who became Queen of Scotland. She married the King of
Scotland, who died at the Battle of Flodden—a battle whose
memory we shall no doubt be commemorating at an appropriate point in
the next few months. Although I hesitate to suggest someone so far back
in history, King Alfred was the younger brother of Ethelswith, a lady
who would have taken the position he had if we had had in 860 the rules

the haste when the legislation is not to commence immediately? Not only
do many of the Commonwealth Governments have to pass the law through

countries, referenda will also be necessary to approve the legislation.
The Government’s case for fast-tracking is also weakened as
Clauses 1 to 3 have elements of retrospectivity.</hs_parafo>

possible faults in Clause 3 regarding the number of six
persons, and to emphasise that even before the Act of 1772 the
sovereign had a right under common law to prevent marriages of other
members of the Royal Family, such as the Queen Mother, from remarrying.

Bill leaves unresolved a number of consequential matters which it

girl, thanks to the Bill she can become Queen. However, she cannot of
right become of Duchess of Cornwall because the charter of 1377
governing the duchy provides only for a male. What is the situation
about her becoming Princess of Wales? Secondly, the Bill seeks to
remove anti-Catholic legislation preventing the sovereign having a
Catholic wife. This is all well and good. It is obvious, as
Mr McBain says, that legislation preventing Catholics and
Jewish people from holding other state positions on account of their
religion should be abolished. The Government have forgotten about the
Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829—for instance, not allowing the
Lord Chancellor to be a Catholic—and the Jews Relief
Act 1858. These Acts will have to be repealed at some stage
as they prevent Catholics and Jews from holding other offices. This

necessary to address the question. That at least is required as a
gesture towards those of us who feel that the timetable at the moment
is far too fast. I have bored your Lordships too long. I hope that I
have reassured you a little; I have certainly reassured myself quite a
lot.</hs_para>

say that we are an anomaly. The difficulty comes when we seek to right
that anomaly, and that is the problem with which we are faced. We can
live with things because they work, until we decide to put them right

is a simple way forward, which is to recognise that the head of state

Catholic and head of the Church of England. The dreadful William of
Orange was technically a Calvinist and lot of other things as well, and
he was the head of the Church of England. George I, who could hardly
have understood the liturgy of the Church of England, was a Lutheran
and was head of the Church of England. Indeed, we have those problems
here today. The Church of England does not technically recognise the
orders of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, yet it has allowed its
head to communicate in a church whose very ceremonies it holds to be
invalid. If that cannot be the basis of sorting this problem out, I
really do not understand it. What worries me is that we are not saying
that this is the moment to see the monarchy again as the symbol of

useful and important points. Although not all have been within the
scope of the Bill, many of them ought to be addressed. Having said
that, I fully understand why the Government may not wish to address
them today, or even in the short term. At least on the evidence of
today’s debate, and particularly on the evidence of the words

Bill is a piecemeal assemblage. Given the nature of the uncodified UK
constitution, it is probably inevitable that, when we have the
opportunity to tinker with the constitution, that is indeed what we do.

<?notus-xml column=825?>However, as several noble Lords and particularly the noble Lord, Lord
Lang of Monkton, said, in our work in this House we need a sense of the
principles and what the underlying proposals would lead to in the long

measure. I think he goes along with the fact that this is an important,
significant constitutional matter. I do not want to make too much of
this issue, as we are going through all the stages in your
Lordships’ House, but we should take from this the fact that
using the expedited procedure for constitutional measures is, in
principle, regrettable. It is to be hoped that the Government do not

noble Lords drew attention to the mechanics that underlie this Bill. I
should put on record the fact that I had some involvement with those
mechanics when I was working in Downing Street a few years ago. As we
understand it, the whole point of consulting the other 15 states who
have the Queen as head of state was to ensure that common action was
agreed, which was necessary to avoid a situation in which different
people emerge as monarchs in different states because there had been no
uniform change to the succession rules. We also understand that the UK
had to go first to blaze the trail, although some states will not have
to legislate at all because their constitutions automatically accept
whoever is the legitimate successor in the UK. Can the Minister,
therefore, tell us how far we have got with simultaneous ratification
in the other realms? I would like to follow up the suggestion of the
noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, that the Minister should say what would
happen to the Government’s plans if several states—or
even one of them—that have to legislate, fail to do so
successfully?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000312" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000312">I
appreciate that the agreed retrospection to 28 October 2011
removes the most urgent time pressures but it would be unfortunate if
changes that we agree upon here are effectively negatived by what
happens in other realms. I understand, for example, that the proposed
method of proceeding in Canada may be inconsistent with what
one—clearly favoured—reading of its constitution
considers to be the right course. Perhaps the Minister could advise us
of whether there is any recent information on that point.</hs_para>

change to gender-neutral primogeniture for royal succession is welcome
and, despite the safety net of retrospection to 28 November 2011, there
is a clear case for settling the matter before the delivery of the
Duchess of Cambridge’s child later this year. However, although
the change to gender neutrality demonstrates our monarchy’s
protean ability to move with the times, a primogeniture rule is a
pretty 
<?notus-xml column=826?>rum way of selecting people for any job, let alone head of state. Of
course, it is not an unqualified rule, as we prioritise adherence to a
particular religion more highly than personal merit, which is a
trade-off that was certainly important to us in the past, but has
surely lost its rationale in the present. Having said that, our present
monarch has conducted herself impeccably, and has set what we must hope
is an entrenched example that will be emulated by her successors. Of
course, it is highly relevant that the modern monarchy has no executive
functions, even if it retains many public
roles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000314" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000314">On
whether there is a possible read-across from royal primogeniture to a
peerage succession, the Government’s argument is that Crown and
peerage primogeniture are distinct. We agree that, as things stand,
Crown succession must and can never fail but there is no public
interest to be served by putting peerages in the same position. To my
mind, regardless of questions of legitimate expectations and private
law arrangements being invaded by unforeseeable changes in the
succession rules, anxieties about peerage succession can serve only to
raise the question of why hereditary peerages should continue at all,
let alone in this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000315" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000315">That is

deal with the argument for change in the peerage succession rules,
admirably put forward by a number of noble Lords but also by a number

your Lordships. They argue, and I agree with them, that the lack of a Y

the issue of religious tests, I am sure that the whole House welcomes
the proposal to permit the sovereign to marry a catholic, which at
least gets rid of one of the most visible bars to full Roman Catholic
participation in our society. However, because abolishing this
disqualification leaves untouched the remaining Catholic
disqualifications, the question that naturally follows is: why should
any remain? After all, it will still be the case that the monarch
cannot be a Catholic and will also have to be “in communion
with” the Church of England. As we have heard, this latter rule
means that, even if all the explicit bans on Catholics succeeding were
repealed, an implicit ban would remain, and it is not much of a
consolation that the ban includes everyone else not “in
communion”, that is non-Trinitarian Christians, all
non-Christian believers and all

customary defence to preserving the explicit and implicit Catholic bans
is that repeal would be incompatible with the monarch remaining Supreme
Governor of the Church of England, a title which derives from Section 8
of the Supremacy Act 1558. In practice, all senior diocesan and
cathedral appointments 
<?notus-xml column=827?>are now made by the Church of England in a situation where the
recommendations of its committees are waved through by the Prime
Minister on their way to the sovereign. All measures require prior
parliamentary approval and all canons the prior approval of Ministers.
The actual content of the supremacy is therefore largely formal and the
church is, in practice,
autonomous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000319" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000319">We

understanding that there are two possible ways of proceeding. We could
do a wholesale statutory repeal or we could do a minimal change to the
law combined with changes of practice. The first would require the
repeal of all the relevant statutes. But there are precedents for that
as we repealed, in an appropriate time and an appropriate way, the
legislation disestablishing the Church in Ireland in 1869 and in Wales
in 1914. How far and how deeply statutory reform would need to reach
would depend on what, if any, roles the church wished to retain in
England and Parliament was content to continue. This route would be
technically laborious but not impossible and perhaps best undertaken by
the church itself in stages, proposing the means by way of synodical
measure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000322" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000322">The
second method would be to proceed by minimal repeal; that is by
repealing the prohibitions against Catholics and the requirements for
the monarch to be in communion with the church, and amending the
accession declaration oath. This would remove the compulsory religious
qualifying link between the sovereign and the church and yet permit, as
a matter of practice, the remaining formal functions to be regarded as
the involvement of a friendly but non-confessional royal patronage
towards one of the most ancient of national institutions. As the noble
Lord, Lord Deben, has just said, free to adopt any belief system they
wished, sovereigns could remain Anglicans if they individually desired
but the compulsory link would be abolished and the way cleared for them
to choose freely like everyone else. At the same time, all belief
systems would thus become equal under the sovereign and, while there
would be recognition of Anglicanism’s historic presence, that
church would no longer have an entrenched constitutional role in
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000323" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000323">The

third part of the Bill deals with royal approval for marriage. It is a
bit of a surprise to find that this subject occupies more of the Bill
than the other provisions put together. Many noble Lords have expressed
concern about the fact that that tidying-up exercise raises the
question of whether royal consent should be required for
anyone’s marriage in the first place. Although the 1772 Act
machinery would have been an important element in, for example,
Princess Margaret’s decision not to marry Group Captain
Townsend, the objection that he was a divorced man would now perhaps
not feature as an insuperable

other targets of unsuitability are thought to have force. If so, what

forthcoming in both countries? Repeal of the clumsy—some would
say vindictive and heavy-handed—1772 Act is clearly
an advance, above all in the way in which the new system will not
invalidate marriages where prior royal consent is not obtained. On the
other hand, it would be helpful to know exactly in what circumstances
the Government envisage that that consent would be withheld. Can the
noble and learned Lord confirm that consent will be withheld only
following and on the advice of Ministers; or where there is a well
founded personal objection to an intended spouse by reason of their
past conduct or present associations being likely to bring the

succession to the Crown will result in any other royal titles becoming
detached from the Crown. The Duchy of Lancaster is held by the
sovereign. We are confident that the Duchy must remain with whomsoever
is the monarch. Clearly, the monarch at the moment being a Queen has
not created any difficulty in the Duchy of Lancaster being held by the

regard to the Dukedom of Cornwall, at present, the title can pass only
to the son and heir of the monarch. Thus, when Her Majesty was the heir
presumptive, as Princess Elizabeth, she did not hold the title of Duke
of Cornwall. Therefore, we believe that where there is a female heir,
the title could not pass to a younger brother and would not detach from
the royal line. I assure the House that, in any event, a female heir
apparent will not find herself at a financial disadvantage because, as
the noble Lord, Lord Janvrin, pointed out, the Sovereign Grant Act 2011
ensures that financial provision equivalent to the income from the
Duchy is made for the heir apparent. The title would not therefore be
automatically inherited by a daughter; the Duchy would go into
abeyance, as indeed happened when Her Majesty was Princess Elizabeth
and was heir presumptive. Provision is made under the Sovereign Grant
Act for the financial consequences that flow from that.</hs_para>

become so on the accession of the Queen. I think he was created Prince
of Wales in 1958 and that his investiture was some 11 years later. It
would be a matter for Her Majesty and I do not think we should be

regard to the royal titles in Scotland, a number of contributors, not
least my noble friend Lord Trefgarne, pointed out that the peerage
rules in Scotland are somewhat more generous to women, in some cases
anyway. It is certainly our view that in the event of an elder sister
becoming heir apparent, the Scottish titles currently held by the
Prince of Wales—namely, the Prince and Great Steward of
Scotland, the Duke of Rothesay, the Earl of Carrick, Lord of the Isles
and Baron of Renfrew—can pass automatically to a female heir
apparent. These titles have always hung together and the removal of
male bias in the line of succession could therefore not result in the
detachment of these titles from the Crown. We have consulted the Court
of the Lord Lyon, who is the official heraldry officer for Scotland, on
this matter.</hs_para>

asked about the Duke of Edinburgh. The Duke of Edinburgh has a normal
remainder to the heirs male of his body, but at the time of the

understanding that there would probably have to be a creation of that;
it would not automatically be inherited from his father. I say to my

for a moment minimise the importance of the issue. It would certainly
not just be the Constitution Committee criticising us if we were
suddenly to introduce in this Bill measures that were going to change
the order of succession to peerages. My noble friend Lord Lucas
reminded us, interestingly, that he inherited from his grandmother and
mother but, as he pointed out, hereditary titles can very often go with
financial interests and estates. These would not be issues to enter
into lightly. As I indicated, they go beyond the scope of this Bill. I

contributed to the debate made clear. This has been welcomed by both
the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church. I was particularly
struck by the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Janvrin, on the
importance of the heir to the Throne being able to have a wider choice
as to who may be their spouse. There was a sense of that around your
Lordships’ House when he mentioned it. Given the particular
challenges that go with the monarchy, I think that the noble Lord
referred to the importance of lifetime love and support. That was a
very poignant but relevant contribution to our debate.</hs_para>

opening remarks, it is not the case that the children of all mixed
Protestant and Catholic marriages must be brought up in the Catholic
faith. Catholic teaching is clear and perhaps more practical than has
sometimes been suggested. The guidance is set out in

Paul VI in 1970, and <I>Pontificium Consilium </I><I>a</I><I>d

requires the Catholic partner in a mixed marriage to do their best to
have the children raised as Catholics but if, as I indicated earlier,
there is a just and reasonable cause which would qualify, such as the
protection of the place of the Established Church, under those
circumstances the local bishop can grant permission for the marriage.

the Archbishop of Westminster has welcomed the decision of the
Government to give heirs to the Throne the freedom to marry a Catholic.
Indeed, in doing so, he recognised the importance of the position of
the Established Church in protecting and fostering the role of faith in
our society today. The noble Lords, Lord Luce and Lord Janvrin, echoed
by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, asked whether it would be
appropriate to have further discussions with the Roman Catholic Church.
It is clear that there have already been discussions prior to this Bill

Queen is not the supreme governor of the Church of Scotland. The
relationship between church and state is symbolised by the presence of
the monarch or her Lord High Commissioner in attendance at the general

extent, it does not operate as a state church in the way that the

surely the very reason why the prohibition on the heir to the Throne
marrying a Catholic being removed is to end that discrimination. My
noble friend Lord Deben’s suggestion of a regency would work
with the way in which the Bill is presently constructed—that is,
the heir to the Throne may be a Catholic but cannot be one. For those
of us who do not wish to see the Church of England being anything other
than the Established Church, this would be a way of removing the
discrimination against Catholics. I have to say that we are not
repealing the vile and offensive language, from our modern-day view,
which is contained in the 18th-century statute and which causes great

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I believe that this would
go beyond the scope of the Bill. Something as profound as that could
not be imported into the Bill without much further scrutiny and
consideration. It is also important to remember that the provisions in
the Bill removing an element of religious discrimination have been
welcomed not just by the Church of England but by the Roman Catholic
Church. I do not think that that is a stitch-up; it is a 
<?notus-xml column=835?>welcome recognition by both churches that this is an important change in
our law. To go much wider than that, in fact, would require
consideration that is not appropriate. We would be subjected to
justified criticism if this were all rushed through as an amendment to
the Bill in Committee, quite apart from all the implications for the
other realms that have been so carefully consulted over a long

regard to the Royal Marriages Act 1772, my noble friend Lord Lang
thinks six is too limited, but my noble friend Lord Carlile thinks six
is too wide. I explained that if one looks at the 240 years of history
since the Act was passed, Queen Victoria was the furthest away from the
Throne at the time of her birth, at fifth. Therefore, six is a
realistic number. I say to my noble friend Lord Carlile and other
contributors that, unlike the consequence of the Royal Marriages Act,
which is that the marriage is void, the consequence of marrying without
consent under this Bill would be that one would drop out of the line of
succession, so some of the convention issues that my noble friend
mentioned are properly
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021468000362" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-0002.htm#13021468000362">My
noble friend Lord Lang was concerned that the Bill might put the
sovereign under some pressure about whether someone was an appropriate
person to marry. That could be the case today. There is probably
unlikely to be any pressure if the person is 710th or whatever in line
to the Throne, but even today, the first six still require the

noble friends Lord Carlile and Lord Northbrook asked us to clarify the
common law position with regard to the monarch’s
consent. It is arguable that the common law no longer applies since it
could be said that by legislating in 1772, Parliament has superseded
the common law. The defects of the 1772 Act have frequently been
pointed out, and the Government consider that there is a clear case for
repealing and replacing it. A dowager queen is not in the line of
succession, so the importance of royal consent is not as great as it is
in the case of someone in the immediate line of succession. We do not
see dealing with any possible surviving common law rules on consent as
essential.</hs_para>

points about the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 that were picked up by

it possible for the regent to be a Catholic. Section 3 of the Regency
Act provides that the regent is the person next in line of succession,
if not disqualified, which a Catholic would be. A further
disqualification is brought in under this Bill if a person in the first
six in line of succession to the Throne marries without

harassment or intrusion. The change that we are putting forward will
mean that if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a daughter, then a
son, the daughter will precede the son in the line of succession. As we
look forward to the birth, we can also celebrate that whether a boy or
a girl, the child will have equal claim to the Throne. I think it is
the mood of the House to wish the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge every
happiness as they face up to the challenge of parenthood, and I commend
this Bill to the House.</hs_para>

UK and others saw this regional approach to a specific regional

Arctic cod and exchanges with Norway fairly reflected the interests of
the different member states. The Faroes declared its intent to set its
own TAC unilaterally on Atlanto-Scandian herring. The Commission would
look closely into what could be done in response to this, including all
legal measures available. The Commission also reported that the EU and
Norway had agreed to take the traditional 90% of the mackerel TAC which
was to be reduced in line with ICES advice. There was a need to
consider further the possible introduction of trade sanctions against
Iceland and Faroe Islands, but the Commission would continue to prepare

is necessary on geographical indications (GIs), enhancing protection of
EU GIs in Canada. These issues would have to be overcome in order to
finalise the EU-Canada FTA. On the WTO Doha Development Agenda (DDA),
developing countries would want movement on agriculture and the EU may
have to compromise on this, in order to secure a DDA trade facilitation
agreement. The UK welcomed progress on trade, which is a key driver of

has been achieved in the youth justice system. Overall crime and proven

there remains a hardcore of serious and persistent young offenders for

poor outcomes both for this group and for society. Seventy-three per

education provision is patchy, meaning 
<?notus-xml column=69?>that many young people leave custody still lacking
basic skills; and too often the support provided in custody falls away
when an offender is released back into the community. On top of this,
we are paying far too much for youth custody, close to £100,000
a place per annum, and in some cases more than
£200,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021461000357" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130214-wms0001.htm#13021461000357">Custody
punishes by depriving offenders of their liberty, but we must also use
that time constructively. It is an opportunity for young people to get
help to tackle their offending behaviour and acquire the skills and
self-discipline to secure placements in education, training or
