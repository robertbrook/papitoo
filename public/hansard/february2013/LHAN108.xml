that it will collect £9 billion a year more from its compliance
activities by 2014-15 than at the start of this Parliament. The number
of HMRC staff in compliance roles fell under the previous Government.

Committee found that £1.1 billion was lost to the Treasury by
foolishly cutting 3,300 staff from the compliance and enforcement unit
of HMRC, can the Minister give us a greater assurance that that folly
will not be repeated, especially with the new comprehensive policy that
has been announced on offshore tax evasion? Will the Minister say when
that will be published, what its focus will be, and whether that, too,

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, it is important to recognise that the big
cut in staff in HMRC took place before 2010. The number of staff fell
by 25,000, and 10,000 staff working in compliance
roles—that is, the very staff about whom the noble Lord is
concerned—were cut during that period. We have added 2,500 staff
in that area since we came in and they are generating a very
significant amount of additional funding. On international tax evasion
and avoidance work, a whole raft of initiatives is under way. There is
a new unit within HMRC and we are working very closely with the OECD. I
am sure that a number of further announcements in this area will be
made during this calendar

Sharkey:</Member></B> My Lords, the 2010 comprehensive spending review
committed HMRC to improving the customer experience. However, in
December last year, the National Audit Office concluded that customers
were still not getting a good service. For example, last year 20
million calls went unanswered and there was a cost of £33
million in phone charges to customers kept hanging on. Will the
Minister say whether HMRC intends to increase staffing and resources to
address this problem?</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, HMRC has a target of answering 90% of
calls. It was more than achieved in the third quarter and was certainly
a better performance than that achieved in some earlier parts of the
year. An example of the challenge that HMRC finds itself facing in this
respect is that the number of calls that it gets per day ranges from
86,000 to 3.2 million on a peak day. Either a very small number or a
very large number of people phone, and it is unsurprising that on a
small number of days it is impossible to reach the 90% target. However,
HMRC has put more resource in. It has upgraded the equipment and, as I
said, the 90% target has been more than met in the last
quarter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T14:40:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Office of Tax Simplification, which has started work in this area.

is in place, it should not be necessary to introduce as much new tax

about 94,000 to 66,000 under the previous Government. Under the
comprehensive spending review, it is due to fall by about another
10,000. While that is happening, there will, as I said, be an
increase of about 2,500 for compliance. There will therefore be a shift
towards more compliance against a backdrop of a significant change in
the way in which people submit tax returns. In 2010 only 42% of
corporation tax 
<?notus-xml column=131?>returns were submitted online, but in 2011-12 that number had increased
by 96,000. As I have said before, the number of staff you need to
process that kind of activity has fallen considerably because they are
no longer dealing with paper

cracking down very hard on tax evasion and tax avoidance. We are
putting more resources into this area. We are submitting more cases for
prosecution and are having more successful prosecutions. The key
question is: what is the outcome on the ground? Are more people who
avoid and evade tax being taken to court, and are abusive practices

have said, we thoroughly support the work of charities such as
FareShare and FoodCycle, which work with the food industry to ensure
that surplus food is distributed to people who really need it. Defra
Ministers held a round-table meeting with retailers and food charities
in July to explore the barriers to food redistribution. They also
considered an outline proposal from FareShare and FoodCycle 
<?notus-xml column=135?>that seeks to make redistribution easier for both charities and

to take effect on 1 January was cancelled and the increase planned for
1 April deferred until 1 September; and we have lifted the personal tax
allowance and taken 2 million of the lowest-paid people out of tax

£60 per week, over time, from their benefits? What estimate has

we are straying a little from food banks. The difficult economic
situation is having an impact on everyone, including workers, who find
their wages either being frozen or increasing only by small amounts.
The Government have protected poor and vulnerable groups as far as
possible while undertaking the urgent task of tackling the fiscal
deficit. Work remains the best and most immediate way out of poverty,
and we have continued to prioritise providing the best possible work
incentives through welfare reform and increasing the personal

Baroness’s first question, we know that these organisations are
part of a complex and community-led response to these issues. There is
a range of food aid provision, from very small local provision through
to national charities working on the redistribution of food. We welcome
the actions of all these organisations working locally in the community
to help meet local needs. Of course we are concerned about those who
need to turn to charities for food, but we should not suggest that the
work of such organisations or the need to help and support the most
vulnerable in our society is a recent phenomenon. The use of food banks
went up 10-fold under the previous
Government.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_05_PT_1/B9826F0345B55E7E4300F6D30992C7C43936B795" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 February 2013">Tuesday,

million into the Forestry Commission’s budget next year

of woodland. We have allocated £2 million to the Forestry

future funding of the estate. However, we continue to face very
challenging financial circumstances, requiring hard choices to be made
across the whole public sector. The Forestry Commission and the public
forest estate have had to bear their share of the cuts that we have had
to make to bring public spending under control. Nevertheless, we want
to ensure that the public forest estate can continue to provide a high
level of public benefits. We are therefore carefully considering the
estate’s financial needs for the long term. In particular, we
want to place it on a secure financial footing for the future by

Reading; two days earlier, on October 7, the Prime Minister had
committed to implement the Leveson recommendations so long as they were
not, as he put it, “Bonkers”. Since returning from the
Christmas Recess, I do not believe myself to be the only Member of your

contains a fatal flaw: it does not deal with the manner in which
ordinary citizens will be able to utilise the protection that it
offers. The Bill has been drawn up with the help of newspapers, which
understandably see the world through their own looking glass. Anyone
who reads the Bill as it stands will not find so much as a hint of the
fact that we live in a country that has spent much of the past two
years debating the fall-out directly attributable to the unaccountable
power of newspapers over our public life and over the lives of ordinary
citizens. It is almost as if Leveson never happened.</hs_para>

his reply, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, might wish to recall the
absurd situation that he and I were placed in 10 years ago when we were
asked to scrutinize the then Communications Bill but not to debate or
discuss the implications of the emerging digital world. That was pushed
safely back into the “too difficult” drawer. We have all
looked a little daft ever since. These amendments seek to address those
real-world concerns. They put into effect an arbitration system that
would allow ordinary people to get redress if they are defamed under
the new definitions that we are passing into law within the body of
this Bill.</hs_para>

some of the perversities of the current libel system, which is largely
to be welcomed, and it can be reasonably expected to lead to fewer
defamation actions against newspapers. However, for the citizen who has
a case in law that suggests they have been wronged by the press, the
Bill has absolutely nothing to say about access to justice or the costs
of seeking that justice in the courts, all of which is plainly
unaffordable except for the very wealthy. After everything that we
heard at the Leveson inquiry, the problems of access to justice
and to remedies are far too important to be left unresolved. It is
fundamental to the issue of balancing the rights of the citizen against
the rights of the press; it cannot continue to be
overlooked or shoved off to form part of some future piece of
legislation.</hs_para>

O'Neill of Bengarve:</Member></B> My Lords, I have put my name to this
amendment to Amendment 1, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam,
because it is urgent to establish an effective, affordable and
independent route for resolving claims of defamation. In doing so, I
declare an interest as chair of the Equalities and 
<?notus-xml column=144?>Human Rights Commission. Unlike my noble friend Lady Hollins, who also
brings the expertise of experience of intrusion and defamation to this
debate, I bring only a track record of speaking and writing on the
conflict between rights to freedom of expression and other rights,
including the right to
reputation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:18:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000086">I
do not think that it is a matter of dispute that we need a cheap and
effective way of resolving claims of defamation. However, the mechanism
for resolving such claims needs also to be fair and that means that it
has to be independent, not only of the interests of both parties but
also of the Government. The noble Lord’s amendment seeks to
achieve that. I think that this amendment to the amendment would do so
rather more effectively; it is at least more explicit, which enables
your Lordships to consider what it would actually take to achieve
independence in this
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000087">Both
amendments build on Lord Justice Leveson’s proposal to create an
independent recognition commission that will validate the standards to
which any voluntary regulatory body for the media works. Lord Justice
Leveson’s proposal is, as we all recognise, ingenious because it
offers a way of retaining media self-regulation, while requiring that
self-regulation to meet adequate standards of fairness and independence
as certified by a recognition body. The amendment sets out incentives
for media organisations to participate in a voluntary regulatory
body—it will be much cheaper for them if that body is recognised
by an independent recognition body—and it also sets out
incentives for claimants to use the arbitration service. Again, it will
be cheaper and quicker.</hs_para>

run by the PCC—or should I perhaps say the former
PCC?—was in many ways cheap to use, but it had a range of
deficiencies, which have been much discussed in your Lordships’
House and in Lord Justice Leveson’s report, and it lacked that
crucial form of independence. I do not think that we should pass a
defamation Bill that fails to address these fundamental defects. The
connections between intrusion and defamation are too close for us
simply to overlook them.</hs_para>

Government will accept these amendments or at least can indicate that
their fundamental purpose will be secured by government amendments at

three main political parties to reach agreement on what needs to be
done to give effect to the recommendations of Sir Brian
Leveson’s inquiry. If these amendments are designed to put
pressure on the coalition Government to achieve that aim, they are most
welcome. But if they are intended to become part of this Bill, then I
cannot support them, despite the great authority of their supporters,
including a former Lord Chancellor, a former Attorney-General, and my
old friend and Cork neighbour, the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. I am not
aware that he took much part in the earlier deliberations on the
Defamation Bill, and most of what he said about the Bill is wrong, but
I am not going to go into the details now because I do not think it is
relevant. The Government have done a great deal to secure a Bill that
balances reputation and free expression, tries to deal with the abuses
of costs, procedural rules, downscaling and so on and so forth.
It is not a Bill, as the noble Lord suggested, that has been written by
the newspaper industry. In its original form, it was written by me, and
I made quite sure that the original Bill and the Government’s
draft Bill were not like that at all. That is not relevant to what we

including the use of exemplary damages as a sanction, which was twice
rejected by the previous Labour Government as punitive, but which the

to be in breach of the convention right to freedom of expression,

dispense with hearings in his or her discretion. There is no

Fowler:</Member></B> My Lords, I was going to say “Mr
Speaker”, but I will not. I do not intend to follow entirely all
the points made by my noble friend Lord Lester, but I agree with him
that this does not entirely give effect to the Leveson report, and nor
could it, given the confines of the Defamation Bill. The
amendments do not deal with the complaints process or, more to the
point, the way in which any complaints process is periodically
verified. On the other side, it does not set down a legal duty on the
Government to protect the freedom of the
press<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:31:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000108">The
questions are whether the amendment can be seen as a building block in
implementing Leveson—a kind of stalking horse, although perhaps
we have enough stalking horses flocking around just at this
moment—and whether it deals with some of the evils or
disadvantages, one in particular, that Lord Justice Leveson exposed. My
noble friend Lord Lester obviously prefers the solution of his own
Private Member’s Bill. I do not entirely disagree. I think it
would be an excellent Bill. I just think that the chances of it being
passed are practically zero, so I do not regard it as a realistic
option. If we reject this proposal, I do not think that the Government
are going suddenly to fall over and say, “Well, Lord Lester, you
can go ahead now with your Private Member’s Bill and we will put
all our effort behind it”. I just do not think that that is
realistic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>. The

long-standing complaints about dealings with the press is that a
serious complaint to the editor fails, as it often does, and then the
only option is legal action. But most of us would take the view that a
libel would have to be absolutely fundamental to persuade us to take
legal action. The outcome is far too uncertain and the cost is only too
certain. That is why legal action is all too often seen as a remedy
open only to the rich.</hs_para>

the amendment clearly puts the intention into practice. I do not intend
to go into all the detail of it, some of which can doubtless be
improved, including by meeting some of the points about drafting made
by my noble friend. We can come to those. The important thing is that
the principle has been recognised, and the amendment gives us the
opportunity to vote on this matter and serve notice on the Government
that this is one of the areas where we want

are two other reasons in favour of the amendment. First, the Leveson
report was published at the end of November. Since then, we have waited
and waited for action, but, instead, some newspapers, sensing a
weakness of intent, have continued to attack Leveson in the most lurid
and extreme manner, and often quite inaccurately. Perhaps I may quote
from this morning’s <I>Sun</I> editorial, commenting on the
Chris Huhne case. It states:</hs_para>

“many” people are. Frankly, I do not know of any
people who want to muzzle the press and prevent the exposure of
scandals. While I think it is the biggest nonsense to propose that that
is the case, I also think that people want some redress when they are
the victims of injustice. That is what the public actually

by passing the amendment, which would set up an arbitration service, as
proposed by Leveson, it would at once establish the truth of
Leveson—that it is to the benefit of the public, and as the
noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, has said, to the benefit of the press.
Indeed, the amendment is quite obviously to the benefit of the press.
In other words, it inserts truth for the kind of smears that we have
been all too used to over the past
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000115">The
second reason why I support the amendment is because the present way of
dealing with the Leveson proposals is woefully inadequate. It has
brought nothing forward, although everyone at the time said how urgent
it was to make progress. The process itself is open to severe
objection. In paragraph 84 of Leveson’s report, he
says,</hs_para>

transparency” is not exactly how I would describe what has been
happening over the past two and a half months since Leveson reported.
We hear mutterings about a royal charter, but there has been no attempt
whatever to engage the public or, for that matter, very many
politicians in this discussion. Doubtless, a magic circle of them has
been engaged, while the press itself shows an almost total lack of
inquisitiveness about what is going on. It is such a contrast to what
happens in almost every other area where the press is for ever trying
to find out what is going on. In this case, it does not seem to be
trying to find out what is going on at
all.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13020546000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000116">I say

Boothroyd:</Member></B> My Lords, I spoke in the debate on the Leveson
report, so I shall certainly not weary the House this afternoon. Let me
start by saying that I take no pleasure in what has befallen the
newspaper industry in the past few years. I am sure that no one wants
to see journalists facing criminal charges, but who among us is proud
of the way in which newspapers are now
perceived<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:40:43"></hs_TimeCode>? I
believe that the amendments before us would help the newspaper industry

us all to account.</hs_para>

said in my speech during the Leveson debate that many of the
transgressions happened because of the culture of some newspapers
whereby they grew to believe that they were untouchable. It is that
culture that must be changed. It can be done with the establishment of
a new complaints procedure for the public which, as the noble Lord,
Lord Fowler, touched on, allows problems and issues with the press to
be nipped in the bud at an early stage and dealt
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000119">We need
a system that allows the citizen to raise their complaint in a low-cost

reporting and improve on the current mentality that everything and
everyone is fair game for

commissions or parliamentary inquiries and the spending of a lot of
public money, it will no longer suffice to be told that there will be

famous line in “Gone with the Wind”: “Tomorrow is

Committee stage of the Defamation Bill, this is a surprising and
exciting development on what might have been regarded as some of the
more dry amendments that were then before the House. However, it is
important—I declare an interest as a practising barrister with
some experience of the law of defamation—that we bear in mind
that this is an amendment to the Defamation Bill. It should not be
thought that all claims by those who say they have been defamed result
in full-scale trials. Thanks largely to the intervention of the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, and the Civil Procedure Rules, and to
initiatives by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, by way of

Hollins:</Member></B> My Lords, as an expert by experience of press
abuse, I consulted Hacked Off, the charity that has represented many
victims of such abuse, and asked its views of the amendment of the
noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. There is widespread frustration about the
lack of transparency and presumed lack of progress on implementing Lord
Justice Leveson’s recommendations. Given this, Hacked Off is
extremely grateful for the initiative taken by the noble Lord, Lord
Puttnam. 
<?notus-xml column=151?>However, its advice to me was that, as they stand, the
amendments appear a somewhat diluted version of Lord Justice
Leveson’s recommendations. The amendments that I and my noble

victims fear that a deal is being brokered with the press behind closed
doors, one that does not include the independent element that Lord
Justice Leveson considered so important. Hacked Off’s advice was
that the characteristics of the regulator need to be detailed enough so
that implementation of Lord Justice Leveson’s criteria is not
fudged. Interestingly, most of the draft Bills already published spell
out the criteria in some

Skidelsky:</Member></B> My Lords, I have only one point to make. The
noble Lord, Lord Lester, said that these amendments in effect introduce
Leveson by the back door into a Bill dealing with other matters. To my
mind, that is an important merit of the Bill because we are unlikely to
get Leveson through the front door. I particularly emphasise the point
that these amendments are the best chance we have of getting the
Leveson proposals implemented in their full integrity. The amendments
are about access to justice. They would put in place two fundamental
elements of Lord Justice Leveson’s proposals, namely means of
legal redress for ordinary people if their rights are breached and a
fair and independent system to deal with complaints against the press.
I doubt whether those who support these fundamental elements will get
another chance, or at least as good a chance as now exists, to have
these principles embodied in law. The private Member’s Bill of
the noble Lord, Lord Lester, will not afford the same chance, for
reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. If we fail to take
advantage of this opportunity, we will in effect kick Leveson into the
long grass<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T15:49:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The

well as the noble Baronesses, Lady O’Neill of Bengarve and Lady
Hollins, for concentrating on the huge lacuna in this Bill and in the
law of defamation generally. Let no one be under any misapprehension as
to how unjust our law of defamation is. I speak as one
solicitor—long in the tooth, it must be said—who has
dealt over the years with defamation, from time to time. It is a
scandal how 
<?notus-xml column=152?>much it is a plaything of the rich, completely beyond access by people
of even ordinary means. So I am wholly emotionally in favour of what is
intended by this set of amendments and the

have listened to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, who never speaks with
less than authority. At first hearing, I am not sure how all the points
that he made would impact, but I accept at large what he has said. One
has to hope that my noble friend Lord Fowler is correct, and that if we
pass this set of amendments today the defects in them can be rectified
either at Third Reading in this place or in the House of Commons or
when it comes back to us. I am convinced that to leave this for another

press and the citizenry, it might be an acceptable use of what is
generally not desirable—exemplary damages, or the concept of
it—in respect of a “flagrant breach”.
Incidentally, subsection (8) of the amendment has in it a serious
misprint. It talks about breach of a defendant’s rights when it
should refer to a claimant’s right. That is but one of several
matters that could and, I hope, will be improved in the course of this

I am attracted to it because the preacher from Galilee said that, if
you have a dispute with your neighbour, it is better to try to settle
it before you go to court, because when you go to court you may find
yourself being given such a stiff sentence that you end up losing
doubly. Therefore, I am attracted by the whole question of arbitration.
The courts, of course, can look at whether the parties were willing or
unwilling to engage in arbitration. If a person has been wronged and
another person does not think that is the case, arbitration obliges
them to have a conversation. It seems to me that we should accept 
<?notus-xml column=153?>Amendment 1 at this stage. Then the Government can
perhaps suggest alterations to it. Certainly, the noble Lord, Lord
Lester, is always very assiduous in correcting things that are not well

amendment. Those subsections are very important. They set out what
needs to happen. Therefore, I urge your Lordships’ House to
pause and consider whether we really think that only the rich ought to
have recourse to a remedy in defamation cases. The ordinary citizen
could find redress very easily and quickly through arbitration. The
press ought to welcome arbitration because it would cost far less than
an elaborate court case, which may collapse in the end after a lot of
costs have been incurred. When there is no trust, what do you do? You
want to be in a position to rectify your situation. For those reasons,

Kennedy of The Shaws:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support these
amendments. I always listen with care when I hear the noble Lord, Lord
Lester, speaking about human rights because of his great experience and
his important role in our nation in arguing for human rights. However,
I take issue with his interpretation of Article 6 and the statement
that any kind of arbitration in this field would in some way contravene
that article. The whole purpose of human rights is to empower the weak
and to recognise the ways in which due process can often disadvantage
those who have no money. The purpose of arbitration in this context is
not simply to speed things up or to move things along. Much of our
arbitration concerns two parties coming together to try to find a
smoother way to deal with something, but in this context the purpose of
arbitration is to redress the fact that our current system
disadvantages whole tracts of people who cannot afford to go to
litigation at all. I think you would find that the courts would not
accept the literal interpretation of this concept on the part
of some of our colleagues. The noble Lord, Lord Faulks, also said that
this provision would be a contravention of human rights. I think you
would find that the courts would take a very different

lawnmower is out in force already. Media lawyers from across the
industry are working flat out to establish a scheme that will be good
for the public but not an intolerable burden on the regional press in
particular. Crucially, we have to find a scheme that will not simply be
a new cash cow for claims farmers. The scheme proposed by the noble
Lord, Lord Puttnam, does not address the legitimate concerns—of
the regional press in particular—about the problems that might

industry funding it if it were simply to compete with other bodies. If
this amendment is agreed today, work will be likely to stop tomorrow
because of the potential for what is in effect regulatory chaos. There
is nothing in the scheme proposed by the noble Lord to stop the
proliferation of a number of statutory regulatory bodies with different

already said, it is a recipe for regulatory chaos. There is a danger of

highly undesirable. There are also serious concerns about whether such

to say that I believe the amendments are ill thought through, misguided
and likely to prove unworkable. The most important point is that it

some years in Ireland, where many of the recommendations made by Lord
Justice Leveson for the United Kingdom have been implemented simply and
with no regulatory competition. That was done in the session of the

the Irish situation again as those interested in this topic are already

appropriate that I speak now. I very much regret that the noble and

the importance of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Black, cannot be

would have a system in due course that would suffice. That is a bit
like one of the saints saying, “Make me chaste, Lord, but not
yet”. We have been waiting for some 65 years for
redress. One of the reasons why the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay
of Clashfern, is so concerned about taking this opportunity is because,
as many of your Lordships will know, in 1993, when he gave evidence
before the Select Committee, he suggested that we should have an
arbitration system to give redress to the poor, to the needy and to
those who would have no redress but for the creation of such a service.

believed to have taken place. For the first time ever there will be

recall that when the Legal Services Bill was passing through this
place, he and I joined together to ensure that access to justice was
put right at the heart of the new system, and that is where I still am.
Although the arbitral arm would improve access to civil redress for
some people who currently have no access to the system, it would not
create any new course of action. If the arbitral arm is to achieve the
rather limited but tightly defined objectives set out by Leveson, it
needs to be very carefully constructed. I am sure that a
Leveson-compliant system can be constructed, but it must not be erected

outside verification body, but the noble Lord’s quotation from
me is extracted from the submission I made to Lord Justice Leveson. It

“Don’t worry about that. The House of Lords will judge
whether you are independent or not”. So I place myself in the

The two debates may seem to have nothing at all in common, except of
course that they have the same Secretary of State, but I believe they
are both important because both have significance far beyond their
obvious and immediate import. Both debates are about the proper role of
the state. In both cases, the world is watching to see what sort of
country we want to be. Will we assert our belief as free citizens and
organisations taking greater responsibility for our own lives and
actions, and our support for freedom, diversity and fair and equal

important, too precious and too hard won to be legislated upon in haste

to have two Statements; one was given by the then Leader of the House,
the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, who said that he was speaking for the
Government, and the other was given by, let us say, another government
Minister—did we are discover in what capacity it was that the

Justice Leveson sets out proposals for independent self-regulation

independent self-regulatory body should meet, including: independence
of appointments and funding; a standards code; an arbitration service;
and a speedy complaint-handling mechanism. Crucially, it must have the
power to demand upfront apologies and impose million-pound fines. These
are the Leveson principles. They are the central recommendations of the
report. If they can be put in place, we truly will have a regulatory
system that delivers public confidence, justice for the victims, and a
step-change in the way the press is regulated in our country. I accept

As my noble friend Lord Puttnam reminded us, that remained the
situation when we had our extended debate on the report on Friday 11
January. Since the original publication of the report, the parties have
been engaged in tripartite talks that have been ongoing for about two
months. However, we hear that the pace of these has slowed down
considerably in recent weeks, with the most recent scheduled meeting
being cancelled by the Government and offers to meet and resume talks
in the light of today’s amendments being rebuffed. It is worth
recalling that when we entered the cross-party talks, we set the
Government a deadline of the end of January to publish
Leveson-compliant measures. It is noticeable that the Government have
so far been unable to publish their proposals, although we know that
they include at least one draft royal charter and some statutory
underpinning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T16:36:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000188" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000188">At
the heart of today’s debate is the question of whether we have
independent self-regulation backed by law. We need statute because the
current system of self-regulation has failed year after year for 70
years, 
<?notus-xml column=163?>and despite seven major reports. Trust, as the most reverend Primate
said, is in short supply here—something has to happen. Lord
Justice Leveson proposes a framework that provides for the continuation
of self-regulation by the press but with a legal guarantee that
self-regulation will be effective and independent and will continue to
meet high standards. The role of the law, the legal underpinning, would
be limited to setting up a body whose task would be to recognise the
self-regulated system and to check it once every three years. Lord
Justice Leveson said that this was essential to ensure that, despite
all the protestations of change and good intentions, the press did not
once again slip back into its old ways, as it has always done after all
the other inquiries and
reports<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T16:37:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000189" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000189">We
believe that Lord Justice Leveson’s answer to that decades-old
problem is ingenious. It ensures that the press regulates itself
independent of both the Government and its own interests, but it also
ensures that there is statutory backing for the system. As I have
indicated, there is wide agreement in Parliament that Lord Justice
Leveson’s recommendations should be implemented. If we were in
power, we would make every effort to get agreement to implement
the Leveson proposals in full. We think that there is no credible

amendments today. We must beware false choices. We were offered them
recently in the sense that the allegation being made is that what is on
offer is statutory regulation of the press. It is not. It may well be
that what we have on offer today is not Leveson, it may be the back
door but, as the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, said, the prospects of
getting it through the front door, certainly not one with the number 10
on it, are quite remote. It could be characterised as being a first
step down the road we need to take, and it changes the status quo. It

that the Government are listening, that they can be relied on to act,

be acceptable to all parties. He may suggest that all this can be done

immediately after our Recess. He may even promise publication of the
Government’s proposals—that would be
nice—and he may offer a 
<?notus-xml column=165?>revised timetable for more talks, which we would certainly look at. Can
we take that risk? As the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, warned us,
tomorrow never comes. Is there credible evidence sufficient to believe
that those responsible for the current delays are working to a deadline
that delivers the necessary changes by the end of this Session? Even if
you believe all that, what is the downside if we pass these amendments
today? At heart, they genuinely offer the Government a chance to get
this process back on track. Even if the Minister, when he comes to
reply to this debate, gives your Lordships’ House an unequivocal

comment on the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, which I very

very detailed work that he has been doing and the real progress that
has been made. He was right to remind us that Lord Justice Leveson
himself said that the industry has the responsibility to set up
the new structure. On the question of independence, I can say only that
the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and I were on the executive of the Atlantic
Association of Young Political Leaders— a modest body,

Lord Justice Leveson’s report was published, all agreed that the
inquiry had uncovered a shocking culture of wrongdoing at the heart of
certain elements of the press, which the noble Baroness, Lady
Boothroyd, referred to. There was also, as Leveson pointed out, an
inadequate system of press regulation—something that I described
in this House as a “sweetheart organisation”. The Prime
Minister has stated that the status quo is not an option, and the
Deputy Prime Minister has said that we must not now prevaricate. We are
all agreed that a tough and truly independent new system of
self-regulation is required to ensure that real change happens. At the
same time we must ensure that there is freedom of expression for the
press, which is a cornerstone of our

see progress on this important issue. We are all agreed on the need for
action and I welcome the noble Lord’s contribution to finding
the right solution. However, I remind noble Lords that when the Leveson
report was published, the Prime Minister and the Deputy 
<?notus-xml column=168?>Prime Minister agreed that a cross-party approach was the best way to
ensure that a consensus could be reached on these contentious
issues—and very few of us in this House would disagree with
that. It is right for Parliament to send clear messages to our

my noble and learned friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness and the noble

concerned. This is a complex series of decisions. Furthermore, the
talks continue to consider, among many other issues, the best way to
recognise the new press self-regulatory body. While there are areas of
differences, there are also many areas of agreement. There is a
widespread desire for a cross-party solution to this issue of
fundamental importance to our democracy. A great deal of work has

brings me to the key issue: whether statute is the most appropriate
route to delivering the underpinning that Lord Justice Leveson sets
out. This question has been the topic of impassioned debate not only
today but across the weeks since the report’s publication. The
cross-party talks have considered a number of options, including
various draft Bills—among them the Bill prepared by my noble
friend Lord Lester. In addition, there have been discussions about a
proposed royal charter. To add to the debate and to demonstrate 
<?notus-xml column=169?>to this House that concrete progress is being made, I can announce today
that a draft royal charter proposal will be published next

Lord Justice Leveson’s proposals and to ensure a new system of

the progress that is being made on the kind of things to which the
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, referred, and given that the royal charter

next few days to give some real impetus to these talks. As I said
previously, there is no doubt in my mind that the real prize is not a
victory or defeat on this amendment today but a successful outcome to
the tripartite talks. That would give us the real holy grail here,
which is a cross-party endorsement which sticks in parliamentary and

O'Neill of Bengarve:</Member></B> My Lords, it has been a
very instructive debate. I think that it has become clear to many of us
how little many of us who are not close to the cross-party talks know
about what is actually being said or discussed. There is, I am sorry to
say and as the most reverend Primate reminded us, a serious question of
trust here that is not going to be remedied quickly. A number of issues
speak directly to that. Perhaps I may address one which the
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, raised. He spoke repeatedly, as he has
previously, about independent regulation, and he was reminded by the
noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that independence is not just a matter of
one’s belief that one is a person of independent judgment; it is
also a question of institutions, structures, how one is appointed and
to whom one is accountable. Our debates would be very much clarified if
we did not speak of a self-regulation body that lacks an appropriate
form of accountability to a recognition body as a form of independent
regulation. It is less than
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000225">I have
every faith in the good intentions of the noble Lord and his colleagues
in seeking to define a way forward, but without the statutory
recognition body which is integral to Lord Justice Leveson’s
proposals, we have no reason to expect that that will endure across the
vicissitudes of time and self-interest. We have repeated experience
that what passes for self-regulation has been self-interested
regulation. That is 
<?notus-xml column=170?>why many of us are extremely anxious on behalf of our fellow citizens
who have been victims of intrusion and defamation, and lack
remedies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000226" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000226">I

friend Lady Hollins. It is a complex amendment and it is imperfect.
Greater clarity will be served if noble Lords make a straightforward
decision on supporting the amendment in the name of the noble Lord,
Lord Puttnam, and colleagues. That puts the issue squarely. We would
all acknowledge that the details of these amendments—Amendment 1
and the amending amendments—are not perfect. They probably
cannot be perfect at this stage. However, I hope that noble Lords will
feel willing to support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam,
knowing that it affords the Government more than one opportunity to
reconsider the matter and come back on it. As the Minister indicated in
his very interesting reply, it also affords some further time for
reflection. I beg leave to withdraw Amendment

Puttnam:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not intend to delay the House any
longer than necessary but I would like to make one point very clearly.
Speaking from the Front Bench, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, frequently
and quite rightly stressed the importance of cross-party support. This
is a cross-party amendment in every sense. I would never have brought
it to the House had it been anything else. We start from the premise
that this has cross-party—and
powerful—support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000228" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000228">I
also take up two points that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made, because
they are important. We all agree that the issue here is trust. I put it
to him that there is some discontinuity between him saying that the
newspaper industry accepts the architecture of Leveson and the fact
that—as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, pointed out—day
after day, whenever Leveson or any form of regulation is raised, the
newspapers’ response is near hysteria. Where is the equivalence
between the hysterical reaction of the newspapers and their apparently
comfortable relationship with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, as he moves
towards an equitable solution? That is why I find myself so untrusting
of where this is going. The noble Lord also said that other countries
look to us on this matter, and he asked an important question: what
sort of country do we want to be? It is very clear that 78% of the
population of this country do not want us to be one in which the lives
of the McCanns and people like them are ripped apart by newspaper and
press abuse. That is the country we do not want to
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000229" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0001.htm#13020546000229">It has
been interesting to listen to the criticism of this amendment. A great
deal of it has been about what the amendment is not. I make no claims
about its faults—there are a number of them. Yet, in respect of
the all-party talks that have dominated this discussion and of which we
have heard so much, I am reminded of the fate of a frighteningly
similar set of talks that have been held for many years—more
years than I can remember—regarding the issue of party funding.
Any 
<?notus-xml column=171?>thoroughgoing democrat knows that party funding needs to be in a form
that supports the maintenance of a serious democracy. But the instant a
momentary or fragmentary form of party advantage raises its head, all
thoughts of what might be the right direction for the electorate, let
alone the country, seem to go out of the window. My real concern is
that these all-party talks seem to conform to that type of pattern, and

I see it, our job in this House is to shoulder that difficulty

think that it is the very least that we owe Lord Justice Leveson for
all the extraordinary effort that he has put into this. As the noble
Lord, Lord Lester, illustrated, the abiding fault of legislators is to
make the perfect the enemy of the good. The amendments in my name and
the names of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, the noble
Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady

is about someone’s reputation being trampled and seriously
damaged by untrue statements made about them. Some commentators think
that since only people and not organisations have feelings, only people
should be able to sue. We do not go that far. We accept that
organisations can be damaged by untrue allegations. Had horse meat not
been in those burgers, or pork not in that halal food, such innocent
information could have substantially and unjustifiably ruined a
company’s reputation and caused untold financial harm. That
would be the same if a small corner butcher, for example, was wrongly
accused of having mice in the shop, if Perrier was falsely accused of
being a purveyor of foul water or if a car manufacturer was said to
have made a car with unsafe

today. It is supported by Liberty, the Libel Reform Campaign, the Media
Lawyers Association, <I>Which?</I> and the Commons Culture, Media and

loss, given that all of us must pay its levy, whether by income tax or

what they like about the local authority against which they are

any of its service users said a critical word about them. Are these

matter of judicial discretion in particular cases but the amendment is
sound in the way in which it is expressed—that non-natural
persons, that is to say, corporate and similar bodies performing a
public function, do not have an action in defamation in relation to a
statement concerning that function. That seems sensible in democratic
terms as the officers of the company are able themselves to bring a

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support the

companies suing for defamation is limited to the requirement in
subsection (3) of the proposed new clause that trading
entities should 
<?notus-xml column=179?>have to show actual or likely financial loss before being entitled to
sue for defamation. As drafted, proposed new subsection (2) would
introduce a restriction on companies that is not so limited and is

the restriction in proposed new subsection (3) is in line
with the recommendation of the Joint Committee on the draft Bill, on
which I served, and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, has
pointed out, the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Human Rights
as well. Whether companies should be able to sue for defamation was one
of the issues that the Joint Committee was specifically asked to
consider outside the ambit of the draft Bill, and we took a great deal
of time and heard a great deal of evidence on this issue. The amendment
accords with the sense of many who believe that corporate bodies
trading for profit should not be in precisely the same position as
natural persons in defamation
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000256" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000256">As in so
much of the law in this area, the task is to strike the right balance
between the right to free speech and the right to protect reputation.
But it is a fact that companies cannot suffer hurt in their feelings
and personal reputations in the same way as individuals can. Therefore,
many have called for companies to be denied the right to sue for
defamation. It is argued that companies have other ways to protect
their reputations. It is argued that individual directors can sue, but
to bring a suit for defamation is a serious undertaking and would
expose those individual directors to substantial personal risk in costs
when the real claimant should be the company. It is argued that large
companies may have other steps they can take to protect their
reputations by advertising or seeking publicity for their position, but
that depends on their financial strength. A right to sue for malicious
falsehood is often mentioned, but that is dependent on an ability to
prove malice, which is notoriously difficult to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000257" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000257">I take a
different view. While companies do not have feelings that can be hurt,
they can suffer financially, as my noble friend Lord Lester has pointed
out. Defamatory statements about companies can have very serious
consequences for their businesses, affecting the jobs of their staff
and the prosperity of all concerned in them—whether or not
untrue and defamatory statements are made with a view to profit by
competitors or innocently by journalists. Therefore, it does not seem
to strike the right balance to deprive companies of the right to sue
for defamation altogether, quite apart from the fact that it would
probably be contrary to the HRA to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000258" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000258">However,
it seems proportionate and balanced to insist that companies and other
non-natural persons trading for profit show that they have suffered or
are likely to suffer substantial financial loss as a result of the
defamation in respect of which they wish to sue. Imposing that
condition recognises the difference in kind between individuals and
non-natural persons trading for profit. It would not restrict the right
of charities and other not-for-profit organisations to sue, and it is
right that it should not do so; for example, charities can suffer from
defamation in their future ability to raise funds, but it may be very
difficult for them to demonstrate that. Proposed new subsection (3) of
this amendment applies only to import a modest 
<?notus-xml column=180?>and proportionate restriction on the right of trading entities to sue

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who
have taken part in this short debate. As has been pointed out,
Amendment 2 concerns two distinct but related issues. Indeed, my noble
friend Lord Lester, who I greatly respect with regard to this Bill in
particular, described it as two limbs. That is a nice way of reflecting
on the current Government, in having two arms to the same body, and we
are seeking to move forward on these
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000269" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000269">The
issues that have been raised again this afternoon were extensively
debated during the previous stages of this Bill. These are whether
there should be restrictions on the right of bodies corporate and other
non-natural persons to bring an action in defamation, and whether any
non-natural person which is performing a public function should be
prevented from bringing a claim in relation to a statement concerning
that
function.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000270" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000270">In
relation to the first issue, the Government have made it clear
in previous debates that there is a difficult balance to be struck, as
the most reverend Primate articulated. Considerable damage can be done
to the reputation of a business by unjustified and defamatory
allegations, and this has an impact on all those involved with the
business, including its shareholders and employees. On the other hand,
we fully recognise the need to ensure that powerful businesses are not
able to—for want of a better term—bully individuals or
organisations with limited means into remaining silent on issues of
public importance by the threat of libel proceedings.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020546000271" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000271">However, if that is the
problem we are trying to solve, imposing specific restrictions on the
ability of businesses to sue does not seem justified. Wealthy
individuals can equally send threatening letters to those with limited
means. This is why we think the twin-track approach we are proposing is
preferable. It embraces both elements within the Bill and procedural
changes alongside it.</hs_para>

claimants—corporate or otherwise—will have to satisfy the
new test of serious harm, as my noble friend just mentioned. As we have
made clear, it is our intention that the serious harm test will raise
the hurdle for bringing a claim and will ensure that trivial claims do
not proceed. In order to satisfy the serious harm test, businesses are
likely in practice to have to show some form of actual or likely
financial loss. The courts have talked in terms
of,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13020546000363" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000363">“a

what that will require will depend on the type of business concerned
and the facts of the particular case, and we do not think that it is
helpful to attempt to define explicit restrictions in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

proceedings is at the root of many of the concerns expressed in the
debate on this issue. As I have made clear, we are fully committed to
reducing costs and are taking a number of steps to achieve that. The
Civil Justice Council is actively engaged in considering the options
for costs protection in defamation proceedings and will be reporting to
the Secretary of State for Justice in March. The introduction of cost
protection measures will provide valuable protection to defendants of
limited means when they are faced by an opponent with substantially
greater resources.</hs_para>

bringing proposals for procedural changes before the Civil Procedure
Rule Committee shortly. As we explained in the note that we
provided to the House before Committee, those proposals will enable key
issues—such as whether there is serious harm, what is the actual
meaning of the words complained of, and whether they are a statement of
fact or opinion—to be brought before the court at the earliest
possible stage. In many cases, that will enable early resolution and
settlement of the dispute at greatly reduced cost. We will also be
encouraging the courts to be more pro-active in managing cases to
ensure that a tight grip is kept on those cases which proceed to
trial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000275" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000275">We
believe that the approach that I have outlined is the best way forward.
It will give significantly more protection to defendants with limited
means, and lessen the likelihood of attempts being made to threaten and
intimidate them, while still enabling businesses to protect their
reputation where it has been seriously harmed by unjustified
allegations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000276" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000276">I
turn to the second element of the amendment. In the case cited of
Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers, the House of Lords held
that local authorities and governmental bodies are already prevented
from bringing actions for defamation. As the noble Baroness
articulated, the amendment would extend that principle and prevent
claims by any non-natural person performing a public
function.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020546000277" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000277">We
do not consider that extension to be appropriate. As my noble friend
Lord Faulks mentioned, it would be a significant restriction on the
right of a wide range of businesses and other organisations to protect
their reputation, and a clear majority of responses to our public
consultation on the draft Bill were opposed to it. A rigid and
restrictive statutory provision which would remove the right to claim
from a wide range of bodies does not represent a proportionate
approach. We consider that it is much better to allow the courts to
develop the Derbyshire principle as they consider appropriate in the
light of individual cases.</hs_para>

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords who
have spoken, particularly those who have spoken in support—the
most reverend Primate, the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, the
noble Lord, Lord Marks of Henley-on-Thames, with whom I had the
pleasure of serving on the Joint Committee, and the noble Lord, Lord
Faulks, who raised an interesting question about small companies such
as 
<?notus-xml column=183?>the ice cream vendor. In the Joint Committee, we
went through the question of whether, as in the Australian situation,
there could be very big internet companies with fewer than 10 people
but enormous turnover. We felt that there was no way to do cover
that—although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T18:03:40"></hs_TimeCode>,
as has been said, if someone is so identified, such as the well-known

say two things to the Minister. I am disappointed by his response. The
noble Lord, Lord Lester, said that this is moderate and
balanced. I am slightly insulted by being called a moderate, but I can
live with it occasionally. This is a moderate and balanced response. It
is one that I should have thought the Government would accept. To put
together the big issue of companies bullying and rich people bullying
is not the right comparison. A few rich people do it. In our next
amendment, we will come to a strikeout ability, which is the way to
deal with those very few—and we know they are—who

are talking about, day after day, companies threatening anyone who says
that they were not perfect with taking them to court, when they know
that they can do that because of the depth of their pockets. On the
Derbyshire principle, the Government are just wrong. If we want people
exercising public functions but privileged to sue on their reputation,
that does not give us the confidence for even more outsourcing of
public functions. I think that the Government have taken the wrong call
on that, and I would like to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13020546000387" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020546000387">6.05

intention behind Amendment 3, which I move on behalf of my noble friend
Lord Browne of Ladyton and myself, sets out a vital
procedure—the ability of a court to strike out an action for
defamation. This power is vital. Everything that the Bill seeks to
achieve has been about reducing costs—which have completely
distorted the law on defamation—by facilitating early
resolution, as the Minister said in response to an earlier amendment.
If the key issues can be decided early on—which the virtual
ending of jury trials enables—then lawyers’ time is
diminished and costs are brought down.</hs_para>

cases, as we have heard, are such that they put the use of the law to
protect reputation beyond the reach of all but the richest. The only 
<?notus-xml column=187?>others who have been able to make use of this law are those who
have used no-win no-fee cases to do so—arrangements which are
shortly to be ended. This law has been beyond the reach of most people.
Virtually no defendant can contest a case, or claimants bring one, as
they risk being crippled not just by their own legal costs but also by
those of the other side. I heard just today of a case involving one day
in court which cost £40,000 on each side.</hs_para>

is early resolution. Up against a rich newspaper, no one without
sizeable means can consider taking on a case. With a multimillionaire,
an oligarch or a company even threatening an action, journalists,

amendment is about the last part of the jigsaw. Having enabled early
decision of most issues by clarity of the law and the reduction of the
use of juries, we now need active case management and the clear
authority of the court to strike out before trial actions that fail the
test of serious harm based on a falsehood, or where other jurisdiction
is more appropriate.</hs_para>

court to strike out an action is what we want written into the Bill. It
would allow either side to apply for this strike-out or for the judge
to start the process. At one level, the amendment would write into the
Bill what in effect exists in the Civil Procedure Rules but which will
not be evident to the ordinary member of the public, be they a
potential claimant or a defendant. Non-lawyers do not even know of the
existence of the Civil Procedure Rules, much less what they

Bill has aimed to provide for a lay person—an author or the
defamed—a clear statement of what the law on defamation is,
without recourse to a lawyer or a legal textbook. Our
description of the power of a court to stop an action is clear. It
would show to the claimant that unless they could show serious harm to
their reputation, and a tort—that it was wrongful—then
they should proceed no further. It would indicate to the defendant that
they could go to the court and ask for such a strike-out when it was
obvious to them either that the claimant had no relevant reputation
here or that any such reputation had not been caused serious damage.
This is clarity; it would add to the Bill a power that is already
there, and it would be a signal that we want early case management so
that as many of these issues as possible can be dealt with and, where
appropriate, struck out. I beg to

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I cannot support the
amendment. One of the difficult things about a Bill like this is to
decide what Parliament should be doing and what the courts should be
doing. Parliament has put into Clause 1 this very important barrier of
serious harm. In his important reply to the previous debate, the
Minister helpfully indicated that serious harm—for example, with
a corporate body—would include the likelihood of serious
financial loss as one of the factors to take into account. Obviously
this is a preliminary hurdle, and obviously the procedure rules, which
are not in the Bill but will be in the Civil 
<?notus-xml column=188?>Procedure Rules, and case management will ensure that a party can come
before the judge at the beginning and say, “Strike this out
because the serious harm test is not satisfied”.</hs_para>

procedure that will be dealt with, I think, by the Civil Procedure

exactly the kinds of issues that one would expect the judge to have
regard to, but the Government have very wisely decided to move against

Clause 1 without a checklist and without being fettered in any

Faulks:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree with my noble friend Lord
Lester. It is possible that the House may remember the contribution
that I made to the first debate when I drew the House’s
attention to the protocol, which does very much what the amendment
seeks to do. Under the current law it is perfectly possible, and indeed
it happens on a regular basis, that a court will rule on a preliminary
basis and will strike out claims, either pursuant to the CPR or under
the inherent jurisdiction. They will manage the case so that
preliminary matters are heard—for example, an issue as to
meaning—without a full-scale trial. Judges and masters are
experienced in dealing with this, and that is a matter that should be
left to the protocol and to the masters to develop as a matter of
practice. With respect, it is not a matter that should be put in the

unnecessary and, further, that it would introduce added uncertainty by
bringing in a gloss on the serious harm test in Clause 1. In
addition, it would add complexity to Clause 3 by introducing another
test for whether or not there should be a strike-out. As has been said,
the court is already able to strike out a case that has no merit;

the Government have made clear in previous debates on this point, the
courts already have a power in Rule 3.4 of the Civil Procedure Rules
that permits them to strike out all or part of a claim where there are
no reasonable grounds for bringing it or they consider it to be an
abuse of process. The courts are very familiar with that power and we

to an amendment on this issue in Committee, the noble Baroness referred
to the fact that my noble friend Lord Lester included a similar
provision in his Private Member’s Bill on defamation. However,
as my noble friend has just pointed out, by introducing the serious
harm test in Clause 1 we have simply taken a different approach to
achieve the same result. We have chosen to make a substantive change to
the law rather than a procedural one, but the result is the same: if
the court decides that the serious harm test is not met, it will use
its power under Rule 3.4 to strike it out.</hs_para>

perfectly clear and that there is no need to create a new strike-out
power, which could itself create confusion by largely duplicating the
existing power. The amendment would also mean that the court had to

regardless of whether that was a matter of dispute. That would
be unduly burdensome on both claimants and the
courts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020568000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020568000021">Finally,
I emphasise again what my noble friend Lord Ahmad said in the previous

be encouraging the courts to be more proactive in managing
cases to ensure that a tight grip is kept on cases that proceed to
trial. I assure the noble Lords that we are committed 
<?notus-xml column=190?>to addressing these issues and will ensure that appropriate provisions

amendment turns on a case called Telnikoff in the context of the honest
opinion defence in Clause 3. In Telnikoff, the House of Lords decided
that it was insufficient for a letter commenting on a newspaper article
to refer to the article in order to establish that it was opinion, not
fact. The letter had to be recognisable 
<?notus-xml column=191?>as opinion on its own rather than in the context of
the article. My noble friend wrote to the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Lloyd, on 9 January. I shall not repeat what he wrote, nor will I

the original newspaper article on which the letter was commenting
should be enough to establish the first and second conditions in Clause

greatest respect to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick,
the Government believe that the current law is in the right place. We
consider that it should be clear from the document in which the
statement appears that the author is expressing an opinion, otherwise a
reader cannot know that there is a judgment to be made. They must be
entitled to accept as a fact something that is presented as a fact. It
follows from this that we cannot accept Amendment 5. Although the Bill

commended for having dropped the checklist in Clause 4 and for
introducing instead the generic test, which I think was very much the
test that Sir Brian Neill, as an adviser, recommended. There
are three separate issues here. I am not sympathetic to widening the
reasonable test to one which “could be” rather than
“is”. I think that the objective test of reasonableness
is right. I am sympathetic to substituting the word
“decided” for “believed”. It is about
whether what was decided was reasonable and, therefore, it seems to me
that decided is a better word. It is not just I who say that: as has

has been recast. That has been welcomed, particularly by the promoters

8 is a government amendment that owes its authorship to the noble Lord.

Our amendment provides for the court to have regard to all the
circumstances of the case in deciding whether the requirements for the
public interest defence under Clause 4 to be satisfied have been met.
This amendment responds to concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Browne, in Committee that following government amendments to Clause 4
which, among other things, removed the list of factors for the courts
to consider, there was a risk that the courts would simply invent a new
checklist in interpreting and applying the new defence—a point

the context of that debate, I indicated that we did not believe that a
provision requiring the court to consider all the circumstances was
strictly necessary, because the courts would do this in any event. I
also indicated that in developing a body of case law the courts may
inevitably decide that particular factors are relevant in determining
whether the defence has been established in a case. That remains our
view. However, on reflection, I believe that it would be helpful to
send a signal to the courts and practitioners to make clear the wish of
Parliament that the new defence should be applied in as flexible a way
as possible in light of the
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020568000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020568000067">Amendments
6 and 7 would change the second limb of the test for establishing the
public interest defence under Clause 4, whereby it would be satisfied
if the defendant could show that he could reasonably have decided that
publishing the statement was in the public interest, rather than that
he reasonably believed that that was the case. This is intended to make
the test more objective, as noble Lords have indicated. It reflects
concern that the provision as currently drafted could lead to claimants
seeking to introduce arguments relating to the defendant’s
motive, which the courts have indicated is not relevant in relation to
the common-law defence. While a claimant might seek to introduce
arguments about the defendant’s motive, given the strong signal

states that the test draws in particular on the way in which the noble

quotes exactly the same section of the judgment. As an innocent in this
jungle of legal jargon and judgments, it does not surprise me that two
sides of the case should quote the same judgment. We think that we have

Committee, the Government tabled amendments to recast the public
interest defence contained in Clause 4 so that the second
limb of the test focuses on whether the defendant reasonably believed
that publication of the statement complained of was in the public
interest. The list of factors which the court could take into account
has been removed from the clause in response to concerns that it could
operate as a checklist and lead in practice to litigants and
practitioners adopting a risk-averse approach and gathering detailed
evidence on all the factors listed in case the court were ultimately to
consider them relevant. As it now stands, the clause is no longer open
to criticism that it could lead to a rigid interpretation. This is now
supported by government Amendment 8, which requires the court to
consider all the circumstances of the case in deciding whether the
public interest defence is established.</hs_para>

friend’s amendment would go even further and remove the
provision in the clause relating to reportage. That would effectively
abolish the doctrine, as the clause expressly abolishes the common law
defence with which it is linked. Our intention with Clause 4, as I have
said, is to reflect the law as set out in the Flood judgment. In
determining whether a defendant reasonably believed that publication
was in the public interest, the courts will, as they did previously,
very often want to see whether the defendant took any steps to verify
the truth of the statement in issue. The need to verify was an
important part of the Flood judgment. The common law makes it clear
that this is not a necessary step in a reportage case. We think that it
is important to make that clear. We also believe that doing so sends an
important signal that a defendant may need to take steps to verify a
statement when it is not a reportage case. However, we do not consider
that this will prevent the court deciding in a non-reportage case that
there is no need to verify. It will look at all the circumstances of
the case in deciding whether this is appropriate. We are therefore not
convinced of the need to change the clause further.</hs_para>

understandable preoccupation thus far with the traditional media, but,
of course, the web is becoming an increasingly dominant player in the
world of communication. Clause 5 deals with websites and in particular
with the position of operators of websites. As fellow Peers will know
by now, the Defamation Bill preserves primary liability, fairly, to the
author of any defamation and protects and gives a blanket protection to
the operators up to the point that a notice of complaint is
lodged—and for a period after
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020568000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020568000079">As we

Clause 5 as it stands, the web operator loses his defence only, as I
say, once the notice of complaint has been given and he fails to
respond in accordance with the regulations. I am happy that Amendment
17, to be moved shortly by the Government, will put into the Bill the

be expensive—just that will be too expensive for many
citizens—but so be it. There then has to be drafted a complaint
notice that satisfies Clause 5(6), 
<?notus-xml column=203?>explaining why a statement is defamatory—fair enough. There will
then be extra tests, or at least extra requirements, under the

yet more complicated tests on the defamed citizen—Amendment 14,
for example. Then and only then, when the notice of complaint has been
duly drawn up and served, will the operator of the website have to act
to preserve his immunity and defence. There will still be time—I
think probably 14 days—after all that when he can consider
whether to take down the statement complained about. In that
time—we could easily be talking about a month—the libel
will be up and will have spread across the globe and back. The more

another situation, where the operator had a stake in this and was maybe
a partner or had some business association with the person posting the

Otherwise, as I say, there could be an unfairness to the person defamed
and the operator would not be entirely at arm’s length or wholly
unaware. It would not be in a position where it could not anticipate
some potentially malign action on the part of the person who posted the
defamation. It could be, for example, that they were part of a joint
campaign. It could be that the website operator itself had an agenda.
More and more websites are campaigning websites and have an axe to
grind. Our amendments would at least ensure that where that was the
case and the court felt that the operator had not taken reasonable
care, and had knowledge or anticipation of what was likely to be posted

correct solution to the question of whether, and the extent to which,
website operators should be liable for defamation. At the moment, there
is no bespoke provision dealing with website
operators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020568000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020568000089">Section
1 of the Defamation Act 1996 was passed to deal with the position of
wholesalers, booksellers, newsagents and libraries. It provides a
possible defence for website operators, but this defence failed in the
case of Godfrey v Demon in 2001 when a website operator did not remove
the posting immediately upon being aware of its defamatory content.
There is also a potential answer provided by the Electronic Commerce

protection this provides for so-called hosting. There is equally
considerable doubt as to what does or does not constitute publication.
Therefore, I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T19:31:48"></hs_TimeCode>

unfortunate that no such code of practice has emerged. As our amendment

law means only a well funded claimant with a serious complaint can even
dream of bringing proceedings. In respect of that rather small risk, it
is clear that website operators can take out insurance in respect of
which only modest premiums would be payable. That seems to me a small
price to pay for the protection of those who are genuinely aggrieved at
defamatory content being posted on a website. In Grand Committee I gave

member of the Joint Committee subjecting the Data Communications Bill

position. They did not want to have to store any information which was
not commercially useful to them even if it helped government agencies
to track down and prosecute criminals. Much was made of their
users’ rights to privacy. This is something of an irony since
the information that users of websites provide is of course extremely
valuable commercially. Website operators now say that it is very
inconvenient to take down potentially defamatory material and that it
compromises free speech. It is perhaps a little easy to deploy free

why this is so. As I said in Grand Committee, there is across the world
a 
<?notus-xml column=206?>fundamental difference between on the one hand the Chinese and,
on the other, the United States. The Chinese position on the world wide
web is to create the great firewall of China and the Chinese intranet
and to do whatever it can to be able to censor the use of the web by
dissidents of one kind or another. The position of the United States,
ever since Bill Clinton’s statute, gives an absolute immunity to
United States internet service providers. The European compromise is
contained in the e-commerce directive, as the noble Lord, Lord Faulks,
indicated, and seeks to strike a fair balance between freedom of speech
and personal privacy and reputation in the structure of the
regulations. Although it is vague, it is fairly

can any one country do to try to strike a fair balance? How can we
devise a system that will encourage operators such as Google and Yahoo
in this respect, given that they have no particular commercial interest
in keeping up anything they post which is controversial? For example,
if they post criticisms of Ruritania as a corrupt, disgraceful and
oppressive Government, and then a threat is made to them to take it
down, they have no commercial interest in keeping it up, even though we
as citizens have every interest in their doing so. That is the free

friend the Minister to take no rubbish from website operators. I have
great sympathy with the purpose of this amendment. There are a lot of
people out there who are essentially defenceless when things appear
about them on the web. We need to make sure that the regulations enable
them to get easy redress and relief and that we do not allow long
timescales to suit operators when short timescales would suit the
people who have been defamed. At the same time, as my noble friend
said, we have to balance that with our freedom to be rude about people
who we need to be rude about and to say nasty things about Ruritania or
anywhere else, and to keep the powerful under control. It is a
difficult balancing act. I think that the right way to deal with this
is in the regulations under Clause 5(5), which can go into
some detail and some precision about this. I would hate to be subject
to this amendment. As a website operator I really would not know where
I was, or what I was or was not allowed to do, particularly with no

and my noble friend Lord McNally and I met them to discuss those
concerns. I am pleased to say that, as has been acknowledged, as a
result of those discussions the Government have been able to bring
forward Amendment 17 on the issue of malice, which I shall speak to in
the next group of amendments. However, this amendment takes a different
approach to that taken by the Government in Clause 5. As has been said,
it would replace the Clause 5 defence and the accompanying process with
provisions which substantially replicate the defence for secondary
publishers currently found under Section 1 of the
Defamation Act 1996 but with one important addition. New
subsection (1)(d) would require the operator, on receipt of
a complaint, to respond with expedition and to take such action as is
reasonable in the circumstances.</hs_para>

requirement would mean that, in order to have a defence, the operator
would, on receipt of a complaint, need to make a judgment on what
action it was reasonable to take. This would inevitably involve them
reaching a view on the merits of the case, which in most instances they
would not be in a position to do. The fact that they would lose the
defence if a court decided that they had not acted reasonably would
create a great deal of uncertainty for website operators, and we
believe that in practice it would mean that many operators would simply
choose to take the material down. That would result in exactly the same
situation that we have now—an approach which has been criticised
as unsatisfactory not only by a large majority of the responses to our
public consultation but by the Joint Committee on the draft Bill and by
the Law Commission in its 2002 scoping study on defamation and the

not the defence was made out, to take account of any steps taken by the

defamation, a complaints procedure or a system for providing identity
details of posters to claimants to enable them to bring proceedings
against the poster. I totally understand the intention behind the
proposed subsection but Clause 5 already sets out a simple process in
relation to the handling of complaints and the provision of identity
details. In the event that a complainant brings proceedings against a
website operator, the court will be able to assess whether the operator
has complied with that process. This will ensure that the court takes
into account how the operator has responded to the complaint. Perhaps I
may also inform noble Lords that we will be publishing specific

interests involved. It will help freedom of expression by giving the
poster of allegedly defamatory material an opportunity to stand up for
it if they wish to do so, and it will give greater certainty to website
operators. At the same time, it will enable claimants to secure
take-down of the material on a short fixed timescale in the event that
the poster does not wish to defend it. Where the poster does wish to

Act is that local people should be able to influence improvements to
local health and social care. To succeed, Healthwatch needs the trust
and confidence of the public. To win that trust and to become an
effective organisation for patients, it must have independence from the
providers, commissioners and regulators of health services, because a
patient’s complaint may involve the need to challenge any or all
three of those interests. It must also have genuine grass-roots
representation from groups and individuals, no top-down organisation,
and work and comments derived from sound local

on Healthwatch England, I welcomed the appointment of Anna Bradley as
its new chair. She has the right skills and experience, and I do not
doubt her commitment to try to make the organisation work. However, the
fact remains that it is a sub-committee of the CQC and it does not have
anywhere near the same levers to pull or incentives to use to drive
changes in the system. It simply does not have the power and authority
of the three big players in the NHS: the Commissioning Board, the Care

the regulations that we are considering tonight, that problem is

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> My Lords, I am becoming increasingly
of the view that the Government have mis-sold the concept of
Healthwatch. When we first started on this long journey and the Health
and Social Care Bill was coming before Parliament, the Government
promised that we would get an effective patient-user voice. They
promised that we would have a coherent structure. They promised that
Healthwatch would ensure that patients’ interests and the voice
of users would be heard centrally in the new NHS structures. But that
is not what we are
getting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T20:03:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020573000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020573000028">I
spent 12 years as director of the national statutory body representing
patients’ interests in the NHS and I learnt a number of
things during that experience, one of which was that however well
argued or well informed the case made on behalf of the users of
services in the National Health Service might be, it is not
automatically listened to. The powerful vested interests within health
militate against that. Let us be clear: there is a power imbalance
between the user and the provider of the health service. There is an
imbalance in information and in what they can do. For the voice of the
users to become as central as repeated government policy has said it
should be, that voice has to be substantial and loud. That means that
the bodies representing the interests of users have to be able to make
waves. They have to make people listen and, on occasion, they have to
be a nuisance. That is why, when the Bill was going through Parliament,
we asked repeatedly in your Lordships’ House whether Healthwatch
would be able to campaign in the interests of the users of the service
that they were representing.</hs_para>

again the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, assured us that that would be
the case—Healthwatch would be able to campaign in support of the
interests of local health service users. As is widely known, I defer to
no one in my respect for the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. To
mis-speak once may be regarded as a misfortune; to mis-speak twice
begins to look like carelessness. Either the noble Baroness was being
extremely careless—repeatedly, both in Committee and on
Report—or policy has changed. Despite the intent that these
would be vibrant, effective, campaigning voices on behalf of
patients, somewhere along the line someone in the Department of Health
took a decision and said, “No, we mustn’t allow them to

we should be clear that there will not be one point of contact so that
a local Healthwatch would know where to go to be given clear and
consistent guidance, because the structure that the Government are

course, there is an answer to this. Ministers could decide, having
listened, not to press on with the regulations. They could say that
they should be withdrawn. There are two good reasons why they should do
that. First, the regulations are appallingly drafted and in practice
unworkable—and will be unworkable when they are interpreted in
several hundred different ways around the country. The second good
reason is that tomorrow we will hear the report on Mid Staffordshire. I
suspect that one of the strongest lessons that will emerge
from the report is the need for strong, local representation of the
interests of local users of the health service. That means strong and
effective local Healthwatch organisations. These regulations will not
give us strong and effective local Healthwatch organisations, so if the
Government are serious in whatever they say in response to
tomorrow’s Francis report, they ought to withdraw the
regulations tonight and come forward with sensible regulations that

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the points made by my two
noble friends in their eloquent speeches. I speak as someone who was
given assurances about campaigning on Report by the noble Baroness,
Lady Northover. My filing system is not up to discovering whether she
sent me a letter, but I have no recollection that she withdrew her
assurances in any way. The set of regulations in Regulation 36(1) and
(2) of Part 6, taken together, totally neuter the ability of local
Healthwatch organisations to campaign effectively.</hs_para>

my noble friend said, the extraordinary thing is that the Government
have chosen, with absolutely brilliant timing, to bring this before the
House on the day before publication of the Francis report. My noble
friend was wise. He did not know when the Francis report was coming
out, but the Government had an opportunity to offer the chance to defer
these regulations. It is very odd that we are having this debate when
no doubt tomorrow there will be an unleashing—a positive
avalanche—of rhetoric about the need to put the patient at the
centre of the NHS. There was a warm-up on “Newsnight”
yesterday. We can see it
coming<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T20:15:33"></hs_TimeCode>. Now we
have a set of regulations that will set up local Healthwatch alongside
Healthwatch England. The organisations will be totally unable to
campaign against policies that they regard as not in patients’
interests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T20:15:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T20:15:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020573000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020573000039">I
will spend a few moments on the text of the regulations. The
Explanatory Note on page 38 of the regulations
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13020573000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020573000130">“Regulation

is an extraordinary statement, but Regulation 36(1) and (2)
go rather wider than that. The Explanatory Note does not accurately
reflect what is in the regulations. Consideration needs to be given to
the quality of the drafting of either the Explanatory Note or of
Regulation 36(1)(a) and (b), interrelated with Regulation 36(2).
Regulation 36(1)(a) and (b) prevents a local Healthwatch organisation
promoting or opposing changes in the policy adopted by any governmental
or public body in relation to any matter, including the promotion of
changes to the policy, unless under Regulation 36(2)(a) they can
reasonably be regarded as incidental to other activities which are

So it is left to a multitude of small local social enterprises around
the country to make a judgment, day by day, about whether
what they are doing offends the provisions in Regulation

if we assume that there is some scope under that wording for them to
campaign—which I very much doubt on any reasonable
interpretation of the words—they will be in a state of

the minuscule amounts of money they have to carry out their operations.
So if the Government want them to be effective with the small amounts
of money there is likely to be, why do they want them to be tied-up by

I draw attention to the requirement provisions in Regulations 40 to 43.

Jolly:</Member></B> My Lords, just under a year ago on 8 March 2012 we
were asked, during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act, to
accept a last-minute change of structure of local Healthwatch
because, as the Minister put it at the time, on reflection the
Government realised that greater flexibility was needed over the
organisational form of local Healthwatch. It was not entirely clear
what lay behind this sudden realisation, which happened after the Bill
had been through the Commons. The House was given only five working
days within which to make sense of 50-plus government amendments that
were put down at the time to achieve this
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T20:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020573000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020573000046">This
was a very unusual action for the Government to have taken and very
little explanation was given. Stakeholders in patient and public

Government the benefit of the doubt. We continued to put our faith in
the Government’s intention as stated in the White Paper,
<I>Equity and </I><I>E</I><I>xcellence</I>, which aimed to strengthen
the collective voice of patients through a new independent consumer

the debate on Report, the Minister described Healthwatch as, indeed,
the voice of the people. At that time, we were dealing with the third
reform of the way in which local communities influenced their NHS in
three years, and there was a general view that, for their sake, we
needed to get on with it. To avoid switching off the power for local
communities to have 
<?notus-xml column=217?>a say in local services for too long, we felt the
turbulence of further reform needed to be kept to a minimum. We hoped
that secondary legislation would give the system its real shape and we
would have an opportunity to ensure that the essentials were in place,
changes in structure notwithstanding. This secondary legislation, which
is among the most difficult to fathom, really fails to

Healthwatch must be a social enterprise contracted by a local authority

may or may not be local or social enterprises—to support or

structural tangle and preserve the essence of local Healthwatch as the
Minister intended it to be—the “collective voice of
patients” operating through a “strong local
infrastructure”—in March 2012 we focused on who would be
involved. We debated the independence of local Healthwatch from the
local authority that contracts it, and similarly the independence of

have listened to the concerns expressed about the need for local

to the House today that we will use the power of the Secretary of State
to specify criteria, which local healthwatch must satisfy, to include
strong involvement by volunteers and lay members, including in its
governance and leadership. This will have the effect that a local
authority cannot award a local healthwatch contract to a social

<?notus-xml column=220?>to when we had the White Paper, which was published in July 2010. I
remember, as my noble friend Lady Jolly has said, how excited I was
then by the fact that in local Healthwatch we were to have an
organisation that really would be the collective voice of patients.
There was a mechanism so that it would have a very strong

throughout the passage of the Bill Members of your Lordships’

are not only disappointed but deeply concerned. I share the grave

add to the accountability framework of the NHS. This view is shared by
Healthwatch England which, as the noble Lord, Lord Collins, has said,
suggests that this could be dealt with by guidance. However, the
trouble with guidance is that it does not have any statutory force.
However, it could use its powers to sharpen the way in which local
Healthwatch operates—as an independent champion through the

have not given my noble friend any notice of this, but perhaps he might
like to think about that and take it away.</hs_para>

well on the local authority commissioners, who are “an organ or

very fact that we have to ask these questions demonstrates that we do

by local authorities, which it is supposed to be scrutinising, is
pretty uncomfortable. The added constraints of Regulation 36 threaten
its freedom to speak and to act in the interests of patients and the
population. These very complex restrictions seem designed to protect
those in politics or in the provision of services who have something to

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Collins, for raising his concerns and other noble Lords for
following in his footsteps in sometimes very trenchant terms. A number
of concerns have been raised about these regulations during the course
of the debate and I will now do my best to address them in turn. A
number of noble Lords reminded us of the critical importance of lay
involvement in local Healthwatch and questioned why the wording of the
regulations does not therefore prohibit employees of a local authority
or indeed of the NHS from taking roles in the leadership 
<?notus-xml column=222?>and governance of a local
Healthwatch<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T20:43:25"></hs_TimeCode>.
Indeed, your Lordships’ scrutiny committee suggested that this
might leave a local Healthwatch in some way vulnerable to manipulation
or threaten its independence. That concern was picked up by one or two
noble Lords. I can, I hope, provide reassurance on this. Indeed, I am
sorry that despite the department’s clarificatory submission to
the scrutiny committee, it still remains a source of concern.</hs_para>

the importance of local Healthwatch being truly local organisations
that are led by local people and involve volunteers. That policy aim is
reflected in the way the regulations are drafted. They impose explicit
requirements relating to the involvement of lay persons and volunteers.
Both those terms are defined. The definitions of “lay”
and “volunteer” are designed to be as inclusive as
possible. Essentially, they aim to cover those who wish to give up
their time for something they feel passionately about to influence
change and service improvement. In practice, very often lay people and
volunteers are the same group of people, but we thought it important
not to frame a definition in a way that would exclude other people who
might not define themselves in precisely those terms. The definition
should, and does, apply as much to those who have paid jobs but who
wish to do their bit for the community in their spare time as to those
who do not work or who are
retired<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T20:45:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13020573000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020573000151">8.45

that certainly a person with a professional health or social care
background could be a member of a local Healthwatch, but unlike some
noble Lords, I do not view that possibility as in any way
unhelpful or sinister, quite the reverse. A person with insight and
expertise on good ways to influence and build relationships in a local
community could be an immense asset to those leading a local
Healthwatch organisation. I do not regard it as giving rise to an
automatic conflict of interest. In most circumstances the
person’s paid work would be complementary to the work of the
local Healthwatch. Yes, one could certainly imagine circumstances where
a conflict of interest might arise, but conflicts of interest are
capable of arising in any walk of life and there are well established
ways of dealing with them. For me, the upside of enabling local
Healthwatch membership to be as diverse and inclusive as possible in
relation to its local community far outweighs any potential downside.
To say that inclusivity leaves a local Healthwatch vulnerable to
manipulation is, I think, an entirely wrong way of looking
at things.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020573000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020573000083">I
say that particularly in the light of the way that the regulations
tighten up the requirements around the role of lay people and
volunteers. Regulation 38 makes it a requirement that lay people and
volunteers are involved in the governance arrangements of a local
Healthwatch. Regulations 40 and 41 specify the involvement of lay
people and volunteers in the contractual requirements for local
authorities. Regulation 40 also makes clear that the making of relevant
decisions by a local Healthwatch must involve lay people and
volunteers. Those are mandatory provisions. Taken together, they mean,
in simple language, that a local authority will not be allowed to
contract with a local Healthwatch 
<?notus-xml column=223?>unless its governance arrangements include lay people and volunteers.
The contract will have to include provisions on lay and volunteer
involvement. It is worth noting that these provisions go much further
than the regulations that govern the operation of LINks published in
2008, which did not contain any such requirements. We have considerably
strengthened this element of the legal underpinning.</hs_para>

the use of the word “involvement”. The term
“involvement” here is being used in its ordinary sense.
We quite deliberately did not want to define this any further. The
appropriate level of involvement in a given situation would depend on
the matter in question. In some cases, the simple sharing of
information might suffice, but in many, if not most cases, this would
be insufficient. Therefore the provisions require a local Healthwatch
to involve lay people and volunteers in the making of relevant
decisions. That is set out in Regulation 40(1)(a) read together with
Regulation 40(2), (3) and (4). That is as far as it is sensible to go,
because it would not be reasonable or helpful to insist on a given
level of involvement for each and every decision taken by a local
Healthwatch.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020573000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0002.htm#13020573000085">The
other main issue of concern to the noble Lord, Lord Collins, and others
is that of campaigning by a local Healthwatch. I am afraid that there
has been a considerable amount of unnecessary misunderstanding on this
point. I am particularly sorry that the Government’s good faith
on our assurances to the House should be called into question. To go
back to the beginning, Healthwatch is the new consumer champion for
health and social care. This gives it a major role in gathering views
in the locality, building the evidence and, from that evidence,
formulating reports and recommendations that will improve services and
the quality of care. In doing this, it would not be in anybody’s
interests not to enable local Healthwatch organisations to speak out.
They will be able to speak out, and they will be able to campaign.
Specifically, and typically, they will be able to campaign for changes
in services in their own localities. However, there might be an issue
of regional or national relevance on which they wished to make their
voice heard. That would be fine as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020573000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020573000086">Noble
Lords and others have read Regulation 36 and have concluded that it is
incomprehensible or unworkable—or, indeed, both. In fact,
Regulation 36 does something very simple. In plain terms, it says that
a local Healthwatch can campaign and can speak out as part and parcel
of its role as the local consumer voice. In other words, it can
campaign on things that are directly connected to what local people are
concerned about, based, as I have said, on robust evidence, and where
the changes being campaigned on are inspired and supported by local
people. Such campaigns might, or might not, have a political flavour to
them. To take the example of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, a
local Healthwatch could campaign as vociferously as it liked on the
reorganisation of a diabetes service. What a local Healthwatch cannot
do is conduct campaigns of a political nature where such campaigns are
not connected to what local people are saying or thinking, that are not
evidence-based, and that do not carry  
<?notus-xml column=224?>a credible degree of local support. Nor can a local Healthwatch make
such campaigning its main raison d’être. Campaigning on
any issue has to flow seamlessly from the local Healthwatch’s
main activity, which is to act as the voice of local people and to make
that voice count towards improving health and care

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> The noble Earl has been
extraordinarily helpful in telling us what Regulation 36 is meant to
mean. My first question is why it does not say that, as opposed to
producing a formulation. Your Lordships are used to this sort of stuff.
If every noble Lord who has spoken in this debate apart from the noble
Earl has found it difficult to follow, I find it difficult to see how

Earl then said what local Healthwatch organisations can do. He said
that they can campaign provided it is evidence-based and draws upon the

mounted? Is it then going to say, “Well, you are not actually

Lord’s other point, we are talking about the difference between
being a genuine voice for local people and simply being an adjunct of a
political party. Local Healthwatch organisations should not be swayed

independently. The only influence that matters to them is that of local

will be to hold the local Healthwatch to account according to that

that I have set out as to what a reasonable person would interpret as
legitimate activities and stray into the territory of being a political
party adjunct, it would be the duty of the local authority to make a
judgment about that. It would be a matter of judgment, but it would be
important for the local authority to make its views rapidly known to
the local Healthwatch to ensure that it retained the role that it
should have, which is a role that primarily involves community benefit.
There are checks and balances in the system, and those responsibilities
are held primarily by the local authority.</hs_para>

interests of a local authority to make sure that it has a good,
thriving relationship with its local Healthwatch but that it is not
tarnished by party political considerations that are irrelevant to the
concerns of local people. The very fact that a local Healthwatch comes
out with a political statement is not to damn its activity. What makes
it vulnerable is if that local Healthwatch cannot show that it is truly

about patient experiences to campaigners on that issue. Yes. In that
scenario, we would envisage a local Healthwatch taking those very views
and evidence of good standards of service directly to the commissioners
or decision-makers. A local Healthwatch can also make a referral to the
health scrutiny function of the local authority, which would be
required to keep a local Healthwatch informed of any action taken. If a
local Healthwatch thought, as part of its Section 221
activities—patients’ public involvement
activities—that local people need to know what their
community’s experience of its A&amp;E is, we would certainly
expect the local Healthwatch to be transparent and make that evidence

the local Healthwatch to decide whether such people can add value to
the outcomes that it wishes to achieve for its local people. Local
Healthwatch has to be different; it has to build up its reputation and
credibility in order to secure the public’s confidence that it
can have a mature relationship with local authorities, which was the
point that I made just now. The regulations seek to ensure that local

As I have explained, we have sought through the regulations to be as
inclusive as possible of people who may wish to give up their time to

fundamental in relation to the conflicts of interests, particularly in

statutory force. Here I take the words of Healthwatch England: the
Department of Health could and should have done better with these

Minister has not given me satisfactory reassurances, certainly not in
relation to the issues that the noble Baronesses, Lady Jolly and Lady

this group we very much welcome government Amendment 17, which the

simply to ensure that a claimant can find out from the web operator the
name and contact details of the person who posted the comment so that
they can sort it out between themselves. Provided that they do this,
the operator has the defence that the author is the person to be sued.
The exception for malice would cover where the operator in some way
connived or encouraged the trouncing of someone’s reputation. I

think that there are some challenges around this proposal. In
Grand Committee, in response to amendments proposed by the noble
Baroness and her colleagues, we discussed the variety of web services
and websites that exist today, and that is where I think there may be a
challenge. There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T21:27:21"></hs_TimeCode>
are indeed a number of websites that would be amenable to the posting
of a notice and where that would be quite straightforward. However,
when we consider the vast scope of speech that may exist across the
internet, it is clear that we are dealing with a wide variety of
services.</hs_para>

intention behind Clause 5—and it is one that I
support—is to make sure that we maximise the opportunities for
people to speak freely. There may be cases where we
need to interfere but we do not want to 
<?notus-xml column=232?>overly restrict the opportunities to speak freely
and, as we discussed in the previous debate, the intention behind the
clause is to ensure that a defence is widely available to such
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T21:27:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

while Amendment 11 would work perfectly well for a number of web
services—I suspect the larger, more mature and more
sophisticated could implement a system of posting notices in a
relatively straightforward manner—there is a whole host of web
services of varying shapes and sizes for which this would present a
barrier. That would effectively mean that those services would lose the
defence—a defence which I think we agreed in a previous debate
is important to sustain the notion of free speech.</hs_para>

understand the noble Baroness’s intention behind the amendment
and I imagine that, as a matter of good practice, operators should post
such notices where it is reasonable for them to do so. Indeed,
Wikipedia has implemented a good practice system so that when content
is contested, people are able to discuss it. That kind of good practice
is reasonable but I think that restricting the scope of the defence
only to services that are able to do that goes further than is sensible
if we are to maintain a broad ecosystem of services in which a citizen
of the United Kingdom can speak freely without excessive interference
from people bringing
complaints<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T21:28:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that I would note from an operator perspective is that every system
that is put in place is abused. My noble friend Lord Phillips of
Sudbury has talked about the interests of the “little
man” or individual who wishes to make a complaint of defamation.
That is absolutely right. However, the experience of web service
operators is that some people will try to use any system that you put
in place for their own purposes, and I can immediately see the
scope for that when I look at this amendment. If you can
guarantee that a notice will be published on a website simply by filing
a complaint, I can see huge scope for it to be used by those who wish
to be aggressive towards people who post content on the internet that
they do not like, irrespective of whether there is any kind of
substantive defamation claim. Given that the individual filing the
complaint faces no penalty in this regime, a complaint can be found
groundless but there will be no comeback on the individual who filed
it. It would effectively create an avenue for that person to have their
content posted alongside that which they do not like. I can certainly
imagine that there would be significant instances when it was used in
that manner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T21:30:13"></hs_TimeCode>. For
those reasons, Amendment 11 would not be helpful to fulfilling the
intention of Clause

Allan of Hallam:</Member></B> The right way is to keep Clause 5 as it
is currently drafted. The Government have done a good job in drafting
the scope of this defence as an additional measure to those currently
available under the e-commerce directive. It makes
sense to have this additional defence. My concern is 
<?notus-xml column=233?>that Amendment 11 would be an additional burden and
further restrict the defence only to websites that have the ability to
post a notice in this way. I imagine that a significant number of
websites which could avail themselves of the defence in Clause 5 would
not be able to do so if there were a requirement to post a
notice. I can also imagine instances when such a requirement would be
abused. It makes sense to leave it to the website operator, once they
have received a complaint, to deal with it under Clause 5 as it is. I
also think that it would be sufficient to encourage website operators
to post notices when things are contested and they believe that a
notice would fit with their environment and be helpful. There are
instances when you need to mandate something and instances when you
want to encourage it as a model of good practice. In the context of
notices, the mandated option is wrong and the good practice
option is
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T21:32:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020580000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lester of Herne Hill" PimsId="1473" UID="13020580000172" xid="1310" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000172">Lord
Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> Having spent about three and a half
years attempting to reform the law of defamation, and in the light of
what happened on the first amendment today, my overriding objective is
to get the Bill through. I want to make it clear that I shall not be
moving any of the amendments in my name this evening. I say that now in
case anyone else, in their sad lives, wishes to do so. Having thought
about it, I take the view that the regime as it stands, with
regulations, will be perfectly capable of accommodating some of these
issues properly and that we are now being overcareful and
overprescriptive. I know that it is very unusual for a member of the
Bar to indicate that he is under a decree of self-imposed silence, but
that is my
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T21:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020580000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Phillips of Sudbury" PimsId="181" UID="13020580000173" xid="1827" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000173">Lord
Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I listened carefully to
what my noble friend Lord Allan of Hallam said. He will forgive me if I
say that, coupled with what he said in Committee, there seems to be a
leitmotif in his objections to amendments that really the industry is
too big to control. That has echoes of the banks being too big to fail.
The truth is that they are enormous organisations and with that
enormity comes enormous power and the ability to inflict enormous
damage on occasion.</hs_para>

like the purport of Amendment 11. It seems right that, while the
operator is considering what to do in the longer term, a notice of
complaint should be there so that anybody reading the original
defamation will see the complaint alongside it. I also understand some
of the points made by my noble friend Lord Allan of Hallam. Perhaps in
responding the Minister will tell us whether under Clause 5(5) it will
be possible through regulations to introduce a regime for posting
complaints and so on that would be practical in the variety of
circumstances to which my noble friend Lord Allan of Hallam alluded.
That would seem to be the obvious way to go: to take the time to work
out a provision that works for all the different types of platform, and
at the same time plays fair both by the operator and the

for the defence under Clause 5 to be defeated if the
claimant shows that the website operator has acted with malice in
relation to the posting of the statement concerned. We tabled this
amendment in response to the concern raised in Committee by my noble
friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury that situations might arise in which a
website operator acts maliciously, for example by inciting the poster
to make the posting or otherwise colluding with him. While we consider
that these situations are unlikely to be common, on reflection we
agreed that in circumstances where a website operator acts maliciously
it is right that the defence should be defeated. I thank my noble

11 was also tabled in Committee. It would require a website operator
who wished to rely on the Clause 5 defence to publish a notice of
complaint alongside the material complained of within seven days of
receipt of the complaint. The amendment also provides that if the
website operator fails to post a notice within the set period, they
will forfeit this defence and will be able to rely solely on the
standard defences available to a primary

basis for this amendment is a recommendation of the Joint Committee on
the Bill that website operators should attach notices to online
material when complaints are received. The Government’s position
on this proposal was first set out in our response to the Joint
Committee’s report. We repeated our position during the passage
of the Bill in this House and the other place. The issue is one of
practicality. Ministry of Justice officials received representations
from internet organisations following publication of the Joint
Committee’s report, highlighting the practical and technical
difficulties with the proposal relating to the posting of a notice of
complaint alongside defamatory
material.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020580000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000021">I
will go through some obvious concerns that were raised, which
may underline the practical issues. First, the point was raised that
complained-about content might be embedded in a number of different
sites, making it unclear who should be responsible for attaching the
notice, where it should be placed and how it could be transferred
across to other sites on which the material might subsequently appear.
Again, as I said in Committee, I fully appreciate that the argument
presents itself as one that it is in the interests of internet
organisations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020580000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000022">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T14:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>

Lord Allan of Hallam highlighted practical issues from his own

daughter’s experience as a graphic designer for websites, and of
the complexities of an operator attaching additional content without
going back to the original programmer. I also acknowledge fully that my

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 16 would allow the
regulations governing the Clause 5 process to provide for a procedure
for a complainant, website operator or person who posted the statement
complained of to seek a court declaration as to whether the complaint
meets the basic requirements of a libel claim.</hs_para>

envisage the creation of a system whereby, alongside the Clause 5
process, any party can seek a court declaration on a prima facie basis.
It is difficult to see what incentive there would be for a complainant
to do this. Such a declaration would not be determinative of the merits
of the case or affect the availability of the Clause 5 defence, and so
it would potentially just be an additional—and
costly—step before registering a notice of complaint. Instead,
the proposal appears primarily to be aimed at helping website operators
to make informed decisions as to the strength of complaints so that
they can be more confident in removing material or leaving it online
depending on whether or not a declaration is
granted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020580000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000043">We
have serious practical concerns about this proposal. It has been
suggested that the process could operate through consideration by a
High Court master, on the papers, at very short notice and on payment
of a nominal court fee. That seems unrealistic. We consider that it
does not adequately take account of the time the process would take,
given the significant additional burden on the courts, the extent of
the evidence that could be needed to reach a decision and the
consequent costs to the parties involved. There is also the possibility
of rulings being appealed, which could add to the time and costs
involved. Bearing in mind that the prima facie declaration would not be
determinative of the merits of a case, it is difficult to
see how that is warranted.</hs_para>

consider that this additional process is needed. Clause 5 is intended
to operate in such a way as to avoid website operators having to make
decisions about the merits of defamatory complaints. The
representations we received from many website

response, we have sought to create a simple, quick, cheap and effective
means for the complainant to request the removal of defamatory material
and for the poster to engage with this request and stand by his posting

operator from the process as far as possible, so that if they follow
the process as will be set out in regulations they will have a defence

additional certainty and protection for website operators. We believe

in Committee by my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury. The
Defamation Act 1996 gives a defence of qualified privilege to fair and
accurate reports of proceedings at a general meeting of a UK public
company, and to copies of and extracts from various documents
circulated to members of such a company. Clause 7(7) extends this
protection more widely to cover reports in relation to companies listed
on recognised stock exchanges worldwide and to summaries of such
material. This includes material,</hs_para>

addition, extend qualified privilege to material relating to the
appointment, resignation, retirement or dismissal of the
company’s auditors. When my noble friend raised this issue in
Grand Committee, it was suggested that the existing provisions of
Clause 7(7) might already cover it. We considered that in circumstances
where this information was contained in documents circulated to
members of a company by or with the authority of the board of
directors or by the auditors, it would be covered by paragraph 13(2) of
Schedule 1 to the 1996 Act. However, circumstances where the
information was published without the authority of the board of
directors would not be covered so, on reflection, we consider it
desirable to extend the provision to cover these additional situations.
This would be in line with the more general government policy to
increase the transparency of interactions between companies and their
auditors. I am grateful to my noble friend for his suggestion in this

provision in the Act itself that abolishes the common-law defence of
innocent dissemination, and it is clear from paragraph 2.6 of the
consultation on the draft Bill, which was published in July 1995,
entitled <I>Reforming Defamation Law and Procedure</I>, that, in
introducing the Bill into Parliament, the Government intended that the
Act, as the then Lord Chancellor said, would supersede, replace and
modernise the existing law. The legislation that was eventually passed
does not expressly provide for the abolition of the common-law defence,

is that there is some uncertainty over what the relationship
between Section 1 of the 1996 Act and the common-law defence of
innocent dissemination amounted to, and where that then sits in the
light of the provisions of the Bill. I shall try to give a short
explanation of this because of the lateness of the hour and because
these arguments were rehearsed at some length in Committee. The
Booksellers Association says that booksellers are presently in a
disadvantaged position compared with where they were when the
common-law defence of innocent dissemination was the defence that they
were entitled to. It says that in those circumstances, if booksellers
had a book—in those days—on their shelves in which it was
claimed a defamatory statement had been included, they were protected
if they had the advice of a lawyer who said that there was a defence to
such an allegation.</hs_para>

says, the position of booksellers is such that when they are challenged
in those circumstances—and there is some considerable evidence
that they are commonly challenged—by lawyers on behalf of people
claiming that the books they are selling contain defamatory
information, they are so unsure about their position that it is better
just to take the book off the shelf. Given the challenges that
booksellers face at the moment, the secondary publishers industry in
particular, this can have a significant effect on a bookseller’s
ability to be able to continue a business because, as has been
explained to me, in those circumstances wholesalers are quite reluctant
to take the books

amendment is to restore the defence of innocent dissemination, which
would put booksellers into the position that they believed they were in
prior to the 1996 Act. Alternatively, and this is my second attempt to
try to achieve this, to obtain from the Government—from the
Minister at the Dispatch Box—a clear explanation for why Section
1 of the 1996 Act is as good, and the provisions of the Bill when it
becomes an Act will be as good, as the defence of innocent
dissemination. In the Committee debate, I offered that opportunity to
the Minister but he did not take it. At the very least, the secondary
publishers that the Bill seeks to put into a position of some
stability, certainty and clarity are entitled to an explanation from
the Government of whether they are in a better position, or even
whether, in the Government’s view, the common-law defence still
exists. If it does still exist in the view of the Government, that will
be of considerable comfort to them.</hs_para>

this occasion either to accept that we should restore the position that
booksellers were in prior to the 1996 Act or, if not, to explain why

Amendment 17, in which the Government, to the approbation of the House,
introduced the issue of malice. If the operator of a website was
actuated by malice, it will deprive him of his defence. That is no

far this evening, the noble Lord, Lord Browne, has discussed Clause 10
and his Amendment 20 exclusively in terms of booksellers, but it
applies equally to website operators. It will completely undo the
introduction of the issue of malice into Clause 5 if Clause 10 allows
an operator to avoid being sued for having allowed something to be
posted with malice on the part of the operator if, in the language of
Clause 10(1), it is reasonably practicable to sue the author, editor or
publisher. I apologise for not having picked this up earlier, but we
need to do something about it. It also infects Amendment 20, where the
same issue prevails.</hs_parafo>

I am sorry to have to object to this amendment, but in proposed

Lords will know of the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions. In
pre-legislative scrutiny, it took evidence from a Mr Burby on
super-injunctions. His first piece of evidence was entirely about
super-injunctions, which anyone could give. His supplementary evidence
was about himself. The courts had told him, after his acts of blackmail
and harassment, that under the injunction he could not make any of
these statements publicly. So he came along to the Joint Committee and
gave the evidence at a meeting chaired by Mr Whittingdale. In his
supplementary evidence, he repeated all the things that the court had
told him he was under an injunction not to say anything about. He
repeated evidence about the allegations and the whole case which the

which chose to go ahead and publish, again arguing parliamentary
privilege. I was concerned about this and asked the Clerk of the
Parliaments how this could happen. I asked him why it is not ruled that
the committee publishing evidence on its website, citing all those
things which the court has told the witness he cannot say, is able to
say that the injunction does not matter because we are the ones who
make the decision here. That evidence is still being published today.

injunction, which basically means that it was not relevant to the Joint

the central issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Browne, I will try
again to see whether he is any more satisfied. As he explained, the

innocent dissemination. We explained in Committee, and previously in
the other place, the Government’s concern about a provision such
as this, which requires the court, as part of an assessment on
jurisdiction, to assess at least to some extent the merits of the case
before it. We think that such an approach has the potential to be
unnecessarily confusing.</hs_para>

my response on the substantive issue at hand here—the defence of
innocent dissemination. We have acknowledged the debate that exists
over the terms of Section 1 of the 1996 Act and how this compares to
the common law defence. During the Committee stage the noble Lord, Lord
Browne, asked me to be “more courageous” in articulating
how the Government saw Section 1 and the common law interrelating.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T22:18:11"></hs_TimeCode> this House
was considering what became Section 1 of the 1996 Act in Committee, my
noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor
at the time, indicated that the Act would “supersede” and
“replace and modernise” the existing law. There was
debate at the time as to quite what the test for innocent dissemination
was and whether Section 1 properly captured it. The Government of the
day took the view that it did but the debate continues.</hs_para>

Section 1, a secondary publisher is at risk of liability once it is put
on notice that a statement is defamatory. It is argued that, at common
law, the secondary publisher retains the innocent dissemination defence
provided it honestly and reasonably believes that a defence is
available in respect of that publication. <I>Carter-Ruck on
</I><I>L</I><I>ibel and </I><I>P</I><I>rivacy</I> describes the Section
1 defence as generally being more generous to secondary publishers. On
this issue, however, it suggests that while the position is not without
doubt, the better view is that the Section 1 defence is more easily
lost than innocent dissemination at common law. <I>Gatley on Libel and
Slander</I> takes the view that it is “possible” that the
statutory defence is narrower than the common law in this
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020580000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000085">The
Government’s view is that it is right to say that Section 1 has,
in effect, superseded the common law defence of innocent dissemination.
As I have tried to illustrate, the position at common law prior to the
1996 Act was not as clear as certain lobby groups would like to
suggest. We could have explored the option of extending the Section 1
defence but, as with 
<?notus-xml column=246?>Clause 5, the Government have taken the view that
the better approach is to remove the secondary publisher from the
process.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020580000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000086">We
believe that the approach that we have adopted in Clause 10 will
provide effective additional protection for secondary publishers such
as booksellers. It is consistent with the approach that we have taken
elsewhere in the Bill in that the focus is on directing the claimant
towards those who are actually responsible for the defamatory material.
In the unlikely event that it is not reasonably practicable to sue the
author, editor or publisher, Clause 10 allows a claimant to bring an
action against a secondary publisher such as a bookseller. However,
nothing in the clause would then prevent that bookseller from deploying
any defences that may be available to him. We believe that this is a
proportionate approach that is fair to all those

said will give booksellers the protection to resist that and that they

for engaging with the spirit of the amendment, to the noble Lord, Lord
Phillips, for engaging with its detail, and to my noble friend Lord
Prescott for seeking the opportunity that it provided for him to
exercise another issue. I hope he is satisfied that he has raised an
important and serious issue. It is to be hoped that the broader
consultation and debate on privilege that the Government are
undertaking will deal with that among other things. We certainly should
not have a situation where, by our own actions, we defeat the law that

with respect that the Minister has engaged more with the detail of the
argument than he has done before. I think that he appreciates that. He
and I have been partial in our quotation of the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Mackay of Clashfern, from when, as Lord Chancellor, he introduced
the 1996 Defamation Bill to this House. There are other quotations from
the noble and learned Lord that I could play into the debate, which
might get us back to the situation that we were in not so long ago in
our deliberations on Report—quotations from the same judge that
could be used to support two different sides of the argument. However,
I have no intention of trying to replicate that interesting Alice in

probably been more courageous on this occasion. As regards the
Booksellers Association, I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips,
said—that this provision applies to other secondary publishers,
although I might say in passing that I am not sure that his
interpretation of Amendment 17 is correct. However, we will perhaps
return to that. I hope that booksellers will be satisfied. I have
enormous sympathy for this group of people, who are at the mercy of a
collision 
<?notus-xml column=247?>between two others. They are—if I may say so
with respect to website operators—less culpable or less engaged
in that process than perhaps website operators could be. There are some
website operators whose very business plan encourages them to go to the
margins and sometimes beyond the limits of what is allowed without
remarks being deemed defamatory. Booksellers are not in that situation.
They are one of many groups of people whom we are trying to improve and
clarify the law to support.</hs_para>

shall go back to those whom I have been engaged with to see whether

innocent dissemination. I think that they will be comforted by
the fact that the Minister has made it clear that it was his aim with
this—I might say, although it does not sound like it—very
welcome provision to codify that defence among other things. They are
generally very pleased with the provision but would like it

should be in no better a position than anybody else who has a judgment

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> I start by thanking my noble friend
for tabling the amendment, and the noble Lord, Lord Browne, for his
timely intervention. Amendment 21 would provide that a court may order
a defendant to publish a summary of the court’s judgment only
where it has given a final judgment for the claimant in an action for
such a defamation. The aim of this amendment appears to be to prevent
the court ordering the publication of a summary of its judgment while
there remains the possibility of the defendant appealing the ruling. As
the noble Lord, Lord Browne, has already said, I can assure my noble
friend that this amendment is not necessary. As is the case in any
other civil proceedings, a party seeking to appeal a decision may apply
under Part 52.7 of the Civil Procedure Rules to have an order or
decision of the lower court stayed. In considering whether to grant a
stay, the court will be required to consider all the circumstances of
the case, including whether it would create an injustice to enforce the
terms of the judgment while an appeal is outstanding. We therefore see
no basis for treating an order under Clause 12 any differently. I hope
that with that reassurance and the comments made by the noble Lord,
Lord Browne, my noble friend will see fit to withdraw his

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 13 currently enables
the court to order the operator of a website to remove defamatory
material in circumstances where a claimant successfully brings
proceedings against the poster of defamatory material online. In
Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Browne, raised the question
specifically of whether this provision could be extended to cover
situations where a claimant successfully brings an action against the
publisher of offline material, but a secondary publisher
refuses to stop distributing, selling or exhibiting material containing
the defamatory statement. Clause 10 would prevent an action for
defamation being brought against the secondary publisher if it was
reasonably practicable to sue the primary publisher. While in the great
majority of cases it is likely that secondary publishers would act
responsibly and remove material when requested to do so, we consider it
desirable to close any possible loophole. Amendment 22 is intended to
capture any situation where the material in question is publicly
disseminated by a secondary publisher. I beg to move the

roots of this debate go back some time. The Minister will be very
familiar with his contribution to the debate on Legal Aid, Sentencing
and Punishment of Offenders Bill on 27 March 2012, when he gave an
assurance to the House on the issue of the disapplication of LASPO, as
it has become known, and that in relation to defamation claims it would
be dealt with in the context of the Defamation Bill. Repeatedly, our
party has sought to persuade the Government that the appropriate way in
which to live up the assurance given by the Minister was simply to
disapply the provisions of LASPO to defamation claims in the Defamation
Bill. However, there have been a number of developments. Since we last
tried unsuccessfully in the Grand Committee to persuade the Minister to
do that, there has been a commencement provision of the Legal Aid,
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, which has a saving
provision in it in relation to publication and privacy proceedings,
defined in the commencement order as including defamation. So far, so
good. However, there is still the possibility that a further
commencement order may be made at some time in the future to commence
the provisions of Sections 44 and 46 of the said Act in relation to
publication and privacy
proceedings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T22:36:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020580000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000107">The
amendment provides the Minister with the opportunity to finish
speculation about that possibility for ever by, in this provision,
disapplying the provisions of that Act to defamation proceedings. If he
cannot do that, second best would be to have an assurance that there
will be no commencement order in relation to publication and privacy
proceedings and defamation at some time in future. What would reinforce
the argument for that are the recommendations of the Leveson report,
which specifically deal with that issue. However, since we last met in
Grand Committee and since the commencement order was passed, we have
had another development—the passing in this House some five or
six hours ago of Amendment 1 to this Bill, which not only deals with
the issue of costs for defamation but deals with early dispute
resolution, introducing arbitration proceedings. That has changed the
environment in which this amendment was proposed. It is almost certain
now that, whatever else happens, the issue of costs in defamation
actions will have to be returned to again in the context of this Bill,
either to modify the amended Bill as it presently stands or to do
something else. I am not suggesting anything at the moment, having
successfully stayed out of that debate thus far and hoped to keep
myself in that position. I am minded at this stage to treat this to
some degree as a marker, recognising that this issue will have to be

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I think that it was at an early stage
of this Bill that I made it very clear that I was concerned with the
matter of costs. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, raised
that in the debate on Clause 1 today. Everybody has recognised that
this has been one of the key issues that have brought our libel laws
into disrepute, and editors and journalists as well as ordinary
citizens have long warned about the chilling effect of the current
libel
regime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-05T22:39:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I do not object at all to the prodding from the noble Lord, Lord
Browne, I hope he knows that in this respect he is pushing at an open
door. He knows that the way that we have chosen to go was to
ask the Civil Justice Council to look at how the Government can
introduce a costs protection regime in defamation and privacy cases.
The Master of the Rolls will report back to us with its suggestions by
the end of March.</hs_para>

Government have agreed that the provisions of the LASPO Act will not
apply until a costs protection regime has been implemented. As
the noble Lord indicated, the commencement order for this, which was
laid on 18 January, includes a definition of “publication
proceedings” and the cases to which the exemption will apply
when Part 2 of the Act comes into force on 1 April. I should add that
the Government’s definition goes wider than that proposed by
Amendment
23.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020580000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000111">Under our
proposals, defamation and privacy cases will not feature as a permanent
exemption from the LASPO Act, as this amendment seeks to apply.
Instead, we will ensure that costs protection is in place so that
anyone who needs to have security against adverse costs receives it.
This will happen later in the year. This costs protection regime will
apply to defendants as well as to claimants because defamation and
privacy cases can affect academics, NGOs and ordinary people just as
much as they can the super-rich and big businesses. The case for costs
protection is even greater in these circumstances because an individual
of modest means needs the assurance that if they have a good case that
they need to pursue or defend, they will be able to do so without the
risk of facing unaffordable
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020580000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-0003.htm#13020580000112">The CJC
will advise on the details by Easter. When the Government have properly

the undertaking in relation to costs protection is part of the answer

just costs protection. It is my ambition that the Government will be
prepared to consider the disapplication of the provisions of the LASPO
Act in all respects to the other parts of the challenges of defamation
costs. Those costs are at the root of the problem of access to
justice, which concerns the ability of people who do not otherwise have
the resource to find solicitors who are prepared to take these sorts of
actions on conditional fee arrangements and other arrangements. That
should be reflected in the whole structure of

I said that I had asked Dr Geoffrey Harris to conduct an independent
review into the technical irregularities that had occurred within four
strategic health authorities (SHAs) (North East, Yorkshire and the
Humber, West Midlands and East Midlands) with regard to the functions
of approving registered medical practitioners and approved clinicians
under the Mental Health Act 1983. In addition, I asked Dr
Harris to consider this matter in the context of the new NHS structures

any lessons need to be learnt.</hs_para>

summary, Dr Harris found that the SHAs involved did not overtly or
wittingly delegate the functions concerned. However, he identified two
key principles as to how the technically irregular delegation happened.
First, the SHAs concerned should have been aware that, where a function
has been conferred by statute on a public authority, the public
authority may not further delegate the performance of the function to
another body unless expressly permitted to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020536000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-wms0001.htm#13020536000035">Secondly,
the SHAs considered that, because they remained accountable for the
functions, the delegation of the operation of the approval arrangements
to mental health trusts through contracts was not something that risked
legal irregularity. The report sets out the factors that led to this
situation in more
detail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020536000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-wms0001.htm#13020536000036">In the
second part of his review report, Dr Harris recommends that every
organisation in the post-April 2013 NHS, including the Department of
Health, should 
<?notus-xml column=9?>undertake a process of due diligence. To guide this process he sets out
four key principles:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>that there
is a clear and secure location of responsibilities across the system
and that all organisations taking on transferred
functions, and receiving new ones, should have a full understanding of
them;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>that each organisation is assured that
it has the authority to exercise its powers and duties. All the bodies
must be cognisant of the duties and powers conferred upon them by
Parliament, or delegated to them by the Secretary of State, and
recognise that this provides the essential authorisation for all
decision-making and
action;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>that each
organisation ensures it has the appropriate capability and capacity to
carry out its functions; and</hs_WAIndent> <hs_WAIndent>that there
should be a process of continuing audit, i.e. once the functions of the
organisations are settled, understood and resourced, that there is
periodic audit of their
discharge.</hs_WAIndent><hs_para UID="13020536000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130205-wms0001.htm#13020536000037">Finally,
Dr Harris recommends that all bodies should include material in their
governance statements for 2012-13 and for all subsequent years, which
confirms that any arrangements in place for the discharge of their
current statutory functions have been checked for any irregularities,
and that they are legally

the basis of a new, standalone judicial pension scheme for which the

approach will allow the judges to participate in the governance of

judges will move into the new scheme for service from 1
April 2015. Those appointed before 1 April 2012, and who
were aged between 51½ and 55 at that date, will have the option
to defer joining the new scheme until an age-related later date; this
“tapering protection” is intended to avoid a
cliff-edge in treatment for those who fall just outside the group with
full protection. Previous service in any of the current judicial
schemes will be fully protected, continuing to be pensioned

Particular concerns have been expressed about the impact on some judges

most affected the option of a transitional protection allowance in lieu
of pension accrual in the new scheme. Eligibility to apply for this
allowance will be strictly limited to those serving judges who have had
continuous membership of a judicial pension scheme, who have registered
their pre-judicial pensions for enhanced protection under the Finance
Act 2004 or fixed protection under the Finance Act 2011 and who have

published on Defra’s website, the largest three categories of
kerbside residual waste were food, plastics and paper. Together these
accounted for 58% of kerbside residual waste. An updated assessment for
2010-11 will be published shortly. The Government have developed a
