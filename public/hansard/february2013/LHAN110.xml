the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the European

regulation for the safe integration of civil remotely piloted aircraft
systems into both European and global air

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that encouraging
reply. Does he not agree that, as far as the domestic situation is
concerned, whatever the value of drones for emergency services and the
like, their increasing availability makes the need for some sort of
code an urgent
priority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:07:46"></hs_TimeCode>? When
it comes to the international scene, how do the Government define the
difference between extra-judicial killing and legitimate killing? How
can transparent accountability for every civilian, not least innocent
children, be ensured? How can the use of drones in areas not defined by
the UN as conflict zones be justified? Is there not a desperate need
for something like the Geneva

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> The noble Lord has asked several
complex questions and I will try to answer some of them. The
development of civil systems is clearly a complicated area. Basically,
for large unmanned systems, the same rules apply as for manned
aircraft. For small unmanned systems—there are now some very
small unmanned systems—provided they are within the sight of the
person controlling them, regulations need not apply. Clearly, a lot
more work is needed in that
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:08:57"></hs_TimeCode>. On the
international dimension, the question of extra-judicial killings is
something which, as those who have read this morning’s

United States as we

Falkner of Margravine:</Member></B> My Lords, on 20 November
2012, the Senior Minister of State at the Foreign Office, the noble
Baroness, Lady Warsi, assured me that the UN special rapporteur for
human rights 
<?notus-xml column=350?>and countering terrorism was preparing a report to the UN on the issue
of drones. That was in response to a question I had asked her along the
lines of the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Judd,
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:09:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Can the

specific question and will have to write to the noble Baroness. We are,
of course, in conversations with others about the use of drones. On the
specific issues being discussed in the United States at the present

military purposes only in
Afghanistan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:10:01"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Singh of Wimbledon" PimsId="5990" UID="13020761000694" xid="2159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000694">Lord
Singh of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree that
the control of the military use of drones is absolutely necessary
internationally? The carrying out of extra-judicial killings in the
sovereign airspace of other nations is a very dangerous precedent.

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the question is very much
about the use across national boundaries in areas where there is not an
active conflict. I simply stress again that the United Kingdom has used
military drones only inside Afghanistan and that we are in Afghanistan
at the invitation of the Afghan Government. There is an active debate
in the United States about the American use of drones across national
frontiers in areas where it is a question of terrorist threats to the
United States rather than local
conflict<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:11:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead" PimsId="5440" UID="13020761000696" xid="2008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000696">Baroness
Kinnock of Holyhead:</Member></B> Since we know that 51 states now have
the technology to use drones, does the Minister agree that it is
essential that a proper legal framework is urgently put in place and
that action is taken to ensure that there is accountability and
reparation when things go wrong as a result of a drone attack? Does the
UK support the stated view of the UN special rapporteur, who is to
conduct an investigation into the spread of drone technology, that we
urgently need to know the extent of civilian casualties, the identity
of militants targeted and the legality of strikes where the UN does not
recognise that there actually is a
conflict<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:12:04"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13020761000697" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000697">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, unmanned aerial vehicles
are spreading around the world. My figures say that some 80 countries
now have some capacity, or have been involved in purchasing such
capacity, so this is spreading very quickly. Clearly, we do need to
develop international law and practice on this. We also have large
issues about what happens in ungoverned space, such as aspects of the
Sahel and, until very recently, some parts of Somalia. I stress that
the largest single use of unmanned aerial vehicles for military
purposes is in surveillance and reconnaissance and not in direct
strikes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:12:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells" PimsId="3906" UID="13020761000698" xid="1999" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000698">The
Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the
Minister’s remarks about the progress in the United States.
However, does not a world characterised by the proliferation of armed
drones, without an 
<?notus-xml column=351?>internationally supported framework of regulation, undermine our core
interests such as preventing armed conflict, promoting human rights and
strengthening international legal regimes? Could the present role of
the United Kingdom be one which enables and begins the process of

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, there are some benefits
from unmanned drones, particularly in terms of
reconnaissance—maritime reconnaissance off Somalia and so
on—because these aircraft have much longer endurance than manned
aircraft. I would add that the question of whether distantly controlled
aircraft encourage people to be less careful in their use of military
weapons is one which I have spent some time studying. I am rather
reassured that, because of the ability of unmanned aircraft to loiter
over the site, not only is target acquisition more carefully attended
to than if you are in a fast aircraft but you are asked to look at what
happened afterwards. I am told that this means that those who are
controlling these aircraft have a thorough sense of responsibility for
what has been
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:14:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord West of Spithead" PimsId="5250" UID="13020761000700" xid="1966" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000700">Lord

Minister’s previous answer, whenever one makes war less
horrible—war is horrible, death is horrible and being involved
in the risk is horrible—and kills people remotely from some

remote, which has huge implications and is very worrying. It needs a

that he has just outlined in areas such as Tower Hamlets represent a
60% cut on the money available to improve social housing in the
spending 
<?notus-xml column=352?>review. However, is he also aware that backloading the social housing
budget means that those in the worst housing conditions have to wait
the longest for upgrades? Can he clarify whether the Secretary of State
will ask the Chancellor to increase the amount of money in the next
spending review to make up for that previous shortfall and, if so, will
they abandon the backloading of the budget that hurts hardest those in
the worst housing? Combined with the bedroom tax, this makes people in

My right honourable friend the Prime Minister made that clear, and it
needs to be reiterated. On the point about decent homes and Tower
Hamlets specifically, I will share the figures with the House. The
decent home benefits grant in 2011-12 was £12.5 million; in

whether he is aware of the fact that there is quite a supply of housing
in London, and that it is simply unusable because people have bought
their flats in social high rise housing and now wish to move for
various reasons, but no one will give a mortgage on those properties.
They are completely locked into them because they are high rise and
have a stigma attached to them because they were social housing. Doing
something about that would release housing that people could obtain

a disproportionate amount of non-decent homes, primarily due to the
high numbers of homes of non-standard construction that she has

greater housing requirements in London. That said, we are providing a

I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Flight. This is not just a question

percentage of adults who invest their hard-earned money in all sorts of

by the people controlling the fund. The evidence is clear that a very

are determined to make the UK a leading destination for investment in
new nuclear, which will play a key role in our future energy mix. The
decision by Centrica reflects the company’s investment
priorities and is not a reflection on UK government policy. New nuclear
in the UK is a highly attractive proposition, as the recent purchase of
Horizon Nuclear Power by Hitachi clearly shows. With the reforms that
we are introducing in the Energy Bill, we are confident that we will
see investment move forward. In the last quarter alone, alongside the

unamended from its introduction in the Commons on 23 October 2012. It
will enable the introduction of a new levy for all heavy goods vehicles
that weigh more than 12 tonnes and that are being kept on or are using
the UK road network. This new levy is aimed at recognising the cost of
the damage that HGVs do to our roads and ensuring that they make a
contribution towards
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000067">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:39:12"></hs_TimeCode>

2014, when it will apply to both UK and foreign-registered hauliers.
The levy, which is being introduced alongside other measures including
reductions in HGV vehicle excise duty, is set at a level that will mean
that, overall, more than nine out of 10 vehicles in the UK fleet will
pay no more than now, with almost all the rest facing a fairly small
increase in charges of up to £79 per year. Introducing the levy
for foreign vehicles and offsetting the charge for the vast majority of
UK vehicles will help the competitiveness of UK businesses, while

additional administrative burden is placed on UK business by the
introduction of the charge, UK hauliers will start to pay the levy in a
single transaction with vehicle excise duty when it is renewed from
April 2014, and will therefore be able to pay the charge either
six-monthly or annually. For the annual rate, we have selected a fee of
up to £1,000 for the heaviest vehicles as being a level where,

£1,000; for the smallest vehicles it will be proportionately
less, at £85 for the year. However, most foreign vehicles that
come into the UK are those in the heaviest two bands. For the largest,
heaviest foreign vehicles, we consider the charge of £10 per day
or £1,000 per year to be fair, proportionate and compliant with
the relevant EU legislation. For the daily amount we are seeking to
charge at the highest level permissible while remaining compliant with

accept that for about 40 UK vehicles, the overall charge for hauliers
will be much greater; it has proved to be impossible fully to offset
the charges in those cases. However, I should make it clear that the
increase is largely due to current VED rates being close to or below EU
minimum levels, which restricts our ability to rebate fully to offset
the charge, rather than the implementation of the charge
itself.</hs_para>

like it to be much higher, the charges have been set at the highest
possible allowed by the Eurovignette directive, while allowing other

helpful introduction. It has filled a few holes in my knowledge of the

this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000081">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:49:25"></hs_TimeCode>
first question is: why is this a money Bill? It seems to introduce
changes to policy and to methods of collecting charges for road
vehicles which probably merit greater scrutiny in your
Lordships’ House. Of course, we cannot do that for a money Bill,
so perhaps the Minister can explain exactly
why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:46:29"></hs_TimeCode> it is a
money Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000082">In
that context, the Minister will know—because I mentioned it in a
speech on Monday in Committee on the Growth and Infrastructure
Bill—that I think that it would be much better if the Government
came up with a consistent policy for tolling, charging, or whatever we
like to call it, for vehicles using the Dartford tunnel, the new
tunnels, congestion charging in London and other cities, and possibly
eventually on the M6 toll road as well, for a start. All of those are
effectively distance-based, unlike this one which is basically
time-based<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:47:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I
expect that this is meant to avoid any policy intention to widen it to
other vehicles; and of course, on that basis, it has to comply with the
Eurovignette directive. I believe that the Commission has started to
look at a wider charging solution for roads across the EU which is
probably designed, as much as anything, to try to reduce the congestion
on the most congested
parts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:47:50"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
I would be very pleased to hear the Minister’s explanation for
why this is a money
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:47:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that this was intended to increase the fairness between UK-registered
and continental-registered vehicles, because when continental vehicles
come here they do not pay the equivalent of a toll or VED, but when our
vehicles go to the continent they have to pay tolls on some
roads—most of which I think are
distance-based<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:48:31"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, can he explain whether the locally registered trucks in any of
the closer member states—on the roads which our own vehicles
probably use the most—pay something equivalent to VED which
visiting trucks from the UK and elsewhere would not pay? It would be a
comfort to know that the balancing on which this Bill is based applies
both ways. I am sure that there is an answer to that, but I do not know
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:49:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000084">In
the case of non-UK heavy goods vehicles, Clause 4(2) places
the liability for paying this levy on the holders of Community
licences. I know that “Community licence” is defined in
Clause 4(8), but can the Minister explain to the ordinary human being
what that means? What is a Community licence? Is it one similar licence
which every truck in the entire EU has, or does each member state have
a different one? Whoever is going to enforce it will need to be
familiar with 26 or so different types of licence if we are not
careful. That will be quite difficult. I shall come back to that in a
few

that UK-registered hauliers will be able to obtain their licences under
this levy in the usual way, with the VED, on a 12-month or six-month
basis. He said that a foreign haulier coming into Dover could buy a
licence on the web or on the phone. Presumably there will be a kind of
booth at Dover, or something, where you can pay for the licence at the
time. If, as I believe, everybody will have to have a sticker with the
licence on their windscreen, there is a question about how a haulier
going backwards and forwards across Europe will manage to collect his
post with the sticker in it. Or will there be a place where he can
collect it every time he comes into the UK? Otherwise, it will be a bit

interesting briefing from the Freight Transport Association, which
raised the question of whether these stickers were necessary. That begs
the question of how the Government intend for this new levy to be
enforced. Window stickers are fine on cars, because traffic wardens go
along and look at out-of-date licence stickers, and you then get a
nasty message from the DVLA. However, traffic wardens are not going to
be much use in enforcing this on trucks, because trucks do not usually
park in the streets where traffic wardens operate, thank
goodness.</hs_para>

in Clause 10 we have a definition of who can stop a vehicle, and that
person is called a “stopping officer”. I have never heard
of a stopping officer before. Is it a police officer? Who is it? The
definition says what his powers are, but how many of these stopping
officers will we have in the country? If they are doing it
already—which would be something I do not know about—in
how many cases a year do they achieve this stopping? I am not convinced
that there will be any enforcement at all of this new licence. If it is
to be done by number-plate recognition, as the congestion charge is in
London, can the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=362?>explain how that will work with 26 different number plates from 26
different members states plus a few from outside the EU? We get Turkish
and other non-EU vehicles here as well. Is a system in place whereby
all registered number plates from around Europe and beyond can be
registered? And when they are indentified, what will happen to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:53:39"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000088">I
hope that the Minister can explain how this enforcement system will
work. My suspicions are that it will hardly be done at all. UK vehicles
will have to do it because they are paying with their VED, but who is
going to do it for the foreign ones and where are they going to do
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:53:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000089">Finally,
the Minister explained the revenue gain of £18.7 million to
£23 million, which is probably worth having. It goes into the
bottomless pit of the Treasury, but that is probably all right. Can he
tell us the cost of administering this new scheme, both for
UK-registered vehicles and foreign ones? In the debate on road-user
charging I also said I believed that the cost of administering the
road-user charging system in London—which is very good, and at
the time it was introduced there was no better technology—is
somewhere between 30% and 40% of the revenue gained. However, I think
that the cost of some of the new electronic systems on the continent is
about 5% of the revenue gained, which of course is much
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:54:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, what will be the cost of administering this scheme? Let us

Snape:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow my noble
friend Lord Berkeley on this topic. I well recall nearly 40 years ago
when I was first elected to the other place and was told that the most
effective political lobby in the United Kingdom was the farmers. I came
to realise that in that conclusion they may well have been right. After
all, I seem to remember that the farming lobby managed to blame the
spread of foot and mouth some time ago basically on Ministers in the
Labour Government rather than on their own
practices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000092">Certainly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:56:01"></hs_TimeCode>,
one lobby that runs the farming lobby very close in its effectiveness
is the road haulage lobby. Most of us in your Lordships’ House
are old enough to remember the immediate post-war period when heavy
goods vehicles—I think this referred to those above seven
tonnes, but it was a long time ago so I would not like to put my shirt
on it—had to carry a 20 miles an hour plate and were
restricted to that maximum speed. Given the number of heavy goods
vehicles that appeared on our roads after World War
2—many of the drivers were demobbed from our Armed
Forces—that issue was the first campaign that I remember the
road hauliers lobby indulging in. It was very
successful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T11:56:38"></hs_TimeCode> and
it has indulged in many campaigns since, many of which have been

the end of World War 2, we have seen heavy lorry weights increase
dramatically. I think that the maximum now is 44 tonnes, although the
Minister will correct me if I am wrong. It used to be about
12 tonnes, 
<?notus-xml column=363?>so the industry has done well there. The length of heavy goods vehicles
also has increased fairly dramatically over that period. Each and every
increase in weight and length has been accompanied by a cry from the
road haulage industry that there would be fewer vehicles on the road
because they are bigger, longer and heavier, and that once the
motorways had been built they would not be much of a nuisance

roads now compared to, say, a decade or two decades ago. Although it is
not a matter for this Bill, it would be interesting to see not only how

of the lobby’s major complaints was about the number of foreign

not I leave to noble Lords to work out for themselves—to attend
meetings of the Sandwell chamber of commerce, which covered my former
parliamentary constituency. The chamber of commerce may not have been
dominated by the issue, but certainly a strong presence from the road
haulage industry raised the same issue more and more often. It
questioned the number of foreign heavy goods vehicles on British roads,
and how they were filling up on cheap European derv and able to snatch
the bread from the mouths of British hauliers by demanding not only the
freedom to travel on our roads, which of course they had, but to take

toll roads, and I pointed out that there was a toll road in the West
Midlands that was not used much by heavy goods vehicles. I have noticed
that Eddie Stobart vehicles do use it, but by and large those are the
only heavy lorries that I have ever seen on the toll road. The heavy
goods vehicle industry generally uses the M6 motorway, which passes
through my former constituency on an elevated section. During my 27
years as the Member of Parliament for West Bromwich East, I calculated
that the taxpayer had spent something like £800 million
repairing just that one section of the M6 because of the damage done to
it largely by heavy goods vehicles. On the department’s own
figures, the heaviest heavy goods vehicles do as much damage to
Britain’s road network as 30,000 private cars. This great sum of
£19 million to £23 million, therefore, might repair one
archway of the Ray Hall viaduct in the West Midlands, but it will not

who pay through VED on an annual basis—so why give them this
particular benefit, which will be not shared by their British
counterparts? I do not know whether, again, this is a matter for
Europe, but why not insist that lorries used in the United Kingdom pay
on an annual basis? Then they could come and go as they wished. Why
allow them to pay on a one-day, two-day or weekly basis: a privilege

only three of which were foreign, six were overloaded. In two of them,
the driver had exceeded the permitted number of hours. A couple were
borderline, while one was taken off the road immediately because of its
lack of roadworthiness. Only 14 vehicles were stopped because, within

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, I will intervene very briefly and take
up the last point emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Snape, that there
should be a level playing field and the same system of charges should
apply. I do not object to the approach that the Government are
undertaking, although the amount of money to be collected is miniscule
in the context of the needs and indeed, I suspect, the damage that is
inflicted on roads and the cost of adapting roads to handle the ever
larger vehicles that seem to be coming
over.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000111">The
point that I want to put to the Minister—he may or may not be in
a position to reply—is that of course the highway system is
devolved. We in Wales have a very substantial cost arising from the two
main east-west roads, the M4 in the south and the A55 in the north,
which carry a very large volume of traffic to and from the
Irish Republic via Holyhead and the ports of Pembrokeshire.
This means that a disproportionate cost lands on the budget of the
National Assembly, and that is over and above the cost of adapting the
small roads, bridges and all the rest to be able to deal with some of
the very large vehicles coming from the continent.</hs_para>

into the Treasury as another source of funding that is not in any way
related to expenditure on roads? If it is meant in some way to meet the
additional costs arising from such transport, what mechanism is there
to allow even a small proportion of this to go through to the budget of
the National Assembly? On a 5% basis we would expect about
£1 million, which is hardly going to fill the
potholes that are caused by these vehicles. As a matter of principle,
this is something that should be taken on board. Certainly, if this is
a first step, I hope that there will be further steps to genuinely
provide a level playing

the vehicle will not be released until the necessary charge has been

office in the country from which he has come, and that office will have
to pay. I agree entirely that it is hard luck on the driver, if that is

have had sympathy with the road haulage industry and with British
motorists for a very long period—from the first time I went to
France and found that French autoroutes could charge heavily while we
provided free roads for any French motorists who deigned to come to

haulage is much more serious. After all, the industry shifts 68% of our

middle and outside lanes have reasonably good surfaces while there are
almost two trenches on the inside lane where the heavy goods vehicles
progress. Of course, the majority of those are British trucks, but it
shows the cost to the roads system that heavy goods vehicles
incur—in particular because Europe has been very much to the

difference between the road structure in Amsterdam and the road

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, as I stated in my opening speech, this
legislation will help to deliver a fairer deal for UK hauliers and go
some way to correcting an inequality which has existed for too long.
For this reason, I believe the Bill should be welcomed. Turning to the
aims of the Bill, we consider our plan to charge £10 per day, or
£1,000 per year, for the largest vehicles, to be fair,
proportionate and compliant with the relevant EU legislation. One of
the challenges in dealing with this problem is that anything we do must
be compliant with EU legislation. We must treat UK and foreign hauliers

made by the noble Lord later on. To answer his point about leaving the
strategic road network and going on to minor roads: an operator would
have difficulties with that because the vehicle would be much less
productive, while he would be trying to avoid only a £10 per day

using local roads would simply not be worth
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:30:24"></hs_TimeCode>. For cases

the real deterrent for operators is the inconvenience of being stopped,
as well as another inconvenience that I will come to in a moment. VOSA
already carries out risk-based stops for a number of different
offences, including weight, vehicle defects, and driver hours, among
others, and the levy enforcement will simply be added to this regime. I
also suggest that when VOSA detects a vehicle that has not paid the
levy, that is exactly the same as if the driver had put a big sign on
the lorry which says “Stop me, because I’m a problem
vehicle”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000139">I
am aware that the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association has
identified an area for a small potential cost burden to operators,
which has been introduced due to the way that the levy is rebated, when
compared to how VED is currently and will continue to be rebated. It
may be helpful for me to say a few words on this. Currently when a
vehicle is delicensed—typically, when it is sold—the
previous owner can claim back the outstanding whole months of VED, with
the rebate calculation done in twelfths. From the introduction of the
levy in April 2014, UK operators will still be able to reclaim VED on
the same basis, but the levy can be reclaimed only in tenths. To comply
with EU law, and to maximise revenue from monthly charges, the annual
rate is set at 10 times the monthly rate. This means that in effect it
is discounted when compared with the costs of 12 monthly levy
charges.</hs_para>

circulation tax. VED or equivalent is required in the Eurovignette

noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, raised a very important point about whether
we should implement a levy on a distance or a time basis. I will say a
few words about this important point. The HGV levy is a time-based 
<?notus-xml column=372?>charge which is both simple and inexpensive to operate. It allows more
than nine out of 10 UK operators to be fully compensated through VED
reductions. A distance-based scheme has been considered and has some
benefits, in that hauliers who use the road network the most would pay
the most. That seems, at face value, to be inherently fair. However, in
reality it would cost hauliers more and it would not be possible to
introduce offsetting measures for UK hauliers, which would mean that
they would pay more than they do now. In many cases foreign hauliers
would pay less than they would under a time-based
scheme.</hs_para>

introduction of a distance-based scheme has also been discounted as it
would be very complex and costly to operate, and would potentially
involve the use of a mechanism such as a fuel duty rebate, which is
illegal under European law. This has already been tested in Germany. We
also believe that the revenues gained from foreign hauliers would not
cover the costs of operating this scheme. The Department for Transport
looked at options for distance-based charging in 2010 and concluded
that in order to fund it the scheme would have to be structured to be
revenue-raising, and would therefore have a negative impact on UK
hauliers, who would pay most of the charges.</hs_para>

difficulty is how to capture the distance-based data. That could be
done with a tachograph, but the problem is that the tachograph and the
records would have to be inspected by enforcement officers. In
addition, the tachograph is in essence a safety device to ensure that
drivers do not drive for too long. If we insert an economic effect into
it, we would increase the chances that the drivers or the operator

that no one pays in the UK, and because of the Eurovignette directive,

limited to the prevailing limits of what you can charge. It could not,

Jay of Paddington:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to
open this debate on behalf of your Lordships’ Constitution
Committee. I am glad that we are able to debate our report reasonably
soon after its publication as this is undoubtedly a fast-moving area.
Since our report was published last autumn, the fallout from the
cancellation of the west coast main line contract has continued. The
Government have begun implementing some of the proposals of <I>The
Civil Service Reform Plan</I> which was published in June last year,
and other proposals remain the subject of considerable
debate—often played out through briefings to the newspapers,
which have usually given a rather negative view of the Civil
Service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:44:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

our inquiry over several months last year and I am very grateful to the
large number of distinguished witnesses, some of whom I am pleased to
say are speaking this afternoon, who gave us written and oral evidence.
As always, the Committee was extremely well served by our official
staff and by our legal advisers, Professor Richard Rawlings and
Professor Adam Tomkins, who acted as special advisers for this inquiry.
I thank them and other members of the committee for their hard work on
this report.</hs_para>

I said, the report was published in the autumn, in mid November, and I
am very disappointed that only yesterday evening I received the
Government’s formal response. Your Lordships will know that it
is established practice that the Government respond to reports of this
kind within two months of publication. In this case, that would have
been by 20 January. I regard it as discourteous both to the committee
and to the House that we have heard so very late from the Cabinet
Office. This must mean that the committee has obviously been unable to
consider the Government’s response and it is therefore
impossible for me to respond to the Government’s reply,
particularly on some of the points on which the committee and the
Government seem to disagree. I look forward to the Minister giving us
an extensive explanation of the Government’s position when he
replies to the
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000158">Coming
to the substance of our report I should first make clear that this was
not a general inquiry into the present state of the Civil Service. Our
focus was specifically on accountability. We wanted to examine how well
civil servants who play very significant permanent roles in our system
of government are held to account. The increase in the size, functions
and complexity of the state makes it important, of course, that all
those who carry out responsible work on behalf of the public are
properly accountable. One of the developing ways in which civil
servants are held directly to account is through parliamentary Select
Committees in both Houses, perhaps most prominently by the House of
Commons Public Accounts Committee which, as the House will be aware,
has been recently involved in controversial dealings with senior
officials.</hs_para><hs_para Justify="left" UID="13020761000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000159">The
Constitution Committee started from the simple but indispensable point
of principle: Ministers are responsible to Parliament for all of their
department’s business. This means that, in addition to being
responsible for the policies they devise, Ministers are also
responsible for the actions and inactions of their civil servants, 
<?notus-xml column=375?>and for the administration of their departments. Accountability must
extend to cover those arm’s-length bodies which report to a
department and the committee is also clear that Ministers are
personally responsible for their political special advisers, including
ensuring that those advisers follow their own code of conduct. In our
report, the committee concludes that this overall responsibility must
be essential if Parliament is to be able properly to hold the
Government to account. Your Lordships may remember that the
Constitution Committee affirmed this principle very strongly during the
passage of Health and Social Care Act during the previous Session. We
insisted that the Secretary of State for Health must remain fully
responsible for the health service, regardless of the changes that were
proposed in the Bill. Section 1 of the Bill was amended in your
Lordships’ House so that that the principle is now in
statute<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:49:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:47:52"></hs_TimeCode>corollary of
ministerial responsibility to Parliament is that civil servants must be
fully accountable to Ministers. It is in this area that there has been
much recent debate. Relations between the Civil Service and Ministers
are said to be at an all-time low. The Prime Minister has referred to
“bureaucrats in government departments” as the
“enemies of enterprise”. The Minister for the Cabinet
Office, Francis Maude MP, has said that civil servants need to focus
more on Ministers’ priorities. Blame for errors in handling the
west coast main line bidding process was pinned firmly on civil
servants in the Department for Transport, resulting in three of them
being suspended. Recently, one former Minister, Mr Nick Herbert, said
that he had been better supported in opposition than by the Civil
Service in
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:48:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:49:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:49:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para Justify="left" UID="13020761000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000161">It
is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that <I>The </I><I>Civil
Service</I><I> </I><I>Reform Plan</I> contains proposals to alter the
relationship between civil servants and Ministers. One of its aims is
to improve civil servants’ accountability. Perhaps the most high
profile of these proposals is to give Ministers a greater role in the
appointment of their departmental permanent secretaries. As noble Lords
will be aware, particularly those who have themselves been Ministers,
Ministers are already closely involved in the process as they agree the
job description and the composition of the selection panel; they can
meet the shortlisted candidates and then provide their views on the
candidates and the selection panel. The Prime Minister retains a power
of veto over the candidate proposed by the Civil Service
Commission—a veto that he apparently and reportedly exercised
late last year in respect of the nominated candidate for Permanent
Secretary of the Department of Energy and Climate Change. However, what
Ministers do not do—and have not done up to now—is decide
from a list of names put forward by a selection panel who should hold
the top job.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020761000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000162">T<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:49:50"></hs_TimeCode>he
Civil Service reform plan indicated the Government’s broad
intention to strengthen Ministers’ roles in the recruitment
process for Permanent Secretaries. It did not specify how, but said
that the Government would consult with the Civil Service Commission.
However, since then, both the Prime Minister and the Minister for the
Cabinet Office, Mr Maude, have made it clear that they prefer Ministers
to be given the 
<?notus-xml column=376?>power to select from a shortlist of names when recruiting a new
Permanent Secretary. Mr Maude has indeed indicated that he has not
ruled out legislating to achieve this. The Government argue that such a
change is important for ensuring that the Civil Service is working to
the Government’s priorities. If Ministers are fully accountable
for all the actions and omissions of their civil servants, the argument
goes, Ministers should be given the choice over the principal civil
servants who carry out their decisions. Interestingly, in evidence to
us, the Government’s proposal was also supported by, among
others, the right honourable David Blunkett MP, a senior Cabinet
Minister in the previous Labour
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000163">On
the other hand, others who gave evidence to us, including the Civil
Service Commission, objected to giving Ministers the final say over the
choice of Permanent Secretaries. They argue that it will lead to
Permanent Secretaries being seen as the creatures of Ministers and will
undermine Civil Service impartiality and the principle of appointment
on merit. The temptations of cronyism and favouritism might, it was
thought, prove too great for some Ministers. Others questioned what
will happen in departments where Ministers are moved frequently. Will
each change of Secretary of State result in a new Permanent Secretary?
If so, the word “permanent” in the job title rings
somewhat
hollow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000164">The
committee heard evidence suggesting that the position may not be as
stark and as black and white as is sometimes suggested. We heard, for
example, from the former Labour Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, that
when a relationship between a Secretary of State and a Permanent
Secretary breaks down the official may just be quietly moved on.
Another Conservative ex-Cabinet member, the noble Lord, Lord Fowler,
said that Ministers are often already given a strong informal say in
the appointment process, including expressing a
preference.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000165">One
thing we should remember is that it was only three years ago that
Parliament passed the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act which
enshrines in law the attributes of the Civil Service—integrity,
honesty, objectivity and impartiality. The principle of appointment on
merit clearly flows from these attributes. However, the Constitution
Committee concluded that however the Government wish to modify the
existing process for appointing Permanent Secretaries, they must
continue to conform fully with those constitutional principles. We
thought it would be odd if, having waited 160 years for the
Northcote-Trevelyan principles and proposals to be put into statute,
they were discarded so
quickly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000166">We
concluded that the same principles ought to apply to the
Government’s proposal for so-called direct appointments. The
Civil Service reform plan proposes that where a department lacks a
particular expertise, a Minister should be able to make direct
appointments into specific, fixed-term posts. On this occasion we heard
concerns that such appointments might be used to create a new class of
special advisers. We concluded that Ministers should be limited to
requesting the category of expertise that they require. Permanent
Secretaries should continue to make the individual appointments subject
to the approval of the Civil Service Commission.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=377?><hs_para UID="13020761000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000167">One member of the
Constitution Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Powell of Bayswater, who
of course has had a long and distinguished career in Whitehall, has
expressed this succinctly. Unfortunately, is unable to speak today. He
has said that bringing in expertise from outside for specific jobs or
to carry through new initiatives is eminently
desirable—Ministers are fully entitled to ask for that. He
believes, however, that they should ask for expertise—for
example, “Go out and get me a really good tax
specialist”—and that they should not ask for individuals
whom they just happen to know. Least of all, he believes, we do not
need a new breed of callow special advisers—seasoned experts are
required for these sorts of
jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000168">None the
less, in the area of long-term project management, the Constitution
Committee was concerned about the Civil Service’s record of
delivery. The list of big government projects which have overrun and
cost vastly more than was budgeted is depressing. It is not easy to
identify solutions to these difficulties; one common problem seems to
be the high turnover of officials working on such projects. High staff
turnover is a widespread criticism of the modern Civil Service. We
recommend that there should be a presumption that a single, senior
civil servant will lead major projects from start to finish. This
should improve the ability to hold the Executive, and specifically one
official in the Executive, a civil servant, to account for such
projects.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020761000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000169">The
Constitution Committee also examined not merely the accountability of
civil servants to Ministers but also the direct accountability of civil
servants to Parliament. As the House knows, it is now commonplace for
civil servants to appear before Select Committees, sometimes alongside
Ministers and sometimes on their own. Such direct accountability is
undoubtedly welcome. Select Committees benefit considerably from being
able to hear civil servants in this way. Constitutionally and
importantly, however, the appearance of civil servants before Select
Committees is a supplement to Ministers’ responsibility to
Parliament, not a replacement for it. Only Ministers can participate
fully in the proceedings of Parliament—answering parliamentary
Questions and responding to debates. For this reason Parliament cannot
hold a civil servant properly to account in the place of a
Minister.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000170">The
Cabinet Office has developed guidance for civil servants who give
evidence to Select Committees. The guidance is widely known as the
Osmotherly rules—called after Sir Edward Osmotherly the
marvellously Trollopeanly named official who originally devised them.
The rules offer guidance on what civil servants should and should not
say to committees and when it is appropriate for a Minister to appear
rather than officials. The committee’s view is that the
Osmotherly rules are simply Civil Service guidance and nothing more.
They should not be given any greater political or constitutional
weight. The Osmotherly rules have not been endorsed by Parliament and
do not bind Select Committees in any
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000171">We
recommend that any future revisions of the rules should be published in
draft to enable Parliament and its Select Committees to scrutinise
proposed changes. In his evidence to us the Minister, Mr Maude,
indicated that he would support such parliamentary scrutiny— 
<?notus-xml column=378?>perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, can comment on this proposal in
his
reply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000172">Although
civil servants frequently give evidence to committees, as I have said,
they do so on behalf of their Ministers. For this reason, committees
usually accept whichever official or officials a department recommends
are best placed to give evidence on any given topic. Sometimes,
however, committees will want to question a named civil
servant—for example, the official in charge of a particular
project or policy. The Osmotherly rules include a
“presumption” that Ministers will meet such a request. We
think this should be strengthened so that a call for a specific
individual should only be refused in exceptional
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000173">Accountability
would also be strengthened if committees were able to question someone
who had left the Civil Service or moved to another post. This practice
should apply not just to former accounting officers—as suggested
in the Government’s Civil Service reform plan—but to
other former senior civil servants. Sometimes it is only by taking
evidence from former office holders that a committee can get to the
bottom of an issue and we do not think the Osmotherly rules should
stand in the way of this
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000174">As
your Lordships are aware, successive Governments have maintained the
principle that advice given by civil servants to Ministers should not
be disclosed to Select Committees or to anyone else. This of course
maintains the principle of ministerial responsibility—civil
servants giving full and candid advice but Ministers taking the
decisions. The committee did not seek to undo this principle, but
thought that the practice set out in the Osmotherly rules needed
revision. For example, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 it is
possible to access Civil Service advice if certain conditions are met.
The Osmotherly rules suggest that in no circumstances would such advice
be disclosed to a committee. Therefore, if the rules are followed
strictly, Select Committees may paradoxically have weaker rights of
access than someone submitting a freedom of information request. This
seemed to us obviously unsatisfactory and so we recommend that on rare
occasions when committees need sight of such advice, they should be
able to request it.</hs_para>

recommendation concerns situations where the evidence taken by a
committee points to an individual civil servant being at fault. The
Osmotherly rules suggest that in such circumstances it is for the
Minister to examine the matter and take any further action. We were
conscious that Select Committees are not disciplinary tribunals.
However, if evidence leads a committee to conclude that a particular
civil servant has been at fault, we think the committee should be able
to express personal criticism and, in extreme cases, suggest that the
department concerned considers disciplinary
procedures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000176" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000176">In
summary, the Constitution Committee’s report underlines the
pre-eminence of ministerial accountability to Parliament and civil
servants’ accountability to Ministers. We make clear that any
plans to reform the Civil Service must not undermine the accepted
principles of accountability or Civil Service impartiality. The report
also concludes that parliamentary Select Committees should have greater
access to individual 
<?notus-xml column=379?>civil servants and that the informal rules governing their appearances
before committees should be revised and scrutinised by Parliament. I
look forward to what I know will be an interesting and authoritative
debate. I beg to

However, I cannot resist commenting on the recommendation that
Ministers contribute to the appraisal of certain civil servants. When I
was chair of ACAS, I was asked to participate in a Civil Service
appraisal exercise to ensure fairness between departments. I freely
admit that I was overwhelmed by paperwork, with a lever-arch file for
everyone under consideration: a veritable mountain of information. How
this involvement in appraisals will work needs careful thought. With
the greatest respect to Ministers, some will be better able or prepared

it is all too easy for a Minister to distance himself from the rogue

their special advisers—if it is possible to encircle with two

Wilson of Dinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the report, which
charts a careful and thoughtful path through complex constitutional
issues which it would be easy to get wrong. There is much in it with
which I agree and which I welcome. For instance, I welcome the
endorsement of the principle of ministerial accountability to
Parliament. As the Government recognised in their belated response,
civil servants are accountable to Ministers and Ministers are
accountable to Parliament. That is fundamental, and it is good to see
it endorsed by the
committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:23:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000210" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000210">I
also welcome the endorsement of what I think of as the
Northcote-Trevelyan principle of recruitment on merit on the basis of
fair and open competition. Those things may seem obvious, but they are
bedrock to how we run our government, and it is important that they are
understood, because we have no written constitution to which we can
refer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:23:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000211" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000211">That
said, inevitably, there are a number of points in the report which I
would like to add to, retract or disagree with. The principle that
Ministers account and that civil servants appear before Parliament on
behalf of their Ministers is important to defend and understand. I note
that it was asserted in evidence to the committee that the idea that
civil servants are unfortunate, beleaguered public servants who cannot
speak for themselves is from a past
era<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:24:24"></hs_TimeCode>. That I
disagree with. You have only to watch some poor beleaguered civil
servants still appearing before Select Committees to know that that is
untrue. Civil servants go before Select Committees to explain the
Government’s policy—they are not there in their own
right. That has a 
<?notus-xml column=385?>consequence: it is necessary, if Ministers are going to have civil
servants appear before Parliament to explain their position, that the
Minister should be able to choose who does
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:25:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000212" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000212">If
a Select Committee wants to summon a named official, it can of course
do so, but there will inevitably be occasions when the Minister wants
to choose who responds on their behalf. When I appeared before the
Public Administration Committee as the Cabinet Secretary, the chairman
complained after a while that, whoever he asked to appear, he always
seemed to get me. I can understand the frustration that that caused,
but it was the fact that the Prime Minister wanted me to explain the
Government’s policy, the facts and, in the end, I think that the
Government will hold to that
position.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000213" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000213">It
is also the case that civil servants should in no way be disciplined by
a Select Committee. Select Committees are not equipped to carry out
that task. In many ways, they are arenas that can be very unfair and
they are in no way equipped or trained to carry out the kind of fair
processes that disciplinary arrangements require. I agree very much
with the excellent speech of the noble Baroness, who I thought got it
absolutely right. I agreed with pretty much everything that she said on
that
subject<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:26:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000214" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000214">Similarly,
I note and understand the view that retired civil servants should be
able to be summoned before Select Committees. I argue only that there
should be some form of statute of limitation. There must come some
point when people are spared that recall. I remember one sad occasion
in the 1990s, which people may not remember, where a former civil
servant was summoned to account for something that had happened. He was
not well—the Select Committee did not know that—and the
whole thing covered everyone with a certain embarrassment. It is
important that this should be done with some sense of proportion and
appropriateness, but, in the end, Select Committees probably should be
able to call back the only people who can explain what
happened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:27:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000215" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000215">Other
things in the report raised a wry smile. I noted the proposal that
Ministers should be able to contribute to the appraisal of selected
civil servants. This is not new. There was a process introduced in the
1990s that Ministers should be asked to comment on the performance of
their Permanent Secretaries. I remember it. The Minister concerned will
remain nameless—there could be more than one. I kept reminding
him that he had not yet said anything for my appraisal. In the end, I
went to see him to ask him to do it because we were way beyond the
timetable and he said, “Will you draft me something?”, so
there is a theory here which may not entirely conform with the facts. I
do not ask the Minister to comment on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000216" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000216">As to
staying in the job, again, it is a noble ideal but it may not be so
easily implemented in practice. When I proposed to Mr Blair as Prime
Minister the setting up of the Delivery Unit, the concept was that the
Government should select two or three topics in particular areas to
which the Civil Service would pay close attention and devote its very
best resources to achieve results over a given period, and that named
officials should be assigned to those projects and remain with them 
<?notus-xml column=386?>until the end, accountable for whatever was required to happen. I do not
think that it proved practicable. The world moves on; Ministers change;
circumstances change; things happen to the people concerned. It is a
highly desirable objective, but in practice it has to be tempered
realistically with the way the world
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:29:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000217" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000217">I
want to say two important things. First, I do not agree with the
committee that accountability and responsibility are the same. The
distinction between accountability and responsibility is useful. I
think Ministers are accountable to Parliament in the sense of being
liable to give an account, but I do not think that they carry
responsibility for everything that they are accounting for. The air is
thick these days with people demanding accountability and in the same
breath demanding sacking. We need to be absolutely clear that the
people who give an account are not necessarily the people who should be
held responsible. I would wish to stick to this distinction, which
originates with my noble friend Lord Armstrong from the Armstrong
memorandum, if I remember
correctly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:30:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000218" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000218">The
other point I want to make is the importance of having the right people
of the right quality in government. These proposals in the Constitution
Committee’s report need to be seen in the context of the
challenge that the Civil Service faces at the moment. The scale of
reduction in the size of the service is astonishing. The reduction in
size is bigger than the entire worldwide workforce of a company such
BP. That is a challenge which no private sector company, other than one
going bankrupt, has to face. It has been done at the same time as pay
and pensions are under pressure, which is bound to affect morale. The
Government are asking the Civil Service to implement major radical
changes across a great broad front such as health, education, defence,
Europe and welfare. All these things are demanding. It will require
enormous skill and ability to implement those challenges, at a time
when there is great
churn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:31:41"></hs_TimeCode>. The
choice of people for these jobs is crucial. It concerns me very much
that so many people at the top of the Civil Service are leaving. I
believe that only two out of 16 key Permanent Secretaries are still in
post over the past two or three years. That is a big
worry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:32:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000219" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000219">The
last thing that the Civil Service needs at the moment is a demand for
constitutional change. The Government’s best chance of achieving
the scale of change that they are seeking is if they work closely in
unity on a basis of trust with the Civil Service within a
constitutional framework that is understood and accepted by everyone,
without attempts to challenge what are bedrock
principles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:32:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000220" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000220">Permanent
Secretaries are in the public eye. If Ministers choose them, they will
be perceived as people who are—I try to avoid the word
“cronies”—the chosen people of that Minister. That
could lead to very unfortunate consequences. If a Minister chooses a
civil servant, that may not be the Permanent Secretary who his or her
successor needs. Permanent Secretaries need to be people who can serve
the current Minister, the next Minister and possibly a Minister from
another Government. It is crucial that they are people who can serve
Governments of any political complexion. If one Minister chooses them,
that is something which is likely to lead to subsequent Ministers
saying, “I want 
<?notus-xml column=387?>my person. If my predecessor had their person, I want the person who is
my own choice”. The perception outside that it has become
politicised is a real one. It is not theoretical—it is

reasonable it sounds, there is a thin red line which the First Civil

importance. Noble Lords who have been Ministers will forgive me, but

Commission<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:34:06"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Lords will understand that there is much more that I wish to say. There

Hennessy of Nympsfield:</Member></B> My Lords, each generation needs to
re-examine its notions of Crown service and the accountabilities that
go with it. I add my thanks to the Constitution Committee, and its
chair, the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, for their resonant report of last
November. It covers a great many of the crucial ingredients of what one
might call the governing marriage at the heart of the British system; a
marriage which brings together transient if, in the end, dominant
Ministers and permanent, career, non-political civil servants in a
relationship that one hopes will be greater than the sum of its parts.
However, there has existed over the past 40 years a third party to the
classic governing marriage in the shape of temporary, politically
appointed special advisers who can bring great benefits to the work of
the established couple but occasionally can also produce bursts of
friction that can induce a serious

am pleased—even relieved—that in general terms the
Constitution Committee’s report has endorsed the main elements

Ministers in return for their Secretaries of State remaining
can-carriers-in-chief in Parliament, in an age in which, quite rightly,
senior officials are expected to give evidence to Select Committees of
both Houses and to be visible and vocal to a degree not experienced by

There was intense resistance to this notion of meritocracy. Queen
Victoria hated it. The Foreign and Home Offices resisted for decades.
However, it became the norm for the Home Civil and Diplomatic Services,
the Armed Forces and the secret services. Its prime virtue is that
Crown servants, in civvies or in uniform, should speak truth unto
power: to tell Ministers what they need to know rather than what they
wish to hear. Sir Charles Trevelyan had seen this approach first-hand
at work in the Indian Civil Service. On his return to the UK, he made
his case to the Commons Select Committee on Miscellaneous Expenditure
in 1848 and then, as Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, to his new

vacancy. It receives direct input from the Secretary of State in the
department possessing the vacancy about the qualities and capacities
they, the Secretaries of State, are seeking. The leadership committee
carries out the interviews and places a handful of candidates above the
line, indicating that they are both capable of doing the job and in
possession of the Northcote-Trevelyan non-partisan characteristics
which would enable them to serve equally well a Secretary of State or
Government of a different colour. After all, as other noble Lords have
pointed out, we need permanent Permanent Secretaries, not temporary
Permanent Secretaries who last for the duration of a single Secretary
of State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:42:56"></hs_TimeCode>. As has
been mentioned, there is already an alarmingly high rate of churn at
Permanent Secretary
level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:43:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Secretary of State and, indeed, the Prime Minister can veto the outcome

experience of civil servants arises from having been a Minister for a
very long time in five government departments. There is no issue with
the integrity and dedication of civil servants. The real issue is
whether they are organised in the best way to serve the state. The
highest point for me, as a very young Minister in 1964—well
before the Ark—was to be told by the person who was in effect
running the Ministry of Power, Matthew Stevenson, that he had
everything in place to implement the Government’s plans to bring
the steel industry into public ownership, for which I had been given a
small responsibility. In Stevenson’s words, by my recollection:
“When I was a young man at the Ministry, I help to nationalise
steel. When I was older, now at the Treasury, I helped to denationalise
it. Now that I am older still, I can assure you that I have the plans
and staff to nationalise it once again”. That great civil
servant was as true as his word, and put flesh on the bones of our
shoulders, which had been pretty bare and innocent of too much
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:47:04"></hs_TimeCode>. The low
point for me was the Cabinet Office’s procedures for handling
the memoirs I was obliged to submit to it as an ex-Cabinet Minister.
All I would say is that I warn future writers to be wary.</hs_para>

committee’s conclusions. First, it
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13020761000595" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000595">“We

Government’s response points out an important distinction
between them. The consequences can be different, so far as blame is
concerned. Crichel Down is said to be the high point of accepting
responsibility. Since then, a much more complex system of government
has evolved, with the development of arm’s-length bodies. The
growth of the modern state has led inevitably to the diminution of
direct parliamentary accountability. Indeed, as a young man I was able
to put a question to the Postmaster-General, asking why a letter to one
of my constituents had been delivered late—another
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:49:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

of Select Committees in the House of Commons, and the flexing of their
muscles in demanding more evidence, is helping to fill the vacuum. I
suspect that our committees still have some way to go to be as strong
as the committees of the American Senate. That leads me to my second
point: endorsing the committee’s recommendation that the right
of access by committees to civil policy should not be weaker than those
making a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The committee
has struck the right balance in underlining protection for civil
servants under the decision-making wing of the Minister. The
Government’s response seems to accept
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:49:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000246" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000246">Thirdly,
I turn to some interesting paragraphs, which have been touched on
already, on the appointment of Permanent Secretaries. The committee
rightly maintains that appointment should be on merit. I believe that
Ministers are entitled to, and should get, the men and women they want
as Permanent Secretaries. In a recent letter to the <I>Times</I><I>,
</I>the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, pointed out his experience
on that score. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, in his contribution seemed
to endorse
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:50:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Welsh Secretary I got my man, albeit in slightly different
circumstances. For six years, I was served by the man in whom I had
confidence and whom I wanted. The committee concedes that the
Government’s proposals are in some respects the formalisation of
practices that already occur. I agree with that too. I have considered
the Government’s response, which underlines the involvement of
the Secretary of State at each and every level. That must be so, and I
accept and agree with it. I hope that the review being conducted will
not ignore the reality of what happened certainly in my experience and
in that of the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord
Rodgers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:51:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000248" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000248">The
bottom line is that a Cabinet Minister must have confidence that his
Permanent Secretary will organise the department in such a way that it
can deliver his policies. When, in 1966, I went with Barbara Castle to
the Ministry of Transport, it was a failed department. The Minister was
in the wrong job and he was sacked. He had failed to produce a
transport policy. It was widely understood that the Permanent Secretary
would not be sacked. He was sidelined and Barbara brought in a
distinguished academic, Christopher 
<?notus-xml column=392?>Foster, an expert in transport, who distinguished himself as an adviser
to many Governments to run the policy side of the
department<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:52:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000249" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000249">Fourthly,
the Select Committee is nervous about temporary civil servants on
fixed-term contracts. Provided they have the vital qualities for a most
senior civil servant, the appointment should be for the Minister to
make and not have to be the Permanent Secretary, who may well have
failed. The Government’s response seems to be the right one,
which I warmly
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:53:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000250" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000250">Fifthly,
the committee recommends the presumption that a single senior civil
servant will lead the implementation of a major project from beginning
to end. The Auditor-General welcomes the creation of the Major Projects
Authority in 2010. Despite the difficulties that we have heard, I agree
100% with that laudable aim. An official should have a personal
promotion, if necessary, in order to maintain continuity in the
department. These projects are complex, and it is very important that a
person should maintain their responsibility. I hope that the Browne
review, to which reference has been made, will certainly ensure that
there is an improvement on that
score<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:54:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

charge of projects, Permanent Secretaries come and go far too
frequently, as do Ministers. Procurement Ministers should be in post
for much longer. Over the years, the history of defence procurement is
an indication of the lack of continuity of proper ministerial control.
I am proud to have been a Minister of Defence for Equipment, although,
fortunately or unfortunately as the case may be, the electorate sacked
the Government. I would have regretted very much not being able to
continue with some of those projects, which have the gestation period
of an elephant. The most effective Minister under whom I have served
was Denis Healey, who was Defence Minister for six years. He knew the
beginning and the end of all projects in that

committee might have spent a little time scrutinising the length of
tenure of Permanent Secretaries in one post. It is a great worry that

the exceptional performance and worthiness of this distinguished senior

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome today’s
debate on this very important issue, and start by paying tribute to the
work led by the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, and the members of the
Constitution Committee for their excellent job. The committee’s
strong endorsement of the basic principles of accountability in our

reason for speaking in this debate is to offer the perspective of
someone who was a career civil servant for 19 years in six departments.
You could say that it is the viewpoint of someone at the other end of
the telescope from Ministers and Parliament. I should start by saying
that I firmly believe in the principles that underpin an impartial
British Civil Service. These principles go back to the
Northcote-Trevelyan report and still hold firm today.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:58:09"></hs_TimeCode> wish to
continue to see a Civil Service that is appointed on merit and that
people who advance in it do so on the basis of merit. I feel sure that
the whole House would wish to see a Civil Service that is impartial,
objective and honest, and that acts at all time with integrity. These
are the watchwords of the modern Civil
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000257" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000257">None<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:58:32"></hs_TimeCode>
of the above should prevent any of the welcome changes of recent years
in the Civil Service, nor should they prevent it learning from
elsewhere, be it from the private sector or elsewhere in international
public administration. Indeed, I read with interest what is happening
in New Zealand to sharpen accountability for senior civil servants and
in Australia where there is a very different system for appointing and
dismissing their equivalent of Permanent Secretaries. A greater level
of exchange with other sectors, a greater level of professionalism in
the Civil Service, particularly in relation to procurement and project
management, and a greater awareness of the challenges of modern
information systems and the rise of the 24/7 world of communications
will all help to enhance the effectiveness of our modern Civil
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000258" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000258">Indeed,
the Civil Service reform plan has already made a start in setting out
the type of changes needed to deliver a 21st century Civil Service. I

spotting and developing a fast stream right up to addressing the
training needs of Permanent Secretaries.</hs_para>

when there is no right of reply and, as other noble Lords have said, at

to make on the potential risks of undermining the values that I have
set out, values which I believe are fundamental to our democracy.
First, a worrying trend is developing—we have heard about it
already in this debate—of too much political interference in the
appointment of Permanent Secretaries. There has been much discussion
recently in the media and elsewhere about this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T13:47:10"></hs_TimeCode>, and the
noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, has already spoken most eloquently on this
matter. In addition, the First Civil Service Commissioner has made very
clear in his interventions that there is, in any case, always ample
opportunity for a Secretary of State to make his or her views clear on
the quality of the candidates being considered as Permanent
Secretaries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:01:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000261" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000261">In
a letter to the <I>Times</I> last year, Sir David Normington warned of
the dangers of a more politicised appointments process, particularly if
a civil servant becomes viewed as the personal appointment of a
particular Minister rather than someone able and ready to work for a
new Minister or a new Government. We all know how quickly the reshuffle
merry-go-round takes
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:01:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000262" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000262">In
my view, Ministers should not be able to overrule the decision of the
Civil Service Commission. Some recent examples, such as the overturning
of the Commission’s recommendation for the post of Permanent
Secretary at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, run the risk
of undermining the principle of fair and open competition based on
merit. I make no criticism whatever of the candidate eventually chosen
in that department who, I know, is a highly regarded civil servant.
However, the original candidate selected, and agreed by the Secretary
of State, was, as I understand it and as was reported, subsequently
overruled by Downing Street. If that was the case, then it
was wrong.</hs_para>

the proposal as part of the reform plan to contract out core policy
functions and test the market in certain circumstances has real flaws
and has not been properly thought through. If you are seeking impartial
policy advice delivered to Ministers without fear or favour; if you are
seeking people who can speak truth unto power it is best if those
people do not have a financial interest in the advice they give. This

course Ministers will wish to have, and should have, access to a wide a
range of advice from think tanks, other pressures groups, academics,
management consultants with specific expertise and others. Of course,
the Civil Service must not claim a monopoly of advice; it does not have
it. However, there is always the risk that a private sector
organisation, a think tank or any other organisation providing advice
under contract to a Minister may be tempted to provide the advice that
they think the Minister wishes to hear rather than what the Minister
ought to hear, particularly if a future contract for that policy advice
is in the offing. It is the role of senior civil servants to weigh up
those at times conflicting opinions and give fair and impartial
balanced advice to Ministers without any axe to grind or any personal
or financial benefit to accrue to them or their department. I do not
think there has been nearly enough attention or debate on this
development and its serious implications for Civil Service
accountability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:03:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the accusation that the Civil Service is inherently risk-averse and
that somehow this is an inbuilt weakness of the system and the way it
is held accountable. Under successive Governments, but particularly
recently, as we have already heard in today’s debate, the cry
has gone up from Ministers that civil servants need to be more
entrepreneurial and more willing to take measured risks. I wish to
challenge that accusation. The work of the Civil Service is not capable
of such a precise parallel with the role of the private sector. In the
latter case, entrepreneurs take risks with other people’s money
or with private money in the hope that they will generate more money
and profits. Sometime they do and sometime they do not. On occasions,
the businesses involved will lose money if the risk does not come off
and the investors have to carry that loss.</hs_para>

the public sector, and particularly in the Civil Service, it is not
private money that is being invested. Rather, the Government are
investing taxpayers’ money in public services. Civil Servants,
and at the top of each department accounting officers, have a
constitutional duty, as the report of the Constitution Committee makes
clear, to ensure due propriety in the spending of that money. Permanent
Secretaries and heads of department are responsible to Parliament for
the proper stewardship of expenditure. The Public Accounts Committee
exists precisely for the purpose of scrutinising and challenging
accounting officers on their management of public money. It would
simply not be acceptable for civil servants to say, “I took a
risk with public money and that risk didn’t come off. I’m
sorry”. As a society, we rightly expect more of public money and
public
servants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:05:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:05:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:05:31"></hs_TimeCode>.
Of course, civil servants must understand risk and be explicit in their
advice to Ministers on the risks involved in pursuing particular
policies. The idea, though, that civil servants across the board should
be less risk-averse—the flipside of that is, as a result, more
entrepreneurial—does not stand up to detailed
scrutiny.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000267" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0001.htm#13020761000267">Finally,
I think we need to look again at the relationship between Ministers and
civil servants—something that I fear is currently at something
of a low ebb, with a real impact on morale. We also need to look at the
three-way relationship between Ministers, the permanent Civil Service
and special advisers, and the benefits that that can bring to the
system. The best special advisers—and I have worked
constructively with many in the past—add value and protect that
vital frontier between politics and the non-party political role of an
impartial civil servant. I am very pleased that the
committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:06:30"></hs_TimeCode>

Minister-civil servant relationship needs to be strong and
constructive, recognising the mutually beneficial role that each can
play. In my experience—and in present company, I am going to try
to put this as delicately as I possibly can—there are on
occasion Minsters who are sometimes too quick to blame their civil
servants when they would do well, initially perhaps, to consider their
own effectiveness in particular circumstances. The best Ministers, and
the ones who command the most respect from their departments,
regardless of party, are those who set out a strong 
<?notus-xml column=396?>strategic vision, take decisions quickly, explain those decisions,
recognise where the boundaries lie between their respective roles and,
when things go wrong, accept personal responsibility, even when they

right in arguing that the growth in the size and complexity of the
state since the Haldane convention was formulated, and the development
of Select Committees since 1979, require that the practice in operating
the convention should be kept under review. It would clearly be
impossible for Ministers to give all the evidence required by
parliamentary committees, so the convention must be applied with
understanding and flexibility within the framework defined by Lord
Haldane—but it must not be
violated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000274" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000274">It
is particularly in relation to the work and the demands of
parliamentary select and other committees that the lines in the sand
need to be kept under review and redrawn if need be. The principle must
be that the 
<?notus-xml column=397?>civil servant is accountable to his Minister when he gives evidence on
the Minister’s or the department’s behalf to a
parliamentary committee, as he is in everything else that he does as a
civil servant. Normally there will be no problem about this. The
Minister—or the department on his behalf—will select, and
the committee concerned will accept, the civil servants who are best
qualified to answer the questions likely to be asked. Occasionally, as
the Constitution Committee recognises, a parliamentary committee will
wish to hear evidence from a particular civil servant. The Minister
will consent to allow that civil servant to give evidence if the
Minister is content that he should do so; but if the
Minister is not content that he should do so, the Minister is entitled
to withhold his consent.</hs_para>

Minister can be forced not to withhold consent. If he does withhold
consent, then the committee will be within its rights if it summons the
Minister himself to go and give evidence, or to make available another
civil servant to do so if the committee is prepared to accept that
other person. I was involved in one case where a Commons committee
wanted to call two named civil servants to give evidence but the
Minister, for valid reasons, refused to allow them to go and, with the
committee’s grudging acceptance, sent me to give evidence on the
Minister’s behalf. I still remember with a touch of pride,
though it got me into some trouble at the time, the
<I>Guardian</I>’s lobby correspondent’s verdict on that
encounter: “Mandarin 3, Select Committee
0”.</hs_para>

cases where a civil servant called to give evidence will be instructed
by his Minister not to answer a particular question or questions, or
not to give certain information to the committee concerned, because the
information is of especial secrecy or confidentiality. The civil
servant must be free to say that the Minister, who is himself
accountable to Parliament and on whose behalf he is giving evidence,
has instructed him not to answer the question or give that information.
In my view, the committee is bound to accept that position and to have
recourse to the Minister himself if it wishes to press for an answer.
The civil servant concerned should not be put under third-degree
pressure by the chairman or members of the committee to answer the
question when he has been instructed by his Minister or is bound not to
do so.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020761000277" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000277">The
Constitution Committee discusses the question of the appointment of
Permanent Secretaries. The problem question here is the role of a
Minister in selecting a new Permanent Secretary. It was all so much
easier in my day. When I was head of the Civil Service, I chaired a
senior appointments selection committee whose task was to consider a
shortlist of candidates for an appointment and give the guidance on
whom I should recommend to the Prime Minister. Before preparing such a
shortlist, I took great trouble to consult the Secretary of State
concerned to try to make sure that any candidates whom he favoured were
on the shortlist and that any candidates with whom he thought he could
not work were not on the short list.</hs_para>

skill, before approving an appointment. She wanted to make sure that

arrangement than the existing system but it did not work badly. It
seems to me that the existing system, as described in the Constitution
Committee’s report, provides a Secretary of State with
sufficient involvement in the process to make sure that his views are
known and taken into account and that he will not have thrust upon him
a Permanent Secretary with whom he feels unable to work. I do not think
it would be right to go further than that and give the Secretary of
State or departmental Minister the final choice, for all the reasons
set out in the evidence to the Constitution Committee and by the

undesirable for the Permanent Secretary to change every time there is a
change of Secretary of State or departmental Minister. The turnover of
departmental Ministers can be quite rapid. I served for four years in

Secretary. During that time I served three Secretaries of State, two
Labour and one Conservative, and got on happily and constructively with

Committee discusses the question whether Civil Service policy advice
should ever be disclosed to parliamentary Select Committees. I agree
with those who said in evidence that a civil servant should never be
asked to disclose the advice he has given to his Minister; if anyone is
to be asked to disclose that advice, it should be the Minister. The
general rule should be that advice given by civil servants to Ministers
should never be disclosed. If civil servants were to believe that their
advice might subsequently be disclosed, there would be a real danger
that that advice would be less full, candid and fearless than it should
be. Exceptions to the general rule should be extremely rare, if not
non-existent.</hs_para>

the whole of that speech to the House, I shall only quote two sentences

second point is relevant to the use by the Lord Callaghan of the words
“temporary” and “fleeting”. The report
which we are debating refers only to the high turnover of senior
responsible officials. Given the frequency with which Ministers, and
even Secretaries of State, have been moved from one job to another, or
to none, under successive Administrations, would it really be a
sensible way to run the public service if all of them were allowed to
dismiss and appoint their Permanent
Secretaries?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000288" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000288">My
third point is somewhat outside the scope of the committee’s
report. I make it not only as a former head of Her Majesty's Diplomatic
Service but as a seconded civil servant for the two and a half years
when I worked for two successive Prime Ministers in the 1970s. Having
earlier in my career been Private Secretary to Sir David Ormsby-Gore in
Washington, I understand as well as anyone the very special
contribution which a political head of mission can make to a bilateral
relationship. But here again, let us be very careful not to follow the
American precedent whereby some 30% of senior diplomatic posts are
filled with friends and donors of the party in power. It is said that
for every top position in the

was roused from my natural indolence by the arrival late yesterday
afternoon of the Government’s response to our report—a
report which had been in the Government’s hands for well over
two months, as the committee chairman, the noble Baroness, Lady Jay,
made clear. One of the most telling features of the response is that it
deals at length with only one element of the report: namely, the
appointment of Permanent Secretaries. To that it devotes six
paragraphs, while no other recommendation in the report receives more
than two paragraphs by way of reply. On the appointment of Permanent
Secretaries, the Government state that they believe that it would be
perfectly possible under the legislation passed by Parliament in 2010
to have an appointment panel which sifts through the candidates and
ensures that they are above the line for appointment, and for the Civil
Service Commission then to provide Ministers with a choice between
those appointable candidates: an appointment panel to appoint this
panel. Is the Civil Service Commission not the panel to which we
naturally
look?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000291" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000291">No
previous Government have sought to exert such firm control over the
processes by which Permanent Secretaries are appointed, and I share the
fears expressed many times during this debate that the
Government’s proposals create dangers for the great principles
of impartiality, merit and competition on which appointment has always
rested, hinting at the patronage from which the Civil Service escaped
as a result of the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms. I am not normally drawn
greatly to the career and achievements of Mr Gladstone—Disraeli
is more in my line—but on this, I am entirely with him for all

is important to remember that we already have a not inconsiderable

Lady Jay of Paddington, and the committee for the work that they
undertook. We owe them a debt of gratitude for being able to have this
debate today. The opening speech by the noble Baroness set the tone for
a very thoughtful, insightful debate which has drawn on considerable
expertise in your Lordships’ House. It is a very timely debate
because the Government’s proposals for reform have reignited
interest in the role of civil servants, the wider relationship between
Ministers and civil servants and the key issues of accountability and
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000296" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000296">I

aback to find that an e-mail into my inbox at 5.53 pm yesterday evening

committee’s report identifies why it undertook this
investigation. This includes the increasing complexity of government
structures and functions, the Civil Service reform plan, and of course
the previous report on ministerial responsibility following the
introduction of the Health and Social Care Bill. For some Ministers,
and indeed for some civil servants, that tension between ministerial
and civil service responsibility proves difficult, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Jay, highlighted some very pertinent examples of that. I
will deal with that issue for a few moments. The committee’s
report on the Health and Social Care Bill dealt with the specific issue
of ministerial accountability, and the issue is again explored in this
report in line with civil servants’ accountability. The
committee has further considered that, and it has maintained its
previous position when it says in the
report:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13020761000599" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000599">“No

effect, it seems that the committee is saying that Ministers should not
be able to abdicate or delegate their responsibilities, and that this
is an essential part of holding ministerial office. Clearly, Ministers
have to accept responsibility for the work of their department. That
does not mean that they are responsible for every action or mistake;
the example of the lost disc mentioned in the report is a good one.
However, it means that they are answerable on operational matters as
well as policy. These matters are not just for civil servants to deal
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:30:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

accountability, the report refers to the “Today”
programme test—that is, the political reality that the media and
the public will seek answers from a Minister, not from a civil servant.
Some Ministers find that difficult if they feel that they are not
responsible and that it is a matter for which a civil servant should be
held to account. I will suggest two other tests to your
Lordships’ House. There is also what might be called the
common-sense test. While some may bray for the head of a Minister in
whose department someone has made a mistake, surely the test should be
whether it was a simple and unintended mistake by a member of staff or
whether there is a more systematic problem for which there must be
ministerial accountability. My sense is that the difference is
generally understood by Parliament, the press and the public, although
it is not unheard of for someone to seek to make political capital out
of such
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:31:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000299" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000299">There
is another test, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of
Aberavon, touched on it. It is ministerial accountability to
Parliament, and where Ministers and Parliament see the boundaries of
that accountability. When issues of service provision are raised,
Ministers in your Lordships’ House regularly state that these
are not matters for them but are operational or local decisions.
However, it is central government that dictates and decides the limits,
including financial parameters, within which local services have to
work. Although the scope for local decision-making is limited by
Ministers, this should not prevent them from answering questions about
the impact of their
policies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:31:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000300" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000300">I

was despite the fact that his Government had set the budget within
which that decision had to be made. That was not an isolated case.

is difficult to judge the parameters accepted by Ministers on
responsibility to your Lordships’ House, but the wider and more
serious issue is the one touched on by the noble and learned Lord, Lord

Government have said that they are seeking to privatise the probation
service. The judgment of the Constitution Committee is that Ministers
cannot delegate accountability. However, if Ministers, while retaining
overall responsibility for the provision of probation services, allow a
private company to provide all or part of those services, will the
Government consider that Ministers should answer Questions on those
operational matters, or would that be delegated to a civil servant or
the head of the private
company<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T12:18:13"></hs_TimeCode>? If
Ministers do 
<?notus-xml column=403?>not answer, the ability of Parliament and of individual parliamentarians
to hold the Government to account for the services for which they are
responsible will be severely restricted. Other than in Select
Committees, parliamentarians cannot question civil servants or private
service providers, and it would be wrong for them to do so. However,
where the Government have ultimate responsibility, surely Ministers
should answer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:33:42"></hs_TimeCode>.

its report, the committee also looked at the issue of distancing
Ministers from the decisions of arm’s-length bodies. However, I
do not think that a privatised service comes under that remit, and
there are constitutional issues of accountability and of whether the
public will lose their rights to freedom of information in such
instances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:34:15"></hs_TimeCode>. The
committee was also right to highlight the complexities of government
structure and organisation. If we as parliamentarians find it complex,
it must be hugely difficult for an ordinary citizen to try to navigate
their way around Parliament or government. Therefore, I strongly
welcome the committee’s recommendation that a map or
organisational chart should be produced. This point was made by the
noble Lord, Lord Hennessy. I suspect that it might be slightly more
complicated than the bus route map of

the brief time available, I looked at the Government’s response
to the point made by the committee. I had an opportunity to look at the
websites that the Government say address the issue, and I have to say
that I do not think they do. The Government’s response to the
report does not address the need to have an organisational map showing

the related issue of civil servants giving evidence to Select
Committees, the committee struck absolutely the right balance in
defining what is appropriate and how the process should be conducted.
There is a question for the Minister around the issue of defining a
civil servant, and who Ministers can and cannot ask and instruct to
give evidence to a Select Committee. I recently asked a Question about
Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration. When I
asked the Minister how often Ministers met him, the rather bizarre
reply was that Ministers have internal meetings and talk to officials
from time to time on matters of policy, and thus that it was an
internal matter. I then obtained an entirely reasonable answer via a
freedom of information request to the chief inspector’s
office<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:36:01"></hs_TimeCode>. Clearly,
for Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector for Borders and Immigration to
give evidence would not be in any way a replacement for the
accountability of Ministers, but it would be of assistance to the
committee in its scrutiny of ministerial decision-making. I would be
grateful if the Minister would look at that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:36:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000306" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000306">After
reading various documents on the Government’s Civil Service
reform plan, I have to say that when the Government deal with issues in

strong echoes of an episode of “Yes Minister”. There are
issues around strengths and weaknesses, better performance management,
building on our strengths, 
<?notus-xml column=404?>reducing our weaknesses and so on. However, as noble Lords have

it appears from public comments and government leaks that the report

not to have that continuity in office. It is logical to have the
involvement of a Secretary of State in the appointment of a Permanent
Secretary. However, the fear is that the Government will stray over the
red line that could lead to the greater politicisation of the Civil
Service. The one thing we have to guard against is any suspicion or

servants with whom they have worked. What is so important is the
principle of impartiality and accountability, and the relationship
between the two. Clearly, a Secretary of State needs to have confidence
in their Permanent Secretary. The working relationship has to be good,

Government welcome this report. We apologise profusely for the late

received a carefully considered and positive response to the

should not exaggerate the degree of current disagreement or discontent,
or the supposed threat to the principles of Northcote-Trevelyan. It is
clear that recruitment is still by merit, and I am happy that
recruitment is going extremely well. The Diplomatic Service and the
domestic Civil Service attract intense competition from graduates.
Promotion is also by talent, although I have noticed during the past 30
or 40 years that ministerial favour has rarely hurt the careers of
particular civil servants under different Governments. There are some
queries about retention, particularly in the Treasury, where I think
churn is 
<?notus-xml column=406?>one-sixth of staff a year. I am still puzzled as to why the Treasury
should pay much less than some other departments in Whitehall. Those
are the sort of things which some of us are querying inside

still have the principle of a permanent Civil Service, although I think
that it would be fair to say—and the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy,
will certainly remember—that when we had a large number of
temporary civil servants in World War II, many of them turned out to be
the great civil servants of the following generation. The idea that one
has a permanent Civil Service in which there should be no movement in
and out is one with which I think none of us entirely
agrees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:44:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000318" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000318">There
is of course a necessary and continuing constructive tension between
Ministers and officials, and between government and Parliament. When I
first came into this area as a graduate student studying under Max
Beloff at the University of Oxford, the new Labour Government were then
deeply suspicious of the conservatism of the Civil Service after 13
years of Conservative Government. Again, in 1974, a Labour Government
came in who were suspicious of the conservatism of the Civil Service.
When the Conservatives came in from 1979, there was, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Smith, remarked, a mood of “Is he one of us? Are
they too close to Labour?”. When new Labour came in again in
1997, there was some suspicion that many senior civil servants were too
close to the Conservatives. We have now had a coalition from 2010, and
some people have natural suspicions that people are too close to the
previous regime.</hs_para>

development of the role of special advisers during the past 25 to 30
years has, in my opinion, helped the relationship between Ministers and
officials, although, of course, there are always exceptions to every
case. The transformation of government during the past three
generations has also changed the challenges posed to Whitehall. We have
moved from policy to management, to a very large welfare state and thus
to a much greater concentration on delivery, and from local delivery to
central control. I note the argument as to how far the Secretary of
State for Heath should continue to be personally responsible and
accountable for actions within the National Health Service across the
whole of England. That is an interesting question. If one adopted the
principles set out in the very interesting new report by the noble
Lord, Lord Heseltine, which proposes a substantial decentralisation of
delivery, it would mean that Ministers would be less responsible for
delivery on the ground. However, 50 years ago, delivery on the ground
was the responsibility mainly of local authorities and not of central
government. That is an issue which we will no doubt also continue to
discuss<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:46:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000320" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000320">The
sharpness of financial constraints under which the Government are now
operating, and they exist not just in the United Kingdom, pose real
challenges for all departments of government. Major shifts in skills
are needed. Permanent under-secretaries two or three generations ago
did not think that they needed strong managerial skills. It is clear
that in what we now call “the delivery department”
managerial skills are extremely important. Management of major
projects, which the 
<?notus-xml column=407?>Civil Service reform plan is much concerned with, requires skills which
are not always easily available within the Civil Service. We have just
set up a major project academy and are well aware of the managerial
failures during the previous Government and before in the management of
major innovatory projects. Digitisation—which is just beginning
to hit the Civil Service—might lead to a total revolution in the
entire relationship between the state and the citizen, in which the
state moves from paper to a much greater reliance on electronic
exchanges, enabling us to have a smaller central

is also the move to formal coalition, in which civil servants have to
balance between two parties in government, although that is not
entirely novel either. I cherish the senior official who said to me a
year ago that this coalition was in many ways working much better than
its predecessor because it was a formal coalition, meaning that we had
to have argument in the open and in committees, unlike in the coalition
between Brownites and the Blairites which had plotted behind closed

has been a comparable shift in the relationship between the Executive
and Parliament: the rise of Select Committees, a far greater
seriousness of parliamentary scrutiny and the development of
committees in the Lords. As I sit in the Cabinet Office, I hear people
talking about “the three key committees” to which the
public service now relates; that is, the Public Accounts Committee, the
Public Administration Select Committee and the Lords Constitution
Committee. That relationship did not concern civil servants very much
in the 1970s. I cherish a comment that I came across, on the
recommendation of the author of the volume, a couple a weeks ago. It
was made by a senior official during an off-the-record conference on
open government in the late 1970s. The civil servant said to the
journalist concerned that he had a “nightmare” of being
subject not just to Parliamentary Questions but to Select Committee
inquiries, investigation by the ombudsman, the Equal Opportunities
Commission, the Community Relations Commission and an appeal to the
European Court of Human Rights. “And now”, he said,
“you’re trying to impose freedom of information on
us”. He said it was a totally different landscape from that
which I had to steer policy through than the terrain I had entered as a
young assistant principal in the 1950s. I thank the noble Lord, Lord

the grade inflation, dumbing down and loss of rigour in those

consensus that the system needs to change. But one of the proposals I

have just one—wholly new—exam in each subject was just
one reform too many at this time.</hs_para>

Ofqual, which has done such a great job in recent months upholding
standards, was clear that there were significant risks in trying both
to strengthen qualifications and end competition in a large part of the
exams market. So I have decided not to make the best the enemy of the
good and I will not proceed with plans to have a single exam board
offering a new exam in each academic subject. Instead, we will
concentrate on reforming existing GCSEs along the lines we put forward
in September, because there is consensus that the exams and
qualification system we inherited was broken.</hs_para>

reforms was to vocational qualifications. They were allowed to become
less rigorous options under the previous Government. Alison
Wolf’s report outlined how to improve the quality of vocational
courses and expand work experience. It secured near universal support.
It will soon all be done. We are also reforming
apprenticeships. Under the previous Government the currency of
apprenticeships was devalued alongside every other qualification. The
Richard report on apprenticeship reform will restore rigour, as the
noble Lord, Lord Adonis, has explained so
powerfully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000349" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000349">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:05:07"></hs_TimeCode>
are reforming A-levels. Schools and universities were unhappy that
constant assessment and modularisation got in the way of proper
learning. So 
<?notus-xml column=412?>we are reforming those exams with the help of school and university
leaders. GCSEs will now also be reformed in a similar fashion. The
qualifications should be linear, with all assessments normally taken at
the end of the course. Examinations will test extended writing in
subjects such as English and history, have fewer bite-sized and overly
structured questions, and in mathematics and science there should be a
greater emphasis on quantitative problem-solving. Internal assessment
and the use of exam aids will be kept to a minimum and used only where
there is a compelling case to do so, to provide for effective and deep
assessment of the specified curriculum content.</hs_para>

GCSEs will be universal qualifications and I expect the same proportion
of pupils to sit them as now. This is something we believe the vast
majority of children with a good education should be able to achieve.
But reformed GCSEs will no longer set an artificial cap on how much
pupils can achieve by forcing students to choose between higher and
foundation tiers. Reformed GCSEs should allow students to access any
grade while enabling high-quality assessment at all levels. The
appropriate approach to assessment will vary between subjects and a
range of solutions may come forward; for example, extension papers
offering access to higher grades alongside a common core. There should
be no disincentive for schools to give an open choice of papers to
their pupils.</hs_para>

qualifications alone is not enough to ensure higher standards for every
child. We also need to reform how schools are graded to encourage
higher expectations for every student. Existing league tables have
focused almost exclusively on how many children achieve a C pass in
five GCSEs including English and maths. Yet this deceptively simple
measure contains three perverse incentives: it encourages schools to
choose exams based on how easy they are to pass, rather than how
valuable they are to the student; it causes a narrow concentration on
just five subjects, instead of a broad curriculum; and it focuses
teachers’ time and energy too closely on just those pupils on
the C/D borderline, at the expense of their higher or lower-achieving
peers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020761000353" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000353">So
today I am proposing a more balanced and meaningful accountability
system, with two new measures: the percentage of pupils in each school
reaching an attainment threshold in the vital core subjects of English
and maths; and an average point score showing how much progress every
student makes between key stage 2 and key stage 4. The
average point score measure will reflect pupils’ achievement
across a wide range of eight subjects. As well as English and maths, it
will measure how well pupils perform in at least three subjects from
the English baccalaureate—sciences, history, geography,
languages and computer science—and in 
<?notus-xml column=413?>three additional subjects, whether those are arts subjects, academic
subjects or high-quality vocational qualifications. This measure will
incentivise schools to offer a broad and balanced curriculum, with
high-quality teaching and high achievement across the board. It will
also affirm the importance of every child enjoying the opportunity to
pursue the English baccalaureate subjects. By measuring average point
scores rather than a single cut-off point, the new measure will also
ensure that the achievement of all students is recognised equally,
including both low attainers and high fliers.</hs_para>

was expressed about the way the proposals were conceived and announced

headlines rather than a strategy for genuine change. There were
concerns at the speed with which Michael Gove proposed to implement the
changes, even leading the Tory-led Education Select Committee to
condemn the timetable as “too much, too fast”. Employers
were concerned that the EBacc placed no value on subjects critical to
our future economic competitiveness, such as design and technology,
construction and engineering. Business leaders, such as the CBI, were

the question of embarrassing changes, perhaps the noble Baroness can
tell us whether Stephen Twigg still supports a single exam board, as he
stated last September. He seemed unable to answer that question in

through lessons, as I have done on many occasions, to see how
content-light the current national curriculum is and how it is
short-changing our pupils. That was brought home to me about four years
ago when I watched a lesson by a so-called very good English teacher on
“The Taming of the Shrew”. It was a 50-minute lesson and
the sole material produced was a single sheet of A4 on which she had
photographed the posters of the six films that had been made about
“The Taming of the Shrew”. The subject matter of the
lesson was how more or less the portrayal of the shrew 
<?notus-xml column=417?>in the photographs had been sexualised. Apparently that was relevant and

display their professional expertise and subject knowledge. One very
important point, which has gone largely unnoticed so far, is that, as
the chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, says in every speech he
makes, we no longer care precisely how teachers teach provided our
students are learning and making progress. There is a perception among
all teachers that there is something called a standard Ofsted lesson.
It does not exist but it is perceived to be no more than five minutes
teaching from the front; a plenary at the end; group work; peer group
discussion and so on. Teachers find this a straitjacket which they live
in fear of. We are determined to end this but that message has not got
through yet to all Ofsted inspectors; however, we are determined to get
it through. When we end this, it will free teachers up to display their

the noble Lord, Lord Baker, said, there may be rejoicing about this
U-turn, it is particularly humiliating for the Secretary of State
because of the bravado with which he announced his original plans?
Maybe the Secretary of State can learn something from that. Many of us
still worry that he does not understand the basic problem of trying to
be too prescriptive about the national curriculum or an examination
system, or the difficulties of not having a proper, coherent
examination system in this country. Whatever the questions are, the
answer is surely not to have a 19th century model of education, as the
Secretary of State
suggests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000390" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000390">Does
the Minister agree that we can make progress on the national curriculum
and the most appropriate system of examination in this country only by
building consensus, and building it before the Secretary of State makes
decisions? Surely that should be one of the lessons that the Secretary
of State learns from this whole experience: you need to consult with
head teachers, teachers, employers and parents before you come to a
decision, not after you have decided and are trying to ram that
decision through.</hs_para>

Falkner of Margravine:</Member></B> My Lords, this year marks 96 years
since Arthur Balfour’s declaration and 20 years since the Oslo
peace accord. It took just over 30 years from Balfour’s
commitment to give meaning to the establishment of a state for the
Jewish people. For the people affected, both Israelis and Palestinians,
the past 65 years have not represented peace and security. In that
period, three generations of Arab and Jewish people have grown up
knowing the sorrow of bereavement, the insecurity of daily life and the
uncertainty of their children’s
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:43:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000419" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000419">The
historical involvement of the United Kingdom and our responsibility for
these affairs is not what I want to talk about today, other than to say
that people on all sides of this debate will commiserate for lives lost

whole, the day-to-day efforts of groups of Israelis and Palestinians to
work towards a peaceful resolution on the ground are unrecognised by
the international media. These peace activists have not given up on the
peace process, even while their Governments either wilfully backslide
or are powerless to move forward. They know what peace will look like,
and we know that a majority of both of them want peace. For the
Palestinians, peace is an end to the occupation so that they can get on
with their lives without either Israeli soldiers or Israeli settlers
over their shoulder. For Israelis, peace translates into an improved
quality of life of security and without fearing the next terrorist
incident. Both populations accept that they have to coexist to share a

many that there is no time to mention. One such organisation is
OneVoice, a youth-led movement working to end occupation and violence
in Israel and Palestine. Based in Tel Aviv and Ramallah, its campaigns
have attracted over 650,000 signatories with over 300,000 Israelis and
Palestinians each. They train youth leaders to prepare them for public
life, and campaign with a vigour at election times that Western
politicians can only watch enviously. OneVoice Israel’s election
campaign, Israel 2013, comprised events across the country to highlight
the 
<?notus-xml column=424?>importance of electing politicians who were committed to the two-state
solution. I am sure that when the election result is analysed in full

Palestine is at the forefront of peaceful opposition to illegal
settlement activity, given that there are over 600,000 Israeli settlers
living in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank—nearly 10%
of Israeli Jews in total. I have been in parts of Area C and witnessed
how Israel’s annexation policy works in terms of closing off an
area of agricultural land, after some time declaring it uncultivated
and then expropriating it for settlements. To counter this, in February
2012 OneVoice Palestine brought around 150 Palestinian youths to plant
dozens of trees and Palestinian flags in a barren area east of
Bethlehem that was under threat of confiscation by Israeli military
order.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020761000424" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000424">One of
the greatest obstacles to genuine collaboration between the two
communities is the difficulty of a common language. Unless both sides
speak English, the barrier of Hebrew and Arabic keeps them apart, so
these movements tend to be dominated by the better educated elites on
both sides. However, they find ways to reach beyond their own
socioeconomic class into the wider public. In April last year, OneVoice
Palestine youth activists released hundreds of helium balloons along
the 1967 line bearing the text in Hebrew of the 2002 Arab peace
initiative. In marking the 10th anniversary of the peace
initiative in this manner, they ensured that while Israeli media might
not mark the event, their actions and the coverage of it made it more

violence through emphasising rights and the rule of law is fundamental
to raising awareness of the implications of harming a civilian

orders of soldiers, and should not be viewed as having committed a
crime. The importance of using the law in a democratic society to

more organisations on both sides of the divide, but in the minutes I
have left I will concentrate on some of the obstacles faced by civil
society groups in mobilising for peace in such difficult circumstances.
The first is the tendency on the part of donors, both on the ground and
outside Israel and Palestine, to be deeply risk-averse. Stringent donor
requirements result in a tendency on the part of NGOs to work with the
converted rather than to work with these on the fringes: the
extremists. It is for foreign donors to take the lead on this, and to
provide funding that is less reliant on the “tabloid
test” of what the headline will say if it transpires that we
“backed” a terrorist. If we are to make a difference on
the ground, we will have to take risks to support those who may appear
extremist but who have sufficient leverage to be change-makers within
their communities. Will my noble friend the Minister reflect on
that?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000429" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000429">A more
specific constraint is the legal difficulty of establishing a joint
structure when working in two parallel jurisdictions. Most NGOs have to
have two separate structures. Travel between the Palestinian
territories and Jerusalem is very difficult indeed. I have spoken to
scores of OneVoice activists who told me how difficult face-to-face
contact was between the two sides. If the idea is to break down
barriers through personal contact, then the test of the state’s
commitment to peace has to be judged by its ability to facilitate
people-to-people contact. What efforts are under way in discussions
between the Israeli and Palestinian Governments to allow for these
joint organisations to operate as a single legal
entity?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000430" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000430">Finally,

Sheikh:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Falkner for
securing this debate. Achieving lasting peace between Israel and
Palestine remains a significant priority for the international
community. I am a believer in arriving at a two-state solution, whereby
Israel has a guarantee of security and nationhood but in return must
ensure that Arabs are fairly treated and have full
independence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000433" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000433">I
have visited both Israel and the West Bank with a cross-party group of
parliamentarians. While in Ramallah, we had a meeting with Prime
Minister Salam Fayyad of the West Bank and with other Arab leaders. We
also spent the best part of a day in discussions with an 
<?notus-xml column=426?>Israeli army officer and senior officials in the Israeli Foreign
Ministry. We wanted to hear points of view on both sides. The
Palestinians have achieved a great deal in strengthening the

be alone in thanking the noble Baroness for having introduced this
debate. Her commitment on this issue is second to none. Last week, I
was in Gaza, heading up an international mission from the IPU. Our task
is to try to draw representatives of the people in Gaza, the Occupied
Territories, the West Bank and Israel into more active dialogue so that
one can build up a context in which leaders are able to take necessary
action. It would be quite wrong for me to report in detail because we
must wait until we have visited the other territories, which we hope to
do next month. Of course, our talks with Israel will be every bit as

think I can say one or two things from a recent visit about the
situation as I saw it, some of which has been put before the House
before. In every aspect of what I am about to say, the role of civil
society is obvious. You cannot build a strong democracy or a strong
future without a strong, thriving civil society. That places a huge
responsibility on civil society in our own country to get into
partnership in that building of the role of the civil societies and the
dynamic of
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:00:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000442" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000442">I
start with water. Some 95% of the water in Gaza is not fit for human
consumption. Noble Lords should think of the voluntary and other
agencies in this country that operate in the sphere of water; WaterAid
springs to mind. Organisations like that have a tremendous role to play
in working with the local community to put that right. It will not be
put right, however, until the strategic dimensions of water can be
tackled. It is an alarming thought that, within two or three years, the
aquifer will break down totally because of shortages of the necessary
spare

saw the overcrowded schools and the wonderful, happy—it has to
be said—and neatly dressed children going to and from school.
There are great things to be done in building partnerships between
schools here and schools there, if only they could get on with it.
There are 700,000 people out of a total population of 1.7
million—to use the jargon—who are food insecure. That
means that they are dependent on handouts by UNRRA and the rest. It
became absolutely clear that the population does not want to be
dependent; it wants to build a strong economy, and that is what it
cannot do in the present situation. People have said, “Has there
been no improvement on the supply of goods through the blockade since
the ceasefire was negotiated last November?”. I have a good deal
of sympathy with people who said to me, “Wait a minute, do not
start looking at the tactics. The principle is that 
<?notus-xml column=428?>somebody else has a hand on the tap and we are not able freely to get
access to everything we need to build a balanced economy. We are not
getting everything we need but we want to get on with the
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:02:47"></hs_TimeCode>.”.
There is plenty of evidence, even if you look at it very briefly, of
people trying desperately hard to do constructive things for their

that is
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:02:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000444" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000444">I
conclude by saying on a wider level, because I think I should share
this with the House, that I was certainly encouraged by what I had not
altogether expected: a lot of positive talk about coming together with
Fatah and the people of the West Bank and the Occupied Territories.
There really seems to be some hope that the talks that are currently
getting under way, with thanks to Egypt for its assistance, can be
fruitful. If we are going to do that, of course, there has to be a
serious and positive response from the world by saying that these talks
desperately matter in providing the context in which progress can be
achieved.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_07_PT_1/6F1AF484578DB84A743E21CE935E0BBE8A799156" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 February 2013">Thursday,

Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lady
Falkner asks an important Question. Civil society certainly has a role
in promoting peace in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. However, real and
elusive peace can only be reached by the Israeli Government and the
Palestinians sitting down at the negotiating table without any
preconditions. Civil society can pave the way but is not of itself a
solution. Civil society groups offer Israelis and Palestinians a focus
of identity and a catalyst for empowerment on efforts for peace and
coexistence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T16:04:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
Their activity is a vital part of encouraging their respective
societies to engage in renewed negotiations towards a two-state
solution.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020761000446" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000446">The
effectiveness and prominence of civil society groups is very much
contingent upon the political environment. As a free and open
democracy, Israeli civil society organisations are able to operate in a
wide range of fields, including those very critical of Israeli
government policy. However, it must be said that the lack of freedoms
in the Palestinian territories and the political atmosphere make it
harder for pro two-state organisations to operate there.</hs_para>

other noble Lords, and I am sure we will hear more, about the position
in Gaza, so perhaps I will concentrate on the Israeli part
here—other than to say that my perception of Hamas is that it
appears to have suppressed the development of civil society in Gaza by
closing down NGOs, voluntary groups and charities which are deemed
critical of Hamas rule. If you agree with Hamas, the situation is fine,
but it has castigated those organisations that support normalisation
with Israel. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, commented on water, which is an
incredibly important subject. The way forward on that issue is to
secure peace with Israel and to build desalination plants, organised by
Israel, on the waterfront of Gaza. Israel is now getting vast amounts
of its water from desalination.</hs_para>

peace initiatives are bolstered by Israel’s domestic civil
society and by those who are working to spread a culture of peace. In
addition, the democratic political environment, including freedom 
<?notus-xml column=429?>of speech and of the press, helps to foster a vibrant Israeli civil
society. We have seen this in the recent Israeli elections. By my

for freedom of speech and a diverse and free media.
Israelis—Jew, Arab, Christian or whatever else they
are—can disagree with the Government and still live freely. The
country has 13 daily newspapers, at least 90 weekly
newspapers, more than 250 periodicals and numerous internet news sites,
many of them popular internationally. All are privately owned and
managed. Among any three Israelis you will probably find at least four
newspapers. In addition, there are no government restrictions on
academic freedom or cultural events in Israel. What other countries in
the region could host the gay pride celebrations?</hs_para>

diverse country. While over 70% of Israelis are Jewish, they come from
across the world. Approximately half of Israel’s citizens today
were born outside the country. In addition, Israel is home to Arab
Muslims, Christians, Druze and Samaritans, as well as other religious
and ethnic minority groups. What other country in the region allows
such diversity? However, there is room for improvement. Minorities in
every country, including our own, suffer discrimination and exclusion.
Arab Israelis have served as elected representatives of the Knesset
since Israel was founded and were elected in the recent election. They
also serve on Israel’s powerful Supreme Court, which a noble
Lord mentioned previously. However, despite equality in the law,
socioeconomic gaps remain—an issue which the Government of
Israel, together with numerous Israeli civil society organisations, are
rightly seeking to tackle. More needs to be done.</hs_para>

which is relevant to previous comments. Hand in Hand runs a network of
four bilingual Arabic/Hebrew schools that serve more than 800 Israeli
Arab and Israeli Jewish students in Jerusalem, the Galilee, Wadi Ara

each classroom is taught by both Arab and Jewish

the short time available, one cannot deal with all the things in civil
society within the region. Civil society plays an incredible part in
creating the right climate both in Israel and in the Palestinian

are going to foster those civil societies on either side of the border.
I hope that my noble friend will also say that, ultimately, there is no
substitute for the two sides sitting down at the negotiating table
without preconditions. I hope that the current Obama Administration,
with this country and the EU, will foster those

Bew:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner of

Lady Falkner, made the point that 2013 marks the 20th anniversary of
the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations for a final status accord. The 
<?notus-xml column=430?>happy future that seemed to beckon in Washington in September 1993 has
not come about. I want to make a point about this drawn from the Irish
experience. The logic that nothing is agreed until everything is
agreed, which successfully underpinned the Irish process, cannot apply
in this more difficult case, in part because the Middle East is awash
with selfish strategic interest of great powers, while Ireland,
frankly, was not; and in part because of the level of hatred involved,
which makes the good work which goes on in civil society even more
important. A very recent example which has come to light is Mohamed
Morsi denying humanity to Jews and talking about them as descendents of
apes and dogs. I am well aware that things have been said by Israeli
leaders which would have been better left unsaid. However, I recall no
such language, despite the bitterness, in the Irish case. We are
dealing with something qualitatively different here, and it means that
a different process is required. The lesson from the failures and
disappointments of the last 20 years is that the concept that nothing
is agreed until everything is agreed is probably suitable in one case,
but not in another. Instead, we should be looking for incremental and
indeed in some cases unilateral steps towards peace; that is, of
course, what makes today’s debate particularly
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000455" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000455">As
has been remarked, Israel has an active and vibrant civil society. I
want to mention and praise in particular NGOs such as the Alliance for
Middle East Peace, which represents 70 leading NGOs that work to
promote reconciliation; the Peres Centre for Peace; and of course those
many groups and think tanks which focus on the possibilities for
enhanced economic co-operation. On this subject, I particularly commend
the ICSR Atkin series paper by Oday Abukaresh, which is included in the
Library’s very helpful briefing pack for this debate. All of
this work helps to explain why, despite the tensions and the frequent,
bitter tides of public opinion, the latest poll for the Abraham Centre
shows that 67% of Israelis support a two-state solution. This is in
part due to the work of so many in civil society to promote a more
complex understanding.</hs_para>

one possible, very simple area for enhanced co-operation. This was
suggested by another Atkin Fellow, Gil Messing, in a recent paper. He
points out that an earthquake in the West Bank, for example, would
affect both Israelis and Palestinians. Joint drills and exercises would
be beneficial to both sides. Israel has significant experience here,
especially with fire marshals, earthquake awareness, and flooding, and
it should share some of this knowledge with the very disadvantaged
Palestinian emergency personnel. This may seem to be a small example,
but these small examples which stress the common humanity—unlike
some of the language which I referred to earlier—are of
particular
importance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000457" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000457">At
the beginning I talked about the ways in which the path to peace is
unfortunately more difficult. I remember how, in 1993, we in Northern
Ireland were lectured on the lines of, “Look, Middle East peace
is about to happen and you can’t get your act together”.
Unfortunately, the path to peace in the Middle East is significantly
more difficult, for very hard reasons. However, one analogy between the
two processes holds. There was only one possible constitutional
settlement 
<?notus-xml column=431?>to the Irish question: namely, power-sharing plus an Irish dimension. At
various times people said that it was dying or gone, that the unionists
were too angry to permit it now that such and such had happened, or
that the nationalists’ ambitions had gone too far and they would
accept only something more radical. In the end we returned to what the
human mind knew to be the only possible, logical compromise. In this
respect this is also the case with the Middle East. The only possible,
logical compromise that preserves the interests of both sides is a
two-state solution. That is why the work of these groups in civil
society that we talked about today is so

should be increased. Alas, these schools have not been welcomed by all
citizens in Israel. Last February, their school in Jerusalem was
vandalised by extremist settlers, as was a school building in Neve

<?notus-xml column=435?>experience. Since then, the illegal settlements in the West Bank have

However, despite these tender green shoots, we see little real
progress. That is why I congratulate my noble friend Lady Falkner on
securing this debate and allowing us to explore the possibility of a
solution that is enforced not from the top down but by civil society in
Israel and Palestine getting together and insisting that their
representatives do things differently. UNESCO has done sterling work in
this area over the past 10 years, looking at the willingness

it is a fairly unusual suggestion, I ask quite seriously whether it

inviting representatives from groups in Israel and Palestine as well as
from our own Jewish and Palestinian diasporas in this country. My
suggestions for invitations would of course include organisations such
as B’Tselem, Adalah and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel that
work for human rights in the Occupied Territories and within Israel.
There is a long list of organisations doing sterling work in both
countries. The three great religions must be represented, and perhaps
we could make amends for the appalling way in which the Arab Israeli
Sheikh Raed Salah was treated, on the advice of the Community Security
Trust alone, when he came on a lecture tour in this country. He is the
leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel and had wanted to highlight
the difficulties for the Muslim and Christian citizens of Israel and
the discrimination that they suffer in education, property rights and
healthcare. He knows civil society in Israel, whether you approve of

which was affecting business investment and their activities in the

united in willing peace in the world, whether it be in Israel,
Palestine, Syria, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, and also Pakistan,

contribution can and is being made by NGOs and the civil population?
Are there instances when NGOs fan the flames rather than promote peace?
Peace will come when Palestinian refugees are treated like other
refugees in the world. Why are they kept in the state they are in,
unlike the millions displaced at the end of World War Two, for example,
from Pakistan, Cyprus, India, Germany and Jews from Arab countries? The
NGO that militates against peace is the UN Relief and Works
Agency—UNRWA. To an outsider, UNRWA seems a humanitarian group
helping Palestinian refugees. In reality, it undermines the chances of
Arab-Israeli peace and holds Palestinians back from rebuilding their
lives. It was set up to take care of the Arabs of the British Mandate.
It began with some 700,000 charges and now has more than 5 million. It
perpetuates their refugee status, unlike the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees that takes care of 50 million refugees with half the budget of
UNRWA.</hs_para>

issue is that UNRWA counts as refugees not only those displaced in
1946-8 but their descendants down to the fourth generation, including
many who have never—and whose ancestors never—set foot in
Israel and who are not in need. There are actually only 30,000 refugees
properly defined under the UN definition of a refugee. The UN
definition specifically excludes any person who has acquired a new
nationality. UNRWA is the only refugee organisation in the world that
considers citizens of another state to be refugees, and includes all
descendants of original male refugees. On that basis, there will be a
lot of refugees sitting in this House.</hs_para>

UNRWA does not push for citizenship in the host countries of others.
Its budget is $1.23 billion over two years—98% of which comes
from Europe, 
<?notus-xml column=438?>the US and Canada, while the oil states give only 2%. It has
become an industry in itself, with 29,000 employees, overwhelmingly
Palestinians, while the UNHCR has a mere 7,600 employees. There is one
worker for every 157 Palestinian refugees. It needs reform. By limiting
its largesse to those in need it should ensure that it is not partisan
and that the children in its schools get a balanced and
discrimination-free education and are not taught to hate Israelis and
to glorify terrorism and suicide bombings. It should accept, and teach
children to accept, the right of self-determination for all people,
Israelis as well as Palestinians. In fact, UNRWA’s functions
would be better transferred to other UN agencies and to the Palestinian
Authority and it would be better if it were
dissolved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020761000497" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-0002.htm#13020761000497">I

way she does in part because the lessons learnt from the Holocaust were
that she can never rely on the armed strength or support of others.

USAID and UNRWA, with the aim of producing innovative new solutions for

held annually here in London under the auspices of the Next Century

from the West, who all enjoy each other’s company. I believe the

society across the divide in the Middle East conflict; I am gratified

peaceful harmony, just as not every charity is charitable to everyone
in the society in which they operate. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech,
referred to those who fuel the flames. There are civil organisations
that fuel the flames on both sides, as we are aware—the
extremist settler organisations and some of the more extreme
organisations, particularly in Gaza. Therefore, we are talking about
enlightened

Secretary of State will be going to Israel and to the Occupied
Palestinian Territories. We want to see intergovernmental negotiation
back on track. However, fostering peace is impossible without a society

taken important steps to support such organisations, including
contracting funds to various organisations that monitor settlement
expansion and continue to work with the Israeli legal system and law
enforcement authorities to reduce illegal settlement activity and

Advocate-General for Scotland (Lord Wallace of
Tankerness):</Member></B> My Lords, the Scotland Act 2012 makes
provision for a new route of appeal to the Supreme Court for
compatibility issues. As noble Lords may recall from our debates on the
Scotland Bill, compatibility issues are questions raised in Scottish
criminal proceedings about European Convention on Human Rights issues
and European Union law issues. These would previously have been
devolution issues. The Scotland Act 2012 also makes provision for
compatibility issues to be referred to the Supreme Court in certain
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000003">The
draft order is made under Section 42 of the 2012 Act, which allows for
provision to be made that is consequential on the Scotland Act 2012.
The draft order makes consequential amendments to legislation to ensure
that compatibility issues are properly taken account of in the criminal
justice system. The draft order is subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure because it makes amendments to an Act of the UK
Parliament and an Act of the Scottish Parliament, and it is usual for
such amendments to be subject to the affirmative procedure.</hs_para>

the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 to enable criminal legal aid to be
provided in relation to compatibility issues. Section 21 sets out the
meaning of “criminal legal aid” for the purposes of the
Act and this includes appeals and references to the Supreme Court of
devolution issues raised in Scottish criminal proceedings. The draft
order amends Section 21 so that criminal legal aid also
includes appeals and references to the Supreme Court of compatibility
issues.</hs_para>

Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 makes provision for criminal legal aid in
connection with appeals and references to the Supreme Court in respect
of devolution issues raised in Scottish criminal proceedings. The draft
order amends Section 25AB so that it also makes provision for criminal
legal aid in connection with references and appeals to the Supreme
Court in respect of compatibility
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000006">The
draft order also amends the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland)
Act 2010. Sections 132 to 140 of this Act make provision for the
disclosure of information by the prosecutor where a person convicted of
an offence seeks to appeal against any aspect of that 
<?notus-xml column=84?>conviction. The draft order amends Section 132 so that the definition of
appellate proceedings includes an appeal to the Supreme Court against
the determination of a compatibility issue. This ensures that appeals
in respect of compatibility issues will be treated in the same way as
appeals of devolution issues in criminal proceedings for the purpose of
disclosure of information by the prosecutor. The draft order, if
approved by each House of Parliament, will come into force on
22 April 2013—the same day as the other orders
relating to compatibility issues.</hs_para>

perhaps worth mentioning that other consequential amendments are needed
in relation to compatibility issues, but as these amend secondary
legislation they are subject to the negative resolution procedure and
are included in the Scotland Act 2012 (Transitional and Consequential
Provisions) Order 2013. This order has been considered by the Joint
Committee on Statutory Instruments, which made no comment on
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000008">Transitional
provision—that is, provisions that are not included in the draft
order that we are debating—has been made in respect of
compatibility issues to ensure that the provisions of the 2012 Act take
effect as quickly as possible. This will prevent two different criminal
appeals systems operating in Scotland for a lengthy period and allow
the benefits of the new system to take effect as quickly as possible.
The transitional order achieves its aim by converting devolution issues
relating to ECHR or EU matters in criminal proceedings that have been
raised before 22 April 2103 into compatibility issues. The proceedings
will then continue under the new compatibility issue
procedure.</hs_para>

also makes amendments that impose a time limit of 28 days on applying
for permission to appeal a compatibility issue or a devolution issue in
criminal proceedings to the Supreme Court. An application for
permission must be made within  28 days of the date of the High
Court’s determination. If that permission is refused, an
application to the Supreme Court for permission must be made within 28
days of the High Court’s refusal. Both limits may be extended by
the respective courts, where this is equitable given all the
circumstances.</hs_para>

provisions—not included in this order—have been made in
respect of existing devolution cases in criminal cases where there is a
right of appeal. The time limit of 28 days will apply from 22 April
this year, as opposed to the date on which the devolution issue was
determined or when permission to appeal was refused.</hs_para>

the arrangements with various bodies including the Supreme Court, the
Crown Office, the Law Society of Scotland, the Faculty of Advocates,
the Society of Solicitor Advocates and the Scottish Legal Aid Board.
Both Governments are working together to publicise the transitional

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (Lord De Mauley):</Member></B> My Lords, these
regulations are principally to transpose in England and Wales the
industrial emissions directive. It is not a completely new directive.
It recasts seven current directives into a single one about regulating
emissions from various industrial activities. It therefore provides a
welcome simplification of EU legislation.</hs_para>

in some cases clarifies or strengthens the provisions of the component
directives. Like the component directives, it aims, through a
permitting system, to achieve a high level of protection for the
environment taken as a whole. That is  consistent with our
belief that we need to improve the environment for future generations,
make our economy 
<?notus-xml column=86?>more environmentally sustainable and improve our quality of life and
well-being. The directive applies to some 10,000 industrial
installations in England and Wales, ranging from power stations to
intensive pig farms and from waste incinerators to dry cleaners. Nearly
all are already subject to one or more of the component
directives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000017">The
directive contains provisions to improve the implementation of current
controls on a range of industrial activities where appropriate,
particularly through better development and application of best
available techniques, known as BAT. The concept of BAT is founded on
the need for the techniques to be both technically and economically
viable in the industry sector concerned.</hs_para>

only relatively small and justifiable additions to the range of
industrial installations covered by the directive. Reflecting
productive UK input during negotiation, the directive reflects UK
practice in respect of risk-based inspections and site monitoring. For
the same reason, it also contains important optional time-limited
transitional provisions regarding control of emissions from large
combustion plants—notably those in the electricity generating
sector. These should assist the UK in managing the transition to
low-carbon power generation while maintaining security of electricity
supplies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000019">The
directive also covers waste incineration plants and a wide range of
activities in which volatile organic solvents are used. Its
requirements in those respects are virtually unchanged from those in
the component directives. In both cases, we have taken the opportunity
in England to ensure that only those requirements will be
applied.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020754000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000020">We
also considered whether, for installations subject only to the
directive’s controls on solvent emissions, we should take the
directive’s option of requiring only registration rather than
permitting. Consultation showed little support for that and so we have
not done so. However, we continue to explore with the local authority
regulators how further simplification can be made in the current
permitting requirements and the associated compliance assessment
procedures. That exploration will include further review of the case
for a registration system. If a case is found, we will further amend
the regulations at the first available opportunity.</hs_para>

derogation allows a single permit to cover several operators. While
this may be of use elsewhere in Europe, consultees in England and Wales

transpose it but, again, we would amend the regulations if businesses
were to demonstrate to us that a single permit for several operators
would be of significant practical
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000022">I

directives are currently transposed through the Environmental
Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. They transpose not
only  the component directives but a wide range of other
environmental directives in a way that standardises, as 
<?notus-xml column=87?>far as possible, the mechanics of permitting, compliance assessment and
enforcement. The regulations before the Committee therefore amend those
regulations so as to transpose the industrial emissions directive.
Within that framework, we continue to look for ways in which
administrative burdens on operators subject to the directive can be
reduced. In particular, regulators continue to develop simplified
arrangements for permitting, compliance monitoring, data reporting and
charging for permits.</hs_para>

Opposition obviously support the notion that we should take a set of
regulations and try to bring them together under a single overarching

in the past and will seek to do in the future. Certainly, as the impact

to infraction and the probability of heavy daily fines for failure to

adopted of consulting properly on how the transposition is taking

important but, I am sure, easily answered question, which may well be
obvious and I have just not been able to pick it up, is about the costs
that are shown in the impact assessment, which are clearly significant.
My assumption is that they are not costs additional to those implied in
the existing regulations but a summary of the cost of the regulation as
a result of transposition. If I am wrong, and these are costs or
savings that are as a result of transposition, that would be a useful
clarification for me if nothing else.</hs_para>

questions, both of which I think were asked in the other place when
these regulations were debated this morning. First, the regulations
seek new, optional provisions for large combustion plants. Is it the
case that without this provision there may be difficulty in maintaining
security of supply? Those who are monitoring this will be concerned
about security of supply. Secondly, on the issue of air standards, this
is a useful opportunity to ask what progress has been made in reaching
full compliance with European air quality standards and what role will
this permitting regime play in helping the Government to achieve
that?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000031">My final
comment is that in the Explanatory Memorandum, which is to make things
clearer, the wonderful word “otiose” is used, which was
also used by the Minister in his opening remarks.
“Otiose” is a great word and it has a very specific
meaning. It is arguable that it is not in common parlance and some
people might want that word explained. So, in passing, I say that I am
just interested in the use of that word and whether there is clearer
English, but it is not a substantive point. On that basis, I look
forward to hearing the Minister’s
response.</hs_para>

the amendments necessary to transpose an EU directive which, in
recasting seven into one, is largely a
simplification. The alternative would have been yet another set of
freestanding regulations obscuring the continuity of the regulatory
requirements that the industrial emissions directive requires.
Implementation of the directive’s requirements will
correspondingly be in continuity with current arrangements for the
permitting, inspection and compliance assessment of the installations
it covers. For those installations subject to integrated pollution
prevention and control, the concept of best available techniques and
the consequences for periodic permit review is already well established
and should  
<?notus-xml column=89?>hold no surprises. By definition, best available techniques cannot
remain static. By that same definition, they have to be technically and
economically viable. It is for industry to contribute the information
which, ultimately, only it can provide in order to ensure that

answer to the noble Lord’s first question, all derogations have
been utilised, except for two cases where industry and regulators
called strongly to keep the current UK systems in place. The
consultation indicated that one derogation that would allow solvent
emission activities to be registered rather than permitted might
increase the regulatory burden rather than reduce it. Consultees could
see no practical benefit in another derogation allowing one permit to
cover multiple sites and operators. As I intimated in my opening
speech, in both cases we would further amend the regulations to provide
the derogation if a need were subsequently

noble Lord asked when we would publish guidance on the directive. In
relation to activities subject to integrated pollution prevention and

noble Lord asked a specific question about costs. The answer is that it
refers to the costs additional to the current regulations. He asked how
one is to know that the large combustion plant and power station
provisions will not erode security of electricity supply. The
provisions were negotiated on the basis of significant input from the
industry and the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The
indications were that the operational flexibilities that we gained

asked a question about air quality. The directive addresses pollutant
emissions to air from industry and will contribute to maintenance and
improvement of air quality, particularly in respect of nitrogen oxides
and particulate matter. However, industry is not the only source of
these pollutants. In 2010, industry accounted for some 43% of emissions
of nitrogen oxides in England, while transport sources accounted for
some 45%. For particulate matter, industry accounted for some 31% and

growth is ultimately dependent on a healthy natural environment. The
directive is about environmental protection and so is key in this
regard. In transposing the directive, these regulations will play a
significant part in nurturing that dependency. We look to the
regulators to use to the full the proportionate approach that the
regulations allow, and we look to industry to respond creatively. We
look forward to the growth and further environmental improvement that

noble Lords will be aware, since we took office, the coalition
Government have prioritised the protection of council taxpayers.
Council tax more than doubled between 1997 and 2010, and this
Government have worked with local authorities to give council tax
payers a break. We have put in place three council tax freeze schemes
that have provided real help with the cost of living. The latest scheme
potentially represents a real-terms council tax cut of around 2.5% in
2013-14. The Government encourage all authorities to take up the grant
that we are offering and freeze their council tax once
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:25:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000043">As
we promised in the coalition <I>Programme for Government</I>, we have
abolished the old centralised system of council tax capping and
established council tax referenda, so that voters could have the final
say on any excessive increases. Following the Localism Act, a number of
regulations were put in place to set out the processes that local
authorities must follow if they set an excessive increase. The most
substantive of these regulations are the Local Authorities (Conduct of
Referendums) (Council Tax Increases) (England) (Regulations) 2012,
which this Committee considered early last year. Both Houses approved
the regulations. However, noble Lords will be aware that in preparing
those regulations we were unfortunately unable to completely agree the
wording of the referendum question with the Electoral Commission in
time for the 2012-13 round of council tax setting. The Electoral
Commission briefed Members of both Houses on their concerns about
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000044">During
the debate on 14 February 2012, my noble friend Lady Hanham gave an
undertaking that the Government would continue to work with the
Electoral Commission and come forward with revised wording for the
referendum question to be used in 2013-14. The House agreed that the
regulations should be approved on this basis to protect council tax
payers by not allowing referenda to go unregulated.</hs_para>

no council tax referenda were held in the financial year 2012-13.
Accordingly, no referenda have been held using the wording of the 
<?notus-xml column=91?>question that we now propose to amend. My honourable friend, the then
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Bob Neill, subsequently wrote
to Jenny Watson, the chairman of the Electoral Commission, proposing a
revised version of the referendum question. The revised version removes
the phrase “do you agree”, which the commission had
concerns about. The revised question also asks voters if they want
their council tax to be at the level that has been set, with a clear
indication that a “no” vote will result in a lower amount
being set. This change removes any possible ambiguity about a
voter’s liability for a council tax bill they have received
prior to the referendum being held.</hs_para>

the commission confirmed that it was content with the suggested
wording. I would like to place on record my thanks to the Electoral
Commission for its highly constructive and timely approach to this
work, and its sensitivity to concerns. In signalling its agreement to
the revised question, the Electoral Commission repeated wider concerns
about the complexity of council tax referenda and the need for
government to ensure that timely information is provided to voters who
take part in a referendum. We remain content that the multiple
provisions relating to the provision of information set out in the
lengthy 2012 regulations are sufficient and we are not minded to pursue
any changes.</hs_para>

commission’s views very seriously and remain in dialogue with it
through various cross-Whitehall fora, and will discuss the scope for an
appraisal of the voter experience if and when a referendum is
triggered. The revised council tax referendum question needs to be in
place before the current round of local authority council tax setting
is completed. The final referendum threshold will be put to the House
for approval alongside the final local government finance settlement on
13 February. All local authorities must have set their council tax by
11 March.</hs_para>

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the Government on
accepting the advice of the Electoral Commission. Certainly, it is
sensible to adopt the new wording although, as the Minister pointed
out, there are other recommendations that the Electoral Commission made
concerning how to promote interest in and understanding of the issue
should a referendum take place. I note from the Government’s
response and the noble Lord’s remarks that the Government will
continue to work with the commission—and, I hope, the Local
Government Association—about how that might be
effected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:30:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

ridiculously short in most cases between a council’s final
budget decision—even after, as is the case in many authorities,
months of consultation about their financial situation—and the
date on which the referendum has to take place. It is less than two
months—normally it is about six weeks—between
the  
<?notus-xml column=92?>final date for making a budget and a referendum. That is a difficult
timescale and the Government need to look at how people might best be
informed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:31:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000051">However,
the principle of a referendum is extremely questionable. The Minister
makes a virtue of the fact that the Government have facilitated a
council tax freeze. That generosity would be more welcome if it had not
been financed by topslicing the local government grant in the first
place so that, in effect, money that would have come to local
government is still coming but only for this particular purpose. It
creates problems for local authorities because while the council tax is
frozen, the base revenue budget is also in effect frozen. There is a
growing gap between the council’s expenditure and its base
budget and, as the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, pointed out in a debate
the other week, this can and will ultimately cause greater problems.
However, we are where we
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:32:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000052">I
would like to ask a question—not about the levying authorities,
which were dealt with in the Secretary of State’s Written
Statement last week; I understand the position about that even though I
do not necessarily go along with the whole argument—in relation
to the police commissioners’ right to impose a levy because
they, unlike other bodies, are not effectively accountable to local
authorities. The regulations will place the precepting authority in the
frame, so to speak, of the referendum question and that might be
thought to be enough. However, I doubt it will be because the levy will
be collected via the council tax and that needs to be made clear to
people. It needs to be made clearer even than perhaps baldly stating in
the referendum question that this element, if it is in excess of
2%—I know of at least one police commissioner who is proposing a
3.5% increase in the levy—is not the responsibility of the
council that collects the tax and sends out the bills. That matter
ought to be addressed in more detail in the course of the review that
will, no doubt, go
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:33:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000053">There
is more to the recent debate about council tax referenda than these
technical matters. Recently the Secretary of State came out with an
extraordinary threat to penalise councils which opt to increase council
tax below the Government’s imposed limit of 2%, above which a
referendum would be required. The Secretary of State has accused
councils which refuse to increase council tax by less than 2%—I
refer to that document of record, the <I>Daily Mail</I>, for the
remarks that he made—as being “democracy dodgers”
by creeping under the radar and cheating their taxpayers. Of course,
the councils would simply be applying the law and the system he pushed
through and, indeed, levying a council tax increase below that which
would trigger a
referendum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:34:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000054">This
is remarkable. My noble friend Lord Smith inquired of me whether the
Secretary of State for Transport might say that people caught
travelling—it is perhaps timely to mention such
matters—at 69 miles an hour should nevertheless be deemed to be
breaking the law because it is under the speed limit. What the
Secretary of State is saying is that councils which levy council tax
increases below 2% are somehow creeping under the radar and cheating
their taxpayers. This is an appalling statement. It also ignores the
fact that councillors remain accountable for their decisions through 
<?notus-xml column=93?>the ballot box at local elections. A referendum that he seeks
to impose is in his view somehow superior to
accountability through the ballot box at local elections. He does more
than criticise; he actually threatens to take into account decisions to
levy an increase below 2% and effectively claw it back or impose
tighter limits next year. Where is the justification for that
threat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:36:03"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000055">I
have to point out that the Government have sought no approval for their
swingeing increases in VAT or the devastating cuts in council tax
benefit, housing benefit and other welfare benefits which hit millions
of people and will cost many households a great deal more than a 2%
council tax increase, assuming that were being levied. In my authority,
which I think is not going to increase the levy, a 2% increase would
amount to something like £20 a year for 70% of the households in
Newcastle. I repeat that the council is not proposing to levy a 2%
increase. That pales into insignificance beside the amounts that those
households will lose in the benefits to which I have

enormous disappointment to him, as it was to all councillors, that a
Labour Opposition, having been committed to abolishing capping for all
its time in opposition, then spent 13 years in government failing to do
so. I do not want to get into too much of a semantic argument about
whether capping—which is effectively what it is—by the
Secretary of State, with a right of appeal to a referendum, is
qualitatively better than the situation that pertained before, but at
least there is some sort of
appeal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:38:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000061">I
think that most of us do not expect there to be a referendum. It incurs
considerable cost and there is uncertainty about the outcome; or
perhaps it will not happen because there is a view that there is too
much certainty about the outcome. Nevertheless, that appeal is there. I
say to those authorities—probably mostly 
<?notus-xml column=94?>Labour-controlled now—that if they feel strongly that the cuts
they are having to make in the budget are too great, too painful and
not in the public interest, perhaps they should consider having the
courage to hold a referendum and test the will of the people. It is not
a system I like or would want. I would be very pleased to see it go.
However, as the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, said, we are where we are.
That is what Parliament has legislated for and that opportunity is
there. Therefore, if authorities feel strongly that they are in that
position, I urge them to trust the people and take the risk—it
is a considerable risk—of holding a
referendum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:39:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000062">As
the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, said, the timescale for being able to do
this is incredibly tight and very difficult. I hope that I shall never
be in this position but I am very unclear as to what local authorities
will be able to do if and when they have a referendum. What are local
authorities able to say in putting a case to the electorate on why they
are having the referendum and what the arguments are? I am not clear
about what role the Government will take. It is too late to say, after
the event, that you should not have done this. Before they enter into
the referendum, local authorities need clarity on what they are and are
not allowed to do. Needless to say, political parties—as
distinct from local authorities—are free, within the law, to say
what they wish in support of whichever view they want to take on the
referendum. We need much greater clarity about what local authorities
can do, especially given that the timescale is so short. The wide
expectation that there will not actually be any referenda has made
people a bit complacent in providing that detail. That is wrong: we
need more
detail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000063">Secondly,
what would the Government’s role be, should there be such a
referendum? I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, that we are
already seeing local authorities of two political persuasions being
lambasted by the Secretary of State and Ministers and described as
“democracy dodgers” for staying precisely within the law.
If we believe in localism, as all of us in this room do, what role is
it of the Secretary of State and Ministers to be writing letters to
local papers and issuing press releases, attacking a local authority
for using its best judgment to determine what
should be the council tax increase within the limit set by the
Secretary of State and entirely within the law? I ask this question
because I worry about whether, should a local authority be brave enough
to hold a referendum, the Government would come in on the side of a no
vote, or would act—as it should—in a strictly neutral way
and say nothing at all.</hs_para>

the proposed referendum question and the information available to

council tax freeze scheme in 2013-14 will, one hopes, make it unlikely
that there will be any referenda next year. However, if any authorities
choose to reject the freeze and go on to set an excessive increase, the
revised referendum question will ensure that voters are presented with
a clear an unambiguous choice around it. The principles around which
any excesses are dealt with are covered, and it is clear that any
setting of 
<?notus-xml column=96?>council tax above the 2% threshold would be subject to a referendum.
Those principles are quite clear. If a local authority was to proceed

a little over two years ago, this Government announced that they wished
to end the current system of business rates being centralised. That is
an ambition that those of us who have worked in local government have
heard many times over the years but, up to now, with no expectation of
it being achieved. With the passing of these regulations and others
which will follow shortly, we will start to deliver this particular
government intention and policy. It has been widely recognised in both
local government and business that the current rating system does not
provide an incentive for local authorities to support growth.
Currently, when a new business or development moves into an area and
generates extra business rates, that is passed on in full to central
government—never mind the fact that the local authority may have
to meet new costs associated with it. That is a system that has been
widely criticised and will end on 1 April; from then, under the new
business rates retention system, local authorities will retain 50% of
their local business rates income. If local government uses its
expertise and local knowledge to create a strong economic environment
and encourage development and new businesses into its area, it will be
able to share in the resulting growth in business
rates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:49:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T14:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000075">In
this House, we have had many opportunities to consider the new rates
retention scheme, particularly through the Local Government Finance Act
2012. That scrutiny allowed us to make a number of
amendments to the Bill to improve the operation of the rates 
<?notus-xml column=97?>retention system. In particular, on 10 October last year, we brought
forward a group of amendments to allow local government to use a
“collection fund” approach to rates retention. This is a
system that has been requested by local government. It is a system with
which it is familiar and that all people who have served in local
government know is used for council tax. The regulations we are
considering today implement that
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000076">Throughout
the development of the rates retention system, we have ensured that
local government has been fully consulted on the principles behind the
scheme and, importantly, its practical implementation. These
regulations were developed in partnership with experts in local
government and were published in draft for consultation last October.
This proved to be a valuable exercise and we are confident that as a
result the system will be workable. The rates retention regulations
implement the collection fund system. They will also ensure that local
authorities are fully funded for qualifying rate relief awarded in
enterprise
zones.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000077">I turn
first to the operation of the collection fund system. It provides
stability for local government budgets. This is because, under these
regulations, an estimate made by billing authorities of the coming
year’s rating income is used to fix the shares paid to major
precepting authorities and to be retained by the billing authority for
its own budget. These amounts do not change in the year, even if the
amount of rates collected changes. Thereby, authorities can plan with
certainty for the coming year.</hs_para>

for the year is unlikely to be perfect and we can expect the actual
amounts collected from ratepayers to be different. Under the collection
fund system, that will generate either a surplus or a deficit. Again to
provide financial stability that surplus or deficit will be rolled
forward into the calculations for future years. This avoids sudden
changes in a local authority’s budget.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020754000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000079">The rates retention
regulations also provide that the central share will be paid to central
government in 10 monthly instalments, in line with the
instalments of rates income paid by ratepayers to local government. The
same instalment schedule will be used for other payments to and from
central government in the rates retention system. The regulations also
offer that schedule for use between billing authorities and precepting
authorities, but we have ensured that, if they wish, they can agree
different arrangements.</hs_para>

of relief in enterprise zones. The regulations ensure that local
authorities are fully funded for qualifying rate relief in enterprise
zones, which will provide an important boost to economic growth across
the country. The Government have promised that ratepayers moving into
an enterprise zone before 1 April 2015 can receive up to five years of
rate relief, up to the state aid de minimis limit. However, under the
rates retention scheme, local authorities would normally have to share
in the cost of that relief. We have agreed that central government
should fund enterprise zone relief in full. Therefore, these
regulations allow local authorities to deduct from the share of rates
income they pay to central government their share of 
<?notus-xml column=98?>the cost of relief in enterprise zones. As a result, local authorities
will be no worse off financially from central government’s
policy of awarding rate relief in enterprise zones.</hs_para>

Local Government Finance Act 2012 (Consequential Amendments) Order
2013. These are technical amendments that, for want of a better term,
tidy up the draft regulations. They make a number of technical and
consequential changes to other legislation, where it refers to the
current system of redistributed non-domestic rates. The draft order
replaces those soon-to-be-obsolete terms with references to the new
rates retention system and locally retained non-domestic rates. The
order also makes technical changes to the way that authorities must
calculate their council tax requirements to ensure that these
calculations correctly reflect the rates retention scheme.</hs_para>

regulations will provide local authorities with in-year stability of
income from the rates retention scheme through the collection fund
system, and will ensure that local authorities are fully compensated
for the cost of qualifying rate relief in enterprise zones. They have
been discussed in detail with local government and utilise systems that
we know work well for council tax.</hs_para>

want to sound a slight note of warning about the arrangements for
enterprise zones. I very much welcome the provisions here, but we will
be returning at some later point to the safety net in terms of business
rates, which brings to mind the danger that businesses relocating into
the enterprise zone will be vacating premises that may stand vacant and
not produce a business rate income for the local authority, thereby
contributing to the amount—which at the moment stands at
7.5%—above which compensation will be paid. That is not so much
in relation to today’s regulations, I have to confess, but I
take the opportunity of drawing the Government’s attention to
the potential complexities to which these regulations might add and the
probable inequity of a limit set at that level. This is just a gentle
warning, but I think that in due course a committee will want to revert
to that issue. However, in relation to these two sets of regulations,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl

provision for three things: first, for local authorities to take
certain steps in the exercise of public health functions; secondly, the
making and recovering of charges in respect of certain steps taken by
local authorities in the exercise of their public health functions;
and, thirdly, a duty on certain providers of health and

the mandatory aspects of the regulations. Part 2 sets out certain steps
which must be taken by local authorities when exercising their own, or
the Secretary of State’s, public health functions. 
<?notus-xml column=100?>These include the provision of arrangements for weighing and measuring
children, health check assessments, sexual health services, a public

the regulations are primarily concerned with steps to be taken by a
local authority in the exercise of its own functions, in some cases the
regulations require the local authority to exercise a Secretary of
State public health function—for example, arranging
contraceptive services as part of local authority sexual health
services. Regulation 2 ensures that the authority can exercise the
Secretary of State’s ancillary powers to assist the delivery of
that function, for example, exercising the power to commission those
services from a third-party
provider.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000091">Regulation

authority director of public health, with Public Health England, to

Lords may find it helpful if I describe the context of these
regulations. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 gives upper tier and
unitary local authorities a new duty to take appropriate steps to
improve the health of their populations and certain other public health
functions. In general, the intention is to permit the greatest degree
of flexibility to local authorities to shape services to meet local
needs. But there will be certain circumstances where a greater degree
of uniformity is required—for example, where 
<?notus-xml column=101?>services must be provided in a universal fashion if they are to be
provided at all, or where certain steps are essential to the efficient
running of the new public health system.</hs_para>

to Part 3 of this instrument, Regulation 9 makes provision for a local
authority to make and recover charges in respect of certain steps taken
in the exercise of its duty as to health improvement. However, there
are some circumstances where it is legitimate for local authorities to
charge organisations—for example, for providing information and
advice to local employers—and the regulations permit charging in
such cases. The regulations also permit individuals to be charged for
services that do not have the purpose of improving their health. This
might include training in public health.</hs_para>

stress now that this regulation means that no individual can be charged
for steps taken to improve their health, nor will local authorities be
able to charge organisations or individuals for anything done in the
exercise of the mandatory functions under Part 2 of the regulations. We
have previously made clear our position on charging for health
services: there will be no new charges during the current Parliament.
Regulation 9 is entirely consistent with that commitment.</hs_para>

responsibility for it transfers to local authorities.
Conversely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-07T15:13:50"></hs_TimeCode>, the

the regulations covering entry and viewing by local Healthwatch
representatives, Part 4 imposes a duty on certain providers of health

enter premises where health and social care services are being provided
in order to observe activities and gather views from people who use
those services. This will enable local Healthwatch to feed back
evidence about the quality of care provided in a report with
recommendations to providers and commissioners about how the quality of

are clear that local Healthwatch is not an inspectorate. It does not
have the status of a regulator—that is the role of the Care

among service users or service providers as to the various roles and
responsibilities within the system. We are giving local Healthwatch a
role that is different from

have extended this role to local Healthwatch contractors in the

Willis of Knaresborough:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise in this packed
Chamber at this late hour to discuss these regulations. I say that
light-heartedly, but the raft of regulations going through the House as
a result of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 is incredibly
important. The fact that the regulations are being very effectively
scrutinised by this House demonstrates the commitment to getting the
implementation of the 2012 Act right, so my comments this afternoon on
behalf of the Liberal Democrats are meant to be helpful to the
Minister. I will do my
best.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000109">There is
significant support for these regulations, not least because there is
significant agreement among the political parties that the direction of
travel for local authorities to be at the heart of a renewed emphasis
on public health is absolutely right. It always struck me, as a former
council leader, as bizarre that I had responsibility for the efficient
collection and disposal of refuse but that protecting and promoting the
health of the people whom we represented was a peripheral activity.
Indeed, when the Government introduced the scrutiny committees,
supported by the Labour Party, 
<?notus-xml column=103?>they emphasised the importance of local politicians taking an interest
in health. That engagement—certainly for my local
area—was incredibly helpful and supportive. I regard this as the
next step. Local authorities should be involved in the scrutiny of
health, and most activities from economic generation to housing and
education are all part and parcel of improving public health; they are
not separate silos.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020754000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000110">Before I deal with some
of the specific regulations within this SI, I raise an issue which is
not in the regulations but which requires a response from the Minister.
I refer to public health research, and he will not be surprised that I
raise it. In some ways, public health research has gone under the
radar—I confess a lack of emphasis myself—yet if we are
to improve public health, and local authorities are going to be at the
heart of that agenda, it is crucial that research is part of it.
Traditionally, local authorities have not funded, nor have they been
responsible for research in public health. That resource has come from
the primary care trusts and SHAs.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020754000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000111">Currently, 187 public
health clinical academics with honorary contracts, and 26 academic
dentists with honorary NHS contracts are working in England. Of those,
56 clinical academics and four dentist academics are part or wholly
funded by PCTs and SHAs. However, that funding—some £15
million—has now been swept up by being transferred to the
Commissioning Board, which, as the Minister knows, does not have a
mandate to honour the honorary contracts determined by the Follett
principles. In fact, public health research is not in the Commissioning
Board’s mandate. That responsibility, rightly, lies with Public
Health England. Fifteen million pounds is of course a relatively small
sum—loose change to the Commissioning Board—but it is the
main source of funding for vital public health research which can be
commissioned by public health directors in local authorities. If we are
serious about local authorities commissioning research—and I
think that these regulations are serious about that
interface—they must have access to research capacity.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020754000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000112">This is an urgent
issue, which is why I raise it at the beginning of my remarks. The
existing honorary contracts legally run out on 31 March, and continuity
over existing research programmes is absolutely crucial unless we are
to see the abandonment of key strands of public health research. Will
the Minister say what plans he has to resolve this very small but
important issue? In particular, will he instruct the Commissioning
Board to transfer the £14.7 million of public health funding
that it has obtained from PCTs and SHAs to Public Health England as an
interim measure until a more secure funding stream can be found for
public health
research?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000113">Continuing
the theme of research, perhaps I may seek clarification on two other
matters in the current regulations. This SI gives local authorities
powers as directed by the Secretary of State which are in effect
transfers of existing powers. They are largely welcomed and give much
needed continuity. Therefore, I do not think that there is any argument
about the transfer of those powers. However, a person who has one or
more of the declared morbidities will be checked on a more regular
basis—that is, if you have hypertension, you 
<?notus-xml column=104?>will be checked annually. However, will the broader health check given
to eligible persons be carried out on non-eligible persons on a
five-yearly basis or will it be in the sequence of their morbidity? In
other words, if you have hypertension and are checked annually, will
you have all the other health checks at the same time, will you have to
wait for five years to have them, or will you not get those other
checks? The regulations do not make that clear. This is important
because the health check data obtained via Regulation 5(3) is valuable
not only for individual patients but for research groups.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020754000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000114">Indeed, with regard to
the information obtained under Regulation 5(3), will the data
automatically be made available in an anonymised format, with open
access for research groups, but allowing for patient opt-out? If so,
will it be the responsibility of the Department of Health, the NIHR,
the Commissioning Board or Public Health England to prescribe a format
for data collection and storage? I make that point because, if the
information is collected in different formats, it becomes less valuable
in terms of interrogating it for effective research.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020754000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000115">Let me move on to
Regulation 6, which I am somewhat confused by the thinking behind.
While I fully understand why services such as abortion, sterilisation
and vasectomy should be moved into the NHS, given their
“clinical and surgical nature”, surely the same could be
said about specialist STD management and specialist contraception
services, which carry significant clinical risks—not to mention
a minefield of legal  and ethical dimensions. For instance, IUD
insertion management can be an incredibly invasive and difficult issue.
The decision to ask local authorities to exclude HIV patients from
other sexual health services and treatment for other STDs appears to be
at odds with offering patients a comprehensive sexual health service.
Why are we separating those out? There is confusion over the
implication for people who move out of an area to be tested for HIV,
for instance—a more likely scenario in places such as London,
Manchester and Birmingham, where specialist clinics with the latest
technology quite rightly are emerging. Yet there is confusion over
where people will be treated if they are tested elsewhere and how that
will be cross-charged.</hs_para>

responsibility for treating an HIV person with another STD? Will
patients continue to have the right to access sexual health services,
including related treatment and care, wherever they choose in England,
regardless of their place of residence? Will there be no loss either in
expertise or in the infrastructure needed to commission complex sexual
health services, and will those services and pathways of care be fully
integrated? I ask that because small authorities may not have the
capacity to be able to have that range of services. Will they therefore
be able to commission those services elsewhere and send people from one
local authority to another? Will the pressures on local authority
budgets not simply result in a diminished quality or availability of
care?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020754000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000117">How do
we guarantee that what we are promising in the regulations can be
delivered, given the pressure on budgets? For instance, 25% of the
budget for public health is likely to be spent on promoting and
supporting 
<?notus-xml column=105?>the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and sexual health. That
represents a huge amount of the budget, and for some authorities,
particularly in large, deprived urban areas, the proportion could be
even greater. Will there be a seamless integrated pathway of care for
people living with HIV? We cannot ask such people to be treated
differently to any other group in the population, and that is what
these regulations appear to be saying. Perhaps the Minister can give me
some comfort on that.</hs_para>

8, health protection is at the core of the new arrangements and, as I
said earlier, none of us, of any political persuasion, do not very
strongly support the direction of travel of the Government. Local
authorities are enthusiastic about this role of being responsible for
health protection. However, an effective response to an early outbreak
or emergency requires clear roles and responsibilities, strong
leadership and timely intervention. This regulation does not appear to
do any of those things. Indeed, rather than building on the DoH
guidance of September 2012 on health protection in local government, in
which the Government clearly stated that local authorities would be
expected to ensure that partners have effective plans in place and that
the director of public health would have a leadership function, these
regulations give local authorities no more responsibility than
requiring other bodies to draw up plans and requiring the local
authorities themselves to issue guidance. There is nothing here to say
whether plans will be mandatory or optional. That is hardly encouraging
if a major crisis develops with potential or actual loss of life. Would
the director of public health have a recourse in law to say,
“Not me, guv, I asked them all to issue guidance and they did so
and therefore my responsibility is
over.”?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13020754000212" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000212">3.30

Minister assure me that local authorities, through their directors of
public health, will have an active role in protecting health at local
level and a statutory responsibility for leadership? Will that role
include giving local authorities responsibility for ensuring that all
local partners have health protection plans in place and that the local
response is co-ordinated effectively? If they are given that mandatory
requirement, they will do it. Will he confirm that he will issue
guidance to that effect? If the local authority will not be responsible
for ensuring that plans are in place or that local responses are
co-ordinated, will the Minister explain who will be responsible within
those local areas, if it is not the director of public
health?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000120">On
Regulation 9, I strongly welcome the powers of local authorities to
cross-charge for services they offer. I think that that is absolutely
right and proper as this will help those authorities which develop
specialist services. If one authority in London offers a specialist
service for diagnosing sexual health problems and that attracts clients
from the rest of London, I think that is a good thing. It is right to
have a Rolls Royce service and cross-charging for that seems to me
important to sustain a revenue
stream.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000121">I am
pleased—as I am sure everyone else is—that no service

appreciate that Regulation 9(3) clarifies this with regard to future
services to improve public health. However, in what circumstances does
the Minister envisage that a service to improve public health could be
charged for? He mentioned training in his opening remarks. If, for
instance, a new contraception service is introduced, would there be a
charge for training people to provide that service? Who would pay for
that training? Would it be the local authority or the Department of
Health? Where would the budget come from? It is conceivable that a new
treatment may become available and yet the local authority or, indeed,
individuals would have to pay for the staff delivering that treatment
to be trained. Will the Minister provide assurances that public health
services provided by local authorities will remain subject to the
provisions of Section 1(3) of the National Health Service Act 2006 and
be free at the point of delivery, and read that into the record? Will
he confirm that powers under Section 2B of the Health and Social Care
Act 2012 will not be used to impose charges for services that are
currently provided free and that individuals will face no further
charges for services for improving an individual’s

I come to Part 4 of the regulations, concerning the interface between
Healthwatch England and service providers. I am not going to rerun the
debates on Healthwatch England, but it is disappointing that we see its
role in these regulations only with regard to premises. In other words,
Healthwatch can make sure a counselling room is clean and tidy with the
necessary flowers and fish tank, but the fact that the person
delivering the service may be unqualified, incompetent or even
dangerous, or all three, is of less consequence. I
exaggerate—not for the first time—but there is nothing in
these regulations about the regulation of public health specialists
other than medics. The Government made a commitment last January to
regulate, by statute, the registration of public health specialists
from backgrounds other than medicine and dentistry and acknowledge
regulation as a key part of the infrastructure of the new English
public health system which starts in April 2013.</hs_para>

letter from Anna Soubry, the Minister for Public Health, that there is,
as yet, no planned date for this work, which could take at least two

implication is that public health regulation is not a priority,
particularly where it concerns individuals other than medics in
delivering those services. There is an increasing number of individuals
and organisations offering health-related services who are not
regulated, trained or accountable, and that is clearly unacceptable.
Regulation will provide a crucial mechanism for identifying problems at
an early stage and providing opportunities for these to be addressed.
The public have a right to be assured that, if things go 
<?notus-xml column=107?>wrong, there will be accountability, sanctions and procedures to prevent
future mistakes. Can the Minister provide reassurance that the
statutory regulation of public health specialists from backgrounds
other than medicine and dentistry will be in place by the end of 2014,

the necessary processes for ensuring the implementation of this

Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> I express my thanks to the noble
Lord, Lord Willis, for his comprehensive contribution this afternoon.
He has covered quite a lot of the questions that I would have asked and
there is no point in repeating them. However, I should like to pick up
some specific points.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020754000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000125">First,
in relation to sexual health, like the noble Lord, Lord Willis, we
welcome these regulations, particularly the very important principle of
the maintenance of open access. HIV has never respected local authority
boundaries, nor have other sexually transmitted infections. I have
spoken in the Chamber of my concerns about how the new system of
commissioning and fragmentation can put at risk regional and
sub-regional co-ordination of HIV prevention work. This morning, I
visited Positive East, a community facility based in the East End,
which does excellent work in a number of boroughs in the east of
London. It also participates in outreach and preventive programmes
across London and it remains particularly concerned about the future. I
appreciate that, while HIV Prevention England is commissioned by Public
Health England to run a national HIV programme and local authorities
will commission local HIV prevention and testing services, there
remains a gap in regional co-ordination. This was highlighted in a
health Question in the other place on 15 January, when the Minister
assured Members of Parliament that this regional work would continue,
but the detail on whether there would be national leadership remains
unclear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000126">What
steps will the Government take to encourage co-ordination of sexual
health services across boroughs and localities? For example—this
was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Willis—25% of HIV prevalence
in the UK is in London, which previously had an integrated pan-London
programme for HIV prevention. What measures have been put in place, as
the noble Lord has already said, to facilitate cross-charging between
sexual health clinics for out-of-area
residents?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000127">An
issue which arises from these regulations is the concern that has been
expressed about the pressure on budgets and, certainly, consistency
across the country. I am acutely aware that, come the local elections,
there will be not so much prioritising of these important issues. This
could be a concern. I do not think that sexually transmitted infections
have been the highlight of many party manifestos, but they are
important issues in public
health.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000128">There
is no mention in the regulations about the quality of open access
health services and the minimum expectation that the Government have of
locally commissioned sexual health services. The Minister has
repeatedly said that the answer lies in localism—in local
circumstances—and that these issues are best 
<?notus-xml column=108?>addressed locally. However, there is a requirement to ensure that
there is proper maintenance of standards on these
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000129">Will

am particularly concerned about and which I have raised in the House is
the question of HIV testing. This is highly fragmented under the new
NHS arrangements. I have asked the noble Earl before, and I repeat: how
will the Government ensure that HIV testing recommendations from NICE
and the British HIV Association are consistently implemented across the
country? In some areas of high prevalence it is recommended by NICE
that HIV testing should be routinely offered in primary care settings.
Will this be implemented? How will this work be funded and
provided?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000131">The
noble Lord, Lord Willis, also touched on the issue of the treatment of
people living with HIV and the treatment of other sexually transmitted
infections they may have. I am not sure how that will be covered.

concerned about the question of offering services and treatment through
self-management, if you like, for people living with HIV. That is one
of the key things I saw at Positive East today. This is not only about
the supply of drugs and treatment but about employment advice, general
housing conditions and other issues that we have already covered in
debates in the Chamber. The funding and support of those activities
concerns me. Where is it going to fall? Who is going to take
responsibility? Fragmentation is a real
worry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000133">I shall
not cover specific local government issues around public health because
the noble Lord, Lord Willis, has covered them excellently. However, I
wish to pick up on some of the points that the Minister
raised in relation to local Healthwatch and its access. We had a major
debate on Healthwatch this week, which preceded the Statement on the
Francis report on Mid-Staffs. Given the measures outlined in these
regulations, will the department review them in the light of the
recommendations made by Francis? Issues were raised by Francis which, I
suspect, are not adequately covered by the regulations, particularly
with regard to
access.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13020754000213" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000213">3.45

Minister referred to wanting to have a clear separation of the CQC role
from that of Healthwatch. As a patient organisation, particularly in
the light of the Francis report, Healthwatch needs to be certain that
the CQC is doing its job. It is not a neutral thing. It is not a case
of saying, “We’re happy, we don’t need to do that
because the CQC is doing it”. Local Healthwatch is not the
regulator; it is the voice of the patient. It is the patient who is
everywhere and is able to see everything. The idea that we can limit
access in the way that is being suggested in these regulations is not
altogether clear. Certainly, NALM has raised some of these issues with
me. There is an exclusion,</hs_para>

“reasonably and proportionately”? A representative of

have raised other points about areas of premises that might be
considered out of bounds. If we are talking about community facilities,
then what about kitchens? You go to see the quality of care of social
care residents and you are told that you can go into the living or

you are not permitted to go into the kitchen or other areas where

research funding. I quite agree about the importance of maintaining
that work. Currently, PCTs 
<?notus-xml column=110?>and strategic health authorities fund public health research from their
local spending allocations, in particular paying for public health
academic posts, located within academic and research institutions. I
can tell him that, in finalising spending plans, officials from the
department, from Public Health England and the NHS Commissioning Board
are working together to identify and continue this funding for the
coming financial year. As soon as I have further news on that front, I

noble friend went on to discuss Regulation 4, which relates to health
checks. First, the requirement to offer a health check is to offer the
check within five years of a person becoming eligible for it. However,
a local authority could, if it wished, offer checks to
non- eligible persons, if it considered it appropriate to do
so. Local authorities have that freedom; all the regulations do is to
lay down the minimum
requirements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000142">Both
noble Lords spent some time discussing sexual health services.
Improving sexual health is clearly a key part of improving public
health and well-being. Our view was, and is, that local authorities are
particularly well placed to commission sexual health services, as they
will also be commissioning services for other public health issues such
as drug and alcohol misuse, weight management and quitting smoking.
They are also best placed to make the wider links between sexual health
and well-being, such as to education, leisure and family support.
Clearly, they will also want to work collaboratively with commissioners
of sexual health and HIV services that will remain in the NHS. During
our consultation there was strong stakeholder support for local
authority commissioning of sexual health services. While it is
important to get the arrangements absolutely right—we are clear
that there are some issues of detail that we need to
resolve—there is broad support out there for the decision that
we have taken on this front.</hs_para>

arrangements will allow each
organisation—local authorities, clinical commissioning groups
and the NHS Commissioning Board—to play to their own strengths
and to commission high-quality services for patients. Local authorities
will commission most sexual health services: they will be able to make
the crucial links between sexual health and other public health
services, as I have mentioned. Clinical commissioning groups will
commission abortion, sterilisation and vasectomy because these services
need to be governed by robust systems of clinical governance, which
currently exist in the NHS. HIV treatment will be commissioned by the
NHS Commissioning Board, which has specialist expertise in
commissioning high-cost, low volume services such as HIV treatment. At

raised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000144">As
noble Lords will know, these commissioning arrangements were set out in
a local government fact sheet on commissioning responsibilities which
we published at the end of 2011. However, I emphasise that we have
worked, and will continue to work, closely with colleagues
in the NHS and local councils to make 
<?notus-xml column=111?>sure that local authorities and other commissioners experience a smooth
transition to their new responsibilities. We intend to conduct a

noble Lord, Lord Collins, mentioned comorbidities, as did my noble
friend. A person with comorbidity— let us say HIV and
another condition—should clearly receive treatment from the most
appropriate source. The two services will often be under the same roof
in practice but it is important to ensure that the commissioning of
those services is joined up for such
patients.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020754000146" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-gc0001.htm#13020754000146">On
the issue of charging—both noble Lords asked about
this—the first point to emphasise is that an individual who was
receiving a health improvement service from the NHS free of charge will
continue to receive it free of charge when responsibility for it
transfers to local authorities. The kinds of activity that local
authorities can charge for are as follows: providing information and
advice; providing services or facilities designed to promote healthy
living; providing or participating in the provision of training for
persons working in, or seeking to work in, the field of health
improvement; and making available the services of any person or any
facilities—for example, providing staff and facilities to enable
a company to conduct public health
research.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_07_PT_1/4B00EF9C69C2C515AB94B68F675F4632644EF4F4" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 February 2013">Thursday,

functions decide to provide the company with that service to help
individuals to address behaviour that is detrimental to their health.
The regulations allow the local authority to recover its costs from the
company, but not to make a profit. Without the regulations, the local
authority would either have to provide the services to the company free
or, more likely, not at all. If the local authority provides a smoking
cessation service directly to the public, the regulations would not
allow it to

worth noting that the regulations specify that a local authority can

of public health to take the leading role in

Howe:</Member></B> We expect that that will be the case but it will
depend on the nature of the incident and how big a public health
emergency we are dealing with. We might find, for example, that if it
is an emergency that covers more than one local authority area, a
particular director of public health would take responsibility on
behalf of all the local authorities. We would expect Public Health
England to be on the scene for any major incident and to advise, but
the central point is that there has to be somebody with ultimate
responsibility for what goes on on the ground. Clearly, who that person
is will depend on how major or minor the incident is and the nature of
that incident. It would be open to the director of public health to
delegate certain functions but, again, we would expect the director of
public health to retain an oversight role to make sure that functions
were appropriately performed.</hs_para>

Collins, referred to the important area of prevention. He expressed
concern about local authorities investing in prevention work. I was
grateful to him for what he told me about the work currently being done
in London on HIV prevention. The mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board
does not specifically cover prevention, but local authorities will want
to undertake prevention activity because this will improve the health
and well-being of their population and reduce costs. Sexual health
services are also a preventive activity in their own right—for
example, the provision of contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy
and the testing and treatment for STIs to prevent onward
transmission.</hs_para>

HIV, one of the public health outcome indicators is to reduce late HIV
diagnosis, and prevention activity can clearly play a crucial role in
that. We are aware that in London, in particular, councils will be
working together to review arrangements for pan-London HIV prevention
work. The noble Lord may well be aware of the work going on to underpin
the current pan-London HIV programme. The current programme comes to an
end at the end of March and this has been known by all the providers
and voluntary sector organisations for some time. Therefore, a needs
assessment of pan-London HIV prevention was undertaken in 2011. London
Councils and the mayor’s office are absolutely sighted on the
need for effective HIV prevention in the capital and urgent discussions

continue to be commissioned by the NHS. More generally, local
authorities will be able to enter into cross-charging arrangements if
they wish. In London, we introduced secondary legislation last year to

how we would ensure that HIV treatment was standardised across the

the commitment to regulate non-medical public health consultants after
conducting a consultation. That remains the case. However, the process
will take 12 to 18 months to complete and so, at this point, I am
reluctant to commit to a particular date for implementation. I should

also raised the issue of the interface between Healthwatch England and

allow entry to local Healthwatch rather than Healthwatch England. If
local Healthwatch representatives observed anything that might be
unsafe or poor care of any kind, they can report those matters directly
to the Care Quality Commission to investigate. I hope that that
addresses an issue also raised by the noble Lord, Lord Collins, because
it is clearly very important for local Healthwatch not only to have a
hotline to the CQC where necessary but to co-ordinate its work, where
relevant, with that of the CQC—exactly as LINks do at the

Robert Francis’s report in detail over the coming weeks.

Lord, Lord Collins, raised the issue of local Healthwatch being able to
enter and view premises and, in doing so, access all areas in those
premises—for example, areas being renovated, kitchens and so on.
Local Healthwatch representatives will be able to access communal areas
but there are restrictions based on the privacy of residents or
patients and the need to respect that, and on intruding on the
provision of care while it is being delivered. The enter-and-view
powers are activities for the purposes 
<?notus-xml column=114?>of Section 221 and relate to service improvements. These regulations

the issue of the reasonableness of local Healthwatch’s
enter-and-view activities, the service provider’s view has to be

convention is an important instrument as it forms the international
basis for numerous incoming and outgoing requests. The second
additional protocol is aimed at strengthening mutual legal assistance
among parties and widening the scope of available mutual legal

Nevertheless, I thank the Minister for the explanation of

his broader point about the Government’s decision on opting out

current intention is to opt out of all measures and to seek to rejoin
those where it is in the national interest to do so. The Government

decision. However, in light of the fact that, as the noble Lord said,
there are no other noble Lords participating in the debate today, my

overt surveillance in a public place wherever its deployment is in
pursuit of a legitimate aim, necessary to meet a pressing need,
proportionate and compliant with any relevant legislation. Like the

appropriate privacy safeguards.</hs_para>

philosophy of surveillance by consent. The Government see an important
parallel with the well-established concept of policing by consent,
which is based upon a presumption of transparency and accountability to
assure the integrity of police officers and staff in exercising their
powers on behalf of their fellow citizens. This Government will ensure

defence engagement goes far broader than this. This strategy therefore
includes traditional defence diplomacy activity of senior level visits

activities; security and non-combat operations; and MoD support for
defence and security exports. The scope of this strategy is ambitious
and it will be implemented in conjunction with other related government
initiatives, such as the building stability overseas strategy, the Gulf

The Burmese Government have taken some very

efforts to support security and justice sector reform and capacity
building, which contribute to regional peace and security. We will be
opening a defence section in our embassy in Libya this year. During the
transition in Libya we established a defence advisory team to assist
the National Transitional Council in developing its organisational and
planning capacity. This team has remained in place post-conflict, to
support the democratically elected General National Congress. The
defence section will build on relationships established by them. Also,
we have recently established a defence section in Juba in South Sudan.
We are working alongside other government departments to assist this
newly independent state to establish national institutions and
implement security and justice reform, contributing to regional
security in a relatively unstable region. Similarly, when the British
embassy is opened in Mogadishu this year we will be establishing a
defence section there, enabling us to provide a greater focus for our
support to the Government of Somalia and to AMISOM, the African Union
force in Somalia, as they make progress in driving out al-Shabaab.
Importantly, taking advantage of our transition from combat operations
in Afghanistan and the resulting increase in available forces, we are
exploring innovative ways of using some Army capabilities on a wide
range of defence engagement tasks and intend to pilot this as the Army

to March 2015). This is being supplemented by up to
£148 million, contributed by local councils,
businesses and private 
<?notus-xml column=29?>investors under the new partnership funding system introduced in May
2011. This extra investment is helping to deliver better protection to
more communities than previously thought possible. Risk management
authorities are now on track to deliver better protection to 165,000

spending period by
20,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020744000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207-wms0001.htm#13020744000085">I can
also announce that nine schemes, including Leeds, Sheffield, Ipswich,
Exeter and Derby, will receive a share of the funding announced in the
Autumn Statement last year. These schemes will unlock economic growth,
create jobs and grow the economy. For example, Exeter’s new
flood defences will create over 1,000 jobs and protect businesses which
employ 4,700 people. The defences will provide better protection to
land for business development as well as major rail and sewerage
infrastructure and over 2,000 homes. In Ipswich, a tidal barrier will
improve flood protection to 10 hectares of development land attracting
more business to the area and creating 4,000 jobs.</hs_para>

that the new partnership funding system had brought forward £72
million of contributions over the three years to March 2015. During its
second year the figure has now doubled to £148 million over the
same period. This is enabling more schemes to proceed than would have
been possible if the old all-or-nothing funding system had remained.
Schemes with significant partner contributions include the £50.5
million growth scheme in Leeds that will protect 250 businesses and
create over 18,000 jobs. To supplement Government’s investment,
Leeds City Council is contributing £10 million towards the cost
of the scheme, with a further £5 million proposed to be raised
from local businesses.</hs_para>

possible as a result of the new system include new sea defences at
Anchorsholme in Lancashire, which will reduce the risk of flooding to
6,000 homes and highway, tramway and sewerage infrastructure. Blackpool
Borough Council is contributing 
<?notus-xml column=30?>£4 million toward the total cost of £28.4 million. The
combination of extra funding in the Autumn Statement, backed by
partnership funding contributions, will allow a £9.7 million
scheme to go ahead in Skipton, North Yorkshire. This will reduce
flooding to over 350 residential and 165 business properties in the

Met Office has assessed the climatological context of the 2010-12 UK
drought. This indicated that a number of drivers may all have
potentially played a role in this event, including multi-decadal
variability in the sign of the North Atlantic Oscillation, which is
linked to Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation—a strong
determinant of winter temperature and rainfall; La Nina
forcing from the Pacific; solar variability associated with the 11-year
solar cycle; declining Arctic sea ice, and; stratospheric influences.
We also noted however that neither the development nor the severity of
the 2010-2012 UK drought was exceptional compared with historical
events and its climatological drivers had several similarities with
past droughts. A number of these drivers, including the links to a
warming world, continue to be investigated, in particular the impact of
declining Arctic sea ice on our winter weather patterns and the impact
of higher temperatures on UK water
availability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020750000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130207w0001.htm#13020750000099">There
is evidence that increases in greenhouse gases and the subsequent rise
in global temperature has increased the severity of short period (up to
a day) extreme rainfall for the Northern Hemisphere and that this is
expected to continue as the climate warms. The seasonal extreme
rainfall of autumn 2000 and subsequent flooding was also found to have
been exacerbated by increased greenhouse gases. However, the degree to
which the wet periods of 2012 was due to natural variability or
increased greenhouse gases is not yet known and a subject of

delivering social care. Independent research by the King's Fund
