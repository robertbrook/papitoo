considers how best to respond to these events, would she undertake to
read the report <I>Tibet: Breaking the Deadlock</I>, which the noble
Lord, Lord Steel, and I published following our visit to Tibet, and
which focused on the need to create dialogue, to end attempts to

the recommendations of the report that he mentions. I am sure he will

rail and road links to Tibet, which help the Han Chinese colonise that
region. Of course, in spite of all these bilateral and multilateral

report to which she has kindly referred, recognise that in the three
years since, two important things have happened? One is that there was
a change of leadership in China; the second is that the Dalai Lama has
given up his political role as head of the Tibetan Government in exile.
Therefore, would she and her colleagues try to encourage the Chinese
authorities to enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama as a religious
leader in order to stop these immolations and try to improve relations

answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Steel. I still
want to probe a bit further. He is certainly exiled, but the Dalai Lama
is not only a spiritual and religious leader of the people of Tibet; he
is also recognised throughout the world. Will the Government
nevertheless impress upon the Chinese Government that they should
recognise and respect the Dalai Lama as a religious leader and not as a

welcome that has been given to the most reverend Primate. We all wish
him every success in the contribution he will make in this House. The
last major dialogue that the Minister has reported to us was in January
2012. Obviously, there has been a change in the leadership of the
Chinese state and Communist Party in the period since. I wonder whether
other channels are available that might be used. I am thinking
particularly of the business group, the 48 Group Club, which
has managed to establish decent relationships with the Chinese
Government and is not always associated with the past that this country
has had with China, which has not been held in great esteem in many
respects by the Chinese people historically. Is there a dialogue going
on with those groups? Can we improve it and can we achieve the

test in 2005 and remain committed to it, but clearly a significant
amount of time, effort and money has gone into these changes and the
questions mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts. It has to be said
that when the Prime Minister failed the test on live television in
America, one has to doubt whether we have all the right questions.
Given that 20% fewer foreign criminals have been deported and the
lengthy delays in the processing of visas, far exceeding what is
reasonable or should be expected, as Her Majesty’s Inspector has
pointed out, should the priority be changes to the citizenship test or
should the key focus be on sorting out the problems connected with
immigration and

important task. Noble Lords will know that the current handbook has
been in use for six years. It was time to have an update and to make it
more relevant. The noble Baroness referred to serious issues on the
part of UKBA, particularly its ability to cope with appeals. We are

My accent remains unchanged, of

concerned about more serious situations in immigration, raised by the

Woolf, a former Lord Chief Justice, we have managed to obtain a right
to be here for someone who has been here now for three years. She was
here legally for five years, having come here as an au pair, then
illegally for about 20 years. Now she has to wait, and after five years
she can apply for citizenship. During that investigation, I discovered
that the problem is that when you arrive, you are told that you have to
have been here for six years. When you get to five and a half years,
they change it to eight years. When you get to seven and a half years,
they change it to another two years. Is it not time that we looked at
the prospect of relating the number of years you have to wait to what

Lords, I begin by wishing my noble friend a very happy 94th birthday,
which I know he celebrated a couple of days ago. The Government are
taking decisive steps to secure our supplies. We are reforming the
electricity market to drive the investment we need to ensure that we
have a diverse range of energy supplies, and through the Green Deal and
ECO, we are looking to reduce our usage of energy. I am also pleased to
announce that we have had investment from Carrington gas, which will
come on stream in 2016, and Hitachi’s investment of £700
million in purchasing Horizon demonstrates that the Government’s
approach is right, and that the UK remains an attractive place to
invest<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000052"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ezra" PimsId="3168" UID="13022665001020" xid="1214" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665001020">Lord

remarks. In spite of advancing years, I continue to take a keen
interest in energy matters. Does the Minister agree that, while in the
medium and long term, shale gas, new nuclear and other installations
may help to meet increased electricity demands, there is a serious
short-term problem, to which she referred? In that connection, will she
indicate what steps the Government will take, in addition to those that
she mentioned, to avoid a possible shortage of electricity-generating
capacity within the next two to three years, bearing in mind the early
closure of existing coal and some nuclear plants, and the warning from

ensure that the UK economy continues to enjoy high levels of
electricity supply security in the short, medium and long term. Our
proposals for electricity market reform will drive investment, ensuring
that we have a diverse mix of energy sources. Those proposals also
include legislating for a capacity market to ensure that we have
sufficiently reliable capacity on the system in the long term. The
legislation, which will come to your Lordships’ House for
consideration shortly, will enable a capacity market. With regard to
the short term, we expect to see some reduction in margins as we move
towards the middle of the decade; we saw similar reductions in the

Tomlinson:</Member></B> Does the Minister agree that we are falling
further and further behind the necessary timetable for getting new
nuclear power on stream? Without that new nuclear power, we will see
the proportion of our energy that is generated from nuclear rapidly
declining as we close the existing stations, and we will become more
and more dependent on imported energy. At the same time, we will of
course fail to meet our Kyoto targets. In those circumstances of an
increase in imported energy, will the Minister answer the question I
asked her yesterday, and which she failed to answer: what is the effect
on imported energy requirements of the devaluation of sterling, which
is further exacerbated by the loss of our AAA

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, this group contains a large number of
technical amendments. Amendment 1 reflects the fact that some of the
obligations in the Bill are set in the main clauses and not in scheme
regulations. This means that the drafting of Clause 3, which allows
only for consequential, supplementary, incidental or transitional
changes as a result of provisions in scheme regulations, leaves a
theoretical gap in powers that we would like to plug. If such changes
were required solely as a result of provisions in the Bill rather than
in scheme regulations, we might not be able to do so without making new
primary legislation. We do not believe that that would be appropriate,
so the amendments in this group seek to address the slight gap in the
current
drafting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:14:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000064">Of
course, this extends the powers to cover only consequential,
supplementary, incidental or transitional changes that result from
clauses that have been debated 
<?notus-xml column=962?>at length in both Houses. Parliament is already
aware of the desired effects of the Bill. These powers ensure that the
effects can be realised. As we discussed on Report, any use of these
powers to amend primary legislation could only be for consequential
purposes and to Acts that have already been passed. I therefore hope
that noble Lords can support this small but sensible
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:14:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000065">Amendments
4 and 5 are minor technical amendments. They are simply to provide
consistency throughout the Bill in the form of cross-references to
Schedule 4 to the Pensions Act 1995. They ensure that the same format
is used in Clauses 34 and 35 as is used in Clause
10.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000066">Amendments
8 and 9 are again minor amendments intended to clarify the wording, in
this case of amendments I brought forward on Report. Noble Lords will
recall that those amendments give schemes flexibility to
define pensionable earnings for the purpose of the final salary link,
and also safeguard the value of members’ final salary benefits.
The safeguard is that the amount of earnings in the new scheme that are
pensionable earnings for the purpose of the final salary link must not
be materially less than the amount that would have applied had the
person been in the old scheme until the point they
eventually left service. The amendments simply clarify the safeguard.
They make it clear that it applies to what would have been the
person’s pensionable earnings had that person been in active
service in the old scheme or deemed transfer scheme, rather than the
new scheme. They would, of course, not have been in actual active
service in those schemes after 2015, since they would have been in
active service in the new scheme instead. The amendments do not change
the substance of the meaning of the previous amendments in any way, but
are just
clarificatory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000067">Amendment
10 is concerned with circumstances where a pension that is calculated
in accordance with the final salary link has been put into payment and
the person subsequently returns to public service employment. It is
designed to allow flexibility for schemes to continue their current
treatment of a final salary pension in payment in such circumstances.
Our intention is for the final salary link to accord with the rules on
final salary benefits in each scheme that are currently in force. Some
schemes currently allow the final salary benefits to be recalculated
after a period of re-employment. The provisions in Schedule 7 allow
this approach to continue where there is continuity of service, as
provided for in paragraph 3. However, many schemes currently treat
final salary benefits that have already been put into payment as fully
crystallised, and consequently unaffected by any future period of
employment in scheme service. Our amendment would allow for scheme
regulations to provide that this continues to be the case too, if
desired. Rules of existing schemes can also continue to provide for
some limited aggregation of periods of employment, as some do at the
moment. This amendment assists schemes in the implementation of the
recommendation of the noble Lord, Lord Hutton, to honour the benefits
built up under the current final salary
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000068">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>
11 consists of a series of minor, consequential amendments to the
Pensions (Increase) Act 1971. It clarifies how the uprating provisions
of 
<?notus-xml column=963?>that Act apply to those with service in both an existing scheme and a
new one. The 1971 Act provides for the uprating of pension benefits for
deferred and pensioner members of the public service schemes. The
intention is that while a person is a member of a new scheme after
2015, and they have also old scheme benefits, those old scheme benefits
should be treated for uprating purposes as though they remained an
active member. This should remain the case until the member takes the
old scheme pension or leaves the new scheme. This means that for those
persons whose existing scheme is a final salary scheme, their benefits
in that scheme will be uprated through the final salary link provisions
in Schedule 7 to the Bill. For those persons whose existing scheme is a
career average scheme, their benefits should continue to be revalued as
if they remained an active member. This amendment clarifies how the
provisions in the Pensions (Increase) Act apply in the circumstances I
have just
described.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000069">Where<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:18:47"></hs_TimeCode>
people continue in service, the old scheme benefits should not be
treated as deferred from 2015. To do so would mean that those benefits
would be uprated in line with prices from 2015, which would run counter
to the treatment of old scheme benefits recommended by the noble Lord,
Lord
Hutton.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000070">The
final amendment in this group relates to an amendment I introduced on
Report to paragraph 30 of Schedule 8. This paragraph amends Schedule 4
to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 to
enable those active members of the Legal Services Commission pension
schemes to transfer into the Civil Service scheme on 1 April
2014 to have full access to the transitional provisions contained in
Clause 18. This subsequent amendment is a minor tweak to paragraph 30
to ensure that, in addition to those active members, deferred members
of the LSC pension schemes who rejoin within a five-year period will
also benefit from the transition provisions. This is entirely
consistent with wider government policy on the treatment of deferred
members of public service pension schemes. It will ensure that
employees of the LSC are not unfairly disadvantaged by the changes to
their pension provision. I beg to

the difficulty is, as the Bill goes on to say, that any
investment has to meet only one of those excellent purposes,
but there can be conflict environmentally in certain areas over certain
actions. For instance, an important coastal reclamation project to
ensure biodiversity might produce a negative carbon outcome over the
medium to longer term. It is a possibility, although clearly it will
not happen all the time. My amendment seeks to ensure that the bank,
looking at the position overall rather than at individual investment

and that this is put within the context of the Climate Change Act.

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, we also welcome the fact that the
Government have listened to our debate in Committee and have tabled
amendments to make more explicit the green purposes of the Green
Investment Bank. As has been said many times, with no ability to
borrow, the bank can scarcely be described as a
bank, and with unclear purposes it might also 
<?notus-xml column=969?>cease to be green. We welcome the Government’s amendments, but
there is a remaining concern. When we discussed this in Committee, we
were looking for specific references to the meeting of the UK’s
carbon budget under the Climate Change Act 2008. The amendments tabled
for consideration today do not contain that explicit reference, which
is a great shame, and we hope to reinstate it. References to
“global greenhouse gas emissions” may be welcome, but
which country, let alone which bank, can truly be expected to make a
contribution to such an outcome? The factors influencing global
emissions are complex and manifold, and where the UK could make a
difference to global emissions is by showing leadership on policy and
instruments to tackle climate change. The Climate Change Act
was drafted not only with a view to contributing to solving the global
problem but to demonstrating leadership at home. The Green Investment
Bank has been created to contribute to the latter part as much as the
former and therefore the legislation which shapes this decision should
refer to our existing, world-leading climate change mitigation
legislation. I hope that the Minister will accept these amendments,
which seek to achieve

Lords, I welcome the contributions from my noble friend Lord Teverson
and the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, to this debate, and indeed
the cross-party support that there is for the UK Green Investment Bank.
The bank will be a key driver of the transition to a green economy and
is already making investments in green infrastructure projects. The
bank has already committed more than £400 million to projects
across a range of sectors, including waste, non-domestic energy
efficiency and offshore wind. These investments are illustrative of the
impact we expect the bank to have in the coming
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000088">In
turning to the first amendment, I emphasise the large measure of
agreement between the Government and noble Lords who have tabled this
amendment. We agree that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a
key objective for the bank and accept that it would be right to give
this objective statutory recognition. However, we want to do this in a
way that best reflects the bank’s corporate governance framework
and its position as a Companies Act company. Clause 1 sets out five
statutory green purposes which, read together, set the parameters of
the bank’s activity to ensure that it must always remain green.
These green purposes provide an overarching framework for the
bank’s green activity while preserving the necessary breadth to
adapt to evolving green priorities over the long term. The Government
consider that this breadth is essential as there are important
activities which are clearly “green”, but may not reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, including recycling and improving water
quality. We would not want the Bill to be amended in such a way that
put doubt on the bank’s ability to invest in these areas, and I
welcome noble Lords’ support for this
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000089">As I
have said, the Government agree that the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions is an important objective for the bank. That is why we have
included a 
<?notus-xml column=970?>statutory green purpose explicitly to this effect, and why we have
tabled our own amendments, to which I will turn shortly. However, it is
important that we focus on the key objectives for the bank and do not
introduce additional requirements that might complicate its
decision-making process. We need to ensure that under its constitution,
the Bank can operate as a commercial company. This is important because
the bank’s impact may be diluted if the board is concerned that
the Government or the courts may seek to second-guess its commercial
judgments. That is why the Secretary of State has given an operational
independence undertaking to the board.</hs_para>

that the legislation provides sufficient clarity for the board and does
not expose its investment decisions to increased risk of challenge by
bringing a clear public element to the Bank’s functions.
Furthermore, by adding another test on which the board will have to be
satisfied when making investment decisions, this amendment raises the
prospect of the legislative framework conflicting with the
bank’s own constitution, something we believe is avoided through
the Government’s proposed amendments to the Bill.</hs_para>

the same time, we do not believe that our ambition in this area is any
less than that of noble Lords. The Government’s amendments do
not refer to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
because we do not believe that it would be possible to give sufficient
clarity to the bank’s directors if we were to introduce such
imprecise wording. Indeed Amendment 1 would not require the board to
make a significant reduction to greenhouse gas emissions. The
Government’s preferred approach of making the new obligation
part of the company’s objects would, however, give the
bank’s directors strong encouragement to maximise the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions, as that would be the most likely way to
maximise the success of the company.</hs_para>

Smith of Kelvin, who is chairman of the UK Green Investment Bank, has
said that he supports this approach, and I welcome his letter, which I
received a couple of days ago. The noble Lord has been very clear that
he welcomes a statutory obligation on the bank in respect of the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but has said that it is
important that this is achieved in a way that is consistent with the

also agree with noble Lords that it is important that the bank
contributes to a reduction in UK greenhouse gas emissions. As this Bill
must make provision for the long-term future of the bank, we believe
that the best approach would be to achieve this through an amendment to
the company’s objects and we intend to make such an amendment
shortly. Amendment of the objects after designation will of course
require the affirmative resolution of both Houses of
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000094">Finally,
I will comment on two further aspects of this amendment. Amendment 1
would require the board to have regard to the advice and reports of the
Committee on Climate Change. I am happy to give a commitment on behalf
of the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Kelvin, and the other members of the
bank’s board that they will do so. We would, however, much
prefer not to impose a specific statutory obligation on the 
<?notus-xml column=971?>board which might cast doubt on the breadth of the general duty on all
directors—under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006—to
have regard to the impact of the company’s operations on the
environment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000095">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:37:03"></hs_TimeCode>
this amendment, unlike the Government’s amendments, does not
impose a corresponding disclosure requirement on the board. We believe
it is important that there is a tailored disclosure obligation on the
board in respect of this new requirement to ensure full transparency
and accountability. This approach is of course in keeping with the best
standards of corporate governance.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022665000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000096">I will now turn in more
detail to the Government’s own amendments in this area.
Amendment 3 requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied that the
bank’s objects are such that, in acting consistently with them,
the bank’s investment activities—taken as a
whole—would be such as the bank considers likely to contribute
to a reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. The new
obligation on the board is therefore imposed through the
company’s statement of objects in its articles of association.
This reflects the approach we have taken in respect of the green
purposes and ensures that the new obligation forms part of the
directors’ general duties to the company, including the duty to
promote the success of the company in line with its objects. We believe
that this will be the most effective approach. It also eliminates the
possibility of inconsistency with the company’s corporate
governance framework and reduces the risk of legal challenge to the
board’s investment
decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000097">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:38:29"></hs_TimeCode>
new provision goes significantly beyond the assurances we have already
given in this area and ensures that the bank will continue to focus its
investments in areas that will deliver such reductions. As I have said,
the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Kelvin, has indicated his support for the
Government’s
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000098">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:38:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:38:49"></hs_TimeCode>
8 would prevent any alteration to the bank’s objects which is
not consistent with the requirement for the bank’s investment
activities as a whole to deliver a reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions. This will ensure that this new obligation will continue to
apply even if there were to be a change in the company’s
ownership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000099">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:39:15"></hs_TimeCode>
third substantive element is the imposition of a bespoke reporting
requirement in respect of the new obligation on the directors to ensure
that the bank’s overall investment portfolio reduces greenhouse
gas emissions. Previous debates have touched on the bank’s
commitment to transparency, and the bank’s board has already
agreed that the bank will voluntarily report on the greenhouse gas
impacts of its investments. This new reporting requirement will
complement that commitment by requiring the bank’s directors to
include in their directors’ report an explanation of the steps
that they have taken to ensure that the bank’s investment
activities would be likely to contribute to a reduction of global
greenhouse gas emissions, together with a statement of their views on
the likely effect of the bank’s activities on global greenhouse
gas emissions. In addition, the bank will be required to report on the
greenhouse gas emissions associated with its own activities under the
forthcoming changes to the narrative reporting requirements on quoted
companies.</hs_para>

turning to Amendments 4, 9 and 12, the Government strongly believe that
any new obligations in this area should be imposed through the
company’s constitution rather than through a separate public law
requirement, which might not be wholly consistent with the
directors’ duties under the company’s constitution. The
amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, seek to
combine the two approaches by imposing an obligation in respect of an
Act of Parliament through the company’s constitution. The
Government consider that this approach will not deliver the degree of
clarity that is
needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000101">The
Climate Change Act 2008 imposes obligations on the Government, not on
the UK Green Investment Bank—there is a difference. Reference to
this Act in the company’s constitution cannot therefore provide
the clarity that the bank’s directors need for effective
decision-making. At the same time, I do not believe that these
amendments show greater ambition than the Government’s
approach.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022665000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000102">The
Government are proposing that, under the bank’s constitution,
the directors will have a general duty to ensure that the bank’s
investment activities, taken as a whole, contribute to a reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions, both globally and in the United Kingdom. This
is not a stand-alone duty but must be read alongside the
directors’ general duty to act in the way that they consider
would be most likely to promote the success of the company, using the
definition of success set out in the company’s objects. The
directors would fail in this duty if they were to aim for a very small
net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions even if, acting consistently
with their other duties, they could achieve a much more significant
reduction. We therefore do not believe that an additional obligation
linked to Climate Change Act targets would in practice affect the
board’s decision-making or the scope of its ambitions in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000103">In
conclusion, we agree that the reduction of greenhouse gases will be a
key objective for the bank but we wish to ensure that statutory
intervention on this point reflects the bank’s position as a

requirement through the objects for the bank’s investment
portfolio to deliver a carbon reduction and set out in statute the
reporting mechanisms that sit behind this requirement, will address

These statements are from the 2010 Conservative Party manifesto, which
is intriguingly entitled <I>Invitation to Join the Government of
Britain</I>. As Liberal Democrats, we actually did, so in many ways it
was a successful manifesto. The serious point that comes from this is
exactly the one that is in those manifesto statements. For a Green
Investment Bank to be able to do what it says that it will do, it must
be able to lever, not just now but into the future, sufficient funds to
meet the vast requirement for green investment that this country needs.
As we know, in the energy sector alone that is some £200 billion
in generating capacity and in networks over the next 10
years, though we will hope to reduce that through
demand-side reduction. But there is a great task to do.</hs_para>

this £3 billion. I agree with the chairman of the Green
Investment Bank, who said in this Chamber at Second Reading that this
was sufficient money for them to get on with, and to start to create a
track record for, the bank. It is very important that the Green
Investment Bank starts to build up this track record. For a major
financial institution, that will take considerable time and very
careful investment. I also probably agree that the £3 billion
will last until 2015 in terms of commitments, if not actual investment
that will go beyond
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000111">The

2016, when these commitments are used up, with an investment track
record created on the way—but you cannot build up a reputation
of trust in a bank, which, as we all know, is essential, unless you
know that the doors are going to remain open for business, apart from
just collecting the money that has been lent or the investments that
have been made on the dividends, beyond three years from now. For
anybody who wants to take the Green Investment Bank seriously as a
long-term instrument for green regeneration in this country, as was so
eloquently described in the Conservative Party manifesto, surely we
need to have some reassurance, some positive sign, and some certainty
that there will be resources to invest after that period. So far, the
sounds that have come out of the Treasury, if not BIS, which sponsors
this Bill, is that it is pretty reluctant to make that commitment. That
undermines the chairman and the chief executive of the bank, whom I
have met. Their appointments are excellent, and I congratulate the
Government on them, but we pull the rug from under their feet if we do
not assure them that there is a financial future, an investment future
and a lending future beyond
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000112">Another
area that I shall briefly bring up is that it concerns me to some
degree that the £3 billion is going to be available to the Green
Investment Bank beyond 2015-16, if that period is needed. To build up a
track record in terms of investment, it has to make the right choices.
I was very pleased that the Minister underlined the investment
independence of the bank. That was a very strong and important message,
not just to us but to investors and future users of this fund. It would
be a tragedy if the board of the Green Investment Bank felt under
pressure to spend that money because otherwise it would lose it. Those
pressures will be much less if there is a route to further finance for
the future. All this amendment does is to put in a simple way a simple
mechanism by which that process starts now. In the finance sector, with
extremely long gestation periods for investment in green industries, we
need certainty now for the time when this £3 billion runs out. I
will be very interested to hear the Minister’s assurances on
those areas. I beg to

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, during the debate in this House
much has already been said about the absurdity of creating a bank and
then effectively tying 
<?notus-xml column=976?>its hands behind its back by not allowing it to borrow. The
Government’s statistics show that green industries in the UK are
bucking the overall trend, showing healthy growth and contributing to
the reduction in our balance of trade deficit. The bank could and
should be helping to increase this welcome outcome but, apparently in
ignorance of this fact, the Government have provided it with only a
relatively limited amount of starting capital and have explicitly
stated that it cannot borrow until an economy-wide criterion is met.
Its ability to plan for the future and to help further strengthen
growth in these particular green sectors is therefore severely limited,
and it cannot contribute to getting the wider UK economy back on its
feet at precisely the time when we need just that. This amendment seeks
to ensure that there is a plan in place for the bank’s future
development by setting a deadline by which borrowing will be allowed
and creating a defined timeline that removes the uncertainty that
currently hangs over the bank’s future, allowing it to plan for
the future. Doing so helps to ensure that green growth can help to
bring the UK’s economy back to good health even as it helps to
restore the health of our environment. Denial of borrowing powers or
setting a date for borrowing powers shows a lack of commitment, and the
bank will be weakened and undermined as a
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000114">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:59:27"></hs_TimeCode>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government are fully
committed to providing the UK Green Investment Bank with the funding it
needs to become a successful and enduring green financial institution.
In Budget 2011, the Government committed to providing the bank with
£3 billion until 2015, and I appreciate the endorsement by my
noble friend Lord Teverson of the sufficiency of the initial funding of
the bank. This is a significant injection of capital, which would allow
the bank to build market confidence and begin mobilising investment in
green infrastructure projects. As the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Kelvin,
explained in his excellent speech at Second Reading, the bank’s
initial priority must be to show the Government and private capital
markets that it is a well-run organisation with a good track record,
worthy of the injection of more capital or borrowing money from capital
markets. The noble Lord, Lord Smith, also made clear that, as chairman
of the UK Green Investment Bank, he will approach the Government as a
shareholder well before 2015 if he believes that it would be in the
company’s long-term interests to borrow, either from Government
or from the capital markets, from April 2015.</hs_para>

right approach. The bank will, of course, require additional funding in
due course, but it is too early to make commitments about the level and
type of funding for the bank from 2015-16 or the precise timing of an
application to the Commission in respect of borrowing. We should
instead take the necessary steps to ensure that the bank has the
confidence of investors and other market players by 2015 and put 
<?notus-xml column=977?>in place a proper process by which the board can
discuss its future funding needs, and how these can best be addressed
with its
shareholder.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000117">As
part of this process we have given a commitment that the Government
will seek state aid approval in respect of borrowing from the European
Commission before the end of this Parliament. Amendment 10 would go
further by setting a statutory timetable for a notification to the
European Commission and, subject to this, for permission for the bank
to borrow from the capital markets. We do not believe that this is
either warranted or wise. The Government should not be committed by
statute to making a premature or ill-thought-through application,
particularly as this would have cost and resource implications both for
the Government and indeed the European Commission.</hs_para>

that the level of bank borrowing will need to be agreed by the
Government as part of their future spending plans. We should not be
apologetic about this. Any borrowing by the bank would score against
the national debt targets and it is essential for sustained growth that
the Government maintain tight fiscal discipline. I want to emphasise
again, in response to the comments made by my noble friend Lord
Teverson, that the Government will consider the full range of funding
options for the bank from April 2015, but it is important that we do
not run before we can walk. In the light of these points, I hope the

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, at Second Reading I expressed
concern about the provisions of Clause 7 and subsequent clauses. They
seemed to me to be designed to make it as difficult as possible for
employees to access employment rights. Indeed, the Government made it
clear that they wished to decrease the number of tribunal cases. I
accept that many issues arising in the course of employment could be
better dealt with through conciliation, such as alleged failure to pay
a bonus or holiday pay, but alleged unfair dismissal is not one of
those
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:14:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000124">Loss
of a job can be completely destructive to the individual concerned and
to the employee’s family as well. It is already necessary for an
employee to have at least two years in the employment concerned before
being able to claim unfair dismissal. In many cases, the length of time
in the employment can be much longer. Dismissal can result in illness,
mental breakdown and marriage problems, particularly if alternative
employment is hard to find, as it is at present. Many
people who lose their jobs at the age of 50 or over are still
unemployed a year later. I have known of cases where an individual who
loses his job does not immediately tell his family but pretends to go
to work at the usual time, spending time in the local library, if there
is one, and then returning home at the normal time, pretending that the
job still
exists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

loss of a job is
life-destroying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:14:53"></hs_TimeCode>.
For these reasons, the drawn-out procedures recommended in the Bill are
quite inappropriate. The individual concerned should have easy access
to a tribunal. Even if it does not result in a return to the job, if
the individual wins the case there will at least be some compensation.
Even if the case is not won, the individual will have had the
opportunity to put his or her case to an independent body—a
tribunal including lay people with knowledge of working
procedures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:15:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000126">This

recognise that the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner,
is prompted by her concerns that the purpose of this clause is to
prevent those who feel that their employment rights have been breached
from reaching an employment tribunal. I reassure her that it is not.
While it is and will remain the case that those who wish to bring a
claim to an employment tribunal should be able to do so, we recognise
that, for many, this can be a costly and stressful process. We are
therefore committed to providing parties with the opportunity to
resolve their disputes without the need for judicial determination, and
early conciliation will do just that. However, while it will be
mandatory in most cases for prospective claimants to present the
details of their case to ACAS in the first instance, the decision to
engage in early conciliation will be entirely voluntary.</hs_para>

the claimant or, indeed, the respondent declines the offer of
conciliation, or where conciliation has failed, there will be no
alternative but for the conciliation officer to conclude that
settlement is not possible. A certificate will be issued as soon as
that point is reached, either within a few days or after one or two
weeks, and the prospective claimant will then be able to proceed to
tribunal should they wish. Those prospective claimants for whom
determination at tribunal is the preferred or only solution will be
able to lodge their claim once the certificate has been received. This
will be the case for all prospective claimants, not just those with an
unfair dismissal

second amendment proposed by the noble Baroness would have the effect
of removing the requirement for the conciliation officer to try to
promote the reinstatement or re-engagement of a prospective claimant by
the employer or, if that is not what the prospective claimant wants or
it is not practicable, to seek to agree an appropriate sum by way of
compensation. This is the same requirement that currently rests on
conciliation officers in fulfilling their post-claim functions. While I
accept that reinstatement or re-engagement may not be an attractive
solution to many prospective claimants, that will not be the case for
all. It is right, therefore, that the conciliation officer should
endeavour to promote such an outcome where it is right to do so, and,
where it is not, then seeking to reach an agreed sum by way of
compensation could mean that the dispute will not need to come before
an employment
tribunal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000133">I
turn to the first of the government amendments in this group. Schedule
2 amends various pieces of primary legislation so that the relevant
time limits for bringing a tribunal claim will be extended where
necessary in 
<?notus-xml column=983?>order to provide sufficient time for early
conciliation to take place so that the claimant is not disadvantaged.
Currently, other than in a small number of jurisdictions, claimants
have three months from the date of the matter giving rise to the claim
in which to lodge the claim with the employment tribunal. The
amendments made by Schedule 2 address concerns that the early
conciliation process will disadvantage prospective claimants by
consuming some of the limitation period and therefore the time in which
they have to prepare any claim that they want to lodge with an
employment tribunal, and thereby dissuade them from engaging fully with
the conciliation offered by ACAS.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022665000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000134">Schedule 2 effectively
stops the clock for those jurisdictions where early conciliation
applies so that the time during which a claim is subject to the early
conciliation process will not count for the purposes of calculating the
passage of the limitation period for that claim. In addition, where the
limitation period would expire during the prescribed period for early
conciliation, or within a month after the day on which the ACAS
certificate is deemed to have been received, Schedule 2 automatically
extends the limitation period for that claim so that the claimant has
one calendar month from the deemed date of receipt of the certificate
in which to lodge that claim at an employment
tribunal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000135">This
amendment changes none of that. It is no more than a
technical amendment to correct one of the references in the schedule.
Section 18 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 lists the claims for
which ACAS conciliation is available and, as conciliation is not
available for claims in respect of breaches of Section 188A
of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, it is
therefore inappropriate for the changes to the limitation period made
by Schedule 2 to apply to such claims. It is, however, the
Government’s intention to amend the list of proceedings in
Section 18 by secondary legislation in due course. We will add Section
188A to that list and, when we do so, will ensure that the extension to
the limitation period applies in such cases too. Amendment 15 will
therefore ensure that the changes made to limitation periods by
Schedule 2 apply to the right
claims.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000136">I now
turn to Amendments 22, 36 and 91, which is our second set of government
amendments. As many noble Lords will be aware, a recent judgment of the
European Court of Human Rights in the case of Redfearn v UK found that
the UK has an obligation to ensure that individuals who have been
dismissed on the grounds of political opinion or affiliation are able
to bring a claim before an employment tribunal in order that the
tribunal can decide whether the dismissal was
fair.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000137">Mr
Redfearn was dismissed from his job as a bus driver following his
election as a British National Party councillor. His work
involved transporting passengers, the majority of whom were Asian.
There were no complaints about his performance. None the less, his
employers took the decision to dismiss him on the grounds that his
political affiliation would give rise to considerable anxiety among
passengers and their carers, and jeopardise the reputation of his
employer.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022665000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000138">The
European Court of Human Rights considered that it was both reasonable
and appropriate for the UK to have a requirement for a qualifying
period of 
<?notus-xml column=984?>service before an employee can bring an unfair
dismissal claim. However, the court held that where the reason for the
dismissal was the employee’s political opinion or affiliation,
the qualifying period, which prevented employees such as Mr Redfearn
who had not acquired the qualifying period of service from bringing
claims for unfair dismissal, breached the Article 11 right to freedom
of association. The court said that where the reason for dismissal was
the employee’s political opinion or affiliation, the state
should at least allow for an independent evaluation of the
proportionality of such a dismissal in the light of all of the
circumstances of the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000139">Like the
majority of people in this country, we in this House do not share Mr
Redfearn’s political views, but the protections provided for in
Article 11 also extend to those whose views offend, shock or, indeed,
disturb. The Government have therefore decided to bring forward this
amendment, which will mean that the two-year qualification period will
not apply to claims where the dismissal was on the grounds of political
opinion or affiliation. Importantly, employers will still be permitted
to argue that they had a fair reason for dismissal and that it was
reasonable to dismiss for that reason. Dismissals for political reasons
will not be automatic unfair
dismissals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000140" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000140">Amendment

turn to government Amendments 16, 35, and 87—the third set of
government amendments. The purpose of Amendment 16 is simple: to ensure
that the information held by ACAS in the course of performing its
duties is properly protected. As noble Lords will know, particularly
many of those on the Benches opposite, ACAS undertakes a range of
functions in the course of pursuing its general duty of improving
industrial relations, including not only the provision of conciliation
in individual and collective disputes, but also advice and guidance via
its helpline as well as mediation and training. As a
consequence, ACAS holds large amounts of information about individuals
and organisations that should not, quite rightly, be a matter
of public record. The introduction of early conciliation will add
further to this pool of information. While ACAS is able to rely on the
provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of
Information Act 2000 to ensure that certain sensitive information is
not released, these provisions are not comprehensive enough to
safeguard all the records held as part of the operation of early
conciliation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000142">This
and previous Governments have taken the view that information relating
to respondents in employment tribunal claims should not be made
publicly available until the matter is due to come before the
tribunal—both to protect employers from unfounded claims that
are subsequently struck out and to allow the parties the space to
resolve the matter without the need for a hearing. To this end, the
register of claims was closed in 2004, a decision that has been
reviewed and affirmed by this Government following lobbying for it to
be reopened.</hs_para>

of requests to ACAS for the release of information relating to claims
made to the employment tribunal since the register closed, but
these have been refused on the grounds that the information held is a
court record. Such a justification will not apply to records held as
part of early conciliation and it is therefore necessary to provide
ACAS with the protection to allow it to carry out its role with
the confidence of those with whom it has contact. The amendment will
introduce a prohibition preventing ACAS from releasing specified
information, and this will cover information not otherwise protected.
While breaching the prohibition carries a criminal penalty, the
decision about whether or not to press charges will be a matter for the
Director of Public Prosecutions.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 11 attracted a great
deal of debate in Grand Committee. Much of it was concerned with the
proposal that judges should sit alone in the Employment Appeal Tribunal
as a matter of course, where there is a divergence of opinion between
the Government and noble Lords opposite. The concerns expressed by
noble Lords then were similar to those raised when the Government
brought forward measures last year to allow judges to sit alone to hear
unfair dismissal cases in the employment tribunal. Those concerns
centred on the loss of the contribution that lay members would make to
determining what was fair and reasonable conduct by parties, based on
their knowledge of social relationships in the
workplace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000151">This
clause relates not to employment tribunals but to the Employment Appeal
Tribunal. As noble Lords will know, the EAT differs from the employment
tribunal in that, unlike the tribunal, where cases will often involve
matters of fact and require an assessment of reasonableness, appeals
before the EAT are taken solely on points of law. The current practice
is for the EAT panel that is hearing proceedings to be constituted such
that it mirrors the composition of the tribunal from which the appeal
arises—so, if the matter is heard by a judge sitting with two
lay members in the employment tribunal, the EAT will sit with a judge
and two
members.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000152">It is
the narrower focus of the EAT on points of law that persuades us that

tribunals for unfair dismissal, lay

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>Indeed, I remind
noble Lords that the Equality Act covers a range of sectors, including
service provision, property rights and education, and only one of

is, however, an issue on which we can agree, and that is in relation to
the exercise of the Lord Chancellor’s order-making power. That
will allow the Lord Chancellor to order that specified proceedings
should be heard by a panel, rather than by a judge alone. However, as
the noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green, rightly observed in Grand
Committee, the drafting of the Lord Chancellor’s power could
allow an order to be made specifying the number zero. For example, the
Lord Chancellor could by order provide that appeals in discrimination
cases should be heard by a judge and zero employer-representative and
zero worker-representative members. Such an order would therefore
remove the judicial discretion that exists in the clause to direct that
a panel should hear an appeal.
While<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:35:38"></hs_TimeCode> the
Government currently have no plans to use the order-making power, we
had never intended that any Lord Chancellor should be able to use the
power in this way. Amendment 19 inserts into the clause a requirement
for the Lord Chancellor to specify in any order whether the panel
should consist of two or four appointed
members.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000155">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:36:02"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green, also raised the further
concern that the power as drafted does not specify that the panel
should comprise an equal number of employer and worker representatives.
Again, the Government have never intended that any Lord Chancellor
should be able to constitute uneven panels. My noble friend Lord
Marland recognised the genuine concerns raised by noble Lords and
agreed to look again at the wording. Amendment 20 honours this
commitment and amends Clause 11 to restrict the power so that any order
made by the Lord Chancellor must provide for an equal number of
employer-representative and worker-representative members. The
provision in Amendment 20 would also apply where a judge gives a
direction for a panel; the judge will need to direct an equal number of
employer-representative and worker-representative members. As a result,

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, I listened with interest to
the Minister; I was very much opposed to Clause 11 at Second Reading
and I am still not at all happy about it. I have always believed that
the involvement in procedures of lay members is a matter of much
interest to us all. The workers who appear before tribunals have always
been concerned that they should include lay members with some knowledge
of working practices, particularly at appeal stage. The value of the
involvement of lay members with knowledge of workplace procedures and
conditions is widely respected. The individual claimant knows that the
appeals tribunal contains people with a knowledge of employment
relations and this gives the claimant confidence in the
proceedings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:38:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000157">I
do not know why the Government are proceeding along these lines, except

value of lay members has been specifically recognised by the Court of

respected, by employees appearing before them and by employer
organisations. I can see no reason for dispensing with them in the

answering the question for my noble friend Lady Brinton, to say that
the guidance for employment judges to consider when deciding to sit
alone, which I agree is important, is set out in the Employment
Tribunals Act 1996. That is unchanged. It requires them to consider the
likelihood of a dispute arising on the facts that suggests lay member
involvement could be beneficial. It is for them to decide. Indeed, the
likelihood of issues of law arising that would suggest that a judge
sitting alone is sensible is another factor. He would need to take
account of the views of the parties and what other proceedings might be
heard concurrently. However, to answer the noble Baroness’s

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, in
Committee a number of noble Lords expressed our concern about
confidentiality in settlement agreements and the inability of these
agreements to be raised at an employment tribunal in the future. We
felt that this was a totally wrong direction for the Government to
proceed in. The worst aspect of this would amount to what we
consider to be a charter for bullies. As the legislation currently
stands, despite the attempts to introduce a number of amendments, which
were rejected by the Government, there is no protection. We believe
that this is a thoroughly unsatisfactory approach that will be
detrimental to basic employment rights in relation to potentially
unfair dismissal. It is on those grounds that we seek to test the
opinion of the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:48:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:48:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022694000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022694000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Turner of Camden" PimsId="4357" UID="13022694000458" xid="1474" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022694000458">Baroness
Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, I support my
noble friend’s amendment to Clause 12. It would make it easier
for employers to end employment by offering the individual a sum of
money in return for a compromise agreement. The clause extends the
“without 
<?notus-xml column=992?>prejudice” rule, which exists where a
compromise agreement is offered as a means of ending an existing
dispute. Any negotiations cannot then be considered by an employment
tribunal. Clause 12 enables an employer to offer a sum of money and a
compromise agreement in return for leaving employment when there is no
pre-existing dispute. These negotiations will remain confidential and
cannot be admitted as evidence before an industrial
tribunal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

provisions as it believes that they will send a clear signal to
employers that it is acceptable to sack employees without following a

to legal wrangles, particularly where an employer has not acted

For these reasons, I support my noble

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, this clause
has been the subject of substantial debate in both Houses, and the
noble Lord, Lord Young, has given notice of his intention to oppose it.
I hope that I will be able to answer the concerns that have been
raised. The clause forms part of a package of measures to facilitate
the appropriate use of settlement agreements, encouraging the
resolution of workplace disputes outside tribunals. Settlement
agreements, or compromise agreements as they are currently known, offer
a consensual and mutually beneficial outcome for both parties as
distinct from the “no fault dismissal” idea, which we
have been clear the Government are not taking forward. The clause does
not affect an individual’s right to bring an unfair dismissal
claim using other evidence or to bring other types of claim.</hs_para>

builds on an existing system that has been successfully used for many
years by many employers. It aims to provide additional certainty to
enable a wider range of employers, particularly smaller businesses
without in-house HR functions, to use settlement agreements with more
confidence and in an appropriate way. We are clear about the importance
of guidance for employers and individuals, an issue that has been the
subject of substantive debate in both Houses. We have recently
published our response to the <I>Ending the Employment Relationship</I>
consultation on the principles to underpin the use of settlement
agreements, and this will inform the development of substantive
guidance that we will publish in support of the
clause.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022694000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022694000014">In
response to concerns raised by all groups, we will include in a
new statutory code an explanation of “improper
behaviour” to ensure that employees understand the protection
and employers are confident that they are acting appropriately when
negotiating settlement. A draft statutory code is currently out for
public consultation and the Government are working closely with
businesses, ACAS and other stakeholders to ensure that the system is
understood and can be easily and successfully used by employers and
employees. This clause is part of a package of measures to better
enable employers and employees to understand and use the existing
system of settlement agreements as a mutually beneficial way of
resolving workplace issues without resorting to a costly and
distressing tribunal process. I therefore commend this clause to the

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, I have
listened carefully to the Minister, but I have found little in his
words to alter my opinion. He talked about small firms that do not have
HR departments. That is part of the problem. This provision is somehow
meant to be a remedy for that situation. It does not matter what size a
company is. Small firms often fall down because they think that HR is
something that they do not have to have any expertise in. I would
submit that no matter what the size of the company, if it does not
understand its obligations to an employee, eventually the situation is
going to end in tears. I do not believe that what the Government are
proposing is fair and balanced, and we do not believe that it will
encourage employers to be more professional in the way they treat their
employees. For these and the reasons we expressed at length in
Committee, I wish to test the opinion of the House.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to
Amendments 25 to 28. I turn to these amendments as the provision for
the employment tribunals to impose financial penalties on employers.
This is a response to points raised in Grand Committee. Much of the
debate on this clause related to amendments tabled by noble Lords
opposite in Grand Committee, which were intended to probe the practical
application of the new regime, including the reasons for setting the
level of penalty at 50% of the value of the award, and to seek that
failure to follow grievance or disciplinary procedures be prescribed as
an aggravating feature for the purpose of attracting a penalty. Further
amendments sought to address concerns, which we share, about the
non-payment of tribunal
awards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000179" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0001.htm#13022665000179">As
my noble friend Lord Marland explained at the time, the
decision to make the penalty 50% of the value of the award was informed
by the national minimum wage penalty regime introduced by the previous
Government, where the level of the penalty is also set at 50%. While we
sympathise with the intent behind the amendment to specify that a
failure to follow grievance and disciplinary procedures should
constitute an aggravating feature, the Government are clear that it
should be for the tribunal to determine what constitutes aggravating
features, based on the facts of the case before
it.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=997?><hs_para UID="13022665000180" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665000180">We are at one, however,
with the desire to improve the position on the non-payment of tribunal
awards. Proposals put forward by noble Lords opposite in Committee
attempted to use the financial penalty regime to address non-payment.
While the intent was clear, the effect would have been limited, in that
penalties would be imposed in fewer cases than those in which awards go
unpaid. While non-payment is not a matter for this Bill, I can reassure
noble Lords that we are taking action to address this through research
into the root causes of the problem and changes to employment tribunal
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665000181">These
government amendments are a further area where we share a common view.
The noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, set out in Grand Committee her
concerns about the unintended consequences that might arise in the
event that a financial penalty was imposed on an insolvent business.
She argued that for companies in insolvency the objective of the
financial penalty regime, which is to encourage employers to have
greater regard to their employment obligations, was not relevant and
that there was a risk, without a specific exemption, that the tribunal
may choose to levy a penalty. If that were the case, the Exchequer
would then have a claim on the assets of the company, leaving less
available for distribution to other creditors. The potential liability
might also threaten a company rescue, as the penalty may rank as an
expense of an
administration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000182" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665000182">As
we have made clear, the Government do not want to fetter judicial
discretion in the exercise of this power by tribunals. We agree with
the noble Baroness that there may be no merit in imposing a penalty
where the respondent is insolvent, but we do not believe that it is
necessary to carve out an exemption in statute. Instead, Amendment 24
inserts a provision in the clause to require tribunals to have regard
to the ability of the respondent to pay when deciding whether a penalty
is appropriate.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022665000183" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665000183">Such a power, which
already exists with regard to cost and deposit orders, will allow the
tribunal to have regard to the circumstances of the business and the
wider impacts of a decision to impose a penalty. It will also apply
more widely than to just insolvent companies and so could be relevant
to those on the brink of insolvency, for which the imposition of a
penalty might well be the final
straw.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665000184">My
noble friend Lady Brinton also raised concerns in Grand Committee about
the effect of the £100 floor where there is a multiple claim
against a large employer, particularly in the event that the employer
goes bust. We agree that there are real concerns here which the
previous amendment does not wholly address in so far as it does not
provide the flexibility for tribunals to impose any penalty when, in
fact, one may be both appropriate and affordable. Amendment 25
therefore effectively removes the floor of £100 in respect of
multiple cases only, and tribunals will be able to use their discretion
both as to whether a penalty is appropriate and as to the level of that
penalty, subject, of course, to the upper limit of £5,000. So,
if a group of 400 employees brought a multiple equal pay
claim against their employer and the tribunal found that there had been
a breach, with aggravating features, the tribunal could decide impose a
financial penalty. The 
<?notus-xml column=998?>change we are making through this amendment will mean that instead of
the requirement to impose, in those circumstances, a penalty
of at least £40,000, based on the original provision that set a
minimum of £100 per claimant, the tribunal will have discretion
to determine what level of penalty is appropriate. The upper limit of
£5,000 per claimant will continue to
apply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665000185">Amendments
26, 27 and 28 make drafting and consequential changes to the clause,
but they do not alter its effect. The principles of a minimum and
maximum amount of financial penalty continue to apply, with penalties
levied at 50% of the value of the award in single claims and up to 50%
of the value of each award in multiple claims. I believe these
amendments constitute a real improvement to the drafting and
effect of the clause, and I beg to move Amendment

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, if it will not embarrass
the Minister too much, this side must also add our thanks for these
amendments which, to a certain extent, take account of the issues I
raised about companies in formal insolvency which risked a penalty
being made by a tribunal, given that companies in insolvency clearly
have financial difficulties. This is partially dealt with by Amendment
24, and we are grateful for that.</hs_para>

other issues on which I would like the Minister to respond because the
amendment does not prevent a tribunal levying a penalty on a company in
formal insolvency. One is that in formal insolvency, the old management
is no longer there. It is not in charge; it is a new, quite separate,
professional insolvency practitioner, who has been brought in to sort
things out. Therefore, any penalty would not be levied on the people
who had done wrong, if you like, and had caused the tribunal’s
award. Nor could it act as a deterrent to repeating the breach because
the company would now be in someone else’s hands. The only
effect would be to deplete the assets available for the creditors,
including the employees, as suggested by the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:15:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point concerns the need for certainty for any prospective purchaser of
the business. Even the possibility of a penalty, of some indeterminate
size, being outstanding against a company for the actions of the former
directors, makes it that bit harder for an administrator to sell on the
business, when the whole point of the insolvency process is to retain
companies and maintain employment. Any additional liability could lead
an insolvency practitioner to conclude that trading in administration
is too
risky.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000190" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665000190">We
assume that the Government consider tribunal chairs best placed to make
a decision on the facts in each case. However, with businesses in
formal insolvency the impact of the penalty is not dependent on the
circumstances of the case because the cost will never be borne by the
perpetrators but by the creditors. The new clause, which we welcome,
ensures that the tribunal 
<?notus-xml column=999?>must consider the company’s finances, but it does not lift the
threat of a penalty against the wrong target and does not bring
certainty to a potential
buyer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000191" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665000191">I
therefore have two questions for the Minister. First, can he confirm
that the Government intend to ensure that businesses in the formal
insolvency process, where there is, by definition, an inability to pay,
should not have to have these penalties applied to them? Secondly,
given the professional time costs involved in attending and presenting
evidence to a tribunal—again indicated in the Minister’s
response—will the Minister confirm that written evidence that a
business is in a formal insolvency process will be sufficient to
demonstrate an inability to
pay<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:17:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022665000192" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665000192"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13022665001092" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665001092">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not think that I am too
easily embarrassed but I am pleased indeed that these amendments
largely address the issues raised by noble Lords, particularly those
opposite, in Grand Committee. I am pleased that we all, as a House,
feel that there is an improvement to the provisions on the financial
penalties, and I commend these to the

would like to address,
where<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:18:38"></hs_TimeCode> I can, a
number of questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter. Where I
cannot address the questions—some were a little
technical—I will of course write to her and copy in other Peers
who are involved. First, the noble Baroness raised the issue of the
amendment failing to address the question of companies in formal
insolvency. I think the gist of the question was that the levy would
not be imposed on the persons who did wrong. The tribunals are well
used to hearing arguments around the ability to pay and it is they, we
believe, who are best placed to take a view on the whether the
imposition of a financial penalty is appropriate in a particular set of
circumstances. It will not always be the case that a penalty should not
be imposed on an insolvent business—for example, a company that
has been trading in administration for many months and yet has still
failed to comply with its
obligations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:18:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:18:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:18:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
I also take the point that there needs to be certainty for purchasers,
which was a further point the noble Baroness raised. I think it is best
to reply to that very specific question in writing. On that note, I
commend these amendments to the
House.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13022665001197" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022665001197">Amendment

suggesting that I intervene at this early stage in the debate and set
out the effect of government Amendment 34. It would introduce the
principle of vicarious liability into the whistleblowing protections.
It has exactly the same purpose and effect as the noble Lord’s
amendment. However, we feel that the drafting of the government
amendment better achieves our shared objective and mirrors the
provisions in the Equality Act on vicarious liability for
discrimination. I look forward to further comments that the noble Lord,
Lord Low, may make. I have noted some questions that he has raised,

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, briefly, I have tabled
Amendment 30 in this group because the TUC wrote to me and pointed out,
among other 
<?notus-xml column=1002?>things, that if you left the Bill as it stood, with the protected
disclosure being limited to something in the public interest, that
could well be construed to mean that a worker would not be protected if
he or she made a disclosure affecting the provisions on health and
safety at work. The TUC wanted to make sure that a worker would be
protected if he made a disclosure in regard to the health and safety
and general interests of the workforce; that is the intention of my
amendment. However, when I looked at the amendment moved by the
noble Lord, Lord Low, it seemed to me that it covered practically
everything, including that which I was intending to cover in my
amendment. Therefore, it had been my intention not to move my amendment
and to say that, instead, I supported Amendment 29 absolutely and
completely. That is still my

upon her case and said that Mrs Donnelly was offered no adequate

left for other employment. Clearly, such treatment was likely to deter

she would not have to walk across the car park alone in the dark. On
one occasion, another nurse followed her into the toilet in their

recently. Despite the progress that we have made over the years in

Walker, a former National Health Service chief executive, highlights
another area of the law that needs to be examined, and that is gagging
clauses. Mr Walker was a former chief executive of the United

<?notus-xml column=1003?>Hospitals NHS Trust who raised a concern about
patient safety, namely the pursuit of targets for non-urgent cases

view—and I am sure that many in the House would
agree—gagging people who work in the public service and have
issues they need to bring to public attention, and using public funding
to stop them from doing that, is quite improper. We should do

that in Committee the Government were so adamant that the amendment was
not necessary and when we met the Minister just a fortnight ago, we had
no indication that they had changed their mind. However, no matter when
the epiphany occurred, we are delighted that the Government have now
conceded that specific protection is needed. I was going to say that we

the noble Lord, Lord Low, has explained, Amendment 29 would place
vicarious liability on employers for the actions of their employees
where bullying or harassment of whistleblowers by their co-workers
occurs. My noble friend Lord Touhig gave the details of the case
involving nurse Helene Donnelly, so I will not reiterate them. However,
one of the key findings of the Robert Francis inquiry into the Mid
Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust was around the culture of
intimidation and lack of transparency which prevented more individuals
speaking out and blowing the whistle on bad practice, which ultimately
led to patient safety being put at

the passage of this Bill, we have argued that the thrust of Clause 15
is to increase the barriers to protected disclosures just at the time
when events from the Savile case to Mid Staffs show us that we should
be making it easier, not harder, for individuals to feel able to blow
the whistle on serious misconduct. We welcome the fact that on this
area, as with the Government’s later amendment around good
faith, and on blacklisting, the Government have listened to concerns
raised across this House and in another place and have brought forward
amendments to change the direction of travel. Nevertheless, as has been
mentioned by other noble Lords during this debate, there is a need for
the Government to clarify the extent to which 
<?notus-xml column=1004?>liability attaches to the worker who perpetrated the harm. The judgment
of Lord Justice Elias in the case of NHS Manchester v Fecitt makes
apparent the need for clarity on this point, as the case turned on the
fact that protection afforded under PIDA for whistleblowers was against
retributive action by the employer and not co-workers. I would be
grateful if the Minister would confirm that the lack of liability
attached to the worker will in no way impact on the extent of the
liability now placed on the employer for the actions of their

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, as I said earlier, we agree
with the aims of this amendment and think that the noble Lords are
right to seek to mirror the equivalent provisions in the Equality Act
2010. However, the first part of the amendment does not entirely
reflect the relevant provision in the Equality Act and, as drafted,
that part of the amendment would not enable a whistleblower to bring a
claim against a co-worker if they cause them a detriment. The
equivalent provision in the Equality Act does allow for claims against
co-workers and we think that it is right that the legislation is the
same here.</hs_para>

me explain this thinking, particularly in view of the comments made by
the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston. Individuals have a personal
responsibility to make sure that they act in the right way towards
people with whom they interact. The law recognises this in many
different ways. For example, the law of negligence makes you personally
liable if you crash your car into someone and contract law makes you
liable if you misrepresent an item that you are selling to somebody. If
you are a taxi driver and you crash your car into someone, or a
salesman and you misrepresent an item you are selling, the principle of
vicarious liability means that your employer will be liable, too. We
think that the same should be true in whistleblowing. If you
cause a co-worker a detriment after they blow the whistle, perhaps by
bullying them, you should be liable for that conduct and your employer
should be liable, too. This amendment therefore will encourage workers
to behave appropriately to each other and will encourage employers to
have the right processes in place to protect whistleblowers. I

30 relates to the Government’s introduction of a public interest
test to the whistleblowing protections. As noble Lords will be aware,
the Government have introduced the test to rectify the loophole which
has occurred as a result of the decision in the Parkins v Sodexho case.
This decision widened the scope of the protection to include
disclosures concerning breaches of personal contracts rather then being
restricted to matters of public interest. This amendment would amend
the test the Government have introduced. It would mean that a
qualifying disclosure would have to be in the health, safety
and general interest of the workforce, and this is somewhat narrower
than the test which currently exists in Section 43B of the Employment
Rights Act 1996. This would impose a stricter qualifying criteria than
the test which will exist in Section 43B after the Government’s
amendment introducing a public interest test comes into effect. The
result would be less 
<?notus-xml column=1005?>protection for whistleblowers and this means that
many may choose not to make disclosures, despite the fact that the
disclosures would be in the public interest. The Government’s
introduction of a public interest test is simply to amend the
legislation in light of the Parkins v Sodexho ruling and return it to

I conclude, I want to respond to some comments that the noble Lord,
Lord Touhig, made relating to the Mid Staffordshire fiasco. The
Government had intended to call for evidence on vicarious liability and
other whistleblowing areas following the completion of the Bill.
However, the Mid Staffs inquiry has provided evidence which was
previously lacking in relation to vicarious liability. It is therefore
prudent to make a change now through the Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform Bill to introduce protections into the whistle- blowing
framework. I hope that that answers the point about the timing of our

noble Lord, Lord Touhig, also raised the use of taxpayers’ money
to gag whistleblowers. I think that he mentioned the sum of £15

resolve a dispute is a common practice in both the public and the
private sectors as a means of avoiding the cost and stress of
employment tribunals. They often involve a sum of money.
However, in the cases to which he refers, they cannot buy silence as
such clauses are null and void in the whistleblowing context.

purpose of this amendment is to make clear within the Public Interest
Disclosure Act, the legislation which establishes specific protection
for whistleblowers, that individuals should not face discrimination
from consideration for future employment because they have made a
protected disclosure in the past. The blacklisting of so-called
troublemakers by companies is an issue that is particularly important
at the moment. Evidence of blacklisting on a vast scale, including
allegations in relation to major public projects such as Crossrail and
the Olympic Park, is incredibly serious. We now know of the existence
of secret files on thousands of workers in the construction sector,
including by the construction firm Balfour Beatty, which has confirmed
that it conducted blacklisting checks on individuals seeking work on
the construction of Olympic venues. Many of those affected still have
no idea that they were included on the secret construction blacklist,
only uncovered by the Information Commissioner’s Office in a
raid in 2009. This action will have resulted in many
people—possibly thousands—being denied employment and
their livelihoods, many of them on the basis that they have raised
concerns over issues of misconduct or health and safety in previous
workplaces, where it is absolutely in the public interest and the
interest of the surrounding workforce that these concerns be
raised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:39:58"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
a national scandal and the Government must do everything in their power

strengthened to provide greater protection for workers in the

themselves time to consider the scope of the definition of

faith. Instead, the employment tribunal will have the power to reduce

that they reasonably believed that the disclosure was in the public

judiciary tells us that the good faith test is well understood and
utilised. As such, the Government have not sought to alter the
substance of the test, but have reconsidered how it should affect the
outcome of a claim. Currently, the good faith test can affect the
success of a claim. This amendment moves the test so it will be
relevant only when considering remedy. Instead of a claim failing, the
judge will have the discretion to reduce a compensation award
by up to 25% in the event that they find the disclosure was not made in
good faith. We believe this to be an acceptable compromise, and my

publication of the Francis report, about which I spoke a moment ago,
and the recent revelations about the NHS chief executive, show, in my
view, that there is a compelling case for reviewing whistleblowing. We
had attempted to persuade the Government in the past that the Public
Interest Disclosure Act should be reviewed. I certainly welcome the
Minister’s remarks. If I understood him correctly, he said that
the Government will work very closely with Sir Anthony Hooper, who is
to chair the commission that Public Concern at Work has now set up to
look at these matters. I am very pleased that the Government will be
co-operating with the commission. It will start taking evidence in
March. It is in the interest of all of us that we make sure that as
much information as possible goes to this commission so that if a
strong case is made for further review, revision or amendment of the
Public Interest Disclosure Act, we can do that together in the interest
of protecting people who blow the whistle to protect
us.</hs_para>

Amendment 33, which implements an amendment tabled by my noble friend
Lord Wills in Committee. This amendment addresses concerns that were
raised across all sides of the House that the Government’s
decision to introduce a public interest test to the Public Interest
Disclosure Act would discourage whistleblowers from coming forward by
placing an additional legal test on individuals in order for them to be
assured of protection from retributive action by their
employer.</hs_para>

was already the case that in order for whistleblowers to qualify for
protection under PIDA it had to be shown that the individual had made
such a disclosure in good faith. Throughout the passage of the Bill, we
have argued, alongside Public Concern at Work, the organisation that
first lobbied for the protection of PIDA, that the combination of a
public interest test with the existing good faith test will create
legal uncertainty over how these two conditions should interact and
potentially dissuade many more individuals from coming forward with
concerns. As I and many other noble Lords have repeatedly said, now is
not the time to be putting up more barriers to individuals who may blow
the whistle but are scared of the consequences, as the Francis report
highlighted.</hs_para>

for any disclosure made in relation to protections under that Act. It
implements what we have been calling for throughout, which is greater
clarity and certainty around the Act, and we thank the Government for

to do with enterprise. Perhaps I may begin with an anecdote. A British
company recently wanted to take over a Swedish company, and when the MD
went to Gothenburg there was a meeting over lunch with the works
council. The workers’ chief representative on this body asked
him the following question: “Mr Struthers, if you take over this
company, do you think it will help us to increase our world market
share?”. Mr Struthers reported when he got home that he had been
flabbergasted; no such question had ever been put to him in such
circumstances in a lifetime of working in British industry and
commerce.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000023">We

ago, there used to be interest in these matters in the Department of
Employment and Productivity, but now we have an ideology in the
Department of Business, Innovation and Skills—I should make it
clear that I am not suggesting that it is open to individual civil
servants to change that ideology—that is totally orientated to
the notion not only that should we remove the concept of two sides of
industry but that one side of it is now without a voice or role in any
sort of decision-making. Therefore, in practice, BIS does as little as
possible to make progress on joint consultation. Indeed, it puts huge
resources, side by side with the CBI, into killing off any real
advance, particularly if it arises from EU legislation. All this is in
the supposed interests of a competitive economy. What a blinkered view
it is that is reflected in this ideology on what makes a modern
competitive
enterprise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000027">One
model is of autocracy, with the interests of the few far outvoting the

me therefore try to do Mr Cable a favour, otherwise he will have to
await the return of a Labour Government in two years’ time. In
that broader context, it is now clear Labour Party policy, to give one

reason why the debate has got stuck is the ideology of what is called,
“the British voluntary system of industrial relations”.
It is true that the so-called voluntary system meant that it was not
laid down by the state. However, that did not mean that there was no
general system. On the contrary, it was a very substantial system, both
through collective bargaining and other types of collective
representation, depending on the subject, on such matters as are
identified in the 
<?notus-xml column=1014?>default list in the IC regulations. The fashionable point being made is,
“Well, what have the unions been doing about it?”. Let me
be very frank and ask the Minister a direct question. Is he aware that
so far as triggering the IC regulations are concerned, to which I shall
refer in more detail in a moment, in the vast majority of cases union
representatives cannot even get through the gate, never mind to the
canteen at lunchtime? Some senior figures in the central arbitration
committee have even been heard to say that this is the
intention—that is, that this is a “non-union”
channel, meaning that union reps should not set foot in the place
unless they are recognised. Unions are therefore damned if they do, and
damned if they do
not.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_26_PT_1/BA00213FBCE79CAED1996ACEDF13AC10961AA1D1" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 February 2013">Tuesday,

Professors John Purcell and Mark Hall from Warwick Business School is
particularly telling. If one wants effective consultation of employees
as a group, documentation and pre-meetings of the employed
representatives must be organised. For the CBI to imply that one is
needed, but not the other, is illogical, to say the least. The CBI is
in danger of grossly overplaying its hand, as it deemed the TUC to have
done some 30 years ago. It is now the best part of 10 years
since the TUC and the CBI were asked by the Labour Government
to try to reach some agreed formula for the implementation—or
transposition, in the jargon—of the regulations in this country.
Experience has shown that that policy formula does not work. I doubt
that the TUC or the CBI would contest that statement. The need now, at
the minimum, is to provide that firms above a certain size should have
a consultative body with a serious purpose. I strongly contest the
notion that this obligation can ever be met by unilateral management
e-mails, which are patently not the same thing at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000030">Our UK
regulations at present require 10% of the employees to sign a request
for the body to be established. This is often referred to as the
trigger. However, this entails a Catch-22 of classic proportions. The
very people who might be able to help with the logistics of getting
this off the ground are not allowed through the door. We know
anecdotally that the whole process is an obstacle course which may have
a stooge body at its end. For the individuals concerned, at a personal
level there are certainly strong discouragements. These are people who,
with no benefit to themselves, stick their head above the parapet for a
proposition which is ridiculed by management and is very complicated to
explain, out of the blue, to the average
worker.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000031">What
is the immediate priority? It is to remove the trigger gradually from
large companies, starting with 1,000 or more employees in 2014; 500 in
2015; and 250 or more in 2016. Removing the trigger whereby one
has to gather 10% of employees’ signatures would remove the
likelihood that it would be left to the employer to organise the
employees. These numbers would within a couple of years take us to
about half the private sector of the economy. The Office for National
Statistics defines the other half of the economy—below 250
employees—as small and medium enterprises. Above that level, we
have half the value added in the private sector and approaching half
the employed. There are only some 6,500 firms involved in 
<?notus-xml column=1015?>this group—the bigger firms—out of 9
million firms in the country as a whole, but they constitute half of
the private sector of the economy, employing some 10 million
workers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000032">Finally,
for the avoidance of any doubt whatever, I want to be very
clear that a trigger of a smaller number—for example,
5%—would be no more satisfactory than 10%. No: the system is
broke, caput, dead duck. For the larger companies it simply encourages
them to make mischief; removing it would be the first step in putting
some substance into what is currently an empty
shell.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000033">This
reform is pellucidly in the national interest. It would, over time,
materially widen the scope and horizons of many millions of workers who
at present are in no way recognised as being more than a cog in the
wheel of industry and commerce. It will, in 10 or 20 years’
time, be seen as an absurdity that we so undervalued our fellow

Monks:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to support the amendment moved by
my noble friend Lord Lea. The amendment concerns the information and
consultation arrangements with which I have long been associated, first
at the TUC and then at the European TUC. Its origins lie in some
unexpected and sudden plant closures in the early 1990s, in particular
a Renault plant over in Brussels. As a result, the European TUC pressed
the European authorities to introduce a directive requiring advance
information to be provided about imminent changes to representatives of
the workforce, and then for consultation to take place with a view to
reaching agreement. A directive was drafted to that effect.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022690000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000035">It was a battle to
persuade the then Labour Government to agree to this directive, but
they did so in 2001 and the directive was enacted at European level. It
is fair to say that they remained unenthusiastic about it. The TUC and
the CBI were asked to come up with an agreement, and from the start it
was clear that both the Government and the CBI wanted to qualify the
universal right to information and consultation by introducing
this minimum threshold of support. I acknowledge that it was also clear
that some union leaders were apprehensive that the directive might be
used to undermine the collective bargaining process, either by groups
of workers using the consultation channel competitively with the
negotiated channel, or by employers wishing to withdraw or to
marginalise trade union recognition. This influenced the TUC to accede
to the 10% threshold which is now UK law in these regulations. In view
of the subsequent history, this agreement was a mistake. The law has
had little effect—my noble friend referred to the recent book by
Professors Purcell and Hall of Warwick Business
School.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000036">Since
the law was introduced, we have had the crash of 2007-08, and of course
the economy remains very fragile. Not only have the banks experienced
corporate governance failures on a very large scale, but there have
been more general failures too. The most spectacular has been the way
that executive pay and bonuses have continued to surge upwards at
double-digit rates every year. All this has been occurring at a time
when 
<?notus-xml column=1016?>recession has been very marked for nearly everybody
else; real pay levels generally have been in decline; and British
performance levels on nearly all measures have been
poor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000037">I
acknowledge that Ministers in the Government have struggled to find a
way to stop top executives helping themselves, and to break this
culture of conspicuous excess. They have not succeeded. The Business
Secretary has said that the regulations could be used to influence
executive pay and bonuses. However, here lies the reason behind this
amendment. Most of the companies in the UK, large and small, do not
have any arrangements comparable to a German works council or a French
comité d’entreprise: bodies which can hold top executives
to account. Many UK companies have hidden behind the 10% threshold
which, as has been explained, is a number very hard to achieve for
worker representatives. It is true that unions, too, with conspicuous
exceptions, have not been very active in this area, finding the 10%
threshold just too arduous to jump
over.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000038">It is
therefore time to revisit these provisions. The noble Lord, Lord
Heseltine, has made a persuasive case to this House for the UK economy
to become more like Germany’s. A hallmark of the German model is
the system of works councils and collective bargaining, widely used to
keep managements and workforces in close step, and to keep companies
on the path of long-term, sustainable success, not simply
focusing on short-term shareholder value and lavish, self-rewarding
systems. The amendment aims to help the UK on to a better path than is
currently the case. It is time to make this law work, to align
ourselves with the most successful European economies and to change our
law—and for all concerned to make that change
effective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Brinton" PimsId="5945" UID="13022690000536" xid="2149" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000536">Baroness
Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise briefly to say that the noble
Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, has exposed a problem with the practical
arrangements that have come up through the 10% trigger. I, too, studied
the Warwick Business School research, which makes a valuable
point—which perhaps the CBI missed—about the combination
of having documentation available and also having pre-meetings so that
employees can get together to discuss issues and to be well informed.
This is a particular problem for very large companies on split sites. I
would be grateful if the Minister would explain the response that there
might be in order to overcome this problem. Even if it is not helpful
to enact it in legislation, perhaps the Government might
encourage the members of the CBI to relax the trigger or make the
facility such that it is not such a barrier, because clearly this is an
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Young of Norwood Green" PimsId="4703" UID="13022690000537" xid="1710" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000537">Lord
Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, I will be brief because
my noble friends Lord Lea and Lord Monks covered the territory very
well. I was glad to see that they received some support from the noble
Baroness, Lady Brinton. I doubt that the Minister will rush to fully
embrace the suggestion that the 10% trigger should be changed. However,
one thing that the previous Government did and that this Government
have maintained is employee engagement. Many statistics demonstrate
that the more companies engage with 
<?notus-xml column=1017?>their employees, the more they will improve their
productivity. That was demonstrated in 2007-08 when companies were in
serious trouble and there was a very positive response from
trade unions. Therefore, there is a justification for the proposal made
by my noble friend Lord Lea and supported by my noble friend Lord
Monks, and I await with interest the Minister’s
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000041"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13022690000538" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000538">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their
interventions in this short debate. I will start by clarifying a point
about the 10% hurdle. It does not need to be 10% of employees at a
single point in time. Cumulative requests over a six-month period
totalling 10% would trigger the requirement. It may be helpful for
noble Lords to understand
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000042">I share
the view of the noble Lord that employees can make an important
contribution to the commercial decision-making process—an issue
brought up by the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall. They have a shared
interest in the long-term success of the organisation, as well as
having experience and knowledge that can increase operational
effectiveness. The noble Lord, Lord Young, made a strong case for the
inclusion of employees to this
extent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000043">There
are many ways in which employees can be consulted by their
employer—formally or informally, voluntarily or as a result of
statutory requirements. The Information and Consultation of Employees
Regulations 2004 are one such formal mechanism. They implement a
European directive and were developed through a landmark framework
agreement between the CBI and the TUC. If 10% of employees request
formal information and consultation arrangements, the employer is
required to introduce such arrangements in accordance with the
regulations. Employees can make the request direct to the employer,
but, if they are concerned about raising their heads above the parapet,
they can make the request to the Central Arbitration Committee and
their names will be kept confidential from the
employer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000044">It
is true that the take-up of the right to formal information and
consultation has been low, but I do not believe this means that we
should remove the 10% trigger. If there is no demonstrable interest
from employees, it is surely unreasonable to require employers to
introduce information and consultation machinery. Employees are
unlikely to be committed to engagement and discussions risk becoming
desultory, wasting the time of all concerned. Nor should it
be difficult for a workforce to secure the necessary number of
signatures if formal information-sharing and consultation is of genuine
value. Unions can play a role by ensuring that employees are aware of
their rights and by helping them make the case more widely to
colleagues. As the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and

declare my past and present interests. I am a former chair of Consumer

of this group of amendments are designed to ensure that consumer

is clear in this part of the Bill that competition is not an end in
itself or an ideological description of what the capitalist system
should look like; it is about the benefit of consumers and avoiding
detriment to them. There may be wider public interest issues in
relation to mergers, cartels and anti-trust issues, but this part of
the Bill deals with the competition dimension, and the definition right
at the beginning relates to the benefit of
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:21:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13022690000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000054">I
regret, however, that once that declaration is past, the operational
requirements placed on the CMA hardly mention consumers. They are not
mentioned in Clause 23 on mergers, not in Clause 24 on interim
measures, not in Clause 27 on cross-market issues, not in Clause 31 on
anti-trust, and so on. After Clause 23, no clause mentions consumers in
the main part of the Bill. There is an amendment from the Minister that
does, but there is no formulation here.</hs_para>

that I suggested that Schedules 4 and 5 be scrapped entirely
except for one paragraph, which says in effect that the CMA
board should conduct its own procedures. The detailed laying down of
procedures is perhaps 
<?notus-xml column=1020?>slightly tangential, as it offers a target to the very litigious
oligopolists who have to deal with regulators. I am sure that the
sector regulators, the OFT and the Competition Commission have
experience of people picking up tiny bits of the regulations and
catching the regulators out on these competition and cartel
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:23:44"></hs_TimeCode>. By

is one reference to consumers, in Schedule 5, paragraph 63, which
simply says “Omit section 8” of the Enterprise Act 2002,

40, the key amendment in this group, says that benefit or detriment to
consumers is paramount in all operations. This is my basic theme for
this evening. Incidentally, my amendment also includes a reference to
small businesses. Much of the trading and some of the detriment of
oligopolistic and monopolistic practices affects small businesses as
much as it affects individual consumers. I have therefore explicitly
put that point in. Indeed, I received a letter today from the
Federation of Small Businesses very much supporting that

other amendments in this group deal with a slightly different issue.
Amendment 52 deals with the issue, which I have raised with the
Minister before, of how some of the other functions that are currently
with the OFT are devolved to other organisations. Clause 22 allows the
OFT to hand on and transfer functions to the CMA or Ministers, but in
practice a lot of what the OFT currently does is going elsewhere: to
trading standards, to Citizens Advice, to the National Trading
Standards Board, which has no clear corporate identity let alone a
statutory identity. The Minister has written to me, this issue has been
addressed in papers on the consumer landscape, and I am not necessarily
against it, but surely if we are looking at what is happening to the
end of the OFT and the rise of the CMA, we ought to be clear in this
Bill where those current issues are
going<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:28:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000063">Some
have already happened; Consumer Direct has already gone to Citizens
Advice. Some are being talked about; scams procedures are being dealt
with by trading standards. But some are going to bodies that are
themselves under serious pressure. According to UNISON members in
trading standards—I have no reason to dispute
this—trading standards across England and Wales have suffered a
13% cut in funding and a 15% cut in staff, which has led to a 26% cut
in inspections and a 29% cut in prosecutions. If we are loading further
functions on to trading standards, we need to ensure the resources are
there to do

Minister is likely to say—indeed, it may even be scheduled in
our forward business—that some of this is going to be dealt with
by orders under the Public Bodies Act. However, for a complete picture
of what is happening to the OFT’s responsibilities, surely we
need some reference in this Bill. We need to be clear where those
responsibilities are going and that the new CMA, wherever it is
devolved to, will ensure that those responsibilities have a national
focus as well. While the day to day operation may go down to trading
standards or to Citizens Advice, there needs to be a statutory body
that is responsible for the effective overall delivery of consumer
education, consumer information and inspection and for dealing with
widespread consumer

54 is more straightforward in the sense that it deals with the staff of
the OFT and the Competition Commission. There is a reference to them
being treated under TUPE or similar arrangements. My previous
understanding—this was a bone of contention during the Public
Bodies Bill—was that the staff would be treated with the
equivalent of TUPE through Cabinet Office orders. If
“similar” raises certain anxieties, I do not see why the
Government are not prepared to put “equivalent” into the
text of the Bill. That is a slightly separate point, which can be dealt
with easily by the Minister accepting that amendment, or at least
producing a form of words which means the same
thing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000066">The
bulk of these amendments are to ensure that consumer interest,

Oppenheim-Barnes:</Member></B> My Lords, I have to start my remarks
with the words, “Oh dear”. We have reached a
disappointing spot in the advance of the protection of consumers, with
the part of the Bill to which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, referred
leaving out, as it does, all the references that he wants to add about
consumer protection. One reason is that the CMA and the consumer body
are very different from what exists today. There is direct access for
consumers to the Office of Fair Trading. If that is not enough and can
be improved, why not improve it? The same applies to all the
competition clauses throughout the Bill. They may be good—some
of them probably are—but I do not see that what exists today
warranted such a total and revolutionary change in the way that these
matters have been discussed, enacted and valued by those consumers,
consumer organisations and others who have benefitted from it in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000068">The
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, spoke in particular about the phrase
“promoting competition”. I am not quite sure how you
promote competition—I have no idea—but what is important
is to ensure that there is protection against anti-competitive
practices that are directly harmful to the interests of consumers. It
is as simple as that. I do not see the proposed amorphous body getting
to the kernel of the problems that will affect consumers.</hs_para>

Whitty, rightly said that the trading standards departments will need a
great deal more financial support than they are likely to get. They are
respected by consumers and others alike. They have dealt successfully
over the years and most people have thought of them as among our most
trustworthy and available resources. They are being given a much more
important role, which I am content about, and I am confident that they
will, given the right resources, be able to carry it out. They have had
the experience and, as long as they are given the opportunity to digest
the role, they will know what they will be required to do in borderline
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000070">Once
again I come to the point about access for consumers. This will now go
because the Office of Fair Trading is going. Apparently, collections
will be made from the experiences of citizens advice bureaux and of the
trading standards officers themselves. They will receive information
about the big consumer concerns that will confront them but, once
again, there is no clear process in the Bill—and certainly not
the funding—for the citizens advice bureaux, which are all
staffed by voluntary and diverse workers, to go to their top
echelons. They will have to collate the information and carry out
research on it, which they have not yet had to do to such an extent,
and then pass it on to the trading standards officers. They will
discuss it with them and then decide whether the matter—it could
be a competition matter—should go to whichever of the respective
bodies. That will be their
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000071">As
I pointed out in Grand Committee—I apologise for raising this
matter again—the funding of the National Association of Citizens
Advice Bureaux, which was 
<?notus-xml column=1023?>announced by the noble Lord, Lord Marland, at Second
Reading, was going to be £1.7 million. I was able to look up the
figures for 1979, when we were closing some citizens advice bureaux.
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux said that it needed
more money, and I gave another £1.7 million then, making the
amount up to £3 million altogether. In today’s money,
goodness knows what that would be. Since Grand Committee, I have looked
even further and have found that in 1981, while the process was still
going on, I increased funding to £4 million for the citizens
advice bureaux alone. If it cannot do its job properly because it has
not got enough money, then the whole chain of information going down
through trading standards, to the CMA, to whoever will be receiving it,
will not have strong enough links. I hope that my noble friend will be
able to tell us something encouraging about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000072">I do not

40, 41, 47 and 48 recognise the importance of
consumer protection and consumer interests and I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Whitty, for the opportunity to debate this important issue. I also

we said in Grand Committee and in the other place, empowering and
protecting consumers is a vital element of our approach to promoting
growth in the UK economy. Indeed, in the coalition
agreement, the Government committed to take action to protect
consumers, particularly the most vulnerable, and to promote greater
competition across the economy. That is why we have put
consumer interests at the heart of the CMA, and in particular, by the
following: first, by giving the CMA a single general duty to seek to
promote competition for the benefit of consumers; secondly, to retain
the OFT and Competition Commission’s markets powers that aim to
make markets work better for consumers; thirdly, by giving the CMA
primary expertise on unfair contract terms legislation and additional
consumer enforcement powers to address business practices that distort
competition or impact on consumer choice in otherwise competitive
markets; and lastly, by transferring the OFT’s super-complaint
function, which provides a fast track process for complaints by
consumer
bodies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000075">Given
the vital role the CMA will play in protecting and promoting consumer
interests, and this vast range of consumer functions, we do not
consider that these amendments are required. Further, in some respects
the amendments could produce the wrong result. Amendment 40 cuts across
existing legislation where the CMA is required to consider a range of
objectives. For example, in carrying out its regulatory appeals
functions, the CMA must take into account the objectives of the sector
regulators, which may include media plurality or energy security. A
requirement for consumer benefit or detriment to be paramount in all
its operations might therefore cast doubt on the ability of the CMA to
carry out its regulatory appeals functions fairly.</hs_para>

provide that “consumers” include SMEs where appropriate.
While I agree with the sentiment, I do not believe that it is actually
necessary to deal with SMEs in this way. The existing legislation has
not to date constrained the OFT from considering business to business
markets, because if there are competition issues in these markets they
will usually ultimately affect end consumers as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000077">With
regards to Amendments 41, 47 and 48, as a core function of the CMA, I
expect the board and panel members to have great expertise in consumer
issues. However, it would be inappropriate to establish a legislative
criterion of this kind for appointments to the CMA board and CMA panel.
We should not impose unnecessary constraints on the sort of people who
can be appointed to these. As is currently the case for the Competition
Commission panel, we expect the CMA panel to be made up of a range of
experts, such as lawyers, economists, accountants and business people.
Between them, they have the range and depth of expertise to deliver on
inquiries across the economy, including on consumer issues and
different
markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000078">I now
turn to Amendment 44. In the current regime, the OFT is not subject to
a statutory requirement to estimate impact on consumers in relation to
its work. At present the OFT and Competition Commission estimate the
impact of their past work on consumers over a rolling three-year
period, using a common approach. Looking backwards helps to make the
impact estimates more precise, and looking over three years helps level
out peaks and troughs in impact. Requiring the CMA to estimate impact
of its future work would be significantly less precise and in many
cases difficult to forecast. Merger cases, for example, are responsive
to market developments, and the CMA cannot pre-empt the outcome of
independent market inquiries. This amendment could also leave the CMA
at risk of judicial review if forecasted consumer benefits
were not realised, and it could incentivise CMA to underestimate, and
underachieve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000079">On
Amendment 51 we do not consider that the OFT’s function to
promote “good consumer practice” needs to be transferred
to the CMA. As we said during our debate in Committee, in the current
regime, Section 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002 gives the OFT a
general function of promoting good consumer practice, which recognises
its leading role in providing consumer education, its function in
relation to approving consumer codes and its international consumer
advocacy
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000080">In the
new consumer landscape, the Citizens Advice service will take the lead
role in providing consumer-facing education from the OFT as well as
taking over responsibility for consumer advocacy from Consumer Focus;
the Trading Standards Institute will have the role of approving
consumer codes. The CMA will continue to have an international consumer
role—for example, to represent the UK at the OECD’s
Committee on Consumer Policy. A specific provision has been made for
this in paragraph 19 of Schedule 4 to the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13022690000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000181">6.45

do not consider that Amendment 53 is required. The amendment enables
the Secretary of State to make a scheme in relation to the
transfer  
<?notus-xml column=1025?>of the rights, properties or liabilities of local authorities, Trading
Standards and the Citizens Advice service, to a Minister or the CMA. It
does not allow for the transfer of consumer functions. Therefore, in
effect the amendment would allow the Secretary of State to transfer,
for example, staff or property from local authorities, Trading
Standards and Citizens Advice to the CMA or a Minister without
transferring the relevant consumer functions. We do not believe that
this is desirable or
workable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000082">I
take note of the comments that were made by my noble friend Lady
Oppenheim-Barnes. It may be an opportunity to reiterate again the aims
of the Government combining the competition and consumer landscape in
the reforms that they are delivering, to provide a better deal overall
for consumers. The objective is to set out clearer responsibilities and
to have better co-ordination between the enforcers and the consumer
advisory bodies. For clarity, I should say that the Citizens Advice
service will be the home for consumer advocacy, education, advice and
guidance. Consumer enforcement will largely be the responsibility of
Trading Standards, with the new National Trading Standards Board being
responsible for prioritising national and cross-local authority
boundary enforcement. The CMA will work with Trading Standards to
ensure that there are no gaps in enforcement. As mentioned above, it
will have primary expertise on unfair contracts terms legislation.
Business education will be shared by the CMA and Trading
Standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000083">As
was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, these changes will be
made using two orders under the Public Bodies Act, and it is proposed
that the first order laid in the House on 12 December 2012 will
transfer Consumer Direct from the Citizens Advice services and modify
the consumer enforcement legislation to enhance the role of Trading
Standards. Finally, it is envisaged that the second Public Bodies Act
order will transfer the functions of Consumer Focus to the Citizens
Advice service. It will also transfer the OFT’s estate agency
functions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000084">My
noble friend Lady Oppenheim-Barnes also raised the issue of funding for
the Citizens Advice service. I recognise my noble friend’s long
experience in this particular area. The Citizens Advice service will be
the home of consumer advocacy, as mentioned earlier, including
education, advice and guidance. It will allocate an additional
£3.72 million to carry out general consumer advocacy work, which
was previously carried out by Consumer Focus. The Citizens Advice
service will receive the appropriate budgets for energy and postal
services advocacy, currently provided to Consumer Focus, once the
regulated industries unit transfers to them in
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000085">I now
turn to Amendments 42 and 43. There is already a system in place,
introduced by the previous administration, for agreeing between
Parliament and the Executive that the public appointments of government
will be subject to a pre-appointment scrutiny hearing. Under this
system, the Secretary of State discusses and agrees with the chair of
the relevant Select Committee which appointments will have such a
hearing. The Government in their response to the Liaison
Committee’s report of Select Committees and public appointments 
<?notus-xml column=1026?>encouraged Ministers to engage with Select Committee chairs to ensure
that the right appointments are receiving Select Committee scrutiny
prior to appointment. The current system works well and the Government
do not believe that there is any advantage in formalising this process
in legislation in respect of individual roles such as the chair of the
CMA. For this reason, we do not think it necessary for there to be a
statutory requirement for this
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000086">Finally,
I turn to Amendment 54. Ensuring that the new Competition and Markets
Authority has the right expertise and experienced staff is essential.
Clause 22 gives the Government the power to provide protection to staff
in circumstances where TUPE is not engaged, and to make schemes to
transfer staff to the new authority. I hope that this helps to answer
the question raised by the noble Lord earlier. It would be
inappropriate to accept Amendment 54 because applying the exact
provisions of TUPE may not be appropriate in these circumstances. For
example, the Secretary of State may wish to incorporate within any
transfer scheme a provision that allows for greater flexibility in
relation to post-transfer contractual variations so as to enable the
CMA to seek to harmonise staff terms and conditions through agreement.
This can assist the process of harmonising disparate reward packages
and thus may reduce the risk of unlawful discrimination, particularly
on equal pay claims, and avoid unnecessary barriers to
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000087">I hope
that noble Lords will forgive me for giving rather a lengthy answer to
these amendments and I hope that the noble Lord will be reassured to
some extent by my explanation of how the CMA will operate its consumer

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply and
the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, for her interventions. I am
afraid that I am not hugely reassured. If the Minister is correct in
saying that the issue of the consumer interest or the protection
against consumer detriment runs through the Bill, it is important that
that is reflected in it at various points. I did not expect him
to accept all my amendments, but I thought that he might be a
little more benignly disposed towards one or two of them than he
appears to be. Part of the problem is that the detailed prescriptions
as to how the CMA will work, running to 50 pages with no mention of
consumers at all, will be seized upon by corporate lawyers and people
representing those who wish to continue anti-competitive and
anti-consumer activities. They will say, “You have to abide 
<?notus-xml column=1027?>by this and never mind about the general broad principles. That is what
it says here, and it does not mention consumer detriment or protection
at all”.</hs_para>

is a lack of specific reference in the procedural aspects to consumer
experience in terms of the membership of the board and the panels. I
would not mind so much if other expertise was not mentioned, but
consumer expertise is not mentioned. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Oppenheim-Barnes, has said, early on there were reassuring noises that
the access that consumers have to OFT services will not be diminished,
but nothing in what the Minister said actually explained how that would
be the case when everything else is shifting things away from the OFT
down the line to trading standards offices, citizens’ advice
bureaux and so forth. They may well be able to do a decent job. I hope
that they will, and that they have the resources, funding and staffing
needed to do so, but there must be some responsibility centrally to
make sure that that happens. That is not reflected in this Bill and it
is not reflected in the terms of the new CMA. I think that the Minister
really ought to accept at least some of my amendments. Amendment 40
summarises all of this, and therefore I shall seek the opinion of the
House.</hs_para>

meaning of this amendment may be a bit obscure from reading it on paper
because it simply says “leave out paragraph (g)”. It
would actually delete the reference to Monitor which, as noble Lords
will know, is the expanded economic regulator for the National Health
Service. The Government would really be very wise not to allow the
terms of this Bill and the role of the Competition and Markets
Authority to get entangled in the issues of the health service. It is
therefore quite strange to me that the Government have kept the
reference to Monitor.
Paragraph<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:09:22"></hs_TimeCode> 16
gives the CMA responsibility for writing a report every year on the
other regulators as to how they have conducted their concurrent
competition regulations and enforcement, and how they have been using
their competition powers. Given that we are constructing a new
organisation it is understandable that it is going to do
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022690000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000094">We have
had some serious issues in relation to some of the sector regulators
using other powers rather than their competition powers. For example,
Ofgem has tended to use its licence powers rather than competition
powers and has been very resistant to a referral to the Competition
Commission; one could argue that Ofwat has managed to introduce hardly
any competition into the sector at all, and so on. But those are very
different from the issues that are going to confront Monitor, and to
ask the CMA, in looking at these other regulators, to have a periodic
assessment that applies the same terms as the utilities and transport
regulators to the health service seems extremely
foolish.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000095">In
part, the Government recognise this because their amendment in
Committee also included Monitor, in terms of the ability of the
Secretary of State to instruct the CMA to take over the competition
responsibilities of the sector regulators, and they dropped that. That
was extremely wise. This is a lesser issue but it is important, because
during all the debates on the Health and Social Care Bill, Ministers
here and in another place said that while they were introducing a
degree of competition into the health service, competition would not
outweigh other considerations.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022690000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000096">Competition has a place
in the National Health Service. One can argue about how much but it is
never paramount. I do not think that even the most ardent advocates of
a change in the National Health Service would regard competition as
being more important to patients and the delivery of the National
Health Service than the integration of services and the assurance that
the quality of services in physical and social terms was important, and
the degree to which competition existed was very much a secondary or
tertiary issue. To give the CMA powers of supervision of a complex
regulator such as Monitor, the prime consideration of which is to
deliver a National Health Service that is integrated, available and
flexible for the patient, and to try to override that with competition
assessments that are equivalent to those used in the gas or electricity
industries or the railways is not a sensible
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000097">Regrettably,
this is also part of a wider picture. Orders are being produced under
the Health and Social Care Act that also give rise to anxieties about 
<?notus-xml column=1031?>the assurances given to us during the passage of the
Act—I am looking particularly to the Liberal Democrat part of
the coalition because the assurances were primarily directed at
them—that competition would not outweigh other considerations in
the regulation of the health service and that in particular the health
service would not be open to the introduction of general competition
policy, particularly EU competition law. That was a clear reassurance
given us by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and Ministers in another place
throughout the difficult period when we were dealing with the Bill. It
may be that the Government have changed their mind but certainly the
combination of Monitor appearing in this Bill, supervised by the CMA,
and the pushing of the boundaries of competition in some of the draft

Bill affects this—certainly not the requirement to publish a

Monitor will have concurrent competition powers so that a

Monitor’s concurrent competition powers in relation to the

will address the question raised by my noble and learned friend Lord
Mackay of Clashfern. I hope I can go some way towards allaying his
fears, particularly regarding the application of competition law in
health services, which was also alluded to strongly by the noble Lord,
Lord Whitty. Competition law will not apply to the NHS Commissioning
Board or clinical commissioning groups in their roles as commissioners
of services because the case law is clear that, where public bodies
carry out an activity of an exclusively social nature, neither that
activity nor the bodies’ purchase of goods or services for the
purpose of that activity will generally be treated as an economic
activity. Also, a significant proportion of services delivered by
foundation trusts would not be subject to competition law, as these NHS
services are not provided in a market. They include accident and
emergency, trauma, maternity, obstetrics, critical care and many
others, particularly in remote rural
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000107">A
foundation trust will typically deliver some services to which
competition law potentially applies and some to which it will not. If
the intention or effect of an agreement was to prevent, restrict or
distort competition, Monitor will, in considering a case, look at the
benefits to patients alongside the detrimental effects to competition.
When deciding on a remedy or penalty, Monitor will take into account
the beneficial deterrent effect of a formal decision and possible fine
against the impact that its payment might have on the public body and
ultimately the taxpayer. Therefore, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister and I thank the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, for his intervention, which posed
the question more succinctly than I did. The Minister has not
effectively answered it. He has underlined that the situation in the
health service is complex, but saying that the commissioning groups and
others are exempt in their monopsonic dimension as buyers does not mean
that other entities in the health service are exempt as providers. The
aim of the health service is to look after the interests of patients,
whereas consumers in most markets are served, 
<?notus-xml column=1033?>with some exceptions, by greater competition. In the vast majority of
situations the default position must be that consumers are better off
if there is more competition. That is not the case when you need
integrated and specialist services, and a whole chain of different
services for different conditions in the health service. This is not
equivalent to railway companies competing through franchises, or to gas
and electricity companies, or even banks, competing; they are covered
by the other concurrent
regulators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000109">This

task in relation to its competition powers. I know that I shall not
persuade the Minister tonight but I ask him to reflect on this, and on
how this could look to the public and to the professions in the health

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I beg to move Amendment 46,
which also deals with concurrent regulators. There are two aspects to
my amendments. Amendments 46 and 64 deal with the opposite issue to the
one that I was discussing with Monitor. Amendment 69 deals with general
relations between the CMA and concurrent regulators. The Government
have also introduced a raft of amendments in this area and, broadly
speaking, they are welcome. As they deal to a large extent with
Amendment 69, I shall leave that to the
end.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000111">The first
two amendments deal with the issue of the Financial Conduct Authority,
which has just been established by the Financial Services Act. Strictly
speaking, this is not quite about concurrent powers, but if we
establish a new competition and marketing authority with wide-ranging
powers across markets in different sectors, it is odd that the
financial sector is not mentioned in this Bill. Some of the biggest
consumer, competition and quasi-cartel issues that have arisen in the
financial sector, particularly over the past few years, are among the
most important issues of market structure and consumer protection.
Somehow, the CMA does not seem to have a relationship with that new
authority. Indeed, there are two authorities here. There is the
Prudential Regulation Authority, which has some impact on the
consumer side as well, but let us focus on the
FCA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000112">If they
are not to be put together at the end of a list of other concurrent
regulators, there ought to be a reference somewhere in the Bill to the
role that the CMA plays in relation to the FCA and the financial 
<?notus-xml column=1034?>sector. Its omission is very odd. Maybe the Treasury has seen off BIS in
a way that bodies such as DECC, Defra, the DCMS and the Department for
Transport cannot in relation to their regulators, but it is wrong. If
you talk to the average consumer at the moment, the markets, consumer
interests and consumer protection issues are primarily about the
financial sector—from the failure of the banks through to debt
and insurance issues. To exclude mention of that sector from the Bill
is very odd. Simply adding it to this list may not be the correct
solution, but I hope that the Minister can tell me why it is not there
and how it could be
included.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000113">Amendment
69 deals with general relations between the CMA and the sector
regulators. That is important because, as it stands, prior to the
Government’s new amendments, Clause 46 suggests a relationship
rather like that between the hammer and the nail. It actually provides
for the Secretary of State to take all the competition powers from the
sector regulators and hand them over to the CMA. Stated starkly in that
way, it seems wrong. My amendment began from the point that the
relationship should be based on co-operation and perhaps reporting
systems, and should move only in extremis to the possibility of the CMA
taking over those powers. As I read the noble Lord’s
Amendment 70 and some other amendments, it goes a long way
towards that. I shall listen to what the Minister says but I will
withdraw my amendment in favour of his. I beg to

stronger powers to co-ordinate Competition Act enforcement work and
sector regulators will have explicit duties to consider using the
Competition Act before taking regulatory enforcement action. We also

with this approach, the Government also want to send a further signal
about the need for strong and effective use of competition powers
across the regulated sectors. They have proposed that, if the new
concurrency arrangements do not work and if a regulator, other than
Monitor, which the Government have excluded from the scope of the
power, fails to produce better outcomes, the Secretary of State will
have a power to ensure that the OFT and then the CMA take sole

power is not used without early warning to the regulator. We have
considered these points carefully and have therefore proposed
Amendments 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68 and 70. These amendments require that
regulators, the CMA and relevant devolved Administrations be consulted
on the potential use of the power prior to the launch of a more public
consultation on a proposal to use it. This ensures that there will be
early discussions with regulators on any concerns giving rise to a
proposed use of the power and allows them an opportunity to

amendments will also set out a purpose for the power: the promotion of

will now make a few points about the amendments tabled by the noble
Lord, Lord Whitty, on the sector regulators. Amendment 46 would include
the Financial Conduct Authority within the scope of the CMA’s
concurrency report. After lengthy debate on the Financial Services
Bill, Parliament decided that the FCA should have a competition remit
and mandate to use its powers to promote competition, but it will not
have concurrent competition powers under the Competition Act or the
Enterprise Act. Instead, there are special arrangements to enable the
FCA to pass issues to the CMA and for the CMA to be able to scrutinise
the competition effects of the financial services regulators’
actions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000120">As it
will not have concurrent competition powers, it would not make sense to
include the FCA within the scope of the CMA’s specific report on
concurrency as this would do nothing to improve transparency or
accountability. We fully expect, however, that the CMA and the FCA will
have a memorandum of understanding on how they work together and may
well report on how they have worked together to improve competition in
financial
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000121">Amendments
64 and 69 relate to the power to remove concurrent powers. I am pleased
to see that the noble Lord agrees that such a power should exist, but I
cannot agree with the form of the power he proposes. He proposes a
general provision that the CMA and sector regulators work together on
the basis of co-operation. The CMA, however, will have powers to carry
out market investigations in the regulated sectors and can act as a
second pair of eyes to the conclusions of a regulator. It will also
determine regulatory appeals and references from the decisions of
regulators. It therefore needs to be free to disagree with their
conclusions and, as such, it would be inappropriate for it to be
generally required to co-operate with them. In any case, the Bill and
existing legislation already include a number of provisions on
co-ordination of the CMA’s and the regulators’ functions
and the OFT has a memorandum of understanding with a number of
regulators.</hs_para>

by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, also link the use of the power to the
CMA’s report on concurrency. This report, however, will be
limited in scope. It ensures there is transparency around the
use of concurrent powers and requires the  
<?notus-xml column=1036?>CMA to provide an assessment of how the concurrency arrangements have
operated. While the CMA’s concurrency reports may therefore
provide some relevant analysis, they are not intended to provide a full
assessment of sector regulators’ performance or of whether the
distribution of powers across the CMA and the regulators remains
appropriate. It is therefore not right to link the use by the Secretary
of State of the power to remove concurrency to this
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000123">Finally,
these amendments would include the FCA within the list of regulators

noble Lord, Lord Whitty, raised an issue concerning the Financial
Services Act 2012 introducing a new competition scrutiny regime for

have an important role to play in promoting effective competition in
financial services. The FCA needs a mechanism to engage the CMA if it
is to make sure that the CMA’s powers and expertise are
effectively brought to bear in the financial services sector. The FCA
will therefore have the power of referral to the CMA with the OFT, and
then the CMA when it becomes fully operational, under a corresponding
duty to respond within 90 days. The availability of the power will not
prevent the FCA taking the lead in addressing competition issues where
it is better placed to do so. When it receives a referral from the FCA,
the CMA may have the information and analysis it needs to take action
almost immediately, for example, launching a market investigation
reference or bringing Competition Act enforcement

the earlier section would not be relevant or detailed enough. I would 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>have thought that the whole power to produce a concurrency report was so
that it would identify where there were some serious failings that
needed to be addressed and might need to be addressed in a fairly
draconian way by the Secretary of State handing the power over the CMA,
so I find that lack of linkage a bit odd. On the other hand, the
totality of what the Minister said about co-operation and the process
that you have to go through before you use the powers in Clause 46 is a
very positive move, and I think him for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022690000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#13022690000128">As far as
relations with the FCA are concerned, the Minister referred to a
memorandum of understanding between the two. My recollection and, I
think, that of my noble friend Lady Hayter is that during the passage
of the Financial Services Bill the Government, in the form of the
Treasury rather than BIS, were deeply resistant to us putting in the
requirement that there should be some co-operation between the new FCA
and the then competition authorities. There is no reference in this
Bill to a memorandum of understanding. The Minister referred to
existing powers, but with effect in both directions in terms of handing
things from the FCA to the CMA and the CMA coming back to double-check
the way in which the FCA is carrying out its powers in relation to the
financial sector. I think this omission is significant. I am worried
about it, and if anybody out there knew about it, they also would be
worried. Whereas this new super-duper competition authority has clear
powers and clear relationships with all sorts of markets, the one
market where it is not clear that it has a relationship, a power and an
ability to second-guess is the financial services area, the one area
which everybody has been worried about for at least the past five
years. That I find odd. While there may be the odd reference here or in
preceding legislation that helps, I think the Government probably need
to have another look at this, but tonight I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

Truscott:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Government Whips’
Office for its assistance in tabling this short debate. I also thank
noble Lords and the Minister in advance for their participation. Your
Lordships’ House last debated the high-speed rail scheme, HS2,
last July and I will not repeat all the excellent points made then by
the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and other noble Lords.</hs_para>

have been following this debate with interest for some time and I have
read all the contributions made in your Lordships’ House and the
other place, together with all the relevant documents. I came to the
subject with no axe to grind. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, who I see in
his place this evening, said in the debate last July that he was not
biased in his pro-HS2 decision as Secretary of State for Transport.
That is quite right and neither am I biased in my views.
Since<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:42:12"></hs_TimeCode> I gave my
S-class Mercedes to my plumber last summer, making him the happiest
plumber on earth, I have become totally dependent on public transport,
in particular the marvellous Great Western Railway to reach my home in
Bath.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130226101000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000003">As a
neo-Keynesian, I also believe in supporting large infrastructure
projects when they are in the national interest. They can create jobs
and boost the economy. In my former role as UK Energy Minister, I
understood well enough that large projects, badly needed by society as
a whole, can have an adverse environmental impact. We are a densely
populated island. Demographic pressures are growing, yet we all want to
see improvements in our standard of living and quality of life. Yet, my
Lords, I fear that with HS2 we are in danger of developing a huge and
costly white elephant, with an ill-thought-out business case, social
disruption and a catastrophic environmental
impact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:41:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:41:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

small island; we are not even the size of France, Germany, Japan or
China, all of which have high-speed rail networks. Carbon neutral at
best, HS2 will do nothing to enable our country to meet its carbon
reduction obligations. Since the 1930s the UK has lost 50% of its
ancient woodland which now accounts for just over 2% of total woodland.
When our ancient woods are gone, they are gone for ever and we cannot
afford to lose any more. Future generations will not thank us for such
wanton destruction for the sake of 30 minutes less travelling time to
Birmingham. As the <I>Independent on Sunday</I><I> </I>pointed out, HS2
threatens 350 unique habitats, 50 irreplaceable ancient woods, 30 river
corridors, 24 sites of special scientific interest and hundreds of
other important areas. Threatened species include the stag beetle,
purple hairstreak butterfly, great crested newt—where is Ken
Livingstone when you need him?—slow worm, black redstart,
long-eared owl, Daubenton’s bat and the
badger.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000005">We
are told that the HS2 business case is sound—it will deliver
much needed capacity, including freight, connectivity at record speed
and it is in the national interest. That is wrong, wrong and wrong
again. The business case is evaporating before our eyes. Instead of a
benefit to cost ratio of £2 for every £1 invested, when
you strip out the Department for Transport’s dodgy calculations,
it is just 40p for every £1 invested, and it will cost every
household in the country over £1,000. The Department for
Transport’s record in accurate forecasting is
poor—witness the west coast main line franchise fiasco or HS1,
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, where again its forecasts were wildly
inaccurate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000006">Improvements
to the existing infrastructure, such as working on pinch points within
current transport corridors, would be a fraction of the
cost—some £2 billion compared with £33
billion and rising—without the widespread disruption predicted
by a scaremongering Department for Transport. Alternative proposals to 
<?notus-xml column=1039?>upgrade existing lines provide a benefit to cost
ratio of over 5:1. This can be achieved by rolling stock
reconfiguration, operation of longer trains and targeted infrastructure
investment to clear selected bottlenecks, enabling increased
frequency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000007">I
can see why some northern cities welcome HS2 as the best deal on offer.
However, the fact is that HS2 will benefit London and connectivity
between northern cities can be better improved by east-west connections
over the Pennines and other inter-city improvements, rather than
focusing on a north-south line to London. Most jobs and benefits will
flow to London, as has been the case with Paris and Madrid with their
high-speed rail networks. If I am not misquoting him, the noble Lord,
Lord Jones of Birmingham, has rightly said that HS2 will turn
Birmingham into a dormitory town for London. Meanwhile, hard-pressed
commuters in the Home Counties, the south-east, south-west and East
Anglia despite severe overcrowding will have all the costs but none of
the benefits of HS2.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:40:06"></hs_TimeCode>think that
Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield will be so keen when they are asked to
cough up some of the £26 billion subsidy that HS2 requires or to
pay the premium fares demanded of their citizens. Besides, has anyone
told the Department for Transport that the north does not stop at
Manchester? Liverpool and Newcastle have clearly been sidelined, let
alone Scotland. Incidentally, I am grateful to the Minister for his
prompt and timely replies to my Written Questions on HS2. The responses
revealed that the Department for Transport has no idea how much the
line would cost to expand to Scotland; nor does it have any contingency
plans for Heathrow should another airport take its place as the
UK’s
hub.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000009">Compensation
is another issue. The Secretary of State for Transport in
the other place said on 28 January last that he understood that HS2
would be “inconvenient” for some people. It can be argued
that being unable to sell one’s house is more than a trifle
inconvenient, quite apart from the noise and other impact of HS2 for up
to 500 metres either side of the line for hundreds of miles, which will
involve clearing thousands of acres of land and property. HS2 estimates
that for every 100 metres of track it needs around 2.5 acres, yet just
2% of those affected will be
compensated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000010">I
hope that in his response the Minister will flesh out how the
Government will keep their oft-quoted promise to compensate properly
those affected. I can see the attraction for the Government of
announcing a massive infrastructure programme, unparalleled in
peacetime, which will not involve significant expenditure until 2017-18
and not be implemented for 20 years, when Ministers will have long
moved on. It has all the benefits of giving the impression of action,
while doing nothing to alleviate current problems and bottlenecks on
the railway network, let alone boost the economy. If the Government
really want to spend such an absurd amount of money, there are other
projects which they may want to consider; for example, sorting out the
nation’s airport
capacity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000011">Finally,
I know the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, will be concerned that the house of
his late grandfather, Clement Attlee, in Prestwood, near Great
Missenden, is imperilled by HS2. Will he do us all a favour, have a

Freeman:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure your Lordships are grateful
to the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, for the opportunity to debate briefly
the merits of high-speed rail. I am a strong supporter of high-speed
rail and a strong supporter of HS2. My brief contribution this evening
is based on my experience as Railways Minister between 1990 and
1994—it seems like an awfully long time ago—when I was
responsible for dealing with HS1 and also on lessons learnt from that
initiative which are relevant to
HS2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000014">I
want to make four brief points. First, the understandable concerns
about noise and physical intrusion expressed by the people who may be
affected by the construction of the line and its operation can, and
must, be rationally and generously allayed in a planned and sensible
financial compensation scheme. When I was responsible for the work on
the line, the Government spent a lot of time listening to complaints
from Members, from this House and the other place, and I hope met many
of their concerns. After initial concerns on HS1, I believe that the
final route was generally accepted. I know that present Transport
Ministers will follow that
example<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:49:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000015">Secondly,
the original HS1 route was changed to terminate at St Pancras rather
than Waterloo. There was a strong argument in favour of that from my
noble friend Lord Heseltine. The two main reasons were to revitalise
parts of east London and to provide a link directly through to the
Midlands and the north. That is provided for in a link for some trains
to join HS2 from HS1, just north of St
Pancras<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:50:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

services will be popular, particularly with the business community; it
is easier to work and discuss with other colleagues on high-speed
trains because of the nature of their design. It is also easier than
flying in many ways because of the congestion and difficulties in
getting landing slots for short-haul
flights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:50:56"></hs_TimeCode>. There
should therefore be more capacity left for freight on the railways. I
commend support for HS2 to this House.</hs_para>

Adonis:</Member></B> My Lords, the benefit/cost ratio for HS2 is
strong, and stronger still once the high-speed lines extend north from
Birmingham to Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds, with high-speed trains
proceeding on conventional tracks through to Liverpool, Newcastle,
Glasgow and Edinburgh. The proposed “Y”
network—London to Birmingham, then north-west to Manchester and
north-east to Leeds—encompasses much of the economic heart of
England in one integrated high-speed network of 330 route
miles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000018">I
obviously appreciate that some who live on or near the 330 route miles
are opposed to HS2. The golden rule of high-speed rail is that everyone
wants the stations but no one wants the line. However, the business
case is robust and the Government are right to proceed.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1041?><hs_para UID="130226101000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000019">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T19:51:52"></hs_TimeCode>
have been claims that the benefit/cost ratio is too optimistic.
Actually, for transport infrastructure such as HS2, connecting densely
networked population and economic centres, BCRs tend to be too
pessimistic because they have difficulty in capturing wider economic
benefits. The Jubilee line extension to Canary Wharf and Stratford was
approved with a BCR of just 0.95, less than half that of HS2. Traffic
forecasts for the M25, when planned in the 1970s, grossly
underestimated usage; it was dubbed the “road to
nowhere”—famous last words.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130226101000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000020">In assessing the case
for HS2, it is vital to understand that the status quo is not an
option. Critics talk as if the choice were £33 billion for HS2
or a few billion for upgrading existing infrastructure. Sadly, this is
false. Patching and mending a 200 year-old railway, working at
capacity, is hugely expensive and disruptive. There is no need to gaze
into the crystal ball. The last upgrade of the west coast main line,
completed five years ago, cost £10 billion. It entailed a decade
of constant disruption to passengers and freight, and it delivered only
a fraction of the capacity and connectivity of
HS2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000021">Capacity
is the key issue. To provide just two-thirds of the extra capacity of
HS2 from London to Birmingham by further upgrading the west coast and
Chiltern lines, would cost more in straight cash terms than building
HS2. For starters, with or without HS2, Euston needs to be rebuilt. It
was built in the 1960s for barely half of today’s traffic levels
and is falling down. Furthermore, extending HS2 to Manchester,
Sheffield and Leeds relieves all three main lines from London to the
north, all three of which would otherwise have to undergo
massive—and massively disruptive—upgrades over the next
25
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000022">There
is no free lunch here. The choice is this: invest billions in a
patch-and-mend of the Victorian railway, or invest a similar sum in
21st century high-speed rail technology, with far greater social and
economic benefits, like pretty well every other developed nation in the
world. We should invest in the future, not the
past.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130226101000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0002.htm#130226101000151">7.54

Bradshaw:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree entirely with what the noble
Lord, Lord Adonis, has just said. The existing railway lines to the
north—there are in fact four—are full. When a line is 85%
full, it is impossible to run a reliable service because you get
degradation with every incident.</hs_para>

increase. There will be population growth in areas around London,
Essex, Kent, Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire. The very heavy extra
freight which will come from the new port in London and from Felixstowe
needs the railway. Of course, there are expanding markets. Without
this, the railway is already expanding. Goodness knows what it would
reach by the time we have HS2.</hs_para>

incremental enhancement to existing lines. This would be very expensive
and disruptive, as the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, has said. Such demand
as there is for travel could be met by a new four-lane motorway,
probably all the way from somewhere in Kent right through, around
London and up to the north. 
<?notus-xml column=1042?>However, that would be colossally expensive and

was working for the railways when HS1 was built. I endorse entirely
what my noble friend Lord Freeman has said. There was an enormous
uproar in Kent, similar to that which we now have in the Chilterns. I
asked a Labour MP whose constituency straddles HS1 how many complaints

shall seek to explain quickly. On reading the various
government reports on HS2 and campaign literature on the issue, I was
struck by the lack of detail regarding social impacts. I searched for
the equality impact assessment and, again, failed to find anything that
reflects any serious thinking. I came across only a short document that
looks purely at passenger numbers by equality

£33 billion project, this seems grossly insufficient. A proper
impact assessment, for example, would look at the population profile
and pick up cultural groups or disabled people who may be forced to
move away from the support of family or community. The voluntary
purchase scheme applies only to properties within an arbitrary 120
metres of the line. It does not apply at all in urban areas. An elderly
woman, now in residential care, is attempting to sell her home to fund
that care. She was thrilled to find a couple who wanted to buy. Imagine
her distress when they were turned down for a mortgage because HS2
meant the house had no value. No value—yet, at 400 metres away,
she is not entitled to any

of the schemes for compulsory or voluntary purchase, or the long-term
hardship scheme, addresses the additional costs that disabled people
may face because of the need to adapt new properties. This can include
widening doorways or installing accessible kitchens and bathrooms.

had to move as a result of

there is a hardship scheme, whereby if someone meets very exacting

nothing more. When I looked further, however, I found reports of people

the likely distress that the construction would cause to their autistic

tunnel through the entire Chiltern AONB, which I support. However, HS2

continuous full tunnel through the Chiltern AONB would not be necessary
if HS2 was routed from Heathrow, up the M40, or through the M1 travel
corridor to Milton Keynes. If the Government are intransigent on this,

high-speed rail. I served for several years on the Northern Way
Transport Compact and we did a lot of work establishing the case for
high-speed rail and setting out the positive cost-benefit ratio that
could be achieved for the north of England. My contribution this
evening comes from that northern perspective, where connectivity for
business and growth matters profoundly, for both the speedy movement of
people and the movement and export of freight in an increasingly
competitive
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:09:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:09:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

several noble Lords have pointed out, we have existing capacity
problems, the product of both rising demand and underinvestment. When
exploratory work was being done on the case for HS2, my great fear was
that debate would become dominated by the route to be chosen between
London and Birmingham to the detriment of the production of a wider
rail investment plan and the wider benefits to the UK as a whole, which
would be glossed over. Therefore, I am glad that the Government have
understood the case for HS2, which I think is vital to our
country’s economic future. It is not just a matter for the
south-east and the Midlands because it will help to rebalance our
economy away from overdependence on London and the south-east for tax
revenues. That means building an infrastructure which helps Scotland,
the north and the Midlands to grow. London currently provides 28% of
non-domestic rates income in England with only 15% of our population.
That is an unhealthy situation and one that requires a better transport
infrastructure to put

HS2 will link northern cities with each other, not just with London and
Scotland. The Leeds to Birmingham journey time will be just under one
hour versus two hours now, and the journey from Leeds to London will
take 82 minutes versus two hours and 12 minutes today. Newcastle will
not be connected to the high-speed track in the next phase but when HS2
joins the east coast main line north of Leeds, the journey time from
Newcastle to London will be two hours and 18 minutes, as against just
under three hours now. There will also be an hour’s saving on
the journey time to Birmingham. As a consequence of HS2, there will be
greater freight capacity on the system as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:11:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000051">I
commend the British Chambers of Commerce, which says that HS2 will
create confidence, jobs and prosperity. We cannot go on just patching
the system. We need to plan for a full national UK network and, pending
that, we need to ensure that we maximise speed north of Leeds and
Manchester. The cost, at £33 billion plus rolling stock at
£8 billion, should be seen as a 20-year investment. Discussions
about cost did not stand in the way of Eurostar or Crossrail. I agree
entirely with the comments about the Heathrow connection, but the
Government’s vision is right. We can debate the detail of

Wilkins:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as I was brought
up in Amersham and have family and friends living there and in other
areas being blighted by this scheme. They are not nimbys but are among
the thousands of people throughout the country who have examined the
arguments for HS2 and find them utterly
unconvincing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:12:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000053">The
Government claim that HS2 is in the national interest and that it will
serve to bridge the north-south divide. Yet, according to public policy
expert, Professor Mike Geddes, that claim has no factual basis, with
the likely movement of money and people being towards London rather
than back to the north. International studies show that it will just
strengthen London’s dominance. HS2 Ltd itself admits that seven
out of  
<?notus-xml column=1047?>10 of the jobs created for phase 1 will be in
London. Far from increasing connectivity between our cities, as the
Government claim, some UK cities will have a worse service than at
present<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:13:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government are pressing ahead with this project despite the fact that
it is based on flawed assumptions and calculations about its costs and
benefits. The Public Accounts Committee in the other place has today
pointed to the basic errors made by the DfT on the west coast
franchising fiasco, which wasted at least £50 million of
taxpayers’
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:13:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000054">One
of the most glaring flaws is that more than half the benefit claimed to
derive from the shorter journey time—55%—is based on the
fallacy that time spent on the train is all wasted. We are in the 21st
century, with iPads, mobile phones and the internet. Will the Minister
explain why his department ignores the extensive research, let alone
the evidence of its own eyes, which shows that business travellers work
on the train? Why is his department using out-of-date, 11 year-old data
and incorrect assumptions on the value of time? Will he also explain
why an outdated forecasting model is being used to project demand? I
understand that the old model significantly overstated the growth
forecast of long-distance trips, and so inflated the growth in demand
for
HS2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:14:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000055">I
am nearly out of time, but any fair cost-benefit analysis would factor
in the cost to the thousands of people whose homes have been blighted
by this route, the farms that have been cut in two and the businesses
ruined, yet the proposed compensation arrangements are derisory.
Overall, less than 2% of blighted homes can hope for compensation.
Thousands are trapped, unable to move, or can do so only by accepting
large losses. As we have heard, one mortgage provider has valued a
property 500 metres from HS2 at nil. I do not deny that the country
needs infrastructure building, but it needs to spend £33 billion
on houses—and on houses built now to draw a halt to the misery
being caused by inflated rents, rocketing house prices and the
iniquitous cuts to the housing benefit system. It does not need to
blight existing houses, and it does not need
HS2.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_26_PT_1/82E5DFD484AA23556D5096FA99E1D93C1ADA18FA" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 February 2013">Tuesday,

Faulkner of Worcester:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a very high-speed
debate and I am pleased to have the opportunity to repeat my
wholehearted support for High Speed 2. I, too, am going to make just
two
points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:15:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000057">First,
we are not in uncharted territory. HS1 has given us experience of the
environmental and social impact of high-speed railways. Noble Lords
have recalled the furore that greeted British Rail’s proposals
to build the high-speed line across Kent in 1987. Protest groups were
formed and scare stories circulated, so why do we not hear more about
the environmental and social intrusion of HS1 today? Kent lives happily
with its high-speed line, and for the county council and local
businesses it is a major asset as it encourages inward investment and
visitors. The reason is that the line was engineered carefully to
minimise environmental intrusion, as the noble Lord, Lord Freeman,
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:16:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The use of
tunnels, cuttings and noise barriers all help to reduce the sound,
which is low anyway because the new track is laid on deep ballast, and
the new trains minimise 
<?notus-xml column=1048?>noise that would otherwise be created at the point of contact between
wheel and rail. It is far less than that created by motorway traffic,
which is intrusive 24 hours a
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:16:56"></hs_TimeCode>. Today, the
Kent transport network could not function effectively without the
high-speed
line<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:17:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000058">My
second point is about how high-speed rail changes the way Britain does
business. We tend not to be very good at assessing the benefits of new
rail schemes. A cost-benefit approach has been adopted to satisfy the
requirement for analysis where public policy or public money is
involved. However, cost-benefit appraisals for rail schemes have
consistently underestimated the benefits that they bring. The growth in
passenger numbers is often achieved much earlier than forecast. Total
passenger numbers in 2012 were higher than at any time in our country
since 1922, and parts of the railway are already
full<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:17:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000059">Cost-benefit
ratios are only part of the story. The railway will transform the way
we do business in Britain. It will offer benefits that we are only
beginning to understand, just as it has for high-speed lines in
countries all over the world. Its speed will link the south-east
economy with other parts of Great Britain and help to encourage
economic development in every part that it touches—a point made
by the heads of the chambers of commerce in their briefing to us
yesterday. It will attract significant numbers of people from road and
air, just as Eurostar has between London, Paris and Brussels, and as
high-speed rail has in continental Europe. It will release capacity on
the classic rail network, which can be used to provide more trains to
towns not well served currently, and, in particular, carry more
freight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000060">I
congratulate the Government on their commitment to stick to, and indeed
expand, what my noble friend Lord Adonis set in train when Secretary of
State for Transport, and I hope that they succeed in accelerating the

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Truscott,
for securing this debate, which provides an opportunity to discuss
where we are with HS2 and to reiterate the point that, with the
continuing growth in passenger and freight traffic, even during a
recession, a new route is needed to address the inevitable and imminent
line capacity problems, such as those on the west coast main line,
where service frequencies are already well in excess of what they were
a relatively few years

fully support the HS2 project, but we are concerned about its progress
in the current Parliament. No legislation has been published, and the
recent Command Paper suggested that Royal Assent for the
Government’s first hybrid Bill would not be achieved until some
point in 2015, and not by the time of the next election, as was
previously intended. On top of that, the outcome of a judicial review
is awaited. Perhaps the Minister could say when the Government expect
to receive a judgment, and what impact a ruling against the Government
would have on the timescale for the implementation of the HS2
project<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:20:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

our concerns about the lack of a dedicated purpose-built link between
HS1 and HS2, which would provide the proper links to enable HS2 to
serve areas of the continent directly. Concerns have also been
expressed that the Government do not propose to connect HS2 with our
major city centres in some instances. There is also the issue of how
HS2 will connect to Heathrow, which the Government have decided to park
on one side pending the outcome of the Davies commission on aviation
capacity, which will not report back before 2015. Our preference was to
take HS2 directly via Heathrow. Now even the Government’s
compromise position of a spur to provide a direct link to Heathrow has
been taken off the table, at least for
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:20:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000064">The
reality is that this Government are acquiring a reputation for dither
and delay when it comes to major transport projects. A decision on
airport capacity in the south-east has been put back until after the
next general election. Now it looks as though there may be dither and
delay over decision-making on HS2, not only as far as links to Heathrow
are concerned but also because of apparent uncertainty over whether the
Government still intend to pass the necessary legislation for even the
first phase of HS2 through Parliament by the time of the general
election. If the Government’s commitment to pass legislation in
this Parliament still stands, can the Minister say what statutory
issues in relation to HS2 that legislation will
address<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:21:43"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000065">The
Minister owes it to everyone, whether they are supportive of HS2 or
not, to clarify the Government’s intended actions with respect
to the HS2 project between now and the general election in 2015. I hope
that the Minister will respond to these
points.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130226101000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000160"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:22:03"></hs_TimeCode></I>8.22

Britain’s future prosperity. Benefits will accrue right across
the UK, leaving a lasting legacy for generations to come. This is a
transformational project that will enhance rail capacity, connectivity
and reliability, helping to underpin economic growth. HS2 will provide
the foundation for a truly national network and connect 
<?notus-xml column=1050?>seamlessly to the existing network, serving
destinations not directly on the high-speed line such as Liverpool,
releasing capacity on the existing main north-south lines to enable
additional commuter, regional and, most importantly, freight services
to use the line, and creating more space on some existing trains. HS2
will be woven into the transport fabric of the nation. It will be

Government are determined to make this an environmentally responsible
scheme and have gone to great lengths to listen to those concerned
about the environmental effects. While I believe HS2 to be in the
national interest, we know that it is not possible to build a railway
without any effect on the environment. When designing the route,
important considerations such as wildlife habitats must be carefully
weighed against other concerns such as protecting as many
people’s homes as possible. The Government must make sure that
any environmental effects are kept to a minimum and also look for
opportunities to benefit the environment along the way, such as the
commitment already made to plant 4 million new trees as part of the HS2
project.</hs_para>

environmental impact assessment, the Government will be best placed to
understand the effects on the environment and bring forward proposals
to make sure that it is protected as far as possible. The initial
preferred scheme for phase 2 has been designed to avoid or minimise
impacts to important sites, and avoid any national parks or areas of
outstanding natural beauty. HS2 Ltd has worked closely with
Natural England and the Environment Agency in choosing options and
preparing designs that would have no impacts on sites of
internationally recognised importance.</hs_para>

possible completely to avoid certain areas, mitigating the effects of
the line is important. This has been demonstrated through the proposals
for the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty. Of the 13 miles
of route through this area, less than two miles will be at or above the
surface. This is more than a 50% increase in tunnel or green tunnel
than proposed in the route originally consulted on. Noble Lords have

this scale will be made on the basis of the long-term national
interest, the economic case for HS2 remains strong. The latest
analysis, published in August 2012, shows an estimated £2 of
benefits for every £1 spent. As with any assessment of this
kind, the economic case will continue to be reviewed and updated
through the life of the project. However, the benefit-cost ratio can
only ever form one part of the decision-making process for a project of
this scale. Wider strategic considerations such as enhancing
connectivity and regenerating cities to underpin the rebalancing of the
economic geography of this country are clearly compelling
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000073">The

not expect me to say any more than that we expect the judgment shortly.
He also challenged me about the progress on the necessary

Truscott, pressed me hard on the issue of compensating those affected,
and he was not the only noble Lord to do so. The Government are
conscious that no major infrastructure project on the scale of HS2 can
be built without an impact on local communities, as well as the
disabled. However, just as the Government are committed to mitigating
the environmental impacts, I should like to reassure noble Lords that
the Government are equally committed to addressing the impacts on local
communities affected by the route. For this reason, for phase 1, the
package of measures that have been consulted on goes significantly
beyond what is provided for in law, including, for example, a promise
to buy all owner-occupied homes in a corridor that in rural areas is
240 metres wide. The responses to this consultation are being carefully
considered, and the Government expect the final package to be in
operation in the spring. Meanwhile, the exceptional hardship scheme for
phase 1 remains operational, and offers have been made to buy more than
100 homes at their full unblighted value.</hs_para>

currently consulting on an exceptional hardship scheme for phase
2—a consultation that closes on 29 April—and will later
consult on a full package of compensation measures for phase 2.

important to our natural heritage; however, the Government have to
strike a balance between a range of important considerations for HS2,
such as the location of people’s homes as well as other
environmental and heritage sites. We are doing everything possible to
minimise the impact on ancient woodlands, but where this is unavoidable
we will provide suitable mitigation and compensation, following the
best practice recommended by ecologists. However, I fully understand
the special status of an ancient woodland. As part of the HS2 project,
the Government have already committed to planting 4 million new trees
and we will also be looking at opportunities to enhance existing, or
create new, woodland areas and wildlife

the impact of the construction project on disabled people. I understand
her points. During the passage through the House under the hybrid Bill

HS2.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130226101000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000078">Many
noble Lords who spoke against the project claimed that there was no
economic case for HS2. I disagree. The latest analysis, published in
August 2012, shows a continued, strong economic case for proceeding
with this strategically important scheme. It shows an estimated
benefit-cost ratio for the Y network of 
<?notus-xml column=1052?>around 2.5, including wider economic impacts. However, the
economic case can form only one part of the decision-making process for
a project of this scale, as its benefits go well beyond narrow
transport economics. The Government remain convinced that HS2 is the
best means of avoiding gridlock on our railways, and delivering the
required step-changing capacity and performance of Britain’s
intercity rail network to support economic prosperity over the long
term. It will cost us more in the long term if we do not make the right
decision

However, one can run these schemes but at the end of the day still run
out of capacity on the west coast main line. The noble Lord, Lord
Adonis, made much the same point. He also made a very important point
about the pessimism of the BCR and the difficulty of capturing the full
benefit. I am very grateful for his wise comments, and I agree with
everything that he
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000080">My
noble friend Lord Freeman raised the issue of HS1. There are advantages
to integrating the two high-speed rail lines. There is a strong
strategic case for ensuring that a high-speed network in this country
connects directly into the many thousands of miles of network in
operation across Europe. I welcome the recognition by my noble friend
Lord Freeman of the benefits that providing links with international
gateways, such as HS1, can bring. My noble friend Lord Bradshaw also
touched on HS1-HS2
connectivity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000081">The
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, raised the issue of why HS2 no longer stops
at Heathrow. The spur has not been cancelled; it has been paused, and
it is too early to predict the outcome of the airport’s
commissioned work or of any decisions taken following that. There are
no plans to slow down progress on phase 1, and we need to press on
quickly with it so that we can deliver the wider economic benefits that
high-speed rail can bring. The noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, also asked a
question about where to build a high-speed railway. The main driver of
where to build a new railway is the business case, and this is heavily
influenced by the capacity constraints on the classic railway network.
It is important to point out that eight of 10 UK cities will be
connected by high-speed rail.</hs_para>

Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool asked if HS2 could go to Liverpool. It
is important to understand that trains will be able to run on HS2 and
then on the classic network, so that the people of Liverpool will still
get the benefits of HS2, as will the people of Scotland; everyone north
of London will gain the

Lords, the smooth transition from the current competition authorities

49 amends Schedule 4 to make clear that the CMA will not be required to
publish certain reports, such as an annual plan or concurrency report
in relation to the period before it takes its competition and consumer
functions. Amendment 50 makes IT clear that when a member of
the Competition Commission panel is also appointed to the CMA panel
during the transitional period, the period when he or she holds both
appointments will not be double counted. The Bill requires that the
total length of the two appointments must not exceed eight
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000087">Amendments
55 and 88 add a new clause which seeks to allow the OFT and Competition
Commission to consult on behalf of the CMA on, among other things, new
guidance before the CMA becomes fully operational, and make clear that
this new clause comes into force on Royal Assent. This is a
time-limited provision that seeks to enable full and timely

relating to competition reforms in the Bill. I beg to

Whitty:</Member></B> I certainly have no objection to any of these
amendments. The Minister referred to a smooth transition. There is one
other aspect necessary for a smooth transition to which we referred
earlier: greater clarity about those OFT functions which are going
outside of the CMA. Clarity on this is necessary over and above what is
provided in the Public Bodies Act orders, which we are about to
consider. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that there
will be a further White Paper on the consumer landscape. I know he
cannot confirm that there will be a consumer Bill in the next
session—he cannot pre-empt the Queen’s Speech—but
I assume that Government policy is moving in that general direction.
With those caveats, I am fully in support of the

Commission and the OFT to allow for this smooth transition to the new

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to the other
amendments in the group, all of which deal with broadly the same issue:
the regime on
cartels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:44:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000091">In
Clause 41 the Government have made a bold and necessary step, despite
criticism from significant sections of business, to make the cartel
criteria work. They seek to delete the requirement that for any cartel
operation to be an offence under the 2002 Act it has to have been
committed dishonestly. That is an unnecessarily high threshold of
proof, which has greatly restricted the competition authorities’
ability to use their cartel powers to deal with cartels. The issue
should be whether a cartel has been established that restricts
competition and is to the detriment of consumers, not whether lies,
fraud and deceit can be proved. Scrapping those dishonesty criteria in
the first three subsections of Clause 41 is very
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:46:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000092">However,
there is a “but” coming. The rest of Clause 41 rather
spoils and undermines it. Subsections (4) and (5) limit the occasions
when an offence can be committed and provide an absolute defence. New
Section 188A in subsection (5) states that an offence has not been
committed if, despite a cartel-like arrangement, customers are told;
or, in the bid rigging situation, the assessors of the bidders, the
clients, have been told; or the arrangements have been
published; or that they are made in order to comply with another legal
requirement. I fully accept the last defence—it makes
sense—but the rest do not make sense. A damaging cartel
arrangement can exist whether or not customers are told; a damaging
cartel arrangement on contracting bids can be damaging to consumers and
can exclude new entrants—small business mainly—whether or
not the client has been told; and consumers and small business can
suffer detriment whether or not such arrangements are
published<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:47:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000093">The
purport of the notion about publication seems to go back to the old
days when registered cartels were recognised and protected. It goes
back two or three turns of the competition law provisions and is not
sensible in this day and age. It is out of kilter with the rest of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:48:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000094">Unfortunately,
it goes further than that. Even when an offence has been committed, new
Section 188B in subsection (6) provides in absolute terms that it is a 
<?notus-xml column=1056?>defence if there was no intention to conceal the
cartel arrangement; or, extraordinarily, that it was disclosed to legal
advisers. Again, cartels can damage consumers and potential small
business new entrants whether or not concealment was intentional and
whether or not my learned friend has been informed. The effect of the

amendments would delete all reference in subsection (5) to no offence
being committed under new Section 188A(1). That is, the only context in
which an offence could be deemed absolutely not committed would be
where it is to fulfil another legal requirement. The rest of the
amendments would delete all references to a defence and replace it with
a relevant mitigation. I recognise that there is some mitigation if you
have told the customers or the client, but it is not an absolute
defence. It needs to be taken into account by the court, but it does
not prevent the court reaching a “guilty” verdict.
Otherwise, if you do not adopt those two deletions, the positive move
by the Government in the first couple of subsections of Clause 41 will
be seriously undermined. I therefore hope that the Minister will
recognise the sense of that and understand that the very positive
consensus on the main issue in relation to this clause will be
undermined unless we modify it broadly speaking according to this group
of amendments. I beg to

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, there is wide agreement in
both Houses that having to prove “dishonesty” makes the
criminal cartel offence unnecessarily hard to prosecute, so it is right
that Clause 41 removes the dishonesty requirement. However, in the
Government’s view one cannot simply remove that requirement and
leave the offence otherwise unchanged. Rather, we have had to think
through the implications. In place of the dishonesty requirement, the
clause provides that the offence is not committed if customers
are notified of relevant information or if that information is
published in a prescribed manner. These are the provisions which
Amendments 56 and 57 would
remove.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000097">The
reason for allowing this protection is that a limited number of
agreements may technically fall within the terms of the cartel offence
once the dishonesty requirement has been removed but are lawful under
the anti-cartel provisions of the civil antitrust regime that governs
which agreements businesses may enter into. In such cases, it is right
that we allow individuals to ensure they do not commit the cartel
offence by checking that under the arrangements customers would be
informed or the arrangements would be published as
prescribed.</hs_para>

the arrangements caught by the offence involve price fixing, market
sharing, output restrictions or bid rigging. These are all potentially
damaging. Where such arrangements are put in place, the parties should
be prepared to justify their actions. In principle, and in 
<?notus-xml column=1057?>most cases, it is reasonable that they provide notice of the
arrangements to those likely to be affected by them, their customers,
either directly or through publication as prescribed; and it would be
unreasonable to prevent, as these amendments would, individuals
entering into perfectly legitimate activities which they are prepared
to publicise in one of the specified ways, just as the present offence
provides in the case of bid
rigging.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130226101000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000100">In
the majority of cases, of course, the types of agreements caught by the
offence will be clearly detrimental to consumers, and the participants
will know that they are engaged in unlawful conduct. In those cases,
the arrangements will not be published but will be kept secret, and
quite rightly the individuals involved will be exposed to prosecution
and punishment. Our intention is to remove the prosecutorial
difficulties with “dishonesty” while ensuring that only
conscious participation in hardcore cartels, which ought to be
blameworthy, is caught by the offence.</hs_para>

those provisions, however, businesses and their legal advisers
continued to have some concerns that the amended offence would
criminalise the participation of individuals in commercial conduct that
would otherwise be lawful. I hope that there is widespread support for
the view that it is right to crack down on cartels, but that we ought
not to chill businessmen from engaging in legitimate business
activities that serve and benefit
customers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130226101000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000102">Concerns
were also expressed about the practicality in certain circumstances of
disclosure or publication and the protection of commercially
confidential information. In a limited number of cases, for example in
relation to arrangements for the joint underwriting of certain
insurance contracts, prior disclosure of the arrangements might be
difficult. In such cases, customers would be aware that such
arrangements were common even without notification or publication and
would be untroubled by it. In other cases, the information would
already be publicly available in an appropriate forum, such as
technical standards. To meet these concerns, the Bill was amended in
another place, including by providing individuals with a defence where
they did not intend to conceal the nature of the arrangements in
certain circumstances or they took reasonable steps to disclose them to
professional legal advisers for the purpose of obtaining advice. This
builds upon the present approach in the Bill of blessing arrangements
that have been publicised or
notified<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:55:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

would drastically dilute the protections that these provisions afford
by removing the circumstances where the offence is not committed and
transforming the defences into relevant mitigations. This would not
provide protection to those who were engaged in otherwise lawful
behaviour but who, for example, had neglected for whatever reason to
give the arrangements the appropriate publicity. It would also
discourage parties from entering into agreements that are exempt from
the anti-trust prohibitions because they bring gains to consumers where
prior disclosure would compromise the benefits the company gains from
the agreement. Rather, the individuals would have no defence, but they
would be able to plead a relevant mitigation in order to reduce their
sentence. 
<?notus-xml column=1058?>That is an unattractive prospect that is likely to

helpful to address some points that were raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, concerning the Government’s approach. What characterises
the kind of hardcore cartel activity that we wish to make it easier to
prosecute from legitimate behaviour is that it is clandestine to a high
degree. That is where the bar is set. Those responsible meet in secret,
use code words and communicate through unofficial channels, thus
bypassing a company’s normal procedures. This element is already
recognised in the Bill by the provisions that take outside the offence
arrangements that are disclosed to customers or publicised. We
therefore think it appropriate to give further comfort in relation to
the offence by providing individuals with a defence that they did not
intend to conceal the nature of the cartel arrangements from customers
or prosecutors, or that before making or implementing such arrangements
they took reasonable steps to disclose them to professional legal
advisers for the purpose of obtaining legal
advice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T20:57:32"></hs_TimeCode>. In the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I find that reply very difficult to
understand. I appreciate that there will be circumstances in which it
is sensible for a restrictive practice to be agreed, communicated and,
in one sense, registered in order to meet certain other objectives.
Those may be legal requirements, quasi-legal requirements, safety
requirements or in the broadest sense in terms of people protecting
investments and so forth. However, I do not think that it is an
absolute defence. It is something that the authorities will need to
take into account in terms of motivation and judging whether the
companies involved were acting reasonably, but it is not an
absolute defence. I find that part of it particularly difficult to
understand and particularly undermining of the Government’s
general approach on this.</hs_para>

offences not actually being committed, from the way the Minister has
described it, it looks as if, in the bidding arrangements, any
restriction would be on the bidders that the client was prepared to
consider. It would not depend on their technical ability or their
financial viability, but could be purely arbitrary; that is, the old
boys’ network. That is effectively what the
cartel offence in relation to bidding was attempting to stop. You go to
the usual suspects only to bid for a contract and as long as you tell
those bidders that you are restricting it to them then there is no
problem. It is not even committing an offence. It is not even that
there is a justifiable move. It is absolutely the case that an offence
is not committed.</hs_para>

there are restricted circumstances, for example in the insurance
arrangements to which the Minister referred, where such a restriction
of the impact would be sensible and necessary. However it is
much narrower than the provisions of Clause 5(1) and (2) in terms of an
offence not committed, and Clause 5(6) and Clause 6 in relation to the
defence. I fear that the 
<?notus-xml column=1059?>good intention in the Government’s changes
could be undermined by markets or clients having too broad an ability
to actually restrict the market. This would be to the detriment of
other companies and ultimately the detriment of consumers. I will
withdraw in a moment because there is no point in pushing these
amendments tonight, but I think the Government need to reflect on these
issues.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130226101000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-0003.htm#130226101000108">I am

raised this point in the immediate debate after Leveson, in the debate
we had the other week and in Committee on this Bill. Would the
Government use the opportunity of this Bill—with its section
dealing with the competition powers which we are just about to
leave—to address the plurality issues that Leveson raises?
Leveson made the point that if you want a truly free press you have to
have diversity of opinion, and to have that you need plurality
of ownership. Clearly there are parts of this Bill which relate to the
newspaper industry. I am sorry I did not mention it before the dinner
break because it was more appropriate to the discussion of the
relations between CMA and Ofcom, but I will now give notice to the
Minister that we may be coming back to this. The last occasion on
which the Government had an ability to deal with this was the
week before recess when the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, raised the issue
of plurality with his DCMS colleague and was told that the Government
are still thinking about it.</hs_para>

section of this Bill is an obvious possibility for raising and
implementing the plurality dimensions of Leveson. It has not got
anything to do with the other areas which deal with behaviour and Royal
Charters. Nor is it to do with the arguments about freedom of the press
and regulations, but plurality is a separate section and—as I
say—I have raised it on a number of occasions in various
contexts. It would be useful if we could know the Government’s
position on that before we reach the end of Report. I am sorry that I
have done that out of order. Going back to being in order, subject to
the points I have made, I beg leave to withdraw.</hs_para>

Advocate-General for Scotland (Lord Wallace of
Tankerness):</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, I will provide the Committee
with a brief summary of what the order seeks to achieve. It is made
under Section 104 of the Scotland Act 1998, which allows for necessary
or expedient changes to legislation in consequence of an Act of the
Scottish Parliament. The order is made in consequence of the Police and
Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012, which received Royal Assent on 7
August 2012. I shall refer to this as the 2012
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000004">The 2012
Act creates a single Police Service of Scotland, which will be
maintained by the Scottish Police Authority. This service will replace
the eight existing police forces maintained by local police authorities
and the two central bodies which currently provide national policing
services in Scotland. The 2012 Act, together with this order, repeals
the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 and replaces it with a new statutory
framework for policing.</hs_para>

creates a single Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. This newly created
service replaces the two unitary fire and rescue authorities and six
joint fire and rescue boards which are currently in place. The 2012 Act
amends the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 to establish this single fire
service.</hs_para>

Act provides for the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland to be
renamed the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner, with
expanded powers to carry out investigations into serious incidents and
other matters relating to the police. The 2012 Act also places
independent custody visiting in Scotland on a statutory footing,
ensuring compliance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention
Against
Torture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000007">As
will be seen, it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:32:07"></hs_TimeCode>
is a very substantial order in terms of size, but I can assure the
Committee that it is entirely consequential in content. Its intention
is not 
<?notus-xml column=120?>to make any new policy but simply to ensure the continuity of current
arrangements when the 2012 Act comes fully into force on 1 April by
updating existing legislation to refer to the newly created Scottish
Police Authority, Police Service of Scotland and Scottish Fire and
Rescue Service.</hs_para>

provision for mutual aid and collaboration agreements between the new
Scottish services and other forces and services in the United Kingdom.
For police, this replaces provision in the Police (Scotland) Act 1967
and, for fire, it provides a clear statutory footing to ensure that the
current relationships continue to work effectively. The order will also
make certain transitional and savings provisions, again for the purpose
of guaranteeing continuity of services.</hs_para>

of the order, the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee drew the
attention of this House to the instrument on the grounds that it gives
rise to issues of public policy which may be of interest to it. I take
this opportunity to thank the committee for its consideration of the
order and address the issue that it
raised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000010">Article
9 of the order makes it an offence to cause disaffection among members
of the Police Service of Scotland, the British Transport Police or the
Civil Nuclear Constabulary. It also makes it an offence to induce a
member of any of those forces to withhold
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000011">With
regard to the scope of the offence, I assure your Lordships that it is
not the intention that an individual would be charged under the offence
set out in Article 9 for merely expressing an opinion or legitimate
concerns. The UK Government would expect a prosecution to follow only
where there was a real and serious attempt to cause disaffection. Such
action could lead to a breakdown in the ability of the police to
maintain public order and to protect society. Any attempt to undermine
the role of the police in this way is a serious matter and must be
addressed. That is why we consider this offence to be
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000012">Offences
parallel to that proposed in Article 9 already exist in relation to all
UK police forces and the specialist forces; namely, the British
Transport Police, Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Ministry of Defence
Police. The Home Office has confirmed that there is no intention to
remove the offence in England and Wales, and it is my understanding
that its repeal is not being contemplated in Northern Ireland either.
These offences are considered to be essential to the proper operation
of policing. The intention of the order is to ensure that the new
Police Service of Scotland can continue to work effectively with the
other police forces within the UK. Not to include this offence would
cause a discrepancy between constables of the Police Service of
Scotland and those of other UK forces. It would also cause a
discrepancy, for example, between members of the British Transport
Police operating in Scotland and their colleagues in England and
Wales.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022698000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000013">It may
well be the case that your Lordships’ House will wish to
consider the terms of this offence in a wider context. I would submit
that the purpose of this order is simply to maintain continuity and
consistency  
<?notus-xml column=121?>between the new Police Service of Scotland and other forces across the
UK. It would not be appropriate if the Scottish Government had proposed
removing the offence for forces operating in Scotland as this would
leave a significant gap for effective policing throughout the United
Kingdom. Moreover, if your Lordships’ House continues to have
concerns about the general policy surrounding the offence of
disaffection, it would not be appropriate to use this technical piece
of subordinate legislation to address such wider concern here as this
order is concerned with maintaining effective policing in Scotland and
ensuring continuity of current policing
arrangements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000014">With
regard to the instrument as a whole, it is worth noting that this order
is part of a much wider legislative programme to provide a smooth
transition to the new police and fire services in Scotland. Indeed, 15
other instruments have been laid to date in the Scottish Parliament,
and I understand that 10 more are planned, while a related order, the
Scottish Administration (Offices) Order 2012 (SI 2012/3073) was
considered by Her Majesty in Council and subsequently laid before this
Parliament on 19 December
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000015">Work on
this consequential order has been undertaken by more than 20
departments within the United Kingdom Government, the Scottish
Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Welsh Assembly
Government, who have agreed that the provisions in this order are
necessary to ensure the effective operation of the new police and fire
services in Scotland and the continuation of effective relationships
with their partners throughout the UK. With the 2012 Act completing its
passage through the Scottish Parliament only in June last year,
agreement on the policy and the drafting of the instrument has been
concluded at an excellent pace, with great credit to all those involved
across the different Governments.</hs_para>

is also fair to point out that neither coalition party in the
Government here at Westminster was supportive of the measure when it
went through the Scottish Parliament. Indeed, my party opposed it and
the Conservative Party abstained. Nevertheless, I believe that it is
consistent with the spirit and mutual respect that we give effect to an
Act properly passed by the Scottish Parliament. Indeed, it was passed
by 101 votes to six with 14 abstentions. I believe that it
demonstrates the United Kingdom Government’s commitment to
working with the Scottish Government to make the devolution settlement
work. I hope that this Committee will agree that this order is a
sensible use of the powers in the Scotland Act and that the practical
result is an example of how we can make devolution work. I
commend the order to the Committee. I beg to

Earl of Mar and Kellie:</Member></B> My Lords, I am perfectly happy
with what the Scottish Parliament has legislated for and I am happy
with the order. I should like to record my surprise at the strategy of
going for a national police force in Scotland. It certainly has been
the tradition in Scotland and across the whole of Britain as an island
that policing should be organised locally. At home, I have maps which
point out where 
<?notus-xml column=122?>the Alloa borough police force was: it had a chief constable, a sergeant
and 10 constables. The tradition in Britain has been one of local
policing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000018">I
also acknowledge that in another part of English-speaking Europe, in
Ireland, that it always has had national policing. After 1922, the
Royal Irish Constabulary was replaced by two national forces—the
RUC and the Garda Siochana. I want to record the fact that I am
surprised by the strategy which apparently we want to have in Scotland,
while I am very happy about us having a strategy in

McAvoy:</Member></B> My Lords, the Opposition support the measure,
which as yet is another example of continuing devolution. I will not
pay tribute to the Minister’s staff today because the last time
I praised one of them, she mysteriously vanished and we have never seen
her again. I do not know quite what he has done to her but I hope that
she survives and makes a further appearance. The noble Earl, Lord Mar
and Kellie, has mentioned the Scottish tradition of policing but we all
have to recognise devolution and its implications. There was a
consultation process that was very supportive and there did not seem to
be any dissenting voices to the proposal. As the Minister rightly says,
this is necessary after the 2012 Act. I cannot quite remember the
context in which he mentioned torture, but I do not think that that has
relevance on
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:40:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000020">There
are comparisons with other nations and regions of the United
Kingdom—we all understand the Northern Ireland one—but
the Scottish Government have considerable powers and I can understand
why there are reservations about having a national police force against
a background of the police always being regionally organised. I was on
the police and fire committee of Strathclyde regional council, which
has a very good operation. The Minister mentioned that there
were 14 abstentions in the Scottish Parliament—I presume
that that was his own party, or did the Liberal Democrats vote
against<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:41:25"></hs_TimeCode>? I

the report is rightly subject to scrutiny and questioning, I want to
develop a wee bit further the principle of disaffection. As a trade
unionist, the word “disaffection” towards anything raises
questions. It has been mentioned that some of the clarification that
the Minister’s staff was able to pass on was on questions asked
by the committee regarding who could be charged with disaffection. The
initial reply seemed to indicate that only certain police could be
charged with disaffection, but further clarification suggested that it
could apply to a member of the public as well. Although I totally
accept the Minister’s point that the Government do not envisage
anyone being charged with this wrongly, unfairly, or whatever, he will
know better than I do that legal history is full of people who have
been prosecuted for offences for which at the time it was indicated
they would not be prosecuted. So, I would like further clarification on
disaffection because the police are different. It is acknowledged that
they are not allowed to join trade unions. We have to have law and
order and a legal system, so it is right that in case anybody tries to
suborn or undermine the police in carrying out their duties,
the defence should stay
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:43:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

go a bit further in giving us assurances that no “innocent
bystanders” who have had a pint too much on a Saturday night and
preach treason—I have certainly done that myself a few times
with pints of soda water and lime, I hasten to add—will be
prosecuted. I seek assurances that ordinary members of the public,
letting off steam—to use one of the expressions
mentioned—will not be liberally prosecuted. I will leave it at
that and hope that the Minister can give us some of those answers. That

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank both my noble
friend Lord Mar and Kellie and the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, for their
contributions to the debate. I note the concerns of my noble friend
with regard to the establishment of a national police force. He will be
aware, as I indicated in opening, that our Scottish Liberal Democrat
colleagues in the Scottish Parliament voted against this. At one point
the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, suggested that the 14 were Liberal
Democrats—if only we had 14 Members in the Scottish Parliament.
It was five Liberal Democrats and one Green who voted against and 14
Conservatives who abstained. The point is not about whether we support
this policy intent, but that the Act was properly passed by the
Scottish Parliament, and by a large majority. It is very consistent and
in the spirit of the devolution settlement that this Parliament,
through the use of a Section 104 order, should give effect to the
intentions of the Scottish Parliament in areas where, because of its
competence, it was not able to do so. It is in that spirit of making
the devolution settlement work that we bring forward this
order.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord McAvoy, asked particularly about Article 9 and the issue
that was raised by the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. He is
right on disaffection inasmuch as it is not just members of the police
force who could possibly comment such an offence. Anyone attempting to
persuade a member of the police force not to serve could expose
themselves to a possible prosecution but, as I indicated and the noble
Lord accepted, this is not about expressing an opinion or engaging in
debate. We said in response to questions from the Secondary Legislation
Scrutiny Committee—I think it had been in one of the earlier
responses about the chat in the pub—that we presumed that the
committee meant a chat in the pub between police officers. That was why
the context of the reply was framed as it was, in an attempt to give a
directed answer to the committee’s concern. However, it is
possible for the offence to be committed by persons who are not members
of police forces in the first instance. I hope this clarifies it. The
first sentence contained a general statement to set the scene before
focusing on the perceived aspect about which the committee was
concerned.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022698000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000025">I
hope I can give some assurance to the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, in that
we are not aware of any prosecution having been raised in relation to
the provisions which are currently in Section 42 of the Police
(Scotland) Act 1967. They have been on the statute book for more than
45 years and there is no reported case; nor indeed does there appear to
be any reported case involving 
<?notus-xml column=124?>equivalent offences in other legislation which applies to other police
forces within the United Kingdom. The lack of any cases implies that
the sort of conduct which appears to be the cause for concern has not
hitherto given rise to a criminal prosecution since 1967 but that does
not mean, as I hope I explained in my opening remarks, that it is not
relevant in 2013. The offence has a powerful impact in deterring
behaviour which could otherwise undermine the effectiveness of the
police forces.</hs_para>

provision, it would be better if that took place in a wider debate and

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</Member></B> My
Lords, as regards the draft Conditional Fee Agreements Order 2013 and
the draft Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2013, perhaps I may
remind noble Lords that conditional fee agreements, or CFAs, are means
of funding litigation that are usually entered into by claimants where
the lawyer agrees not to take a fee if the claim fails. If the claim is
successful, the lawyer may charge an uplift known as a success fee, in
addition to their fee. Under the existing regime, the success fee is
recovered from the losing defendant, in addition to the base
fee.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022698000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000030">The
statutory power under which the draft Conditional Fee Agreements Order
2013 is made governs the regulation of CFAs and the recoverability of
success fees payable under a CFA. Under Section 44 of the Legal Aid,
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012—the LASPO
Act—the success fee payable under a CFA is no longer recoverable
from the losing party, but will be payable by the successful client
subject to a prescribed
cap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000031">Lord
Justice Jackson, in his report, <I>Review of Civil Litigation
Costs</I>, argued that the current regime had led to excessive costs in
civil litigation, with risk-free litigation for claimants and
additional costs being paid by defendants. He therefore recommended
that recoverability from the losing side should be abolished in all
cases, and this has been reflected in the provisions of Section 44 of
the LASPO Act.</hs_para>

also recommended that CFA success fees in personal injury cases should
be limited to 25% of damages, excluding damages awarded for future care

5 sets the cap. This means that in personal injury claims, the CFA must
not provide for a success fee which is greater than 25% of the damages

damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity, and damages for past

that there has been concern about the 25% cap and some representatives
argue that this should be against all heads of damages. However, the

there will be a cap on the amount of damages that may be taken as a
success fee of 25% of the damages, excluding damages for future care

now turn to the draft Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2013. A
damages-based agreement or DBA is a privately funded arrangement
between a representative and a client whereby the
representative’s agreed fee is contingent on the success of the
case, and is determined as a percentage of the compensation received by
the client. Until now, DBAs have not been permitted in litigation
before the courts, but their use has developed in non-contentious
business—that is, work that falls outside the courts, including
employment matters. However, Lord Justice Jackson recommended that DBAs
should be extended to all areas of civil litigation. He argued that
this would provide litigants with a 
<?notus-xml column=126?>choice of funding methods and the freedom to choose the one that they

45 of the LASPO Act therefore permits the use of DBAs in all areas of
civil litigation. This section enables the Lord Chancellor to regulate
their use and, in particular, to specify the maximum payment that may
be made from damages under a DBA in particular proceedings. The draft
regulations revoke the 2010 DBA regulations but replicate their
provisions in respect of employment
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T15:56:16"></hs_TimeCode>. The

I mentioned earlier, a similar, although not identical, approach has
been taken for CFAs. The Government believe that there should be a cap

the provisions from the 2010 regulations for employment matters. These
detailed provisions in relation to information and other matters are
necessary because employment matters may be undertaken by non-lawyers
such as claims managers. On the other hand, civil litigation can be
undertaken only by qualified legal representatives, who are subject to

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> I have only one simple point to make.
It is a question to the Minister regarding the Conditional Fee
Agreements Order, particularly the 25% cap, which does not apply to any
future losses. In moving this piece of legislation, the Minister rested
his case heavily on proposals made by Lord Justice Jackson in his
review. Is the Minister aware of a lecture Lord Justice Jackson gave on
29 February last year? In this lecture, he made a point, which appears
in the footnote,
stating:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13022698000209" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000209">“The
Personal Injuries Bar Association (PIBA) and the Bar Council have
recently sent to me forceful submissions that the 25% cap should apply
to ALL damages, as it did before April 2000. I can see the sense of
allowing that dispensation in appropriate cases provided that the
success fee is only payable by the client as it was pre-April
2000”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13022698000190" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000190">That
seems reasonable and it seems doubly reasonable given that the author
of these proposals, Lord Justice Jackson, himself had second thoughts
which he expressed in public last year. I am wondering, therefore, why
the limitation to past losses survives into this statutory instrument

thinking of Lord Justice Jackson, which is supported by the Bar Council

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I always like to be consistent and it
certainly would be inconsistent of me not to begin with a complaint
about the process here. These regulations come to us some five weeks
before they are to take effect. The Bar Council has drawn attention to
this, rightly stressing that a major change in the law, particularly in
relation to DBAs, is being introduced with very little time before they
come into effect for people to work out how they are going to be
applied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:12:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

said, it has always been permissible for damages-based agreements to be
implemented in non-contentious matters in tribunals. As he has also
said, these were extended by regulations to employment cases. That
opened the way to the revival of what used to be called
“champerty” in previous times, which of course was
unlawful. We are now legalising it under the new nomenclature of
damages-based agreements and I can see that there is a case for doing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:13:26"></hs_TimeCode>.
Nevertheless, significant issues and questions arise from the

to the timescale, it should be pointed out that other changes affecting
contentious litigation are in hand. These include changes to the Road
Traffic Act portal and small claims limits in cases, including,
potentially, personal injury cases. With all that happening, one might
have thought that it would be sensible to bring all the changes
together and to do it at a time which allows the parties and the
professions to prepare adequately. I hope that the Minister will look
again at the timetabling with a view to deferring implementation of
whatever regulations finally emerge for six months until October of
this year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:14:23"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
particularly indebted to those who have briefed me, and no doubt other

number of issues arise and I hope that the Minister will be patient
while I list them. If he is not able to reply to them all
today—he may well not be—I hope that he will take these
matters back and consider them. I was going to raise the question of
the cap, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. I, too,
identified the change of mind by Lord Justice Jackson, to which the
noble Lord referred. It is notable of course that the 25% cap in terms
of damages-based agreements applies only to personal injury cases. It
is a 35% cap in employment cases, which can equally be quite
substantial, although not, I guess, running into the millions of pounds
of the exceptional cases of clinical evidence and the like to which the
Minister referred. Nevertheless, it certainly can be comparable with
many ordinary personal injury cases. In those cases, the cap is 35%
including future loss, so there is a serious question about the
composition of the figure against which the percentage is to be
calculated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:16:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13022698000233" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000233">4.15

is also a perverse situation, which the Minister explained by reference
to the indemnity principle, where if recoverable costs—that is
to say, costs which would normally be payable by the
defendant—exceed the cap, the claimant and his advocate, the
solicitor, cannot recover them from the defendant. That is a perverse
consequence of the way the regulations are drafted. That makes
damages-based agreements less attractive to the professionals who will
undertake that
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:16:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000056">There
is similarly a problem about including VAT in the cap. Of course, rates
of VAT can change. The Government increased VAT by 2.5% 18 months ago.
If agreements had been in place at that time, the cap 
<?notus-xml column=129?>would effectively have been lower because of the increased VAT that
would then have been levied on the fees above what had been originally

will change automatically, whether or not the parties wish it to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000057">There is a
similar issue—except in employment cases,
interestingly—for counsel’s fees. Counsel’s fees
are included in the cap for the ordinary PI case but not in employment
cases. Why should that be the case? There is another issue about
after-the-event insurance. It is not clear from the regulations whether
the cost of after-the-event insurance is to be contained within the cap
or not. The Civil Justice Council working party recommended that that
matter be clarified. Perhaps the Minister could do so—again, if
not today,
subsequently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000058">In
commercial cases, there is a question whether the percentage recovered
includes party and party costs, or is that also to be on a
non-recoverable basis? In connection with personal injury cases, again
there is the issue of the inclusion of general damages and past loss. I
still do not see the justification for that. As the noble Lord, Lord
Phillips, and I have mentioned, Lord Justice Jackson took a different
view. There is also a question about how you deal with where a global
offer is made. Offers are not always split under particular headings; a
composite offer can be made. How will that be dealt with for the
purpose of calculating the success
fee?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000059">In terms
of process, the regulations and the scheme do not set out any system of
regulation or, indeed, for the termination of such agreements. The
Civil Justice Council working party suggested that should be embodied
in the regulations; it does not appear. The Government seem content to
rely on the professional codes of conduct of the Law Society and the
Bar Council. Indeed, in answer to a recent parliamentary Written
Question, the Minister replied that it was not the Government’s
intention to regulate the industry, which leaves claims management
companies outside the scope of regulation—except, as it happens,
in the case of employment. That is another inconsistency between the
approaches to employment cases and other
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000060">Why are
the Government content to rely on claims management companies, which
might well get involved in these agreements, to regulate themselves? It
is one thing for a profession to do that—although even that
might be regarded as inadequate in certain quarters—but it is
certainly another for claims management companies to do so, especially
given the reputation that they have acquired over the past few years.
There is not even any provision in the regulations on the information
that is to be provided for clients by the providers except, again, in
the case of employment law. Why is there a distinction between
employment law and other cases in that respect? In short, as the Civil
Justice Council effectively inquired, why is there not one set of
regulations for all kinds of case? Why are there differences between
the different
categories<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:21:25"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000061">There
is also the question of potential liability for the payment of the
defendant’s costs and whether these could be covered by
after-the-event insurance. 
<?notus-xml column=130?>Another issue relates to defendants. The regulations are cast on the
basis that we are concerned only with damages-based agreements for
claimants, but of course, defendants have a financial interest in these
matters as well. The regulations speak only about a percentage success
fee in relation to the money recovered but not to money saved. If a
defendant is successful and saves money, how will the fee be
calculated? Is there a basis for a damages-based agreement, as it were,
when a successful defendant saves money under such an agreement? It is
unclear what will then
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:22:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000062">It
is instructive to look at some of the experience of other
jurisdictions—particularly the American experience. A whole
industry has grown up in this arena and I had the benefit of meeting
representatives in America who are dealing with these issues. They
expressed some interesting views about how the system works. Going back
to the lawyer/client relationship, in practice it is not the lawyer who
has control of the case in the American system with the professional
disciplines that might apply. Effectively, it is the commercial
organisation that is engaged in putting up the money for these
cases—a kind of hedge fund for legal claims. I used that phrase
when the Bill was going through. That is in marked contrast to the
position of professionals with their ethical obligations, to which the
Minister referred. I understand that 25 funders are already established
in the UK for damages-based agreements, of which only nine have signed
up to their own self-regulated Association of Litigation Funders. They
are not even joining their own association, let alone being responsible
to any independent and impartial organisation to oversee their work.
Again, I invite the Minister to reconsider whether there should be such
a system of regulation. There is apparently around £1 billion
already held by organisations in the UK to fund these arrangements.
Some of them, interestingly, are apparently based offshore—a
sort of Starbucks of the damages-based agreement world. One can only
imagine where any profits will ultimately

are also questions about class actions. The organisation I met from
America was essentially very concerned about the potential growth of
class actions from the point of view of potential defendants.
Nevertheless, there is an issue as to whether the scheme should apply
to class actions. I understand that the Department for Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is looking into this. I wonder whether
the Minister can advise us on the current state of thinking in those
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T16:25:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000064">With
regard to damages-based agreements, there are, as will be seen, a great
many questions that are raised by the regulations but not answered by
them. Again having regard to the timescale, I urge the Minister to
consider whether it would be sensible to look into all these, and other
points that might be raised by other noble Lords today or in the House
of Commons when the matter is debated there, and, if necessary, to
defer implementation until these issues are clarified. A few
months’ delay does not seem to be too much to ask in order to
get things right from the

arguments apply to conditional fee agreements—again, the issue
of damages for the purposes of the calculation of a success fee, not

would also be sensible to look at these two sets of regulations
together to see whether they can be improved in order to fill the quite
evident gaps that exist, which cannot help the new system to bed in.
The risk is that if there are problems of this kind, the
Government’s purpose in promoting DBAs, or indeed the new regime
of CFAs, as an alternative to legal aid will not succeed because the
professions will not undertake the risks or, alternatively, it will not
be the professions that run the show but commercial organisations with
very little regard necessarily to the proprieties with which litigation
has been, and should be, conducted in this country. I urge the
Government to think again, look again at the Civil Justice

suspicious of Ministers who at any time rest too much on a report, no
matter how learned. I do not rest the case for the 25% cap on that
being Lord Justice Jackson’s original recommendation, although
indeed it was. A sharp-eyed lawyer would say that the noble
Lord’s quote about Lord Justice Jackson did not endorse the
counterview but simply said that it had merit, which is not the same as
advocating that the Government change their policy. Even if it were,
this is the Government’s policy. It is the right policy because
it protects the future earnings and the future cover for victims in
these cases. It remains our policy on that merit, and we are willing to
defend it on that

nimbleness and fleetness of foot in all parts of the legal profession,
if we are to take advantage of the changes that are going through. We
are not persuaded that the timescales we have set are unreasonable, and
we will not be deferred from the course that we have set. We have taken
account of reasons for delay regarding mesothelioma and privacy, which

I might deal with a number of the specific questions that the noble
Lord, Lord Beecham, raised. He was very correct to raise the issue of
the American experience in DBAs. I also met the organisation that came
over to present its case. I left that meeting with some of his concerns
about what this might bring into our legal system. The noble
Lord’s description of hedge funds for legal claims is something
that we are very conscious of. What we have decided so far is to keep
the matter under review. That phrase can often hide weasel words and
weasel intent, but we want to see just how much this is going to become
a factor in our legal system, while making sure that some of the
warning signs that the noble Lord has quite legitimately raised are on
the radar of Ministers as well. We will keep this matter closely under
review.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022698000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000076">The
noble Lord raised the issue of VAT on the 25% cap. The 25% cap on
success fees is as recommended by Lord Justice Jackson. Including VAT
on the success fee on lawyers’ fees within the cap will provide
further protection for the claimant’s damages and add certainty 
<?notus-xml column=133?>for the claimant as to the likely deduction from their damages. This
approach is also consistent with the existing cap of 35%, inclusive of
VAT, on payments to be made from damages in respect of DBAs in
employment matters. The noble Lord also asked about the indemnity
principle. DBAs are an alternative method of funding and it would be
for solicitors to advise their clients on the most appropriate method
of funding according to the circumstances of each case. He also
mentioned there being one set of regulations. There is one set of
regulations covering both civil litigation and employment cases, as
recommended by the Civil Justice Council. We have listened to the
concerns of the Law Society and others that there should not be too
much regulation in respect of civil litigation in these instruments.
This is because failure to comply with the provisions in the
instruments would make the agreements unenforceable. As I have said,
lawyers are properly regulated in any
event.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000077">The
noble Lord asked whether the cost of ATE insurance is within or outside
the 25% cap. This is an expense and is therefore outside the cap. On
why DBA regulations do not contain requirements on termination for
civil litigation, as in employment cases, the DBA regulations 2010 made
provisions for employment cases which can be taken forward by
non-lawyers. Detailed safeguards need to be built in as a result. Civil
litigation can be conducted only by lawyers, who are subject to their
own professional regulations.</hs_para>

Lord that I welcome the thoroughness with which he has examined these
regulations and, as I say, if I have not covered the questions in
precisely the detail that I should have done I will make sure that a
suitable letter is lodged in the Library of the House. I nevertheless
think that the timetable that we have set, the consultation that we
have undertaken and the changes that we have made after that
consultation, with our having listened to the Bar Council, the Law
Society and other interested parties, make the regulations fit for
purpose. I therefore recommend them to the

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, before my noble

the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, about damage-based agreements for
defendants. It is my understanding of the regulations that DBAs are not
appropriate for defendants, whereas conditional free agreements are and
always can be available to defendants. DBAs depend upon the damages
awarded to the client or monies paid by another party to the party
entering into the DBA. Clarification on that from my noble friend may

defendants to use DBAs, not least because a DBA is enforceable only
where the agreement makes provision for the payment of the fee from
damages awarded. My noble friend asks an extremely pertinent question

be a particular rationale for excluding defendants from this process.
If they secure the retention of a sum of money claimed under the
agreement, why should the DBA not be available to them? To confine it
to claimants seems too narrow a concept. If the intention of the
Government, as it clearly is, is to use the DBA as an alternative
method of financing, it should be available to both sides because
nobody is being compelled to undertake a DBA. That still requires some

the Access to Justice Act regulations in effect, although there are
differences in terminology and structure. For example, the regulations
refer to making a determination that an individual qualifies for legal
aid, rather than to granting a representation order following a
decision that an individual qualifies. This change of terminology is
made only to reflect amended wording in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and

practices will not need to be altered in any way as a result of the
regulations. The key change is that under the Access to Justice Act
1999, the default position is that a court makes a decision that an
individual qualifies for legal aid, unless specified otherwise in
regulations. However, due to the roll-out of means testing in the
magistrates’ court and subsequently the Crown Court, the
circumstances in which a court may grant legal aid have been gradually
reduced. LASPO reflects this shift, and the default position is that it
is for the director of legal aid casework to make a decision that an
individual qualifies for legal aid, unless otherwise stated in
regulations. The regulations set out the limited circumstances in which
a court can make a decision that an individual qualifies for legal aid.
That merely codifies current
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000087">The
regulations also limit the circumstances in which an individual can
select a representative of their choice in criminal proceedings, and

individual to select enhanced representation. The regulations specify
the circumstances where the court may permit an individual to select a
different provider to the provider selected by a

relation to advocates, the regulations generally provide that
individuals may not select an advocate in proceedings before a
magistrates’ court, and set out circumstances where the court
may permit an individual to select an advocate in the
magistrates’ court. The regulations also provide that
individuals may select only a provider and a single junior advocate in
proceedings in the Crown Court and above, and set out circumstances
where the court may permit an individual to select a Queen’s
Counsel or more than one advocate. The provisions have the same effect
as the current provisions in relation to choice of representative under
the Access to Justice Act.</hs_para>

that these arrangements will make no substantial difference to

therefore no risk of any delay to existing court proceedings or any

protect an individual’s personal information and maintain

26(1) of LASPO sets out the general principle that costs ordered
against a legally aided party to civil proceedings must be reasonable,
having regard to all the circumstances including the financial
resources and conduct of the parties to the proceedings. This is known
as “cost protection” and is a feature of the existing
civil legal aid system. It caps the amount of money that a legally
aided party may be ordered to pay if they lose their case. The
intention of this is to ensure that they are not deterred from
resolving their issues through legal action for fear of being
personally liable for unaffordably high costs.</hs_para>

9, which deals with the withdrawal of determinations by the court and
prescribes that the court before which criminal proceedings are
listed may withdraw determinations in certain circumstances. I draw
attention in particular to Regulation 9(c), where a reason
would be that the provider named in the representation order that
recorded the original determination declines to continue to represent
the individual. The previous two conditions I can quite understand;
first, the individual declines to accept the determination terms that
he was offered—arguably, that is not unreasonable—and,
secondly, the individual requests that the determination is
withdrawn, which is also reasonable. However, I do not understand why,
if the provider named in the 
<?notus-xml column=138?>representation order declines to continue to represent the individual,
the determination should be withdrawn unless that determination relates
specifically to that advocate. If that is the intention, it should
perhaps be clearer, but if it is broader than that it would presumably
leave the party unrepresented. Perhaps that needs some
clarification.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000105">Regulation

deemed to be employed by the Lord Chancellor and therefore are required
to be included in the pension scheme. If employment is to be used in

framework laid out in the Access to Justice Act 1999 is different from
that laid out in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders
Act 2012. Under the Access to Justice Act, the default position is that
the court can grant representation. However, with the rollout of means
tests to magistrates’ courts and later to Crown Court, the
circumstances in which the court can grant representation have
gradually reduced. The responsibility for granting representation has
therefore gradually passed to the Legal Services
Commission—although, in practice, Her Majesty’s Courts
and Tribunal Service staff make the decision. The Criminal Defence
Services (General) (No. 2) Regulations 2001 reflect that position.
LASPO reflects that shift, and the default position is that it is for
the Director of Legal Aid Casework to decide whether to grant
representation. The court may do so only when expressly authorised by
regulations. The regulations set out the limited circumstances in which
a court may do so—for example, where an urgent determination is
required in a case of contempt of

there a process of appeal for conflicts of interests under the

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the background to these regulations is
the failure of the previous system for regulating financial services to
provide clear responsibility for financial stability, which was shared
in an opaque way between the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA.
This meant that it has been all too easy for the identification and
management of risks to financial stability to fall between the cracks
in what those organisations believed were their respective roles in
protecting and promoting stability in the financial
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:23:17"></hs_TimeCode>. That
confusion was a key contributing factor to the emergence of the
financial crisis in 2007. None of those three institutions was

stability across the system as a

the light of those failings, the Financial Services Act gives the Bank

The FPC will do this in two ways: primarily through recommendations,
which can be made to the regulators, to industry, to the Treasury,
within the Bank and to other persons—and, where appropriate,
through directions to the PRA and FCA. The FPC’s direction power
will be limited to the measures set out in this order. The regulators

discussing the measures that will be granted to the FPC, it is worth
noting that there is international consensus on the need for
macroprudential regulation. International regulations such as Basel III
and CRD4 go some way towards establishing minimum standards while
retaining room for national discretion, although areas such as the
leverage ratio remain under discussion. The UK strongly supports the
ability of national supervisors to exercise discretion where
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000123">In
February 2011, the Government and the Bank established an interim FPC
to undertake, as far as possible, the work of the statutory FPC ahead
of the 
<?notus-xml column=143?>passing of the relevant legislation. One of the tasks set for the
interim FPC was to analyse and recommend macroprudential measures for
which the statutory FPC should have direction-making powers. Following
the interim FPC’s recommendations in March 2012 on the tools
that the committee should have, the Government consulted on these
tools, seeking comments on our intention to: make the FPC responsible
for setting the level of the UK’s countercyclical capital
buffer; provide the FPC with a direction-making power to impose
sectoral capital requirements; and provide the FPC with a time-varying
leverage ratio direction-making tool, but no earlier than 2018 and

instrument relates to the ability to set the sectoral capital
requirements, or SCRs. I will deal with this tool first, then briefly
cover the others. The interim FPC recommended that the statutory FPC
should have a power of direction to vary financial institutions’
capital requirements against exposures to specific sectors over time,
arguing that often the overexuberance that precedes crises begins in
specific sectors before spreading further. The Government
agree that this targeted approach would allow  these
risks to be managed in a more effective and proportionate manner than
raising capital requirements more generally.</hs_para>

risks associated with the use of these tools. Although the majority of
respondents to the Government;s consultation supported the introduction
of SCRs, some noted that the FPC risked being perceived as applying an
industrial policy via the application of sectoral capital requirements.
The FPC has stated that it would wish to avoid an “overly
activist, fine-tuning approach”, which should limit this risk.
However, there may be times when using the tools in a granular way
would be necessary. The Government will keep the use of this tool under
review to ensure that it is being used in an effective, proportionate
way. There is also a risk that imposing sectorally specific
requirements would merely displace excessive risk-taking in other
sectors. The FPC will need to monitor carefully the impact of any
policy interventions using this tool and may need to consider adjusting
more general capital requirements if displacement is a significant
problem. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:30:38"></hs_TimeCode>
should take the opportunity to highlight one change that the Government
have made to the order since the version that was published for
consultation. The current order excludes investment firms that are not
regulated by the PRA from the FPC’s SCR power. This will ensure
that systemically important firms are captured, while smaller firms are
not subject to additional
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:28:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

discuss briefly the other macroprudential tools that the Government
intend to give the FPC: the role of setting the UK’s
countercyclical capital buffer—the CCB—and from 2018, the
power to intervene to limit leverage ratios. These are not covered by
the draft order, but give useful context to the debate. The CCB is part
of the Basel III agreement and will be implemented in Europe by the
capital requirements directive, known as CRD4. It aims to ensure that
banking sector capital requirements take account of the macrofinancial
environment in which  
<?notus-xml column=144?>banks operate. It will be deployed by national jurisdictions when excess
aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build up of
system-wide risk to ensure that the banking system has a buffer of
capital to protect it against future potential losses. Requiring banks,
building societies and larger investment firms to build up capital
during periods of overexuberance should help to increase the resilience
of the financial system and might also dampen the credit cycle.
Unwinding these requirements in the downturn once the particular threat
has passed might help to mitigate contractions in the supply of
lending. It is clear that with its macroprudential focus, the FPC will
be the body  best placed to determine the level of the CCB.
This was supported by the results of the Government’s
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000127">As
the CCB is expected to be provided for in the CRD4, the simplest way to
incorporate it into UK law is via regulations made under Section 2(2)
of the European Communities Act 1972 to transpose into UK law the
provisions of the CRD4 which relate to the CCB. It is vital that the
FPC’s decisions in relation to the CCB should be subject to
comparable procedural and reporting requirements to the FPC’s
other tools. Therefore, in addition to the requirements imposed by the
EU legislation, the Government intend to ensure that the CCB will be
subject to the same transparency requirements as other FPC decisions,
with a summary of the FPC’s discussions when taking decisions on
the CCB set out in the FPC’s meeting record and the FPC’s
use of the CCB covered in the biannual FSR. The Government will make
any necessary changes to achieve this in the regulations which
incorporate CRD4 into UK
law.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:29:59"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="13022698000242" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000242">5.30

SCRs, small investment firms will be excluded from CCB requirements,
although the exact terms of the exclusion have yet to be determined.
The interim FPC also recommended that the statutory FPC should have a
power of direction to set and vary a minimum leverage ratio. A leverage
ratio could indeed potentially be a useful macroprudential tool for the
FPC. The unweighted nature of this measure would guard against risk
weights underestimating the true riskiness of assets in firms and
provide a directly comparable figure across firms. The leverage ratios
of firms were a useful indicator of failure during the last crisis, and
the period immediately preceding the crisis was characterised by sharp
increases in leverage.</hs_para>

in the EU prudential toolkit and consider it an essential measure to
ensure that leverage remains at sustainable levels. It is also
important to maintain consistency with international and European
standards, and it is clear that a leverage ratio will not be
implemented across the EU until 2018. The Government intend to provide
the FPC with a time-varying leverage ratio direction-making tool, but
no earlier than 2018 and subject to a review in 2017 to assess progress
on international standards. The precise design of the tool will depend
on the provisions of the relevant European legislation and will be set
out in secondary legislation at the time.</hs_para>

will, of course, be able to add to this suite of macroprudential tools

for the FPC. The Government expect the FPC’s toolkit to adapt
and evolve as the international debate and academic literature on this
subject develops and empirical experience becomes more widely
available. We expect the FPC to make recommendations to the
Treasury if its macroprudential measures require amendment or new
measures are required. I hope that that explanation has been helpful. I

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, that was an interesting introduction to
this order as it spent most of its time discussing measures that are
not included. It also began with a preamble that was an extraordinary
rewrite of history, referring to a failure to identify macroprudential
risks prior to 2008. Will the Minister specify any Government or
regulatory document that includes a reference to macroprudential risk
before 2008 and before publication of the Turner review? He will be
hard put to find it. There are some academic articles on systemic risk
but the whole issue of macroprudential risk was simply not on the
horizon at that
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:33:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000132">I
was also somewhat distressed to find that the Government still believe
that following the Basel III approach of using capital related to
risk-weighted assets is still at the centre of the approach to the
determination of stability, particularly in the banking sector. This is
using weapons with which we fought the last war to try to deal
with the new war. It is an excessive emphasis on the asset side of the
balance sheet to the detriment of the liability side, and indeed has
been criticised very strongly recently by the IMF. I hope
that the Government will rethink their approach and not
continue to rely on this outdated
measure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:34:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000133">I
want to talk about some of the measures before us rather than some that
might appear in the future, although the Minister has tempted me to ask
what is happening with the leverage ratio. Leverage collars, which
after all apply to the liability side of the balance sheet, have been
demonstrated to be far more effective than risk-weighted capital
requirements. Do the Government still plan to weaken the Vickers
proposal of a leverage ratio of 25:1 and to fix the requirements simply
on the Basel minimum of 33:1? When thinking about the leverage ratio,
is the FPC planning any distinction between deposits and wholesale
funding in the specification of a leverage
cap?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000134">In
its earlier consideration of these measures, the FPC rejected the
adoption of a loan-to-value ratio in mortgage finance, arguing that
this was a political decision. In this instrument, though, we find the
requirement on financial institutions to maintain additional own funds
with respect to exposure to residential property. Will that not have
the same effect?  
<?notus-xml column=146?>Is it not a back-door method of introducing loan-to-value restrictions

to the sectors specified in this instrument, it is striking that the
measures are confined to financial instruments issued by financial
sector firms. Why is that? If there were a bubble in the stock market,
it could involve predominantly financial instruments  issued by
non-financial firms. Why is this legislation restricted only to
instruments issued by financial
institutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:36:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000136">Another
peculiarity of the drafting of this instrument is that it refers only
to an increase in requirements of holding of own funds. It refers to
“additional funds required” and that the PRA may require
additional own funds both by banks and by other financial institutions.
How will the PRA reduce the amount of funds required since the
instrument only allows it to require additional funds? How will that
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:37:44"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

regret the exclusion of smaller firms, to which the noble Lord referred
in his introductory remarks. The Treasury seems to have totally failed
to understand that a significant amount of the financial crisis was due
to the aggregation of a large number of small firms doing the same
thing at the same time, which had the same consequence as a large firm
doing the similar thing in terms of the development of systemic
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:38:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000138">The
measures also refer to the requirement to ask or require that banks
treat particular exposures as if they give rise to an increased level
of risk, which is true not just of banks but also of investment firms.
How is this level of risk to be specified by the FPC? Is it as a risk
weight or as a modification of the stochastic distribution model used
in the calculation of the firm’s value at risk? How is it to be
done? If it is with respect to the modelling, does that now mean that
the ability of firms to use their own risk models is to be 
modified and that there is to be a standardisation of risk models used
by firms in the calculation of capital
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:39:29"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000139">The
noble Lord referred to the use of these measures in what he called a
granular way and what in the instrument is referred to as a solo basis.
What will the relationship be between the FPC’s requirements of
measures and competition policy, in the sense that imposing measures on
a single firm would have competition implications? Will the views of
the competition authorities be taken into

assume that this is the first of a series of instruments that will

Newby:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord for those extremely
thoughtful questions, and I will do my best to answer them. He
said that systemic risk was not on the horizon before the
crisis. I think that the phrase was first used in academic
literature 
<?notus-xml column=147?>in 1979. Although the phrase was not in common parlance, it was well
understood, at least by some people, that a bubble was building up that
was capable of creating systemic risk. The first problem was
that it took a long time for the authorities and
the Government to accept that there was a bubble. The second
was that when they realised that there was a problem, and indeed when
there was a crisis, it was far too late to forestall it. It was then
necessary to deal with a crisis rather than dealing with a problem at
an early
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000142">The
noble Lord said that we rely far too much on Basel III and that it is a
weapon of the last war. We are part of an international discussion on
Basel III. Although Basel III is part of the armoury that we use, it is
only one part. Indeed, the measure that we are looking at today is not
a Basel III measure. Even if the noble Lord was correct that Basel III
does not deal with every issue that we will be grappling with, it is
not the only tool that we are looking at.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> The Government said in response to Vickers that
they believed he was going too far, and I do not believe that that view
has changed. The noble Lord asked about the loan-to-value ratio and
whether that tool would not have the same effect as introducing a
loan-to-value ratio. In an aggregate sense, in many ways it does so.
However, the advantage of this approach over adopting a loan-to-value
limit is that it places an overall requirement on an institution in
terms of its lending to the property sector, but still gives that
institution the flexibility to provide loans at a high loan-to-value
ratio. This might take place, for example, in a minority of cases in
which the circumstances of the person to whom the loan is being given
makes that loan prudent. In many ways it could have the same overall
effect on the sector, but it gives institutions greater flexibility
than a prescriptive loan-to-value
ratio.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000146" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000146">The noble
Lord asked why the stock market was not included and why we were not
including firms in that sector. The answer is that at this point the
FPC believes that the definition of which firms are covered includes
those firms that are most likely to cause a problem. The FPC has taken
the view that firms in the stock market are not creating an equivalent
risk to those elsewhere and those already covered. That is
its judgement, which one can take a view on. The noble Lord
disagrees, but that is the answer to the
question.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000147" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000147">The

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to the other three
orders made under the Act. As I said in respect of the previous order,
the Financial Services Act establishes a system based on clarity of
responsibility and focus for the new regulatory bodies, avoiding the
confused and ineffective tripartite system that it
replaces.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000159">The
new system will make the Bank of England clearly responsible for
financial stability and will provide for two focused regulators with
clear remits. The Prudential Regulation Authority, or PRA, will be
responsible for the prudential regulation of firms that manage complex
risks on their balance sheets. The Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA,
will be a focused conduct of business regulator. This group of
statutory instruments relates to the scope of the responsibilities and
powers of the PRA and FCA. The Government’s guiding principle in
all these orders is that there should be clarity of responsibility and
effective co-ordination mechanisms where
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000160">First,
I turn to the draft order made under Section 22A of the 2000
Act, which establishes which activities will be prudentially regulated
by the PRA. The draft order provides that deposit-taking, effecting and
carrying on contracts of insurance, and certain other activities in
relation to the Lloyd’s market will all be PRA-regulated
activities. All firms that carry them out will be regulated by the PRA.
That reflects the complex nature of the risks borne by firms that
engage in such activities and the need for specialist prudential
regulation. Additionally, the activities of some investment firms are
of such scale and complexity or are interconnected with other firms to
such an extent that they may pose risks to the entire financial system
or to other PRA-authorised firms. The PRA will be able to designate
such investment firms to be prudentially regulated by the
PRA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000161">The
draft order sets out the criteria which the PRA will apply when
considering whether an investment firm should be designated. First, the
firm must hold,  
<?notus-xml column=150?>or be seeking to hold, permission to deal in investments as principal.
In other words, it must be an investment firm or be applying to be an
investment firm. Secondly, the firm must be of a type and size that is
required to have initial capital of €730,000 under the capital
adequacy directive. This means that it must be relatively large and
complex. Finally, the PRA must conclude that designation is desirable,
having regard to its objectives.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022698000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000162">When
deciding on the designation, the PRA must also give consideration to
certain other factors. It must consider the assets of the firm in
question. If the firm is part of a financial group, the PRA must also
look at the size and complexity of other investment firms in the group,
and at whether the activities of the firm in question could affect
their safety and soundness. The draft order was first published more
than a year ago and it has the overwhelming support of consultation
respondents. I hope that it will be equally acceptable to the
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000163">Next, I
turn to the threshold conditions order. The threshold conditions are
the minimum requirements that firms need to meet to become authorised.
They are a key supervisory tool and provide the basis for
triggering certain of the regulators’ powers to intervene. On
the recommendation of the Joint Committee on the draft Financial
Services Bill, which carried out pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill,
the Government reviewed the threshold conditions to ensure that they
support judgment-led and forward-looking regulation.</hs_para>

revised conditions set out in the draft order will provide clarity
about which aspects of a firm’s business are of interest to each
regulator. They will also deliver clear, relevant and unambiguous
standards which firms are required to meet and which will be used by
the PRA and FCA in exercising their judgment. Lastly, they are aligned
with the priorities of the FCA and the PRA—for example,
including a reference to whether firms are “resolvable”,
which will be a key consideration for the PRA in understanding the
risks posed by individual firms to the financial system as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:55:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

next to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme order. The FSCS
plays a crucial role in the financial services sector, supporting
consumer protection and confidence in financial services while serving
to protect and enhance financial stability. The Government are
committed to retaining a single Financial Services Compensation Scheme,
so that there is a single point of contact on compensation for
consumers. However, given the important role that the FSCS plays in the
financial system, both regulators will interact with the
FSCS, and the Government have legislated that in the new regulatory
system the FCA and PRA will have joint oversight responsibility for the
FSCS and split rule-making
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:56:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022698000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000166">As the
scope of prudential regulation by the PRA is set out in secondary
legislation, it is also necessary to specify the claims that each
regulator may or may not make compensation rules for by statutory
instrument. Broadly reflecting the division in regulatory
responsibilities  
<?notus-xml column=151?>between the PRA and the FCA, the order makes the PRA responsible for
making compensation rules in relation to claims for deposits and claims
under a contract of insurance.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022698000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000167">The order
also provides that the PRA may make compensation rules relating to the
activities of managing the underwriting capacity of a managing agent at
Lloyd’s, or arranging contracts of insurance written at
Lloyd’s. The inclusion of these activities in the order reflects
the PRA’s regulatory responsibility in these areas but does not
mean that the PRA will be expected to make compensation rules for them.
To be clear, the FSA does not currently make compensation rules for
these activities and it is not expected that the PRA will do so.
Conversely, the FCA will be responsible for making rules to deal with
claims for all other matters. This will include claims for
mis-selling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:57:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:57:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000168">Finally,
I turn to the mutuals order. The FSA’s most important regulatory
functions and powers were established in the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000. However, the FSA also has a range of functions under
the legislation that governs the establishment and operation of
mutuals. This order does two things. First, it replaces references to
the FSA in the various pieces of mutuals legislation with references to
the FCA, the PRA or, in some cases, both. Secondly, it inserts
mechanisms similar to those in the Financial Services Act requiring the
two regulators to consult each other and co-ordinate their actions in
certain cases.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022698000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000169">The
division of the responsibilities under mutuals legislation follows the
general division of responsibilities between the PRA and the FCA under
FiSMA. The PRA is given all of the FSA’s mutuals functions that
are relevant to the safety and soundness of PRA-authorised
mutuals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:58:38"></hs_TimeCode>. The FCA
will take over the other functions of the FSA, including those related
to registration, the register and the public file, the enforcement of
offences and the majority of the functions related to administering
mutuals in

Committee’s attention that the order applies the PRA’s
objectives to its functions under mutuals legislation but not the
FCA’s. Applying the PRA’s objectives means that when
carrying out a function under mutuals legislation, such as directing
the merger of two building societies, the PRA will be held to account
for whether its actions promote its objectives. However, the
FCA’s tasks under mutuals legislation are mostly administrative
in nature. It will have little discretion as to how it goes about them,
so it would not really be possible to hold the FCA to account for
whether it was approaching its tasks in a way that advanced its
objectives. In the legal sense, there is little to which the FCA
objectives could
apply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T17:59:30"></hs_TimeCode>. The
FCA’s objectives of course apply to all its regulatory activity
in relation to mutuals that is carried out under FiSMA, such as making
rules and imposing requirements.</hs_para>

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for
introducing these orders. Like him, I will deal with them altogether.
Before doing so, I declare an interest as a non-executive director of a
financial services firm as set out in the <I>Register of Lords’
Interests</I>. Turning first to the PRA-regulated activities order, I
still am somewhat puzzled as regards the whole definition of the large
investment firm. Are we simply relying on the CRD definition expressed
as €730,000-odd or is there some broader definition of what is
meant by a “large investment firm” which the PRA has in
mind?</hs_para>

with respect to that, under Article 6.5, what is the procedure if the
FCA disagrees with the PRA’s decision to withdraw a designation?
The consultation process should form a check on the PRA and not just
act as a rubber-stamping on behalf of other bodies. There should be
some scrutiny of important decisions that the PRA wishes to undertake,
although of course without undermining its
powers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:01:22"></hs_TimeCode>. What

threshold conditions are entirely appropriate but I want to focus on
Article 2A about suitability. I found the discussion of suitability as
a threshold condition—a very important threshold condition in
any regulatory system—to be rather more vague than I would have
expected. For example, under Article 2E(e) those who manage
the affairs in investment firms have to have “adequate skills
and experience”. Who defines adequate? What is meant by
adequate? Does adequacy refer to a particular examination standard or
standards of experience which might be
expected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:02:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

addition, the PRA might be expected to act with probity. Do we need a
more precise definition of probity or will we simply regard it as
having not yet been caught? How will we determine the conditions of
suitability? Should they not be more precise, as individuals who wish
to work in the financial services industry surely should have precise
conditions and not be  turned down on the basis of those rather
general
statements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:03:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:03:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000177" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000177">I
have rather more questions on the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme. Again, I will start with the problem of consultation between
the PRA and the FCA. It seems to me that the PRA and the FCA are
required to develop rules for access to the FSCS. How will they
disclose that? What is the rule-making procedure referred to in this
instrument? What will the procedure look like? Will they review the
FSCS’s current rules? Presumably, they will. When we have had
that review, will there be a transparent report to Parliament of the
substance of that
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:04:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000178" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000178">There
is a relationship between the discussion of mutuals and the FSCS. As
the noble Lord will be aware, there has been considerable disquiet, to
put it mildly, among mutuals with respect to the
contributions that they make to the FSCS relative to those made by
banks. I may have missed it, and if I 
<?notus-xml column=153?>have I apologise, but has there been any development on the levies made
on mutuals in their contributions to the FSCS?</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, if there is a leitmotif running through
the noble Lord’s questions, it has to be about how the two
bodies work together. This theme ran also through previous debates in
your Lordships’ House and gets to the core of arguments about
whether the Government were right to split the FSA at all. The view
that we took is that we needed to give greater focus to the two
elements of regulation. It was very important, having done that, we
then set in place ways in which the two regulators would work together.
As the noble Lord knows, there are number of points in the Act where
the two bodies are required to establish memoranda of understanding
explaining exactly how they are going to work together. The success of
the new structure will depend to a very large extent on that working. I
know that the bodies as they are establishing themselves are absolutely

some of the specific points that the noble Lord raised. He asked

capital requirement. The order takes a number of criteria into account,
not all of them from the CRD. I read some of them out. The PRA, for
example, has to conclude that designation is desirable, having regard
to its objectives—this is part of the regulator exercising
judgment. That is an additional criterion beyond the €730,000;
it is not
automatic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:08:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000184">The
noble Lord asked what would happen if the FCA disagreed with the
PRA’s decision to withdraw designation. This is a decision for
the PRA. We expect it to give considerable weight to the views of the
FCA, but it is ultimately a matter for the
PRA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:09:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord asked whether the definitions should be more precise, in
particular the definition of “probity”. The Government do
not consider that the concept of probity is significantly more
subjective than other criteria against which the regulator must make
regulatory judgments. Recent conduct and mis-selling scandals have
shown more than ever how important it is that firms conduct themselves
with probity, and it is right that the regulators can make an
assessment on whether this is the case and take action where it is
needed. A general question for legislation is how far it attempts to
define terms which are in common parlance and have a common
understanding. Our view is that in this respect the legislation goes as
far as it should
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-26T18:10:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022698000186" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130226-gc0001.htm#13022698000186">The
noble Lord asked about mutuals and whether there had been a change in
class. This has been a long-standing beef of the mutuals; they feel
that they have to bear the burden of the incompetence, folly and
recklessness of others. That is a question for the authorities to
decide, but for the time being they remain in the same levy class that
they have already stayed

shall try to deal with one or two other points. The noble Lord asked
about the procedure for FSCS rules. The same procedure applies as for
other rules; there is a duty to consult but no duty to carry out a
cost-benefit analysis. There are no plans to change the rules as part
of the transition. Once the transition has taken place, it will
obviously be for the new regulators to decide whether they are happy
with them, but we are not planning to do that at the same

uncertainties around how the 2050 carbon target will be met, however,
in the Carbon Plan (December 2011), the department put forward four
plausible example pathways that meet the target. Details of the
pathways, including associated estimates of full energy system costs,
can be examined in the report and using the 2050 Calculator: a tool

our best estimates for the four pathways, which vary between

costs for the whole energy system including cars, power stations and
insulation, but exclude the cost of not tackling climate change and the
costs of changing people's behaviour, such as encouraging them to turn
down their thermostat. The table also shows that if climate change
wasn't tackled and climate change turned out to have no impact, the

mitigating the risk of them going missing from care. Local authorities
work in close co-operation with the police and the UK Border Agency to
support, and provide protection for, potentially trafficked children.
Our forthcoming revised statutory guidance on children who go missing
