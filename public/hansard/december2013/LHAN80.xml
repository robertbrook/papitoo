PISA results allow us to compare ourselves with the world’s

has not changed significantly since 2009. It remains at the OECD
average in maths and reading, and above in science. The

report makes for gloomy reading about mathematics education in our
secondary schools. We are stuck in 26th position, and 22% of our 15
year-olds are ranked as low achievers. The situation looks as though it
is going to get worse. A quarter of our secondary school maths teachers
have only A-level mathematics. Only half of our newly qualified maths
teachers have a maths degree, and well over half of training posts for

We recruited 2,230 maths teachers in 2013-14, and we are continuing to
focus efforts on recruiting the best graduates for the subjects we need
most, which of course include maths. We have increased the number of
maths places and the scholarships for teacher training. These
scholarships amount to £25,000. We have increased the value of
maths bursaries because we need to attract the top graduates. We have
also introduced bursaries for graduates with good A-levels in
maths or physics who train to teach maths, because we recognise

performing best in the OECD results published today, all teachers must
have a teaching qualification and have to undertake 240 hours of
professional development in the first five years of their career. In
the UK now, academies and free schools can employ an unqualified person
as a teacher even in these core subjects. The South Leeds Academy has
just advertised for an unqualified person to teach maths, with a
minimum qualification of just four GCSEs. Given what the Minister has

Howe of Aberavon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, is the performance of
our children not to be admired because of their achievement in
mathematics? That subject is far more difficult that it should ever
have been allowed to become, granted the fact that Magna Carta
specifically requires the establishment of single, uniform system of
mathematics and measurements, such as has been achieved in many other
former British colonies, such as Australia and New Zealand, and even
including the United States and Ireland. In almost all other
territories, what should have been achieved has not been achieved in
the simplicity of our measurement systems in this country. There is all
the more reason to do so, given our abolition of the Metrication Board,
which we introduced to give us one system during my time as Minister
for Trade and Consumer Affairs. Alas, I confess that, as Chancellor of
the Exchequer, I abolished the Metrication Board, disregarding its
achievement, and so created the difficulties which I felt I had to
spell out with candour in posing my

for what he achieved—using the metric system rather than
anything else certainly made things much easier when my kids were
studying—and for his candour. I note that the PISA report is
extremely long, complex and very interesting. I urge noble Lords to
have a really good look at it. If they look at the breakdown on maths,
for example, they will see that students in the United Kingdom do
relatively better than some countries on uncertainty, 
<?notus-xml column=119?>data and probability, but are less strong on space and shape. In east

the only way to enthuse young people is with a committed, knowledgeable
and enthusiastic teacher. The Government need to do more to recruit the
very best. We know that if you get the top 10% of graduates into

the messages that have been given to free schools and

Northover:</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness for her initial
tribute. It was very striking to see a steady increase in the number of
high-quality candidates entering teaching. That is immensely
encouraging, and we have to take it further forward. The proportion of
postgrad entrants with a first class or 2.1 degree is now 74%, compared
with 61% in 2009. That is moving in the right direction and shows that
students recognise that it is worth teaching. The noble Baroness is
absolutely right that all of us remember our outstanding, inspiring
teachers. The report emphasises that autonomy for head teachers, along
with accountability, is crucial to moving things
forward.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_03_PT_1/DE860A36AF6AF40C40C81283B89A62EAA8DC0841" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 December 2013">Tuesday,

Newby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the Government believe that
non-resident landlords should pay tax as appropriate, and HMRC operates
a withholding scheme to ensure compliance. Tenants and letting agents
are required to withhold and pay HMRC basic rate tax. Landlords whose
UK tax affairs are up to date may apply not to have tax withheld and be
automatically entered into self-assessment. Non-resident landlords in
self-assessment are subject to HMRC’s usual rigorous compliance
checks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T14:45:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Campbell-Savours" PimsId="2453" UID="13120363000402" xid="1640" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000402">Lord
Campbell-Savours (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, that only applies where
a landlord uses an agent—I listened very carefully to the
Minister’s response. How is it possible to quantify the scale of
evasion on rental income without a means of establishing who owns what,
what rents are paid, and to whom those rents are paid? Is there not a
real need to establish a local authority-based national register of all
domestic and overseas-based landlord rented-out property—a
register that is accessible by HMRC? Is it not true that there is vast
evasion in this

agents. As I said, there are two other categories of people who should
pay tax in this case: one, in the case of tenants, if their
non-resident landlord wishes to go that way; and the other for the
non-resident landlord to register for self-assessment. Perhaps I may
give the noble Lord and the House some sense of the scale of the income
generated from this scheme. In 2011-12, companies that held residential

effort directed through the global fund has had stunning achievements.
The rate of new HIV infections among women and girls has declined. The
pace of the decline is not as fast as we would wish it to be and that
is something that the UK is putting renewed effort into, as will the
global fund. Clearly, the focus on prevention will particularly benefit
women. There has been far greater coverage of the population as a
result of the global fund’s efforts and stunning reductions in
the cost of, for example, HIV treatment. In 2000, treating a patient
cost about $10,000 a year and that has now dropped to $125 per

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord
Nash) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, with your permission, I
would like to repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Education in another place earlier today about
the PISA league tables of educational performance published earlier
today by the
OECD.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000064">“Before
I go into the detail of what the league tables show about the common
features of high-performing systems, may I take a moment—as I
try to in every public statement I make—to thank our teachers
for their hard work, dedication and idealism. Whatever conclusions we
draw about what needs to change, I hope we in this House can agree that
we are fortunate to have the best generation of young teachers ever in
our
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000065">The
data show that the new recruits now entering the classroom are better
equipped than ever before. I would like in particular to thank
those head teachers who are, through the new school direct programme of
teacher training, recruiting more superb new graduates to teach in our
state schools. But while the quality of our teachers is improving,
today’s league tables sadly show that that is not enough. When
people ask why, if teachers are better than ever, we need to
press ahead with further reform to the system, today’s
results make the case more eloquently than any number of
speeches.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000066">Since
the 1990s, our performance in these league tables has been at best
stagnant, at worst declining. In the latest results, we are 21st in the
world for science, 23rd for reading and 26th for mathematics. For all
the well intentioned efforts of past Governments, we are still falling
further behind the best-performing school systems in the world. In
Shanghai and Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong, indeed even in
Taiwan and Vietnam, children are learning more and performing better
with every year that passes, leaving our children behind in the global
race.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000067">That
matters because business is more mobile than ever, and
employers are more determined than ever to seek out the best-qualified
workers. Global economic pressures, far from leading to a race to the
bottom, are driving all nations to pursue educational excellence more
energetically than ever before, and 
<?notus-xml column=130?>today’s league tables show that nations that
have had the courage radically to reform their education
systems, such as Germany and Poland, have significantly improved their
performance and their children's
opportunities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000068">There
is no single intervention or single nation which has all the answers to
our education challenges, but if we look at all the high-performing and
fast-improving education systems, certain common features recur. There
is an emphasis on social justice and helping every child to succeed.
There is a commitment to an aspirational academic core curriculum for
all students. There is a high level of autonomy from bureaucracy for
head teachers. There is a rigorous system of accountability for
performance, and head teachers have the critical power to hire who they
want, remove underperformers and reward the best with the recognition
that they
deserve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000069">Those
principles have driven this coalition’s education reforms since
2010. The first reform imperative is securing greater social justice.
It is notable that many of the high-performing jurisdictions set
demanding standards for every child, whatever their background, and
Germany in particular has improved its standing in these league tables
by doing more to promote greater equity to ensure more children from
poorer backgrounds catch up with their
peers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000070">The
good news from the PISA research is that in England we have one of the
most progressive and socially just systems of education funding in the
world. But we in the coalition Government believe that we must go
further to help the most disadvantaged. That is why we have made
funding even more progressive with the pupil premium, extended free
pre-school education to the most disadvantaged two year-olds and
changed how we hold schools accountable so that they have to give even
greater attention to the performance of poor children. I hope that
today the Opposition will acknowledge these steps forward and give
their support to our reforms.</hs_para>

imperative is a more aspirational curriculum. In successful Asian
nations all students are introduced to more stretching mathematical
content at an earlier age than has been the case here; and in the
fastest-improving European nation, Poland, every child now follows a
core academic curriculum to the age of 16. Our new national curriculum
is explicitly more demanding, especially in mathematics. It is modelled
on the approach of high-performing Asian nations such as Singapore. The
mathematical content is matched by a new level of ambition in
technology, with the introduction of programming and coding in the
national curriculum for the first time.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120363000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000072">In our drive to
eliminate illiteracy, we have introduced a screening check at age six
to make sure that every child is reading fluently. Our introduction of
the English baccalaureate, which is awarded to students who secure
GCSEs in English, maths, the sciences, languages and history or
geography, matches Poland by embedding an expectation of academic
excellence for every 16 year- old. I hope that today the
Labour Front Bench will confirm its support for our new curriculum, the
phonics screening check and the English baccalaureate. Our children
deserve to have these higher standards adopted universally.</hs_para>

imperative is greater autonomy for head teachers. There is a direct
correlation in these league tables between freedom for heads and
improved results. That is why we have dramatically increased the number
of academies and free schools and given heads more control over teacher
training, continuous professional development and the improvement of
underperforming schools. By giving heads control of teacher
recruitment, the School Direct programme has improved the quality of
new teachers. The creation of more than 300 teaching schools has put
our most outstanding heads in charge of helping existing teachers to do
even better. The academies programme has allowed great heads, such as
those in the Harris and Ark chains, to take over underperforming
schools, such as Downhills Primary in Tottenham. I hope that today the
Front Bench will signal its support for these reforms and show that,
like us, it trusts our outstanding heads to drive
improvement.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120363000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000074">The fourth pillar of
reform is accountability. Those systems which have autonomy without
accountability often underperform, but accountability has to be
intelligent. That is why we have sharpened Ofsted inspections,
recruited more outstanding serving teachers to inspect schools and
demanded that underperforming schools improve far faster. The old
league table system relied too much on a narrow measurement of C passes
at GCSE, which generated the wrong incentives and wrote too many
children off. We have changed league tables to ensure that every
child’s progress is rewarded and ensured that children are not
entered early, or multiple times, for GCSEs simply to influence league
tables. I hope that today the Opposition Front Bench will endorse those
changes and join us in demanding greater rigour and higher standards
from all
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000075">The
fifth pillar of reform is freedom for heads to recruit and reward the
best. Shanghai, the world’s best-performing education system,
has a rigorous system of performance-related pay. We have given head
teachers the same freedoms here. I hope that today we can have a clear
commitment from all sides of the House to support those brave and
principled heads who want to pay the best teachers
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000076">The
programme of reform we have set out draws on what happens in
the best school systems, because we want nothing but the best for our
children. Unless we can provide them with a school system that is one
of the best in the world, we will not give them the opportunities they
need to flourish and succeed. That is why it is so important that we
have a unified national commitment to excellence in all our schools for
all our pupils”.</hs_para>

failed to make any further progress in improving standards in these
core subjects of English, maths and science, compared

this Secretary of State’s line of defence has been one of

international league tables
is,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13120363000349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000349">“a

say to the Minister, and believe profoundly, that if we had not had a
Labour Government prioritising and investing in education year on year,
the UK would be at the bottom of the league table. Without doubt, if
the OECD had been comparing countries in 1996—it was
not—the UK would have been on the floor. After 18 years of a
Conservative Government, the education system in this country was in
tatters, with crumbling schools, standards flatlining, teacher morale
at rock bottom and a school system in chaos. The Labour Government,
quite simply, had to rebuild that system from top to
bottom.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13120363000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000081">That
is why we saw the first and biggest transformation ever for pre-school
children, with free early years education for all three and four
year-olds and, later, for disadvantaged two year-olds. We also saw
capped class sizes in primary schools and radical reform of the
secondary curriculum. We introduced academies in disadvantaged areas
because the Labour Government really did care about social justice and
equity in our education system. We also saw massive investment in
teacher and head teacher training and development, including the
introduction of Teach First, and year-on-year improvements in GCSE and
A-level results—achievements which this Secretary of State has
ridiculed and said were a
fiddle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000082">When
we left office in 2010, the coalition inherited record results and the
best cadre of teachers this country has ever had, by common acclaim,
including from Ofsted. That was a solid foundation for the continued
progress that we agree is undoubtedly still needed for us to compete
with the rising economies elsewhere in the world. It would have been
good to hear the Secretary of State acknowledge that progress, but
instead of doing that and trying to build on it, this Secretary of
State is in danger of squandering those advances by taking our
education system backwards to didactic teaching and a rampant free
market between
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000083">The
Minister selected certain factors that he thinks these results tell us.
However, if PISA tells us anything, it is that the countries doing
better have understood and are relentlessly implementing three
important lessons. First, as a teacher using the Singapore maths model
said on the news this morning, learning by rote is simply not good
enough for the innovative technological world in which our children
will work. However, this Secretary of State is returning the UK to an
obsolete curriculum and an exam system that measures what children
remember, not what they can actually
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000084">The second
lesson is that collaboration between schools and schools challenging
each other drive up standards. However, this Secretary of State has
abolished the London Challenge, where schools worked together, 
<?notus-xml column=133?>challenged each other and produced the fastest rise in achievements. He
also abolished the Greater Manchester and Black Country Challenges,
which were beginning to produce similar results in some of the most
disadvantaged parts of the country. If the Minister cares about social
justice and equity in education, that should not have been done, as the
scheme was addressing extreme disadvantage in our education
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000085">The
third lesson is that qualifications, along with continuing development
of teachers, is the single most important factor in improving education
and achievement. However, this Secretary of State, as we just discussed
in Questions, has allowed academies and free schools to employ
unqualified people to work as teachers, even in core subjects. As I
said, we have seen some academies putting out adverts for unqualified
people with four GCSEs to teach
maths.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000086">I could
not agree more with the Minister about the need to focus on social
justice and equity, to introduce rigour and standards into the
education system and, particularly, to make sure that those from
disadvantaged backgrounds can gain the most. However, although we
support some of the Government’s reforms, I cannot agree that
all of their measures, taken together, will achieve those ends. Will
the Minister explain to the House why the Government’s policies
are flying in the face of the lessons from elsewhere in the world,
which I have just outlined, that emanate from the PISA results
today?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120363000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000087">I
agree that this is a most important subject and we should use the OECD
findings to our advantage as far as we can. Will the Government
bring forward a considered and comprehensive analysis of the OECD
findings so that we can have an informed debate in public about the

reforms to ensure that we can position our young people to compete with
the best in the tiger

considered analysis. With her experience, she probably knows better
than to suggest that we can be expected to have turned round the
education system after only three and a half years, as Andreas
Schleicher acknowledged only yesterday. It is far too early to form a
verdict on the coalition’s reforms. However, we have
stopped the decline. Between 2000 and 2009 we fell from fourth to 16th
in science, eighth to 28th in maths, and seventh to 25th in literacy.

Government spent 87% more in real terms on the education
system, but it is all about what results you get rather than how much
money you spend. We must have a concept of value for money. It does not

acknowledge that the academy programme was a splendid
idea—indeed, 
<?notus-xml column=134?>I would not be here if it was not for the academy programme. The London
Challenge was an excellent example of co-operation between schools.
That is why we have taken these ideas and expanded them dramatically;
for example, from 200 to 3,500 academies, working together in close
geographic local clusters, with schools supporting each other locally,

unqualified teacher story seems to run and run. It is a bit of a red
herring. We have brought the numbers down to 14,800 from 17,800 under
Labour. It is still a tiny proportion. It is interesting that the area
that the noble Baroness refers to—London, which had some of the
best results—has the highest incidence of unqualified teachers.
It is also true that we have a high incidence of unqualified teachers
in our academies and free schools because we have nationalised quite a
few independent schools. However, we are interested in the best
teachers with the best qualifications and now 75%—up from
61%—of our teachers enter the profession with a 2.1 or

Quirk (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the Statement made no reference to
one issue which must have caused a certain amount of buzzing in the DfE
yesterday. His ministerial colleague, Liz Truss, addressed the
Publishers Association and very largely deplored the disappearance
—which may surprise many of us—of the textbook from the
classrooms of both primary and secondary schools. I was astonished to
learn from a <I>Telegraph</I> report today that, as compared
with 10% use of textbooks in primary schools here, Germany and Poland
have around 80% or 90%. Only 8% of pupils in English secondary schools
have textbooks in their hands, whereas the figure for Finland
is 80%. I compare the UK largely with other
European countries because of the huge cultural differences
which make comparison with Taiwan and Hong Kong a bit difficult. In
view of what Liz Truss said yesterday, why does the Minister think that
there is such a gap between our countries and other European countries
in the simple use of textbooks in classes? Does he think that this gap
between the two lots of teachers and the two lots of procedures may
account for our disappointing performance and the much more hopeful
performance that he has drawn attention to in Poland and
Germany<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:33:25"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000098"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="13120363000458" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000458">Lord
Nash:</Member></B> I agree entirely with the noble Lord. I think that
the answer to his questions in brief, although I will elaborate, is
that this situation has been caused by a lack of rigour in the
curriculum and in teaching methodology. I agree entirely that this lack
of rigour and methodology, which is expressed in one way in textbooks,
is one of the reasons why we have declined. One also needs to look at
workbooks. In far too many state-maintained schools, there is a
complete absence of workbooks. We are finding that some of the much
more successful schools—not just academies but maintained
schools—insist that all their pupils have a workbook. A workbook
is something pupils can be proud of and it can be marked. Pupils do
more homework and they get more feedback. In all senses, we need to
instil more rigour in our school
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000099"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:34:18"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Knight of Weymouth" PimsId="5757" UID="13120363000459" xid="2049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000459">Lord

Government’s reforms borrow more from Sweden than from
any other jurisdiction, but the position of Sweden in these tables is
going backwards. As we have heard, the reforms also built on what the
previous Government did on academies. Therefore, regardless of
politics—and I regret the highly political tone of the
Statement—should we not learn from the top three, from Shanghai,
Hong Kong and Singapore? There, parents are much more involved in their
child’s learning, and those jurisdictions are designing-in
collaborative problem-solving to meet the needs of employers. Given
that those skills will be tested by PISA in 2015, how does the Minister
think our children will fare then, given the Government’s new
emphasis on rote learning and individual
testing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:35:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

are learning from Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai, particularly in

that parents need to get more involved. When I first got involved in
the academy programme, we had one ghastly meeting in Pimlico with all
the antis. They were clearly not representative of parents, so to reach
out to the parents, we organised eight one-hour meetings in Camberwell
and Brixton, where the parents lived, to tell them what we were doing.
There were 1,300 pupils so you would think that there would
be 2,500 parents. I would like to ask noble Lords to guess how many
parents turned up but I will tell you—one parent came to all
eight meetings. We now have more than 90% attendance at parents’
meetings, because all state schools must now send out a message to
their parents that if their children go to that school, they must turn
up. That is what happens in independent schools and we must try to
replicate that in the state system. I entirely agree with the noble

40 years visiting schools in my constituency, it was always
the case that where there was proper discipline—allied to
parental enthusiasm, I would add with reference to the noble Lord, Lord

Nash:</Member></B> I agree entirely with my noble friend. Across the
academy system a great many sponsors have taken over schools where,
frankly, the previous behaviour was very poor indeed, and put in place
a very effective behaviour management system. I saw a behaviour
management system in America which I thought was particularly
effective. You start the pupils on the left-hand side of the page,
where they basically behave because they will get into trouble if they
do not, and you slowly move them across to the right-hand side of the
page, where they behave because that is the society they want. They
want a calm society in their school because that is the only way they
can learn. More sophisticated behaviour management systems are coming
into place. We have strengthened teachers’ ability to confiscate
mobile phones, particularly in the appalling incidents of sexting, and
given more power for detention, and so on, but I agree entirely with my

school visits these days but I was in a secondary school about a month
ago. It has been dramatically turned around in the last six months,
since a new head arrived. He described his office to me as being set
out like a war room, with all the key five factors. I asked him,
“What about the staff turnover in this period?”.
There were very few changes; I had walked around the school and talked
to the staff as well. In other words, the dramatic changes in the
school had been brought about by leadership—not by going in to
clear out teachers but by leading them. Even this head will therefore
require help in future. I take the point about the leadership of
schools being absolutely crucial. You cannot just put the best teacher
in the role of head teacher. They have to be trained to lead but it can
be done. Finally, if this is a wake-up call to the schools, it is
equally a wake-up call to the governing bodies. More work needs to be
done there because if governing bodies take the issues seriously, it is
more likely that parents will take them

to clarify the points I made in my opening speech. It was not that I
expected the Government to have turned around a tanker. What I said was
that substantial progress had been made during the years of the Labour

system in 1997. In their three and a half years, the Government could

a very bad position for any Secretary of State to take. They do not

to do it if we are to do the right thing for our teachers.

We have looked at examination systems across the world in improving the

reducing—again, going to the point about turning the ship around
quickly, a lot of these reforms have not even come into effect
yet—the number of modules and the amount of coursework and
continuous assessment in exams, and we will be reducing the scandal of
equivalence that went on in recent years. You could take a higher
diploma in construction, a subject that even someone as hamfisted as
myself would probably pass because there were no exams at all and it
was entirely continuous assessment, and it counted for four GCSE
equivalents. I could give noble Lords many other examples of exams that
were massively overrated, doing their pupils no favours at all and not
valued by employers. We have taken into account a lot of what we have

Bill, therefore, is the provision for the new single-tier pension: a
flagship reform which will simplify the current state pension system
and provide a firm foundation for pension saving. These reforms will
replace the current, two-tiered pension system with a simpler
single-tier state pension for future pensioners—those who reach
state pension age on or after 6 April 2016.</hs_para>

new state pension will be set above the basic means test. This will
help to clarify the incentive to save privately for retirement
without the need for the complex savings credit element of
state pension credit. The savings credit will therefore
close to those reaching state pension age on or after 6
April 2016. The introduction of the single-tier pension thus
reduces means-testing in the pension system, halving the proportion of
new pensioners qualifying for pension credit.</hs_para>

variation in state pension payments under the new system. We estimate
that more than 80% of people reaching state pension age by the mid-
2030s will receive the full single-tier pension. Those who have
historically done poorly in the current system, such as the
self-employed, carers and those with interrupted work histories, who
are often women, will benefit from the introduction of the single-tier
pension. Around 650,000 women who reach state pension age in the first
10 years after the single-tier pension is introduced will receive an
average of £8 per week more in state pension due to the
single-tier
valuation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000126">There
will be a minimum qualifying period for entitlement to the new

am able to advise 
<?notus-xml column=141?>noble Lords that the Government have today announced
that this is to be set at 10 years, in line with the assumptions made
in the White Paper and the impact assessment. Integral to the
single-tier reforms is the closure of the state second pension for
people reaching state pension age on or after 6 April 2016. Contracting
out of the state second pension for defined benefit schemes will
therefore come to an end in April 2016 and all employees will pay the
same rate of national insurance and become entitled to state pension in
the same way. As part of the simplification of the system, the outdated
provisions which allow a spouse or civil partner to boost their state
pension on the basis of the record of their partner or ex-partner will
end. These provisions, introduced in the 1940s, are no longer
appropriate for today’s society, where the vast majority of men
and women get a full basic state pension in their own right.</hs_para>

addition to reforming the state pension system to make it simpler, the
Government are taking action on state pension age to ensure the system
remains affordable and fair between generations in light of continuing
increases in life expectancy across all socioeconomic groups. The
Pensions Act 2007 set the original timetable for increasing the state
pension age to 66, 67, and 68. Since then, the average life expectancy
of a man reaching age 65 in 2013 has increased by over a year. We are
therefore bringing forward the increase in state pension age to 67 by
eight years, so that it gradually increases from 66 to 67 between 2026
and 2028. No one will experience a rise in state pension age of more
than 1 year compared to the original timetable that was set by the
Pensions Act 2007 and I can assure noble Lords that this will not
affect anyone whose pension age was changed by the Pensions Act
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000128">The fact
that people are living longer is to be welcomed. Yet continued
increases in life expectancy place a great deal of pressure on the
pensions system. The Bill therefore also provides for a regular review
of the state pension age so that is it considered once every
Parliament. This will ensure that the state pension age is examined in
an open and transparent way on a regular basis and prevent future
Governments from needing to take emergency action. As part of these
reviews, the Government of the day will ask the Government Actuary and
an independently led review to report on life expectancy and a whole
range of other factors relevant to setting the state pension age. The
Government will then consider what adjustments, if any, should be made
to pensionable age. This is not an automatic mechanism for future
increases, however, and any resulting proposals to change the state
pension age would still need to be set out in primary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:58:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000129">I
turn now to Part 3 of the Bill, which provides for the abolition of the
assessed income period in pension credit. The assessed income period
was introduced as part of pension credit in 2003 and was a new approach
to case maintenance for customers aged 65 and over. This was based on
the assumption that pensioners were more likely to have relatively
stable incomes with fewer changes in their circumstances and so a
lighter touch maintenance and review regime was deemed appropriate.
However, it has proved more complex than originally anticipated and the
assessed income period has allowed inaccuracies to build up in the 
<?notus-xml column=142?>system. As customers with an assessed income period
do not need to inform the department if they experience changes in
their capital or the make-up of their retirement income, an
increase—for example, a windfall—can legitimately be
ignored until the end of the period. Many see this as unfair,
particularly in the current economic climate. The Bill will therefore
abolish the assessed income period from April 2016. Older customers
will be protected through the continuation of existing indefinite
assessed income periods for those aged over 75.</hs_para>

pensions, the Bill contains measures to reform the bereavement benefits
system through the introduction of the bereavement support payment,
which will both simplify and modernise the current complex payment and
contribution system of bereavement benefits. The current system was
introduced at a time when women were not seen as workers and when
widows were left destitute. However, society has changed. Women are no
longer expected to be dependent on their partners and we now have an
expectation for people to work, with universal credit to support those
who cannot.</hs_para>

that many working-age people, regardless of income, do not make
contingencies for the loss of a spouse or civil partner and are
unprepared for the significant financial impact in the period
immediately following the bereavement. We have therefore designed the
new payment to focus on this period. It will support people with the
additional financial pressures associated with bereavement, helping
them plan during the readjustment period and better understand what
they will receive from the state while encouraging a supported return
to work for those without employment. An additional £110 million
will be invested in bereavement benefits during the first four years of
reform, so that existing recipients are protected over the course of
the next Parliament and those who claim the new bereavement support
payment get the help they need when they need it most.</hs_para>

contains a number of private pensions measures. As I said earlier, 13
million people are currently not saving enough to ensure an adequate
income in retirement. Furthermore, the number of employees saving into
a workplace pension has declined from 12.9 million in 1997 to 12.1
million in 2012. It is expected that automatic enrolment will see
between 6 million and 9 million people either starting to save
or saving more into workplace pensions, and the introduction of the
single-tier pension will ensure that the state provides a
good platform for private saving. Measures in the Bill are therefore
designed to build on these reforms and give people greater confidence
in pension
saving.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000133">As a
result of more people saving into a private pension we expect to see
more dormant pension pots as people move jobs—up to 50 million
by 2050. The Bill therefore contains powers to introduce a
pot-follows-member system of automatic transfers of small pension pots.
This will help people to better keep track of their pension savings and
ensure that they reap the benefits of consolidating those small
pots.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120363000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000134">The
automatic enrolment of people into pension schemes and the introduction
of automatic transfers make it all the more important that schemes used
for workplace pensions are well governed, well administered 
<?notus-xml column=143?>and offer value for money. The Bill therefore
extends powers to set minimum quality requirements for workplace
pension schemes and to limit or prohibit charges to allow the
Government to respond to the recent consultations on these issues
accordingly. In addition, the Bill contains a number of measures to
clarify and strengthen existing private pensions legislation, including
a power to prohibit the offering of incentives to transfer pension
rights. Finally, the Bill gives the Pensions Regulator a new objective
to minimise the impact on the sustainable growth of an employer when
regulating defined benefit pension scheme funding, and it also makes
changes to the calculation of the Pension Protection Fund’s

direction of travel. I also hope that he will work with me in seeing
what we can do during the passage of the Bill to make pensions
interesting. I do not promise that my contribution today will advance
that cause greatly, but it falls to all of us, if we want to raise the
level of saving in this country, to try to raise the level of interest
in it as well. So far, when anyone asks me what I am working on and I
tell them that it is the Pensions Bill, I find that they have looked at
their watch before I finish the sentence. I look forward to all the

firmly away from that agenda, I may say that one reason why we agree
with the idea of a single-tier pension is that it is very much the
direction of travel that the previous Labour Government took. However,
we have some significant questions about the way in which this
Government are doing it and about the decision to go with what is known
in the trade as a hard/fast transition. We agree, too, with the need to
address the way the state pension age is raised, but we have different
views on the best way to achieve consensus around
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:05:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

project of overhauling both state and private pension provision is of
crucial importance to the future of our country. We on these Benches
will do all that we can to improve this Bill to ensure that it is fit
for the job ahead. But that job is a tough one, made harder by the
climate of mistrust which obtains at present—mistrust of the
industry, which we must all address and, I regret to say, mistrust of
government. People can become cynical, and sometimes have, in the
welfare area, when something presented as a reform turns out all too
often to be really just a cut. It is popularly assumed that with
financial services products the bad news and exclusions are buried in
the small print. The same may be true here, of course. Parliament does
not yet have the small print, or the regulations, as we call them, but
I hope that the Minister can tell us how soon we can get them. But we
must maintain an appropriate degree of scepticism until we see what the
detail is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:07:19"></hs_TimeCode>. That
is particularly important in the light of the 13th report of the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, to which the Minister

regulations. So I look forward very much to the amendments that will
come forward from the Government

moving on to the detail, I, too, would like to say a few words about
the context of this Bill and background. When Labour came to office in
1997, we inherited two challenges in relation to pensions from the
previous Conservative Government. First, there were disgracefully high
levels of pensioner poverty, much of it among generations who worked
hard to rebuild Britain after the last war. The second problem was the
degree of mistrust in the pensions industry, some of it caused by the
mis-selling scandals of the 1980s and 1990s. Labour addressed both
challenges head on. We introduced a minimum income guarantee for
pensioners, lifting incomes from £68.80 per week in 1997 to more
than £132 by 2010. Under Labour, pensioner poverty fell to the
lowest level for 30 years. We pegged pensions to increase in line with
earnings and brought in pension savings credit to tackle the 100%
marginal deduction rate facing many savers. We brought low earners and
carers into the state second pension and introduced legislation for
auto-enrolment. I pay tribute to the Government for taking that forward
and implementing it. Crucially, we reduced the years of national
insurance contributions required for a full state pension from 44 years
to 30 years for men and from 39 years to 30 years for women. We also
set up the Turner commission, to which the Minister referred. I, too,
add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Turner, and my noble
friend Lady Drake on the excellent work that they
did<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:09:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000141">Labour
supports the creation of a simple state pension system, and we are
committed to the goal of encouraging people to save into private
pensions in which they can have confidence. But we believe there are
three tests that this Bill must pass if it is to achieve those
objectives. First, is it fair to all those who have contributed?
Secondly, is it sustainable in the long term? Thirdly, does it create a
decent standard of living for all and, within that, will it encourage
the private pensions saving that the Government are banking on to
ensure decent retirement
income<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:05:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:09:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:09:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:08:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:09:44"></hs_TimeCode>?

part of the Bill. The biggest challenge to understanding the reforms to
state pension provision in Part 1 is figuring out who are the winners
and losers. The Minister has graciously allowed us access to his
officials so we hope to dig down into that before Committee. However, I
wish to lay out some big questions, on which I hope he can come back.
First, as the Bill goes through the House, the Minister will need to
confirm the precise level at which the single-tier pension will be
introduced. The reason for that is twofold. First, the Work and
Pensions Select Committee recommended that, given the importance of the
principle that the STP is above the level of the pension credit
guarantee, the level should be on the face of the Bill.
Furthermore, paragraph 3 of the DPRRC report said that the Bill is
drawn in a way which means
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13120363000351" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000351">“for
the first time, the rate of the state pension will be specified only in
subordinate
legislation”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13120363000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000264">Given
that, the Minister needs to tell the House what the level of the STP
will
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:10:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13120363000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000143">Secondly,
there is the issue of those 700,000 women born between 1951 and 1953
who will have to wait longer to retire but will not get the new
single-tier pension, unlike men of the same age. While a line has to be
drawn somewhere, I think the House will want to reflect carefully
before concluding that, after a reform of this scale, a twin brother
and sister should find themselves in such markedly different
positions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:11:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000144">Thirdly,
some people who are married or widowed will receive a lower pension
because the derived entitlements to which the Minister referred have
been taken away. In other words, they would have expected to get a
higher pension based on their husband’s or wife’s
contributions, and they will now not be able to do so. Although state
pension rules of course change over time, this is a long-standing
provision around which some couples have planned their retirement
income. The Work and Pensions Select Committee recommended that women
within 15 years of state pension age should retain that right, so I
would be very interested to know why the Government decided not to
accept that
advice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000145">Fourthly,
the move from 30 to 35 qualifying years could mean that a number of
people, especially women and the low paid, are less likely to get a
full state pension, and someone with 9.5 years of national insurance
contributions will get not a penny in state pension. The House will
want to understand more about the rationale for that and the
consequences of that shift which reverses a significant Labour reform
which reduced the number of years to 30. I would also be grateful if

we have the issue of the abolition of the savings credit element of

in Part 1, we will want to examine the impact on both public and
private sector pension schemes of the changes relating to the ending of
contracting out. In addition, when these reforms are implemented,
national insurance contributions for contracted out workers will rise,
as will those for their employers. The Bill allows private pension
schemes to amend their terms to take account of the increase in
employers’ contributions but public sector schemes cannot do
that, presumably to avoid destabilising the public sector pension
settlements. That leaves an unfunded cost on the shoulders of public
sector employers. Can the Minister tell the House whether the
Government have committed to meeting that cost for those public sector
employers, perhaps from the £5.5 billion windfall the Treasury
will get as a result of increased national insurance

Part 2 of the Bill on pensionable age, the major issue relates to the
proposal to have regular reviews of pensionable age, at least every six
years. We agree with the need for periodic review, but the Minister is
right to say that everything around this needs to be consensual. We
agree with the principle but we think that, done badly, this could be
very bad and could remove certainty for future pensioners and damage
trust in the system, undermining incentives to save for the future. It
is vital that the way the state pension age is reviewed is not just
fair, but seen to be fair, ideally delivering cross-party consensual
support for reforms in which the public can then have confidence. We
believe that the best way to do that is for the reviews to be overseen
by an independent cross-party panel, including a Cross-Bench Member of
this House, and for it to have a broad remit. It should be
tasked to consider not just the latest trends in life
expectancy and the long-range public expenditure issues but also, for
example, differences in life expectancy for different socioeconomic
groups and the degree to which health and ageing go hand in
hand.</hs_para>

4 is very interesting, proposing, as it does, a complete
overhaul of bereavement support. As I understand it, bereaved people
under 45 without children will benefit, receiving a flat-rate grant for
one year for the first time, but I think that bereaved parents with
children will be the losers. At the moment, they can claim widowed
parent’s allowance for as long as they claim child benefit,
although in fact the average length of claim is just five years.
However, in future their support will last for only a year,
and that is a major shift. We have received strong representations from
charities which work with families with children, particularly bereaved
families, and which are worried about the impact of this reform on
bereaved parents. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain the
Government’s rationale behind this. Although there may be more
investment in the short term, I understand that over the long term the
measure will save money, or at least be neutral, and effectively it
will therefore redistribute money from parents with children who lose a
partner to people who do not have children. Understanding why that
choice was made would be helpful.</hs_para>

concerned about the conditionality requirements. The Minister mentioned
that society has changed and that people are expected to work. 
<?notus-xml column=147?>They are, but early widowhood is not just an ordinary time for someone
to go out to work. When families lose one parent, the effect on the
other parent can be very severe. I hope that the Minister will think
again about the conditionality requirements so that a person will not
be expected to go out to work just six months after losing a partner.
That would be very difficult.</hs_para>

5 on private pensions. The Government have explained to us the numbers
coming into auto-enrolment. If we think about this, it is clear that
the state owes a very serious duty of care to those who have
auto-enrolled into the pension system. If we are going to ask people,
at a time of wage stagnation and a cost-of-living crisis, to forgo
spending on themselves and their family today in order to invest for
the future, they absolutely must be able to trust their pension
providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000153">This
is a huge industry in the UK. About £180 billion is
invested in trust schemes and £275 billion of assets is invested
for DC schemes. Some 180,000 people with assets worth £2.65
billion have money in pension pots with annual management charges of
over 1%, and 400,000 people a year buy an annuity. The numbers are
eye-watering but the principles are pretty simple: the pension industry
has to deliver value for money. However, the OFT study published this

propose a number of ways in which the Bill could address the challenge
of building a private pension sector that people can trust. The first
is to improve pension schemes. We will argue for the full disclosure of
all costs and charges, including the costs extracted by fund managers,
and stronger trustee-based governance of savers’ pension money,
including the extension of fiduciary duties to all intermediaries who
handle pension savings and policies, with the aim of encouraging
bigger, better, stronger, well resourced and expert pension schemes

savers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000155">The
second proposal is better management of pension pots when people move
jobs. We absolutely agree about the need to make sure that people do
not lose track of pension pots when they move to a new job, but we
absolutely disagree with the way that the Government have decided to do
this. The Government have chosen “pot follows member”, as
it is known in the trade, but that raises some really serious
questions. The most important are probably, first, the potential for
customer detriment if, for example, the new employer’s pension
scheme is worse than the one that the person is leaving, and, secondly,
the real concerns about administrative complexity and the cost of this
way of doing things. We will need to drill down to that in
Committee.</hs_para>

would be for the pot, by default, to move to an aggregator such as
NEST, or one of its competitors, rather than to the new
employer’s scheme. That is not just a Labour position; it is
backed by many key experts, as we will come back to in Committee. In
fact, the DWP went out to consultation on this and, even though a
majority of respondents preferred the aggregator model, the
Government  
<?notus-xml column=148?>chose to plough on with “pot follows member” instead. I

charges have to be reasonable if people are to have confidence to
invest their hard-earned money. I am sorry to say that it has taken the
Government a long time to wake up to this issue. More than one year
ago, my right honourable friend Ed Miliband raised the issue of pension
charges and Ministers accused him of scaremongering. They said that no
action was needed because the market was “vibrant”. In
another place, the Pensions Minister ignored the evidence presented by
experts. He stonewalled the determined efforts of my honourable friend
Gregg McClymont as the Bill went through elsewhere to try to do
something about pension charges.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:20:34"></hs_TimeCode> am delighted
to say that Ministers have now acknowledged that there is an issue and
we are promised a consultation and a cap on charges. I absolutely
welcome this change of heart. As I am sure the right reverend Prelate
the Bishop of Derby will confirm, there is more rejoicing in heaven for
the one sinner who has repented than there is for the 99 who have
always been there. I welcome the Minister and the Government to the
happy place which Labour has happily occupied for some time. However,
we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:20:41"></hs_TimeCode> will need to
drill down on this in Committee. We will need to understand exactly
where the Government are going on this, the right level for the cap,
whether the cap will include the full range of charges and deductions,
and how soon action will be
taken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000158">Finally,
there is the means by which people turn their pension pot into an
income for retirement—decumulation, in the jargon. Most people
use their pension pot to buy an annuity. We are the annuity capital of
the world. More than half of all annuities are sold in the UK but the
annuity market has some serious issues and is badly in need of reform.
Performance is hugely variable, charges are often unreasonably high and
the margins are such as to raise serious questions about whether they
are value for money for savers. We will seek to amend the Bill
in Committee and on Report to ensure that people approaching retirement
receive good quality, independent advice, something that is already
best practice and available in many of the larger
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000159">In
conclusion, there is much to do to improve the Bill but we very much
welcome the direction of travel. At heart, pensions are about trust;
trust that the system is fair and sustainable, trust for savers that
their contributions are safe, and trust that the market is working
fairly and in the interest of savers. People in Britain must trust us
to ensure that, having contributed to pensions for their whole life,
they will have the income to afford a decent standard of living and to
enjoy their later years. We hope that the Minister will work with us in
Committee and on Report to provide the House with all the information
that it needs and help us all to make the Bill the best that it can be.

transform the state pension system by introducing its new single
flat-rate pension. I, too, pay tribute at the outset to all those who
have contributed to its happening. I particularly want to acknowledge
the hard work and dedication of my honourable friend the Pensions

for bringing to fruition a policy which reflects my party’s

state pension will particularly benefit women and the self-employed. It
will also make it easier for people to understand what they will
receive from the state when they retire. It will help to promote
private saving and build on the base of auto-enrolment, which in itself
has had a most encouraging start. Under the current state pension, a
woman on average receives £40 less a week than a man. The new
single-tier system will treat men and women alike. The Institute for
Fiscal Studies estimates that of women arriving at state pension age in
the first four years of this policy—between 2016 and
2020—61% will see their pension income increased as a result,
and that there will be further progress as time passes by.</hs_para>

IFS analysis also shows that the gains are greatest for those who have
spent periods not in work, caring for children, and for those men and
women who have had long periods of self-employment. The new
system will fully count time spent out of work caring for children,
which is of particular benefit to women, who are still more likely to
take time out of work as a result of starting a family. The new system
also benefits self-employed people, who currently lose out as a result,
among other things, of irregular working patterns and the difficulty of
applying a means test to them.</hs_para>

benefit of simplicity cannot be overvalued. Simplification is very
worthwhile. It enables people easily to understand their future

spur to help people save more for their retirement. Coupled with
automatic enrolment, we should see the quality and cost of private
saving schemes improve. That is why the Government’s proposal to

through speeches from the other House and responses from a wide variety

good a pension from the single-tier proposal as they would had the

provision has a long timespan tail, transitioning becomes even more
difficult. The Government have made significant changes to the
transitioning arrangements from when they first appeared as a policy
proposal, but I know that your Lordships’ House will wish to

first relates to public sector contracting out in pensions. As it
stands, the Bill provides for private sector pension schemes to be able
to amend their rules to accommodate the loss of income from national
insurance contribution rebates. These permitted scheme changes can go
no further than recouping the loss of these rebates, but can be
used more than once to achieve any objective—perhaps by staging
changes according to the strength of their overall funds. But this
ability to modify does not apply to public sector pension
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000168">Public
sector schemes cannot alter contribution levels into their funds, nor
can they alter the benefits offered. Yet there will be a reduction to
these schemes in national insurance contributions, of 1.4% from

this money—which some estimate at £5.5 billion a year

helping hand to employers has been introduced to allow them from next
April to offset the first £2,000 against their national

national insurance at all. Some of the retained government finance has
already been committed to meeting the financial demands of other
age-related policies, such as funding the care proposal cap outlined in
the Dilnot report. Roughly on a 5:7 to 2:7 ratio, two-sevenths of the

Chancellor of the Exchequer at some stage in the future, at the
beginning or after the beginning of the single-tier proposal. However,

of example, if we were in times of plenty, with public sector pension

wonder if my noble friend would agree that without the power to amend
their schemes, any shortfalls will have to be made up by the public
sector organisations responsible; and that this could mean local
authorities, who are currently so stretched for resources to meet the
urgent demands of their communities, having to find the extra cash
needed to sustain their pension funds. It would therefore make sense
for the Government to give some forward commitment to pension funds to
enable them to bridge the transfer to the new regime.</hs_para>

a pension from a public sector pension scheme, but my contributions

Bill, not unusually, has tacked on to it a measure that is only loosely

complex system of contribution conditions that makes it difficult to

are told that the reforms in the Bill are based on what people
have told the Government would provide them with the most support. I
understand that the Government believe they are not about reducing
entitlement or saving money. However, there is one part of the reforms
that is particularly harsh—and, some might argue, cruel. The
Government will expect parents of bereaved children to look for work
just six months after the child’s mother or father has died.
Kinship carers, by contrast, will be exempt from full work-search
requirements for a year after a child comes to live with them, to allow
the child to settle. As charities have pointed out, this could
lead to the perverse situation where a father caring for
his daughter after his wife's death would be required to work
within six months, whereas if the child went to live with an auntie, a
full year could be dedicated to helping her adjust. Subjecting
widows and widowers to full conditionality at such an early stage in
their grief may be counterproductive; it may increase stress and
anxiety, which in turn may lengthen time away from work.</hs_para>

current weekly payments of bereavement benefit assist with general
living expenses, with many finding those essential to meet basic living
costs. Where the person who died was the main breadwinner, the benefit
goes some way to replacing their income, allowing some continuity with
arrangements for looking after the children. For others, it allows the
surviving parent more flexibility to work fewer hours 
<?notus-xml column=152?>or to change jobs or even sector to fit with their
new responsibilities as sole carer of their child. Requiring bereaved
parents to complete a readjustment in just six months is harsh indeed,
and I hope that the Government will reconsider

in the Bill that can be welcomed and supported. I genuinely believe
that it takes forward much of the consensus that has recently been
established in this country about the best way to ensure that more
people retire with an adequate pension. That is a very important thing
to be doing. There are some people—maybe even in this
House—who recoil from the concept of a consensus in politics,
but when it comes to pensions policy, consensus is a very important
thing to strive for, in that it establishes the conditions for people
to plan for the future with some confidence. The one thing
that has bedevilled pensions policy in the UK in recent years has been
the constant stop and start, chop and change, which has acted as a
deterrent to people saving.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Turner, my noble friend Lady Drake and Sir John
Hills—the three commissioners who made up the Turner commission
—for helping us to focus our collective attention on two
fundamental problems that we face in this country. If the goal is to
ensure that more people retire with an adequate income, which I think
is the right policy because we cannot ask the taxpayer to shoulder the
principal burden in future years in the way that it has done in the
past, we know that we have to address these two fundamental
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000189">Not
enough people are saving and what they are saving is probably not going
to be enough to give them an adequate retirement income, so we have to
address 
<?notus-xml column=154?>that. We are addressing that now with auto-enrolment. The speakers in
this debate have already drawn attention to the progress that we are
making. The Minister referred to the nearly 2 million savings accounts
that have been established under auto-enrolment. That is to be
welcomed, there is no question at all about that, but we need a reality
check here. These are early days for auto-enrolment. The big challenge
and the big test for auto-enrolment are still to come, but so far so
good: we are making good progress.</hs_para>

never lose sight of one very important factor: it is wrong to say that
we have an established or developed savings culture in this country. In
fact, the opposite is true. We know from the Office for National
Statistics survey of occupational pensions that in the year running up
to auto-enrolment the number of occupational pension savers in this
country fell by almost half a million—in one year. It is going
to be a significant challenge to move from a culture that honours and
pays homage to debt, consumerism and spending to one that puts a
premium value on saving, but we have to make that transition.
Auto-enrolment is the right policy to ensure that we make progress in
that direction. The Bill makes some changes to auto-enrolment, such as
the technical changes in Clauses 36 to 40. Some of those are to be
welcomed. There is quite a lot of detail that needs to be fleshed out
as we move to Committee and Report.</hs_para>

people are saving is altogether more complicated. Today is probably not
the time for a debate about how much people are contributing via
auto-enrolment into these new savings accounts, but the time is
probably not far off when we will have to have a very honest debate in
this country about whether 8% or 9% of earnings going into a defined
contribution pension will be sufficient to guarantee people a decent
and adequate pension in retirement. I, for one, do not believe it
is.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120363000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000192">The group
of savers that we should be most concerned about are actually not those
who are the lowest paid. They will do well in auto-enrolment, together
with reforms to the state pension that I want to say a word or two
about in a minute. The people we in this House should be most concerned
about are those on median earnings, who are above the lowest threshold
of earnings, who are almost certainly not heading in the right
direction at the moment when it comes to ensuring that they have
adequate pensions. That debate cannot be postponed for very much
longer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000193">The
second of the two big problems that we face in this country concerns
the state pension. It has been clear to all of us—it was
certainly clear to my colleagues in the previous Government—that
the state pension has become far too complicated and far too wrapped up
in means-testing, and there is a serious risk that it will act as a
deterrent to people taking the principal responsibility themselves to
save for their retirement. That would have been a major, mortal threat
to auto-enrolment and the principle behind it, which is to shift over
time the burden of responsibility for saving from the state to the
individual<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:44:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000194">Like
my noble friend Lady Sherlock, who made an excellent speech from the
Front Bench—to be fair, the Minister did too—I think that
moving to a single state 
<?notus-xml column=155?>pension represents an historic opportunity to make sure that we avoid
that car crash. Moving to a single state pension can complement
auto-enrolment and not undermine it—and there would have been a
good chance of that happening if we had continued on the path that we
were
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:45:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the single state pension today on Second Reading is that reform, very
important and welcome though it is, is not going to be straightforward.
I remember well the time when I had just become Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions. I was going through a briefing with my officials on
the nature of the state pension. We had a full discussion about
that—there were pages in my briefing note about it and I hoped
that I had got my head around it. When I turned the volume over to deal
with the state second pension, there was nothing in the folder. I asked
the Permanent Secretary at the time, “Where is the briefing on
the state second pension?”. He said to me, “Secretary of
State, it’s too complicated for us to explain it”. I was
never quite sure whether he meant, “You aren’t capable of
understanding it so I’m not going to bother with trying to do
that”, or whether they were saying something which was actually
true—that is, that it had become too complicated. I
think that the latter is the case. There is no doubt in my mind that it
has become complicated. As a consequence, there are some genuine
transitional issues to sort out. I am quite sure that it is the right
thing in principle to be doing. We know that some people will lose out;
for example, people who due to their earnings would have built up a
higher state second pension if these changes had not been made. It will
be very important, although the principle is right, for Ministers to
keep their minds open about how this change can best be implemented.
However, as I have said, I think that it is the right thing to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:46:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000196">Like
others, I welcome Part 2 of the Bill, in particular the commitment to
keep the pensionable age under regular review. This change will be
necessary if we are to stay ahead of the demographic changes that have
already had a tremendous impact on our society and that, if anything is
true, are accelerating. Many think that at some point this trend for
longer life expectancy will flip into reverse; I really doubt that to
be true. There is no doubt that the pressures, both financial and
societal, will build up unless we stay ahead of the process of
demographic
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:47:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000197">That
is easier said than done in many respects, and I say that for one
reason: the age at which people retire, certainly for men, and for
women in fact, had not changed for several generations. My grandfather
would have retired at the age of 65. We have all come to expect as a
natural order of things to get to that age and then retire. That is the
old world and it has to be left behind, but it is sometimes difficult
to persuade people to understand that. The good news is that I think
that people have generally taken a very pragmatic view. If you compare
the response in Britain to the increasing age at which the state
pension is payable with the response to similar reforms in other
European countries, you can detect a degree of welcome pragmatism here
in the UK, and that bodes well for the future. However, further change
is necessary and it is right 
<?notus-xml column=156?>that we make sure that the process is as objective and non-partisan as
possible, which is why Part 2 is to be
welcomed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000198">There
is therefore a great deal to be welcomed in the Bill. I would like to
say that the same is true of Part 5, particularly the clauses dealing
with the transfer of pension benefits, but I really cannot say that to
your Lordships’ House. The Government have made a significant
mistake, or stand on the threshold of doing so, in their reforms around
pot follows

clear that there could as a result of auto-enrolment be up to 50
million small pension pots being established. People will change
employment fairly regularly, particularly early on in their working

developed and basically left dormant. We should not be complacent about
that; we have got to decide what to do about it. The Government have
come up with the idea of pot follows member. The other obvious course
open to them, which my noble friend referred to from the Front Bench,
to use aggregation as the default option, has been
rejected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000200">I
say to the Minister that I hope he can reflect on this with his
colleagues. I think that a mistake is about to be made here and I hope
that we can avoid it even at this late stage. I have nothing in
principle against pot follows member—there is a logic to
it—but making it the default option through legislation is the
wrong decision. I say that it is wrong because it lacks ambition. It
exposes some savers to the risk that they will move from well run, well
managed, good value-for-money schemes into schemes that are less well
run and provide less value for money. I am not entirely sure that the
minimum standards will iron out or rule out that
hazard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000201">When
it comes to setting policy in this area, we must keep asking ourselves:
what is the best thing for people who are saving? It is not necessarily
the same thing to ask ourselves: what is the least risky reform for
Ministers to make? The question is: what is in the best interests of
savers? I accept that aggregation poses some significant
challenges—there needs to be a clearing house, proper data, and
so on—but that route genuinely offers the prospect of higher
pensions in retirement than pot follows

other commentators, too. I am a great admirer of Michael Johnson and

that one year is a very short time within which to encapsulate
bereavement. Many people who work in this area in the voluntary sector
would concur with that. I propose to the Minister that we should
consider a three-year term to provide the stability and continuity that
family life requires. I am not an experienced politician so I am not
offering three years and thinking that the Minister might negotiate
down to 18 months, I am saying that, from my pastoral experience, three
years would be the right kind of timeframe if pensions are about
providing continuity and
stability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000211">I
want to give three or four brief reasons why I propose three years. The
first is in terms of the pastoral situation of the family concerned. If
this support ends after one year, that comes at a very raw time. I can
tell your Lordships, from my ministry, that many people who have
nothing to do with the church will come back on the first anniversary
to light a candle, come to Evensong and pray with a priest. We could be
giving people a double loss if this support was withdrawn after one
year.</hs_para>

if we stop after one year, many who would then be lone
parents, with children to look after, would probably have to face the
prospect of working more hours to make up their income. Some people
project that 75% of new claimants will be worse off under these
proposals. This is just when children need more care and attention
because their bereavement happens in phases, not just over a few weeks
or months. Two or three years is a fair time to enable children to
adjust but just when they need more time, the person who would now be
their single parent might have to look to spend more time away from
them at work.</hs_para>

a withdrawal of the net of support for continuity and stability, and
are these proposals more like a death grant than care in bereavement?
There is a big difference between offering a grant, even if it is
extended over a year on death, and care and bereavement. Pensions are
about ongoing care and stability at a time of change into a new
life.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120363000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0001.htm#13120363000214">My
fourth point is on universal credit, the provision that is offered in
its place. Just as families are having higher costs as children grow
older and more expensive, the universal credit system which would take
over after the year, as I understand it, would mean that the now lone
parent would have to be willing to prepare for work while their
children are three or four years old, and be available for work when
they are five. That may be well within the three years during which
children need special care and attention for their bereavement. Can the
Minister comment on that point? Is this proposal about bereavement or
an extended death grant? Bereavement is a proposal that
takes pensions seriously; a death grant is nothing to do with pensions
but something rather different. If pensions are to provide appropriate
stability and continuity in life through times of great change into
another way of living, and especially if children are involved, is
there a case for having a three-year support rather than a one-year
support and universal credit?</hs_para>

is whether the Government will be sufficiently bold in exercising these

with the OFT finding that the demand side, the buyer, of the DC
workplace pensions market is one of the weakest that it has analysed in
years—raises the bar inexorably on governance requirements,
especially as auto-enrolment drives a level of demand that the industry
would not achieve under a voluntary system. Poor governance, a lack of
transparency or scrutiny and conflicts of interest are to be found
abundantly on the supply side. To quote the OFT,</hs_para>

embracing auto-enrolment. Relatively few have opted out so far, and
employers are fulfilling their duty. However, this places a reciprocal
responsibility on the Government to protect ordinary people against
poor standards and conflicts of interest. The challenge that the
Minister is grappling with is apparent from the plethora of
consultations and investigations: the FCA on annuity markets and asset
management charges; the OFT on the workplace pensions market; the DWP
on quality standards, governance and charges; the Law Commission on how
the law of fiduciary duties applies to investment intermediaries, using
pensions as an exemplar; and TPR on codes of practice. The imbalance
between the buyer and the supplier sides of the pensions market, and
the systemic inequalities of knowledge and understanding between 
<?notus-xml column=160?>saver and provider, mean that seeking an alignment of interests is not
sufficient—the interests of the saver must come first. There
must be a duty to act in the saver’s best interests and, where
there is a conflict of interest, priority must go to the saver. No
shareholder has a right to gain a dividend from selling or managing a
pension product that fails to meet the interests of the saver. The

“Pot follows member” cannot be implemented without
raising quality standards or the Government risk transferring the

existing scheme. PFM increases the regulatory burden to oversee the
myriad workplace schemes into which automatic transfers would be made
rather than focusing on leveraging extremely high quality in a few
aggregator schemes. Pot follows member may prove complex for the
industry to implement and increase risks to savers. Pot follows member
increases risks of charges and transaction costs being incurred on the
whole pension pot each time a worker changes their job and transfers

previous employer. An efficient pot consolidation mechanism is needed,

The Government argue that significant sums accumulating in aggregator

market where competition cannot be relied upon to deliver value for
money—the words of the OFT, not mine—the driver, as my

the impact of work on women’s mortality. We discovered in a
preliminary way that women subjected to the same work and life
experiences as men had quite similar mortality and that the female
differentiation then taken for granted was not, in fact, in all cases
completely sustainable. However, the Government Actuary’s
Department was not impressed with the finding and I must admit it was
far from proven. It was, however, a straw in the wind and has been at
least partially confirmed as time has passed. Today, differential
mortality between sexes and social classes is an accepted fact, even if

will briefly raise some points for consideration in the time ahead. The
first picks up on a matter referred to earlier in this speech and in
other speeches. Clause 26 makes provision for a periodic
review by the Secretary of State of the pensionable age in the light of
changes in life expectancy and other relevant factors. I referred
earlier to differential mortality. It is now known beyond all
reasonable doubt that there is a wide variation in mortality
and that life experience is a key factor in that. What is often
referred to as “postcode mortality” conceals a much
deeper area. The Government have promised a review. It is envisaged
that that review will be conducted by the Government Actuary’s
Department. In addition to that, the Government must appoint a panel of
one or more persons to consider factors relevant to the pensionable
age. I ask my noble friend to consider appointing more than one person

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it gives me considerable pleasure
to follow and welcome the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Balfe,
in this House. He has described the slightly
circuitous political route that he 
<?notus-xml column=164?>has taken through his life, whereby he has ended up
sitting on the government Benches. I have long and, by and large, fond
memories of his activities when he was, perhaps, in a slightly
different political place. When I was in south London, in the
early 1970s, he was already a force in the London Co-operative and
Labour movement. Eventually, he became my Member of the European
Parliament. He probably does not mention it that much to his colleagues
these days but, during my period as general secretary of the party and
his time as an officer of the British Labour group, or the EPLP, as we
now call it—for some reason, whoever was in control of the EPLP,
whether it was the right or the left, pro-Europeans or anti-Europeans,
Richard was always an officer—he was extremely helpful to me. I
shall put it no more strongly than that. When I did a European job in
Brussels and Strasbourg, he was extremely helpful to me, personally,
and I am very grateful for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:21:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000239" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120363000239">Obviously,
the road to Damascus is dangerous, and the noble Lord has had a bit of
a conversion, the full political and spiritual aspects of which I am
not entirely clear on. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, is a
bit unsure himself, given the past history. But it is clear that he has
retained some of his early interests and commitments, particularly in
relation to the trade union movement. I recognise the Prime
Minister’s wisdom in giving him his remit. I have two regrets.
On the one hand, not all leaders of trade unions were prepared to talk
to him on the subject; on the other, it is clear that the leader of the
Conservative Party has not entirely followed his wise advice. However,
he maintains an unashamed interest in that field, I am very pleased to

reference to this Bill, the noble Lord’s experience with the
pension scheme of European Members of Parliament is instructive. If he
can make improvements to this Bill that render similar conditions for
the bulk of the population, I think that we will all be seriously

him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:22:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120363000241">As
regards the Bill, I share the general consensus of the overall
direction and, in particular, the concept of a single-tier pension
scheme, but I do have a number of concerns. My main concern is about
the impact on employee members and employers who run occupational
pension schemes, both private and public. I have concern for certain
other groups, as well, which may well come up in Committee—for
example, the cohort of women born in the early 1950s, who seem to miss
out on both counts, as well as those who would have got a better
pension under the old system than they will with this one. We can deal
with those issues in
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:23:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:22:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000242" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120363000242">My
main concern at the outset is about the cost that these provisions will
impose on all existing occupational schemes. I spent an early part of
my youth getting large swathes of manual workers and others into
occupational pension schemes, and it is one of my great regrets in life
that the security that that seemed to provide them with for the first
time has disappeared in the private sector to a large extent and has
been diluted even within the public
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:23:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120363000243">As
the noble Lord, Lord German, said, all occupational schemes will, as a
result of this Bill, face increased costs of approximately 1.4% for
employees and 3.4% for employers as a result of the
national insurance 
<?notus-xml column=165?>implications. I have a special interest in the local
government scheme, and I declare an interest as a vice-president of the
LGA and a member of the GMB. In neither capacity do I receive any
pecuniary benefit, but nevertheless I have taken an interest, until
recently being a chair of one of the member schemes of the local
government
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:24:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:23:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120363000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120363000244">As
the noble Lord, Lord German, said, in the case of private sector
occupational schemes, Clause 24 allows for the overriding of existing
rules and benefits which had previously been negotiated or provided by
the trustees of a scheme, in order to offset these costs. I think that
that is quite a dangerous move and will cause difficulties in a whole
range of private sector occupational schemes. I certainly do not
propose that the Government should extend that to public sector
schemes. However, there has to be some recognition of the size of the
impact on public sector occupational schemes. I think that the local
government scheme in particular is likely to suffer from this. Some
public sector trade unions and scheme members have been given a bit of
a nod and a wink and been told that departmental budgets will adjust to
cover these schemes. I suspect that that assurance is not worth the
paper on which it is not written, but they have been given some
assurance in that regard.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120363000245" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120363000245">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:25:25"></hs_TimeCode>,
no such assurance has been given in relation to the settlement with
local government. The cost increase of the local government scheme for
the average employee earning about £27,000 per annum will be
£25 a month over a lifetime. The cost to the employers is an
additional £700 million. For a small Welsh council, that would
mean charging an extra £33 in council tax. For a typical
northern metropolitan district council, it would mean withdrawing
£2.5 million per annum from expenditure on public services. That
is not an inconsiderable cost and the Government need to face up to it.
The speed with which local authorities are expected to adjust their
pension schemes is also an important factor. These provisions are to be
brought in almost immediately. Local authority finance directors are
already budgeting for 2016-17. To have such additional costs imposed on
them, with the accompanying uncertainty, gives them a real
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:27:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

authority scheme and every local authority fund will suffer as a result
of this measure, but it is not only local authorities: a very large
number of private bodies—several hundred—are also
admitted members to the local government scheme. They vary from
outsourced companies as big as Serco, Mitie and Sodexo to relatively
small charities such as the North London Hospice, the Norfolk Heritage
Fleet Trust and various museums, and to bigger charities such as the
Alzheimer’s Society, the Children’s Society and
Barnardo’s. They include all sorts of bodies such as museums,
the local citizens advice bureaux and parish councils with full-time
employees and so forth. So this is a cost issue that hits many large
and small private bodies and charities as well as local government
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:28:17"></hs_TimeCode>.

are other complications. For example, under the Bill, LGPS funds will
suffer significantly from the fact that the payment of pensions
increases in members’ 
<?notus-xml column=166?>guaranteed minimum pensions, which currently the
Government pay, will be shifted on to the employers and the public
sector pension schemes directly. So there are significant additional

do not have a solution to this problem but the Government need to have
one. We took the then Public Service Pensions Bill through this House
with some difficulty. However, the employers and the trade unions very
responsibly sat down and agreed on how it should be effectively
implemented in the LGPS area. These new costs, as well as the possible
knock-on effects on the level of contracting out, particularly for
low-income employees but more generally as well, and the costs for the
employer of running the scheme are likely to tear up that agreement
very quickly. At the very minimum, we need more time to ensure that

year, the additional state pension will have existed for 36 years, so
it nearly qualifies for the 40-year time horizon but not quite. Does

pensions was in 1970 when, as a NALGO branch secretary, I campaigned
for an occupational pension for university non-teaching staff at the

by insurance companies

Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London—or SAUL,
as they are called—and it now has assets of more than £1
billion. It was an uphill climb because the majority of staff were
women. The assumption was that women were not going to stay in the job
very long and would probably get married, so why would they want an
occupational pension? Those on the lowest grade and part-timers were
not even allowed into the college-based pension scheme, presumably
because it was felt that they would not stay at work for very
long.</hs_para>

Paddick (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may start by declaring a
couple of interests. I am already in receipt of a police pension and I
thought that I would be in receipt of the state pension in 10
years’ time until I received a letter from the DWP telling me
that it will now be 11 years. Some noble Lords may be intrigued as to
why, as a former police officer, I am contributing to this debate. My
main concerns are about the reforms to welfare that this Government
have introduced. However, I am slightly less concerned about this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:39:42"></hs_TimeCode>. Noble
Lords also may wonder why I am contributing when there has been such a
big build-up in terms of how interesting this subject is. I have to say
that the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Hutton of Furness, was
fascinating more than interesting. I congratulate my noble friend Lord
Balfe on his maiden speech, which may sound a bit cheeky coming from
someone who made his only five minutes ago, but his wealth of
experience will be very valuable in this

support this Bill and pay tribute, as others have done, to my
honourable friend the Pensions Minister, Steve Webb, and his team. This
is a difficult subject for any government to tackle. It is to his and
his team’s credit that they have taken it on. As the noble
Baroness, Lady Sherlock, has said, there are three tests; namely, that
pensions must be fair, sustainable and provide a decent standard of
living. I believe that that is what this Bill does. Of course, it is up
to your Lordships to test that during our debates at this stage, in
Committee and on

was introduced in 1926, only half of those who reached the age of 15
were expected to live to the age of 65. On average, people would spend
just over 11 years collecting their state pension. In 2013, 93% of 15
year-olds are expected to live to 65 and 32%, almost one-third, have a
chance of reaching 100. Clearly, in terms of sustainability, things
need to change. The level at which the new single-tier state pension is
set appears to be reasonable, as has been said by the Minister, and is
above the current state pension means test. It allows people to plan
for their future on the basis of understanding what, at least in
today’s money, they are likely to expect when they reach
pensionable age.</hs_para>

automatic enrolment of workers in pension schemes requires safeguards.
This Government appear to have worked hard to ensure that those
safeguards, including, as has been said, the very welcome capping of
fees, are in place. I will talk about the “pot follows
member” issue at the end of my remarks. The noble Baronesses,
Lady Donaghy and Lady Sherlock, expressed concern about women born
between 1951 and 1953 who will not be eligible for the single-tier
pension whereas men of the same age will be. My understanding is that
these women need to make only 30 years of national insurance
contributions, as opposed to 35 years for their male
colleagues. In addition, those women will be able to draw their state
pension earlier than men, at some time between the age of 61 and 63.
Men in the same age group will not be able to draw their pension until
they are somewhere between the age of 63 and 68. Clearly, that is not a
straightforward issue. Swings and roundabouts are
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000005">As
someone who has more than 30 but less than 35 years of

that I do not appear to qualify for a single-tier pension, which is
currently set to be £144. However, I am reassured that, if the
new system gives me more than the current £110, I will get that
amount. If I would have received more under the old system, I will
receive that amount. In short, while others may be better off than me
under the new scheme, at least I will not be worse off. I ask whether
these changes are to be brought about because of the need to be
sustainable.</hs_para>

than previously planned but it still gives a lead time of 13 years,
which will enable people to make provision for it. Surely, this makes
sense when one takes into account the fact that, at the moment, life

26 introduces a review of the state pension age, taking into account
life expectancy and other relevant factors, every five years or,
allowing for some leeway, every six years as stated in the legislation.

The first report would be in 2017. The Secretary of State will have to
commission 
<?notus-xml column=170?>reports from the Government Actuary’s Department on life
expectancy and from an independent, appointed panel on other factors to
be specified by the Secretary of State. This Government have indicated
that the panel will be similar in nature to the Hutton inquiry. It
seems eminently sensible that not only life expectancy but other
factors that may arise or change over the years are considered by an
independent panel, provided there is sufficient lead time to enable
those affected by such changes to plan for their retirement.</hs_para>

whether “pot follows member” would be the right system,
my understanding is that Australia, a country that is held up as an

regards ensuring that there are caps on fees charged by pensions
providers, it is hoped that the minimum standards to be applied should
ensure that if pot does follow member to a new employer, the new scheme
will be as good as the one from which the money is being moved.
Clearly, employees will have to consider into what pension scheme their

me, the great virtue of the new state pension, unlike private pensions,
is that it removes risk. So my test of the Bill, not dissimilar to that
of my noble friend Lady Sherlock, is: does it make pensions simpler,
easier to understand and more transparent? Will it produce an adequate
replacement income in retirement while being affordable both to
individuals and society? Is the Bill fair, recognising women’s
unpaid as well as conventionally paid work, and not leaving groups of
women unfairly outside the system? Is it also fair in its assumptions
about retirement age? Does it encourage 
<?notus-xml column=171?>savings where possible by removing means-testing,
which inhibits them? My acronym is SAFER. The Bill must make pensions:
simple; adequate and affordable; and fair; encouraging savings; and
removing means-testing. Does it do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:50:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000014">Is
it simpler? Yes, although it is not yet simple. By bringing together
the state retirement pension, S2P and pension credit into one single
state pension, people can predict their state pension if they have full
contributions. But they still have to work out whether their mix of
contributions and credits will cover 35 years. Over time, it
should do so given a full working age life, but it may
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:50:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000015">Is
it adequate and affordable? Will the new state pension continue to
address pensioner poverty? S2P, which redistributes to poorer earners,
and pension credit, which especially helps older widowed women, were
both in Bills that I took through this House. Together, they targeted
pensioner poverty and succeeded. Since 1998, pensions have increased
three times faster than wages. In 1997, pensioners were the poorest
group of our society—the poorest of the poor. When we left, they
were less likely to be poor than any other group in
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T17:51:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000016">But
helping existing poor pensioners through means-testing has potentially
the perverse effect of deterring future pensioners from saving. By
building a stronger state platform, as the Bill does, we both target
poverty and support saving. Is it adequate? A middle-aged couple, he on
average earnings and she on a modest part-time job, might expect a
replacement state pension in future of around 70%—adequate for
them, yes. On top may come NEST, its value depending on their age,

it affordable for us? Given the raising of the state pension age, the
capping of S2P and the overall £5.5 billion of NICs
windfall from ending contracting out, which will go to HMRC, then, yes.

the Bill fair? For me, that raises two questions. First, will all those
who should do so get the new pension? No, it is not that fair. If I
were the Minister I would want as inclusive a structure as possible.
Those left out of the new single pension will continue to get pension
credit, and the cost and confusion of running two systems for a further
40 years is clearly undesirable. Obviously, pension credit will remain
as a residual safety net, but we want as few people as possible to fall
into it. Who gets left out? Service wives do, possibly, depending on
their age, and I will table an amendment on that. Women with several
mini-jobs will also be left if they perhaps work 20 hours a week yet

does he know? Has he asked them? He said that they could pay voluntary

50,000 or so excluded on the beliefs—not facts—offered by

second question of fairness is around the state pension age. I am
pretty fed up with people, usually in well paid, interesting,
salubrious and physically undemanding jobs, pronouncing that as we are
now living longer we must all work longer and what is more—the
final insult—it is good for us. This House will know that we
have three stages of older age. Most of us who reach 65 in good health
can expect another decade of healthy retirement. From our mid-70s, we
develop functional disability—mobility, sight, hearing and
reach—which increasingly limits what we can do for the next
decade. We need support. Then, in the last three to five years of life
in our upper 80s, we need care. As the Government’s analysis in
the ONS stats shows, between 2000-02 and 2008-10, male life expectancy
rose by over two years. But—and this is key—only a third

2007 and 2010, the most deprived fifth of the population had a healthy

years extending healthy retirement but additional years of increased
disability and dependency, especially if you are poorer off. Every year
that we raise the state pension age is deeply unfair on those who have
had hard lives. They start work five years earlier than those who enjoy
higher education, and they can expect 10 to 15 years less of overall
life expectancy and of healthy life expectancy. By raising the state
retirement age, we eat into and reduce their few healthy retirement

Yes. On the state pensions front, indeed I do. I even wrote a pamphlet

delighted to corral Steve Webb, then a Back-Bencher, into contributing
to said pamphlet. All credit to him and the DWP team behind him for
delivering the SAFER pension; I am really pleased. It will continue to
reduce pensioner poverty; it will eradicate for very many the snakes
and ladders of means-testing; it moves us closer to a decent state
pension for all, but one rightly clothed in a contributory system. It
will make it safe to save. Those are really valuable contributions.
However, it can be improved. The Minister will be delighted to learn

country have become an area where successive Governments in the main
have sought a degree of continuity with their predecessors. From time
to time, there has been an impressive degree of cross-party agreement;
my noble friend Lady Hollis has just reminded us of one or two
significant contributions made by the current Pensions Minister. There
is a recognition that this is a long-term problem and that long-term
approaches need to be taken to pensions. They should be taken rather
more in other areas, which are perhaps more politically controversial.
Given the uneven nature of pension provision in Britain, we certainly
need a continuous effort to tackle some of the more glaring
inequalities that abound. Still, the degree of agreement has been
impressive. That stems from a report by the Pensions Commission, which
the noble Lord, Lord Turner, chaired and of which my noble friend Lady
Drake was a member.</hs_para>

a general welcome for the main pillars of the Bill, there are problems
that I want to touch on briefly. I will look first at the statutory
override in Clause 24 and Schedule 14, which provides that private
sector employers must make changes in their schemes that are
commensurate with the higher national insurance costs that arise from
the end of contracting out, and for that be done without trustee or
member consent. Because the calculation will be done at the aggregate
level, not per individual, many scheme members may well lose out.
Despite the requirement in Schedule 14 for actuarial certification of
scheme changes, we believe that these protections are not solid enough
to make sure that people do not lose out significantly.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120375000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000032">On the state second
pension itself, the concern has to be that the majority of future
pensioners could well be worse off under the single tier, because its
accrual rate is lower than the current system for people not contracted
out. Those retiring later are more likely to lose out and to lose out
more. It is not fair that people close to retirement and not contracted
out of the state second pension will be unable to accrue a state
pension above the single-tier starting rate, despite continuing to pay
full national insurance contributions.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120375000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000033">There are also problems
with the accelerated timetable for increasing the state pension age to
67 in Clause 25. My noble friend Lady Hollis has just spoken eloquently
along the same lines. There has not been enough time to address
some of the inherent inequalities that exist both regionally
and between manual and professional workers. It seems that you have won
the jackpot if you are a professional worker in Dorset; if you are a
manual worker in one of the old industrial areas, you are in trouble.
Yet it is “one size fits all”, and that one size does not
fit some, for whom, in the years after retirement, the forecasts are
pretty poor. I hope that these will be considered. Certainly, if the
state pension age is to be changed again, I hope that 
<?notus-xml column=175?>this review will lead to some independent process, to give people
confidence in the judgment about retirement ages.</hs_para>

private pensions and auto-enrolment, Clause 35 extends government
powers to cap pension scheme charges. Lower charges are very important.
From my Danish knowledge, the contrast between low charges there and
high charges here, historically, has been extremely marked and I
welcome what is being done to bring down the British level. The
principle is good, but the worry is that the changes over a single year
can distort the benefits that come with long-term saving. We ask that
the Minister and the House take a look at perhaps having a cap over the
lifetime of the scheme, which would offer greater flexibility. In the
current consultation exercise, it is important that we do not rush this
fence too fast, without looking at the longer period over which to
compute the appropriate cap.</hs_para>

Eccles (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, as we consider the detail of the
Bill—many of those who have spoken have made very good points
about the detail—I hope we will remember two things. First, a
great deal of what actually happens will depend on secondary
legislation. In essence, this is a framework Bill, and much will emerge
as the regulations are produced. Secondly, as we go through the Bill, I
want, from long private sector experience, to think a bit about other
things that come on top of state provision.</hs_para>

noble Lords, I fully welcome the move to a single-tier pension, which
is an excellent thing to do. If I may venture an opinion, I would do
it, in the end, with the smallest possible consideration of the
difference between people and their experiences. I would eliminate, if
I could, the idea that certain things should be taken into account, so
that it would be a well established and very simple “that is
what we are going to get”
pension<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T18:10:21"></hs_TimeCode>. As has
been said before, pension legislation is a dense thicket, into which we
venture sometimes but probably as little as we need to. We do 
<?notus-xml column=176?>not get very far and come out all scratched without really understanding
the detail. Anything that simplifies what is going on out there must be

departmental brief took us back to Beveridge and 1942. I remember the
excitement when that report was produced. The terminology in Beveridge
is very different from the terminology we use today. He referred to
want, a subsistence minimum, savings on top and the avoidance of an
intolerable financial burden. On that last point, we are probably in
some form of denial, in that there is nothing which could be rightly
described as an intolerable financial burden. Beveridge also said that
we should do nothing that discourages the individual from doing the
best he can for himself and his family. He was determined, in what he
wrote, to make his progressive, reforming recommendations but, he
hoped, without perverse incentives being contained in what was
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000042">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T18:12:14"></hs_TimeCode>
course, between 1942 and today, very great changes have taken place.
The brief refers, as all noble Lords have, to demography. In
Beveridge’s time, 10 years of retirement would have
been a pretty long time. I fully admit that this is a very theoretical
point, but if we were, 10 years from now, to put up the retirement age
to 70, we would probably be looking at more like 15 or maybe 20 years
of retirement, which is a very big change. Because life is very uneven
and unfair, that is only an average. I fully concede that averages can
be very
deceptive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000043">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T18:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>
brief referred to the much increased employment of women, something
that has been completely transformed from what applied before the
Second World War. However, other things are not in the brief which I
think are very important and go to the point on confidence and trust,
which has also been referred to many times this afternoon. There is the
relative prosperity—real incomes today are probably three times
what they were in 1942—but of course, alongside that, financial
services have become immensely more sophisticated and much more
difficult to
understand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000044">Then<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T18:13:50"></hs_TimeCode>
there have been the rapid changes to the economy, including the
disappearance of enormous industries. I come from the north-east of
England, where there is not a deep coal mine left, which is almost
unthinkable. ICI has disappeared, which is, again, almost unthinkable.
Some of these changes have been created by the incredibly rapid
progress of technology. Completely unimaginable things have happened,
even in stable, long-running companies. British Telecom, for example,
suffered the split from Royal Mail and the Post Office. When we were
younger, all the equipment was electro-mechanical, but of course it is
now digital and a completely different employment pattern is involved
in looking after all the equipment in that business. Even in
long-running and apparently very stable businesses, there have been
enormous changes in the pattern of
employment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T18:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000045">There
has also been social change, with people wanting different types of
career. The idea was certainly prevalent in the days of Beveridge that
you joined a company and there you were: that was your life from coming
out of school or university until you retired. That now is the
exception and not the rule. In trying to deal with all these changes,
we have tended to muddle 
<?notus-xml column=177?>the distinction between provision by the state and
the top-up that Beveridge referred to, which is acquired privately. We
have not thought carefully about the limits of state intervention or
carefully enough about doing nothing that discourages individuals from
doing the best they can for themselves and their family. Instead, we
have got into a situation where there is an impenetrable thicket, which
is not understood by many people and in which, therefore, very few
people have confidence and trust. We desperately need to simplify
wherever we can—not only in state provision but in private
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T18:16:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000046">I
turn to one or two examples. The linchpin of private provision was
always the defined benefit system, which related to salary and service.
Such schemes are dying on their feet. Company after company has gone
out of defined benefit schemes after finding them impossible to retain.
The promises made in those schemes were so long that the actuaries were
unable to match their view of contributions and assets to the potential
liabilities, and they kept getting the sums wrong. That is not at all
surprising if you set that against the differences that have occurred
in society and in business and
commerce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T18:17:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000047">My
own experience is of working for 27 years for an engineering company in
the north-east, which was taken over, in a deal brokered by the
Government of the day, by another engineering company in the
north-east. That was in turn taken over by a big construction company,
which was then taken over by a big shipbuilding company based in Norway
with lots of other engineering industries. That company went bust. I am
a pensioner—I should declare that as an interest—of a
closed scheme where there are problems. There is now a separate,
independent, ring-fenced company with all the funds that came from
those different companies. If I told you all the companies that were in
the current ring-fenced scheme, you would be amazed. It is nothing like
four, and probably closer to 20. It is very difficult to maintain trust

from defined benefit to money purchase schemes, which of course is the
solution in many cases, has also proved very difficult, because of the
same sort of considerations. Promises have been made to the people in
the defined benefit scheme, which is closed, under the contracts
entered into with them, but newly employed people are put into a
different mode. That creates two classes of employee. Many people have

the other day, I was asked by quite a young self-employed person,
“Why is it wise for me to have a pension?”. I said,
“Is anybody else going to contribute to it or are you going to
do it all on your own?”. That is the first question you should
ask yourself. The second is: what are the tax advantages of putting
whatever you save into a pension scheme, personal or otherwise? If you
really think about it, the two reasons why we are so keen on pensions
as a method of saving are: first, somebody else is going to contribute
as well as myself; and secondly, it gives me tax capacity.
For a lot of people, other forms of saving, provided that they
have the tax capacity, may well be a better way of going about it than
joining schemes.</hs_para>

I have a thought about fees. Of course, if a system is extremely
complicated, I am afraid the fees will be high. They become high for
two reasons: first, the complexity means that they will be high; and
secondly, if you do not think through your own position as a member of
a scheme, you contract it out to somebody else and do not pay close
interest. In addition, there could be many regulations and rules. It
was no surprise to get a letter from somebody involved in my
self-invested pension plan saying, “Given everything that is
happening now, you should expect fees of 2.5% per year”. I can
tell your Lordships that I have been trying to ensure that that did not

that we are living very much longer, and the Government already insist
that everyone will need to work longer before collecting the basic
state pension. The Bill proposes a single-tier pension for those
retiring from 2016 and, of course, contains provisions under which men
and women will work to the same age—67—by 2026. The
single-tier pension will be £144 per week above the basic level
of means-tested support. As indicated, the pack provided by the
Government sets out the ways in which it is proposed to transfer people

affect people, poorer people in particular? Many people in well paid
jobs are quite happy to work for longer before retiring. Some actually
want to do so. Things are often very different for those who have spent
a lifetime in employment such as manual labour or cleaning, often very
low paid work. A woman who has done that kind of work, such as hospital
cleaning, over the years is very anxious to be able to give it all up

there are workers in strenuous or difficult, sometimes dangerous, work.
We should remember the fire service staff who threatened industrial
action if their retirement age was raised, who were successful in
getting what they wanted. Of course, there are other industries in
which people will want to retire early. There should be provision for
them to do so. A single-tier payment may be easier to administer but
people are different and work patterns are different, and a good scheme
should take account of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000055">The Bill
also deals with the effect of private pensions. These have changed over
the years, as many people have said. I well recall my years as a trade
union official, when we all aimed to have members in what were then
called final salary schemes—now known as defined benefit
schemes. These have to some extent disappeared, except in cases where
there is strong enough union organisation to prevent that
from happening. My own union, Unite, has had several successes in that
direction. But generally speaking, the number of employees saving in
workplace pension schemes has declined.</hs_para>

there is the matter of pension pots. People change jobs and could
perhaps lose track of pensions from former employment. The Government

aggregator—but unfortunately this was not accepted. This was
discussed earlier in the debate, particularly by my noble friend Lady

it be left to the market? I think not. Then there is the possibility of
annuities; again, these are not popular. This is a very important

directions—on bereavement, for example—but this seems to
be on a short-term basis and there could therefore be losers. I note
that the present restrictions on the payment of state pensions outside
the UK will remain in place for single-tier pensions. The provision is
strongly objected to by people who paid their contributions while they
were in this country but who have retired to countries where there is
no reciprocal arrangement. This was also raised in the recent debate in

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, as my noble friend Lady
Turner has just said, this is an important Bill which covers a major
area of public policy: how we provide for and treat our citizens in
retirement, the extent to which we expect them to make provision
themselves through their lifetime and how we value contributions made
otherwise than through formal work by way of caring or nurturing future
generations. It is about the intergenerational
bargain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000065">As a
number of noble Lords have recognised, despite major and progressive
changes to the pension environment in recent years, we cannot claim
that the state pension construct has yet reached steady state. We know
that the proportion of women in Great Britain qualifying for a full
state pension will not equalise with men for another six or seven
years, and for S2P outcomes to equalise will take much longer. While
the availability of means-tested benefits—pension credit,
housing benefit and council tax support as it now is—has lifted
millions of pensioners out of poverty, there remain problems of take-up
and ongoing questions of the extent to which their potential
availability undermines incentives to save. Despite progress, we have
not eliminated pensioner poverty, but neither does the Bill—all
this, of course, in an environment where life expectancy for men and
women continues to increase at an accelerating rate. As my noble friend
Lady Hollis said, we should look at healthy
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000066">The
introduction of a single-tier pension pitched above the
rate—just, in the illustrations—of the guaranteed credit
is therefore an important development. It is built on the foundation of
auto-enrolment which grew out of the Pensions Commission work on which
my noble friend Lady Drake was so influential. It was the report of
this commission which clearly concluded that the then state and private
pensions regime would not deliver adequate incomes in retirement
through changes to the state system alone. Reform to make it simpler to
understand and less means-tested were essential to provide clear
incentives for individuals and employers to build additional private
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000067">In
analysing the reforms necessary to the state system to underpin private
saving, it was clear that abolishing S2P before establishing the
success of auto-enrolment and a national pensions saving scheme would
be risky. Since then, things have moved on. We legislated for
auto-enrolment—my noble friend Lord Hutton was Secretary of
State at the DWP at the time—and for NEST, and the coalition
Government have brought 
<?notus-xml column=181?>them into being. It is still early days, but opt-out
rates look to be below expectations, which is encouraging. While
continuing to acknowledge that the coalition Government have broadly
followed the consensus, we should continue to express concerns about
raising the bar to automatic entry. Every time the Deputy Prime
Minister talks to us about how many people have been taken out of
income tax, he might complete the sentence and say how
many—mostly lower paid women—have been denied auto
enrolment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000068">As
my noble friend Lady Sherlock said in her sparkling opening speech, the
introduction of a single-tier pension deserves our support—our
long-term support. I know that it will be music to the ears of my noble
friend Lady Hollis, who has long campaigned for this approach. Of
course, as proposed, the detail will not be unwelcome news to the
Treasury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000069">We
do not reach the sunny uplands of a simplified single tier overnight.
There are complications along the way and we will seek the assurances
of the Minister in Committee about the communications strategy to be
adopted to explain what is going on. We also need to be assured of the
capacity of HMRC and DWP to build and maintain the necessary systems
which will give effect to all this. Without putting too fine a point on
it, I suggest that the DWP has not covered itself in glory in
managing change in recent times. It is a sobering thought that the
transition to everyone being in receipt of a single- tier pension will
probably extend beyond my lifetime. In the interim, there will be two
systems running side by side. Those retiring before the single tier
could receive the basic state pension, possibly uprated by the triple
lock; S2P, uprated by earnings during accrual and CPI in payment; and
the guaranteed credit, possibly uprated by earnings. On the single
tier, the Bill provides for uprating by at least earnings, although the
impact assessment assumes the triple lock. Protected payments under the
single tier are to be uprated by price inflation. So it is hardly all
simple and
straightforward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000070">There
will also be different access to benefits. Those retiring into the new
system will be denied savings credit but not the guaranteed credit.
They might also be eligible for housing benefit and council tax
support, although the former could be affected by the withdrawal of
savings credit. Those retiring before 6 April 2016 will be able to
access benefits as now. There are complexities here, too, compounded by
how passporting is to work. For some benefits, it is the guaranteed
credit of pension credit which is the passport; for others, it is
either the guaranteed credit or the savings credit. We need more
clarity around all
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000071">Individuals
retiring before 6 April 2013 will be able to defer their state pension
under the current rules, including taking a lump sum. Deferral under
single tier cannot involve a lump sum and will be more actuarially
based and restricted. Qualifying conditions will be different for the
two regimes—we now know that it will be 10 years for single
tier—and both these changes contribute to the savings for the
Treasury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000072">Over
time, those reaching state pension age before single tier will comprise
a smaller proportion of the pensioner population and it is important
that their interests, too, remain protected. Those retiring in the
earlier years of single tier will be better off than under 
<?notus-xml column=182?>the existing system—notionally, that is—although this
reverses for those retiring later. The position of women improves,
particularly because single tier benefits lower paid and part-time
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000073">Transition
is not only about two systems running side by side. Provision is
necessary for those who retire after 6 April 2016 but who have a
contribution record prior to this—hence the need to grapple, as
we doubtless will in Committee, with new concepts of “foundation
amounts”, “protected amounts” and
“rebate-derived amounts”. We should also test the
transitional proposals for derived and inherited
entitlement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000074">Perhaps
a surprising fact to emerge from the various analyses that we have been
sent is the extent to which means-testing will remain within the new
system. While the amounts may have declined, the percentage of
pensioners receiving housing benefit or council tax support in
comparison to what would have happened under existing arrangements
hardly changes. There is a significant fall-off of pension credit
entitlement, but even 5% of those reaching pension age in 2060 will
qualify. Overall, there is a reduction in benefit claimants of just 3%.
Nevertheless, there is an improvement in the number having low marginal
deduction rates, which is important for saving
incentives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000075">In
these circumstances, take-up remains an issue. If the rationale for the
assessed income period—a degree of stability in the incomes and
capital of pensioners—has not proved to be the reality, it could
be difficult to argue for its retention, although I take the point that
my noble friend Lady Hollis has just made. However, we think that the
Government have done the right thing in retaining the current
indefinite awards. Given the still significant scope of benefits within
the system and the fact that take-up of pension credit is not high, the
need for more regular reporting will bring its challenges. What
assurances can the Minister give us about the support proposed for
pensioners having to reconnect with the reporting
system?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000076">We
should be clear that, because of this Bill, the state is going to do
less than is currently planned. Over time, the share of GDP going to
pensions will be smaller than currently predicted. At 2060, it will be
0.6% less—some £30 billion—but assuming the triple
lock for uprating. Should uprating be as provided in the Bill, by
earnings, the reduction is 1.5%. On top of those savings are the
increased national insurance contributions which accrue to the Treasury
from the abolition of contracting out—some £5 billion a
year in the early years. More than 80% of that will be borne by public
sector employers and employees. An additional 1.4% national insurance
contribution is unwelcome news for scheme members at a time when
incomes are being squeezed and household costs are
rising<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T18:40:04"></hs_TimeCode>. Costs
have risen faster than wages in 39 of the 40 months since this

the override given to private sector employers to recoup the loss of
the 3.4% national insurance rebate—I share the concerns of my
noble friend Lord Whitty about that—there is the risk that all
of this will accelerate the decline in defined benefit provision.
Public sector schemes will not be able to recoup the loss in that
fashion. Following on from questions already asked, perhaps the
Minister will say 
<?notus-xml column=183?>something specific about how those costs are to be
met. On the local government schemes, specifically dealt with by my
noble friend, as he said, the LGA estimates employer costs in the
region of £700 million a year. Given the savaging of local
authority budgets by the coalition, how does the Minister think that
those costs can be found? Does he think that the new burdens policy
should apply and that they should be met centrally? What analysis has
been undertaken of the concerns expressed by the LGA that the Bill
could undermine the agreement of the reform of the local government
pension schemes due to be implemented next

Bill is not only about state pension provision. It includes a
raft of other measures, and it should be supported in its attempts to
tackle some long-standing problems in the private pensions industry,
including the prohibition on offering incentives and removal of
short-service refunds. Although the focus on tackling small pension
pots is to be applauded, like others, I regret that the proposed
solution cannot be supported. The technical amendments to
auto-enrolment look supportable, but is it not time to remove some of
the historic constraints on

biggest investment in their life is their pension scheme. The Bill will
be important for the quality of life of the whole nation at the end of
their working life, so it is important that we get it right. We have a

one of the biggest and best changes to state pensions for women
in this country. In my view, the women who will benefit from it do not
want to get those improvements on the back of the women whom the Bill
does not treat fairly in the transitional stage. That is where my real
concerns arise. I hope that we will propose to amend the Bill to deal

is established and generally accepted that women make up by far the
largest number of those on pensions living in poverty. The number is
substantially different; far more women than men are in poverty on

reasonably expect to receive either a married woman’s pension or
a full basic pension, if they were widowed, or would not have had the

Work and Pensions Select Committee in another place. The committee has
asked the Government to conclude a solution by allowing individuals
within 15 years of state pension age to be allowed to retain that

group of women has been mentioned in this debate several times: those
born between April 1951 and April 1953. Those women feel that they are
being subjected to a double disadvantage. First, their state pension
retirement age will increase. That is an issue that would have faced
any Government. Any Government would have had the unpalatable task of
changing the retirement age; I fully accept that. However, this group

issue has come up several times. Because an element in the Bill deals
with private pensions, I feel able to raise it. That is the issue of
part-time workers. We had a long debate on the previous Pensions Bill
about the fact that although part-time workers who do not earn up to
the national insurance level cannot join a pension scheme, they may
have two jobs which, put together, would take them through that barrier
and they would qualify for a pension. Those in that category are
predominantly women. It is grossly unfair that we are having a major
pensions change in this country which, I think, will put it on the
right path for the future—although I think that we will have to
make further changes later—without dealing with that

Of that 50,000 people, again, 40,000 were women. In a Bill which marks
a substantial and improved change on pensions for women in this
country, there are those anomalies which I believe we should deal with.
It will be our responsibility to try and do that. They are all

something of a sinking heart, that I had forgotten to draw the

Browne of Ladyton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to
follow my noble friend Lady Dean and I learnt a considerable amount
from her contribution to this debate, some of which I shall draw on in
my few remarks. I think most noble Lords will understand that I rise to
the Dispatch Box with the words of my noble friend Lady Donaghy ringing
in my ears, not just because she is sitting behind me but because she
urged us in her opening remarks to approach this subject with a degree
of humility. I do just that, as this is the first time in 16 years in
one part of this building 
<?notus-xml column=186?>or another that I have had the lack of wisdom to
debate pensions, and to do so from the Dispatch Box is a daunting
prospect.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120375000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000094">I
open my remarks by thanking the Minister for his introduction. I
thought that he laid out in a helpful way what this Bill seeks to
achieve and I look forward to hearing him build on that in his response
to the debate and throughout further consideration of the Bill. I have
some experience of engaging with him in debate in your
Lordships’ House and I know that he will do his best to assist
the House to understand and, if necessary, improve this legislation. I
thank him, too, for engaging with Members in all parts of this House in
preparation for this debate and for his promise of further briefings. I
join him in commending the noble Lord, Lord Turner, my noble friend
Lady Drake and Sir John Hills for the work they have done; I add to
that my thanks to my noble friend Lord Hutton and the noble Baroness,
Lady Hollis of Heigham. I was privileged to work with her for a short
time when I was the Minister for Employment in the Department for Work
and Pensions.</hs_para>

deserve some recognition for their contributions to this debate will
excuse me, while I hope to give them some recognition during these
remarks I single out my noble friend Lady Drake. With an economy of
words that was a model, she went through the Bill in a way that
identified almost all the issues that many months of my trying to
understand it had identified, if not understood, and some others that I
had not even thought of. I can appreciate why she was on the commission
led by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, and why she has had such a
significant effect on the direction of travel. I also commend my noble
friend Lady Sherlock, whom I am privileged to serve in this
cobbled-together team for this purpose. She knows how much I admire her
and I thought that she made a sparkling and excellent speech.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Balfe, on an accomplished maiden speech. I have no
doubt that the House will value greatly what appears to have been his
long and varied journey since the age of 16. It took him all the way
from 4 Millbank, which is just across the road, to your
Lordships’ House. He referred to Millbank and the noble
Viscount, Lord Eccles, referred to the Imperial Chemical Industries, or
ICI, in his contribution. Since I am the survivor of a man who was an
employee and then, for a short period, a pensioner of the ICI—my
mother, who was widowed, was a pensioner of it for a significant
period—I recognised the Millbank address as being very
significant to the ICI. Those buildings are still there and
at least the noble Lord, Lord Balfe, is still with us although the ICI
is not. That just occurred to me as a relevant coincidence in the
debate before your Lordships.</hs_para>

raised in the debate, I start with my noble friend Lady
Sherlock’s first question to the Minister, which challenged him
to confirm the level at which the STP—the simple pension which
we are all discussing—will be set. I do that because it seems to
be the essence of our understanding of whether this significant reform
of the pension system will meet the challenges that the Minister and
others have set for it. There seems to be agreement that it needs to be
high enough to provide an adequate 
<?notus-xml column=187?>platform for saving and to reduce means-testing. The problem is that, as
we understand it, these reforms will reduce means-testing only if the
flat rate pension is set above the pension credit level. Indeed, the
Select Committee recommended that there should be some clear blue water
between one and the other and argued further that that principle should
be built into the Bill. None of us will be able to get a handle on
whether this will, over time, consistently meet that condition unless
we have some idea of the rate at which it is to be set.</hs_para>

passing, and with all humility, to the noble Lord, Lord German, that
this is assuredly not a citizen’s pension. A pension that
requires 35 years of national insurance contributions cannot
be described as a citizen’s pension.</hs_para>

encouraged to draw the Minister’s attention to the questions
asked by a number of noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord
McKenzie, about the fact that all the documentation we have before us,
set in the context of the impact assessment, assumes that the
single-tier pension will be uprated by the triple lock. Of course, we
know that the triple lock is in place only until the end of this
Parliament and I am not suggesting that it is reasonable to expect the
Government, or indeed any party aspiring to government, to promise the
triple lock going forward. One does not know what financial
circumstances or degree of growth there will be in the economy in those
times. However, I would argue that if we are to understand fully the
implications of this policy, and whether it meets the tests that we are
all generating for it, we have to have some information against which
we can compare the performance of this policy going forward. It would
be much more helpful if the Minister could provide us with additional
information, other than that which is in the impact assessment and has
that assumption underpinning it. If there were alternative calculations
provided to us that showed the other ways in which could it be uprated,
or not uprated at all, that would give us some sense of whether this
policy is dependent on the triple lock or whether, on its own terms, it
can be sustainable into the future.</hs_para>

of the continued review of pensionable age, which was raised by my
noble friends Lady Turner of Camden, Lady Hollis of Heigham, Lord
Whitty and Lord
Hutton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T18:59:48"></hs_TimeCode> of
Furness. The noble Lord, Lord Balfe, also raised it in his maiden
speech. I make it clear that we on these Benches recognise that, as
life expectancy increases, it is reasonable to consider extending
working lives. However, along with many other Members of your
Lordships’ House, we believe that it is very important to
consider a range of factors. One of those is that there are differences
in healthy life expectancy between different groups and varying
employment opportunities for continued working in later life. A number
of noble Lords made reference to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000101">It is
our argument that the Bill needs to provide greater clarity about that
process. It is also essential that people have sufficient notice of any
changes in state pension age in order to make or revise their plans for
retirement. To meet the first objective, we proposed consistently in
the House of Commons an amendment that would have ensured that the
panel set up to assess 
<?notus-xml column=188?>rises in longevity included representatives from opposition parties and
trade unions. We also have concerns about the methods of periodic
reviews.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120375000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000102">On
the second of these objectives, I point out to the Minister that only

concession—that advice—that they published in their own
document brings into question a five-yearly review and the consequences
of such a review. At this stage I am not seeking to argue beyond the
amendment that we tabled in the Commons, and will probably repeat here
in Committee and perhaps on Report, but it raises a question
about the consistency of the Government’s thinking when that
document, published just last month, can strongly make that point while
the Government expect that the review of pensionable age will be every
five
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T19:02:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13120375000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000103">My
noble friend Lady Hollis of Heigham made reference to part-time
workers—I think she called them people in mini-jobs. As she
identified, there is a group of people, mainly women, who have more
than one part-time job but are below the national earnings limit in
each job, so are not building up the rights to a future
pension. In fact, as she pointed out, recent analysis found that in
2012-13 50,000 people—40,000 women and 10,000 men—had two
jobs with a combined income above the lower earnings limit but were not
accruing qualifying years towards their pensions. My noble friend
argues, I think with some authority, that this is unfair and could
prejudice hard working people who are doing everything possible to
provide for themselves and their families at a time when
full- time jobs are acknowledged to be in short supply.
Characteristically, she has an innovative solution, which, as I
understand it, is essentially that they be treated as self-employed.
That would ensure that all those in work with total earnings above the
lower earnings limit were building up rights to a state pension. I
commend this approach to the Minister, and we will be interested, as I
think other Members of the House will be, in the Government’s
position regarding this. I suggest that the arguments that have been
put forward thus far do not meet the challenge that my noble friend has
set
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T19:04:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000104">My
noble friend and others have concerns about the phasing out of the
assessed income period. She makes the very good point that the phasing
out of this period generates challenges relating to equity release to
pay for care and its impact on pension credit when changes to capital
are taken into account. While I am not arguing that the release of
equity should be dependent on administrative easement that was meant
for other purposes and may not be sustainable in the long term, we on
the Front Bench do not disagree with the phased abolition of an
assessed income period but we wish to use Committee to probe the
evidence base for this change. We know that some elderly people
struggle with correspondence, particularly official communications, 
<?notus-xml column=189?>and we wish to be assured that there is support in place for those who
need it, with the additional burden that these provisions
impose.</hs_para>

number of noble Lords raised issues reflecting the dysfunctionality of
the private pensions market. It is at the heart of this reform that,
from a base of a single-tier pension, people are encouraged to save. As
my honourable friend Greg McClymont has made perfectly clear, this will
work only if they are saving into pension funds in which people have
trust and confidence. At the Bill’s Second Reading in June, Greg
made clear that our focus on the Bill would be on the half of the Bill
that was missing—essentially, the part that would make private
pensions value for money for the saver. The Pensions Minister responded
throughout the deliberations on the Bill in the Commons in a relatively
dismissive way to these suggestions—the Minister smiles; I think
that he recognises some of the phraseology that was used—and
resisted all our amendments throughout Committee, despite the fact that
he recognised consistently that they were relevant to existing serious
problems. Throughout that time, he was able to take advantage of the
alibi that the OFT report had not been concluded. However, as many
noble Lords have said, the OFT reported in a devastating fashion,
confirming all our criticisms of the dysfunctional pensions market and
raising the sword of a market investigation reference, which is still
hanging over the pensions market pending Parliament’s completion
of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T19:07:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000106">In
response to that and the fact that the report expressly, or by
implication, supported every one of our amendments, the Government
performed a U-turn, but only in response to a part of the problem with
charges. The Government have listened to the OFT report on charges and
have done a U-turn, and that is welcome, but perhaps now they should
listen to the other OFT recommendations, which include the areas that
we have tabled amendments on. Indeed, the OFT has gone further than we
did to make our pensions industry value for money for savers. We
encourage the Minister to consider some of these issues in relation to
transparency and governance of the pensions industry, which we will
continue to
urge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T19:08:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000107">In
anticipation of this debate, I wrote myself a set of notes that said,
“No one supports the Government’s line on pot follows
member except possibly the ABI”. That was before I heard the
speech from the noble Lord, Lord Paddick. I think that he was the lone
voice in this debate supporting pot follows member. I say to him, again
with some humility, that the Australian example that he encouraged us
to follow comes from an entirely different environment. In Australia,
as I understand it, there are several hundred pension schemes, whereas
there are over 200,000 pension schemes in this country. This is an
entirely different environment and the Australian analogy does not

am conscious of my time and I shall endeavour not to go through all
this now, saving some of these arguments for Committee. However, I am

Lord Hutton identified. Reading carefully the briefing we all received

noble friend set three tests in her opening speech. However, there is a
series of other tests that the Government have set that we will measure
this Bill and these reforms against, because the Government claim
substantial consistent consequences for them. I think the Minister has
comprehensive notice of them, particularly from the informed
contributions by my honourable friend Greg McClymont, who went over the
detail of this with some care. I think he can expect interesting and
engaged debates in Committee and on Report. I was very struck by the
number of times the Minister used the phrase “very
complicated” or “very complex” when I was speaking
to him earlier and he and his officials were giving me an explanation
of what we can expect in the Bill. He is right about that. I stand
before your Lordships’ House confident that behind me I have a
significant number of Members who are comfortable with that complexity.
One or two of them will be talking to me quite a lot before the later

shall focus first on the transition which many noble Lords rightly
focused on. There are some tough issues around it. People who have
contributed to or been credited into the national insurance system have
expectations, so we cannot switch to the new system overnight. I assure
the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, that this is not a hard, fast
transition. It is pretty difficult to design a transition that strikes
the right balance and takes account of people’s expectations as
far as possible while also ensuring that those who are part of the
transition—in other words, those who will retire over the next
50 years—will see the benefits of the single-tier pension. I
believe this Bill has been successful in this difficult endeavour, and
for that reason I expect it to outlast by a considerable
factor the 10 years predicted by the noble Baroness,
Lady Donaghy.</hs_para>

allows people to see the value of their pre-2016 national insurance
record in one figure, which gives simplicity to the single tier but
also recognises past contributions. It is a smooth transition. For the
vast majority of people reaching state pension age in the years after
single-tier is introduced, their outcomes are similar to what they
would have got under the old system. Nearly three-quarters of those
reaching state pension age in the first five years will see a change in
their state pension of less than £5 a week. Of those who see a
larger change, five times as many gain as lose. Those who see this
boost are likely to be those who have traditionally been badly served
by the state pension system: women, carers and the
self-employed.</hs_para>

modern system based purely on individual entitlement, the
transition provides, for example, for inheritance of additional

There is also transitional protection for those who paid the married

necessary to redesign the state pension within its cost-neutral
envelope, and inevitably this means that while some people
get more than they would have done under the current system had
it continued into the future, some people get
less.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000116">I shall
move on to as many of the specific points as I can—there were a
lot. The noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, said I would delight the 1951 to
1953 generation of women by moving. I think I might delight them a
little bit. Ninety per cent of these women will get more in state
pension and other benefits over their lives by drawing their pension in
the current system at their state pension age than they would if we
gave them a state pension at 65 and single-tier pension. The women in
this cohort will reach state pension age between two and four years
before a man born on the same day, which means that they will get
between £13,000 and £26,000 more state pension than a man
of equivalent age. To correct the point made by the noble Baroness,
Lady Dean, it is not a double whammy. They have not seen their state
pension age rise, except for the equalisation under the 1995 Act. The
only change this group has seen recently is in the triple
lock.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120375000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120375000117">The

things that the single tier does is to clarify savings incentives, so
that people will know what pension to expect from the state and be able
to plan the additional provision that they want. The issue of
passporting was raised by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie. Clearly, passporting will be through the guarantee credit,
not the savings credit, although in practice the numbers are not that
different. On the difference between being on the single tier and being
on a credit, and whether you get various passporting, that is always
the case when you have a system of

substantially by the change in the welfare system when you have
universal credit as a basic bedrock for people. Bereavement benefits
were another way of producing that kind of income in an entirely
different way. We are now targeting this support for the period of
financial need, as we heard that it was required; we did a survey on
that. One therefore needs to separate it from bereavement, and maybe
the right reverend Prelate’s point about what we call it is
relevant there. It is a financial support which is underpinned by the
universal credit but, clearly, we do not offset it against universal
credit which, if it went on for a long time, we would do. By not
offsetting it, we are targeting help at those with the greatest need,
whether they are a widow or parent or not. It is a very progressive
structure in that way. It means that 62% of the very poorest are

Assembly term in 2011, or indicators of wider attitudes towards
institutions, such as the almost 2,300 Catholics who applied to join

Ireland’s people. Without economic success, peace is less well

deeply rooted problems that Northern Ireland faces, so that is
important work. It is very welcome that that group is undertaking it,
first, because the devolved institutions have taken up the challenge of
dealing with these issues—not, as would have happened in the
past, leaving the lead to the Government. It is welcome also because
the Northern Ireland authorities secured to chair the talks someone of
the eminence of Dr Haass, who has earned universal respect
in Northern Ireland for his grasp of the issues and his energetic
dedication to the task. I am aware that some noble Lords in the House
will take a close interest in those issues, and we will have to
consider when we see the report how we can best give opportunity for
those views to be expressed, bearing in mind that the process and the

would argue that the institutions established under the agreements are
beyond improvement, but let us remember that they have given us the
relatively stable politics that no other approach in the
past 40 years has been able to do. There may come a time when
significant change is considered. However, the Government have been
very clear that major changes to the institutions established by the
agreements can go ahead only if they have broad support across the
community in Northern Ireland. It is also essential that any such
change is consistent with the principles 
<?notus-xml column=196?>of power-sharing and inclusivity that are at the
heart of the Belfast agreement. At present it is clear that there is no
consensus around fundamental changes, and the Bill does not seek to
make any. The imperative in Northern Ireland at present is, as I have

strengthening the

therefore readily acknowledge that the Bill does not make radical
changes, but it does make important ones. It is a Bill for more normal
times. It reflects progress in Northern Ireland, making changes which
remove some of the special measures which have been implemented because
of Northern Ireland’s unique situation, and which bring the
system in Northern Ireland closer to Great Britain. However, it also
acknowledges that there are areas where institutions in Northern
Ireland might benefit from further reform. I know that some noble Lords
look forward to a day when there might be scope for more substantial
changes to the institutions. I hope that debates during the passage of
the Bill in this House will give us the opportunity to reflect on these

that it is right to protect the names of those who made donations in
the past. These individuals made donations in the belief that they
would remain confidential, and it would be wrong to change this
retrospectively. I hope we can also agree that future political
donations in Northern Ireland should be published as soon as the

provisions in the Bill take a cautious approach. They set a date after
which permanent anonymity will not be guaranteed, and they give the

moment, we believe the security situation does not justify publication
of donor names, but it is important to ensure we have the flexibility
to move towards the goal of bringing Northern Ireland’s
transparency rules into line with the rest of the UK. If the Bill
proceeds successfully to the statute book, we intend to move as swiftly
as possible thereafter to draft secondary legislation on transparency.
We would, of course, consult on these provisions, but we can confirm
that our intention is that information about donations and loans made
to political parties since 2007 which does not identify the donor would
be made public—for example, the type of donor, its value, the
date on which it was received and whether it was from an Irish
source<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T19:42:04"></hs_TimeCode>. We will

bring about the end of dual mandates between the Northern Ireland

matter of concern. Indeed, the Committee 
<?notus-xml column=197?>on the Preparation for Government, formed prior to
the talks at St Andrews in 2006, debated the issue of dual mandates and
agreed that the practice should be phased out. Even though good
progress towards ending dual mandates has been made since 2010, half of
Northern Ireland MPs were also MLAs following the Assembly elections in
2011. Of course, some have now given up one seat or the other, but it

Scotland and Wales that a general election would overshadow the

Parliament and Welsh Assembly to avoid their elections coinciding with

that Northern Ireland has too many elected politicians. Long-awaited
reforms of local government structures are addressing that level, but
there is also clearly scope to reduce the size of the Assembly. To
allow the reduction to take place without further primary legislation,
the Bill makes this matter reserved, meaning that the Assembly could

Northern Ireland’s future. In this context, we believe it right
that we make provision that opens the way to devolving functions
relating to the Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland, the
Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the District Electoral
Areas Commissioner. By placing these matters in the reserved category,
the Bill would enable devolution to take place, following a full
consultation, a cross-community vote in the Assembly, and votes in both

an Opposition, we have to state that there is some disappointment
attached to the Bill, not because of what it contains but more to do
with the issues that are not dealt with. The use of the word
“miscellaneous” is unfortunate as it gives the impression
that a number of minor issues are being bundled together and dealt
with. The Bill’s provisions have been discussed within the
Northern Ireland parties and received general but not universal
support. In principle, we support the ending of dual mandates; the
extension of the Assembly’s term—temporarily and then
permanently; giving security of tenure to the Justice Minister and
devolving power on the size of the Assembly. We want to move to full
transparency and accountability in political donations. Clearly, we
will look at the detail of all the proposals in Committee, but by and
large they make sense. However, the Minister will know that the
Assembly and Executive Review Committee at Stormont is looking at the
size of the Assembly, the number of executive departments, designation,
the composition of the Executive, and provision for opposition. These
are difficult and sensitive issues. The principles of power sharing and
inclusivity are fundamental, but there is an acceptance that the system
could be improved and there are demands for more accountability and
more rigorous scrutiny of the
Executive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000008">The
previous Secretary of State last year launched a review of the
operation of the Assembly during a speech in which he criticised the
Assembly and the Executive. Vernon Coaker said at the time that that
criticism was largely unwarranted and unnecessary and suggested that
the Government work in partnership with the Executive and the Assembly
to look at how they and the Northern Ireland Office could work more
effectively, individually and collectively. To be fair to the current
Secretary of State, she has taken an approach 
<?notus-xml column=200?>more in line with that thinking. However, Vernon
Coaker worried that in some respects she has gone too far the other way
and has not engaged with some of the issues. Vernon Coaker also said
that devolution should not mean disengagement. The Bill gives the House
a chance to put its views appropriately and constructively and we hope
that, as the Bill goes through its stages in the House, the Government
will reflect on how they could take that
opportunity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000009">A

through the Bill, we will support the Secretary of State in her
attempts to persuade the Home Secretary to work with the Northern
Ireland Executive to get the legislative consent necessary for the
agency’s remit to extend to Northern Ireland. My noble friend
Lady Smith of Basildon has experience of this issue and I hope that she

needs to be a balance between ensuring that as many people as are

against the kind of electoral fraud that undermines the process. The
history of violence is very difficult and painful to speak about, but
we have had many difficult and painful conversations in Northern
Ireland and made progress, and we need to have a conversation on the
history of violence. Is there nothing we can propose in the Bill that
would help this process and take it forward? The Government say that
there is no consensus on the way forward, and therefore no possibility
of agreement. We fundamentally disagree, as Members of your

with the past—the legacy of the Troubles—is expressly a
responsibility of the Northern Ireland Office. It cannot act alone, of
course, and we have consistently said that we need a comprehensive and

time that Northern Ireland was debated in the other place, Lady Hermon
asked what was meant by that. I repeat today that the Government, in
partnership with the Irish Government, and in full co-operation with
the Assembly, have a duty to lead but not to prescribe. There has to be
consensus all the way. It is very difficult but we must try to create a
vehicle through which these issues can be discussed and resolved. Of
course that will take time, and it will not be easy, but the prize will
be worth it. Victims and survivors are not afraid to talk about the
past; the Governments should not be
either.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000012">Having
said that, the hurt, anger and pain in Northern Ireland which are a
legacy of more than 40 years of the Troubles—40 years of
killing, bombing and other events—cannot be overestimated. We do
not underestimate that legacy but a start has to be made some time, and
we think that could be now. We are a little disappointed that the
Government cannot find  
<?notus-xml column=201?>a way in the Bill to allow the issues of the past to be discussed and
addressed so that consensus may emerge. The legacy of the past has to
be dealt with and the Government must consider the impact that it has

Trimble (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this is a worthy Bill and I
welcome it, but when we go through it in detail I would like us to deal
generally with devolved matters as opposed to excepted and reserved
matters. During the interparty talks that preceded the agreement of
1998, I raised this issue on a number of occasions. We were then using
the devolution provisions in the Government of Ireland Act 1920, with
minor changes, as the basic starting point. However, I
thought—and still think—that some matters which were
devolved in 1920 were no longer suitable for devolution in 1998.
Unfortunately, this was considered to be a side issue, but I do not
think that is any longer the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000014">In those
discussions I gave two examples. The first concerned commercial law. I
am not sure whether it was seriously intended in 1920 that there could
be regional variations in the law concerning commerce, but it is not a
valid idea now. Now, commerce operates within a single EU-wide market,
and there is no scope for any regional variation and no real function
for the Assembly. However, because of its 1920 Act inheritance, the
Assembly must pass legislation identical to that enacted here to give
effect to European directives. To have this matter no longer devolved
would relieve Stormont of drudgery and add to its resources to do
something
useful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000015">The
second example which would relieve the Assembly of even more drudgery
concerns social security, and that is because of the operation of the
principle of parity. That principle flows from the existence of the
unified tax and benefits system, which is at the heart of being part of
the United Kingdom. I do not have to remind folk in Northern Ireland
that that parity was hard won and is of huge importance to poor and
unemployed persons. The Stormont Parliament stuck firmly, step by step,
to UK national welfare policies, whether it liked them or not, and
resisted opportunist suggestions from some within its own ranks to
depart from parity. The Northern Ireland Executive have done that until
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000016">I am not
going to debate the advantage or otherwise of recent changes to social
security because those changes are not relevant. What we are dealing
with here is a matter of principle. I say to those in Belfast who are
seeking regional variation that they have to bear in mind the
consequences that would flow from it. If the door was open to regional
variation, it could be a two-way street, and it could apply to other
things as well. What comes to mind immediately are things such as
public sector pay. Therefore, I suggest to the Northern Ireland
Executive that they should close this Pandora’s box as quickly
as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000017">If
one favours, as I do, a nationally unified tax and benefits system, it
does not make sense for part of that system to be under Westminster and
part to be devolved

the case with regard to Wales and Scotland, where welfare is not
devolved. The anomaly could be tolerated while Stormont adhered to
parity, but now, when Stormont has departed from parity, the matter
should be addressed properly. I am sure that the Government here would
prefer to sort things out quietly, but so far that has not worked and,
as noble Lords will know, a financial penalty has been imposed. That is
scheduled to increase but one cannot be sure that that will be the end
of the
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000018">Westminster

is an instructive example in another part of the Bill, and it was
mentioned by the Minister. After devolution in Wales and Scotland, the
national parties were against dual mandates. Originally there was a
suggestion of legislation, but a voluntary approach has been adopted
and that works after a fashion. However, with regard to Northern
Ireland the voluntary route is being abandoned and this Bill legislates
to put an end to dual mandates. Therefore, that, in a sense, is a
precedent for what I am suggesting in this
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000020">If there
is legislation to transfer welfare, I doubt whether there will be
serious opposition at Stormont. I suspect that Sinn Fein has raised the
issue of these welfare changes because of its embarrassment at the
contrast between its bitterly opposing austerity in Dublin while
appearing to implement it in Belfast. I suspect that privately it would
be relieved if this burden were removed. I am not sure what the
DUP’s position would be, but parity is a unionist
position.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120380000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000021">It
may be objected that this is swimming against the tide when one
considers what Calman has suggested regarding a fresh commission in
Scotland amid talk of devo-plus and devo-max. However, while there have
been suggestions in Scotland that some relatively minor welfare powers
might be devolved in the event of a no vote, there appears to be no
inclination to devolve welfare as a whole, and I would advise caution
on that matter.

Alderdice (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, when the notion of a Northern
Ireland Bill was first discussed a couple of years ago, the Secretary
of State at that time undoubtedly considered that the centrepiece of
the Bill which he hoped to see through would be the devolution of
corporation tax. I suspect that most noble Lords and indeed Members of
the other place will see this as a very modest Bill because of the
failure to be able to include that measure. I perfectly understand the
concerns about the impact that such a proposal might have on Scotland.
However, I think that that is mistaken: the argument for the devolution
of corporation tax in relation to Northern Ireland is wholly different
because of the existence of a land border, and that fundamentally
changes the economic questions and
challenges<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T20:05:10"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, when the Minister says that there are no fundamental changes

measure which I guess was not considered when the Bill was first
thought of a couple of years ago concerned the position of the Justice
Minister. That really emerged only at a later stage. I very much
welcome the regularising of this situation. I know that my former
colleagues in the Alliance Party found themselves having more Ministers
than would be justified by their votes, although not by their
abilities. However, in all fairness, they, like others, would feel that
it is better to regularise this and to give a degree of stability to
the position of the Justice Minister. In the context of Northern
Ireland the Department of Justice is even more important than it is in
any other state, although it is always an important ministry. Indeed,
today, with the results of the Smithwick tribunal being announced, we
recognise and recall that issues of justice and policing have always
been central, difficult and contentious. I pay tribute to my friend and
colleague David Ford, who has, I think, fulfilled this role with
considerable distinction. It is not an easy role but he has worked hard

Lord Eames, in his place and no one needs to tell him about the
difficulties in dealing with that issue. I am exerting myself
considerably in thinking about it. I am not persuaded that lawyers or
legislation will necessarily be the right way to deal with what is
fundamentally a question of difficulties about identity. I hope that we
find a way forward and that Dr Haass and his colleague Meghan
O’Sullivan can assist us in that way, although I am not at all

measures about which I would express a little caution. First, on the
size of the Assembly, I know that in times of austerity the need for
efficiency and care about money is important but there was a reason why
the Assembly was larger than was justified by the number of electors.
It is about dealing with a range of issues from a range of perspectives
and having an Assembly large enough to make it function. For
example, the Welsh Assembly is much smaller but there are
substantial complaints about its size.</hs_para>

the representation size in the Assembly. I could see a temptation on
those parties to reduce the numbers and the numbers in the electoral
areas in such a fashion that those who vote for it might benefit most
from it. One reason why past measures were accepted was that there was
always a danger that those who were in power might use them to their
own advantage, which is the fundamental problem in the Northern Ireland

there is a feeling on this side of the water that, “They are all

the longest period of stable government in a generation, politics is
changing. It is right that the regulation in relation to political
donations should be adjusted to reflect that change. My party, the
Democratic Unionist Party, supports Clauses 1 and 2, which provide for
greater transparency concerning donations made after 1 January with the
important proviso that a final decision will be made only when the
security situation in Northern Ireland allows it. Those who donated to
political parties under the current procedure did so 
<?notus-xml column=205?>with a full expectation to full and perpetual

individuals and businesses are to be commended for stepping forward
during the bad old days of the darkest of times in the history of
Northern Ireland. Despite great personal risk to themselves and their
businesses, these brave persons donated to political parties, standing
up for democracy. As we move forward to a more normalised society and
as we attempt to put our troubled past behind us, it is correct that we
move towards the system of donations employed throughout the rest of

regard to setting a timetable for the removal of anonymity, sole
responsibility for this process lies with the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland. Under the Bill as currently drafted, in assessing the
security risk and potential future risks to commercial companies, the
Secretary of State is obliged to consult only with the Northern Ireland
Electoral Commission. It is certainly right for it to be consulted
regarding the mechanics of changes, but as regards the security
situation, surely the Secretary of State should also consult with those
who have relevant experience and specialised knowledge of the subject.
We also believe that provision should be made for consultation with
political parties as political parties will have to live with the
consequences of reduced funding if the Secretary of State gets the
timing

issue of concern is that the Bill will not close the sizeable loophole
that at present permits political parties based outside the United
Kingdom to be bankrolled by donations made abroad. Unfortunately, the
Government have not so far seen fit to close that particular loophole,
which should not be made available to any political party. Under the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, political
parties registered in Great Britain are permitted to accept donations
only from UK residents and bodies. That is a solid and sound principle.
The same Act extends to parties in Northern Ireland. However, parties
registered in Northern Ireland may accept donations from the Republic
of Ireland. Unfortunately, in this particular instance, an exception
has been made in relation to Northern Ireland. Certain political
parties have raised substantial amounts of money outside the
jurisdiction, and that money is used to influence the political and
electoral process within the United Kingdom. That is wrong and it is an
area that should be looked
at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T20:16:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000037">In
relation to Clause 3, dual mandates served a useful purpose in Northern
Ireland during the period of the Troubles. It was important to have
political leaders present in both the Northern Ireland Assembly and
another place when negotiations and decisions around Northern Ireland's
future were being made. Given that the Troubles as we knew them are now
over, we hope, the constitutional debate has been won 
<?notus-xml column=206?>and we now have the longest and most stable period
of devolved government in a generation, it is clear that dual mandates
are something that have naturally come to an end. My party, the
Democratic Unionist Party, has been actively phasing out dual mandates
for a number of years and by 2015 all our dual mandates will have
ended. This legislation change simply underscores and re-emphasises
what has been happening already on a voluntary

dual mandates do indeed need to be addressed, the anomaly of
non-representation must also be brought to an end. It is time for those
persons from Northern Ireland elected to the other House to make a
decision. If they want their expenses and office costs, they need to
demonstrate that they are doing the work. That means taking their seat.
They are free not to take their seat if they so wish. However, the
situation that exists where people do not take their seat but are
allowed to claim expenses must end. The issue of non-representation
while still claiming expenses is an affront to
democracy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T20:17:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000039">Regarding
Clause 6, there is broad consensus within Northern Ireland that there
should be a considerable reduction in the size of the Assembly. As
Northern Ireland moves towards a more normalised society, this should
be reflected in a more proportionate legislature. As the party that has
most consistently sought to improve Assembly structures, we believe
that it is right and proper that the Government should change the
Northern Ireland Act 1998 to allow determination of the size of the
Assembly to be a reserved matter. That will allow the Assembly to
legislate for themselves following consultation and agreement with the
Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T20:18:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000040">However,
an important point that could arise from the reduction in numbers in
the Assembly is that, as it stands currently, a petition of
concern requires 30 signatures. If the Assembly were to be
reduced to 90 MLAs or fewer, as would be my preference, it would
clearly be right, proper and sensible to reduce the number required to
sign a petition of concern. This debate should take place between the
parties of Northern Ireland at the same time as a discussion on the
reduction of MLAs. Thus, I believe that the Bill should be amended to
make petitions of concern a reserved matter upon which the Assembly may
legislate following
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T20:19:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000041">I
also welcome Clause 7, which will bring Northern Ireland into line with
the rest of the United Kingdom. Holding elections for the Assembly and
the other House on the same day leads only to confusion and does not
allow for the issues pertaining to each body to be properly debated and
considered. This change has been legislated for already in Scotland and
Wales and is welcome for Northern Ireland as well. There is unanimity
of support for the changes proposed in respect of the appointment of
the Justice Minister. Those changes would permit that appointment to
become normalised within the d’Hondt system.</hs_para>

welcomed that elections for the Northern Ireland Assembly have now been
brought into line with those for Scotland and Wales. I welcome the new

<?notus-xml column=209?>afternoon, under a light but wetting rain at the
commemoration of the 36th (Ulster) Division at Helen’s Tower,
mishaps were happily overcome. The first happened when the Minister
from the Ministre des Anciens Combattants, representing the French
Government, having returned to Paris after an excellent local lunch,
was therefore not available to take up the tray of fleur-de-lys, which
were refused in turn by the lady Mayor of Thiepval—population
86—and the British ambassador and were eventually accepted by
me. The second was because of the ambiguity in a sentence in the
service sheet to the effect that a piper, “will play a lament.
Wreaths will be laid”. The latter phrase could have made the
actions either simultaneous or
consecutive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000053">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T20:29:00"></hs_TimeCode>

that the talks had now run their course and should be brought to a
gentle close. It was agreed that the close should be temporary and that
the gentleness should bind everyone not to get into the blame game, so

Shutt of Greetland (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have to follow that
slot. I thank my noble friend Lady Randerson for explaining the Bill to
us. For me, the starting point in considering the Bill is, indeed, the
Belfast agreement of 1998, which was of course endorsed by 69% of those
who voted in that May 1998 referendum. It is perhaps right that we are
considering this 15 years on. We are looking at the revision of two
Acts of Parliament —the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the much
earlier Act, the Northern Ireland Assembly Disqualification Act
1975.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000055">I
support much of the miscellany that is before us in connection with the
transparency of donations and loans to political parties, the ending of
the dual mandate and the new method of appointing a Justice Minister.
But I would like to highlight one or two areas of reservation. I am
concerned about the size of the Assembly. The Bill suggests that this
could change, and we have heard noble Lords speak about reducing the
number of Members in a constituency from six to five.</hs_para>

of the most recent Assembly election. Of course, in looking at results
one is not to know exactly how people would behave if there were only
five elected rather than six. However, after studying that election, it
is my view that the losers would not be the DUP or Sinn Fein but other
Members of the Assembly, and there would be fewer people from minority
causes serving in the Assembly. That would result in a loss of
plurality, which is embedded in the Belfast agreement as to how
Northern Ireland should go forward. Indeed, if we were to reduce the
number from six to four, it would be even worse. If there were to be
reductions under the present system, I would sooner reduce the number
of constituencies from 18 to 12 and stick with the six
Members.</hs_para>

into account the fact that there will be a reduction in the number of
those who serve in local government—it seems that the
legislation is there for 2015. The folks in Northern Ireland would be
well advised to think through what that will mean in terms of the
number of public representatives who are available to serve the people
there. I caution against that and wonder whether that clause ought to
be supported in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000058">The
Northern Ireland Assembly Disqualification Act 1975 has not been
referred to by anyone else but I would like to refer to it. It is
interesting that it sets out those who are disqualified. Of course,
those who are disqualified are justice officers, and there are 17
different sorts of justice officer specified; there are also civil
servants, Armed Forces, police, national criminal intelligence people,
the National Crime Squad, any member of a legislature of any place
outside the Commonwealth, and other offices in Parts 2 and 3 of
Schedule

105 offices listed in Part 2 and 136 in Part 3. For example,
if you happened to be a member of the Football Licensing Authority,
which is in Part 2, you are not able to stand for the
Northern Ireland Assembly. If you are chairman of the Plant Varieties
and Seeds Tribunal, you are not able to stand for the Northern Ireland
Assembly. Northern Ireland is quite a small place and if you think of
those who are serving on these 241 bodies, you are reducing the gene
pool from which candidates can come. I think that needs looking

issue is not looked at in itself, it can be looked at in another way.
The Minister will be aware that there was a little local difficulty in
Wales a couple of years ago in terms of people standing for the Welsh
Assembly and the problems that were caused. There could well be a
situation where on nomination day you could stand down from the office
of profit, and if you are not elected you resume after polling day. Of
course, the specific reason that I am able to speak on this is that the
Civil Service Commissioner for Northern Ireland is to be so listed, so
there are 242 rather than 241 appointments that exclude people from
standing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0002.htm#13120380000061">As I

is true that Northern Ireland has progressed in the years since the
Belfast agreement was ratified. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Shutt,
that the percentage in the referendum was 71.2%, if I recall correctly.
As has already been referred to, the visit of the President Obama and
other world leaders ahead of the very successful G8 summit held in
County Fermanagh in June signified just how far the Northern Ireland
political process has come after many false starts. The noble Lord,
Lord McAvoy, indicated his antecedence from that district—it is
as well that that information was not freely available when the Prime
Minister took his decision to go to County Fermanagh—and I join
him in saying to the Prime Minister that he took a very brave decision

seemingly unconquerable issues of “the past”. Attempts
are being made as we speak by Ambassador Haass to do this, but it would
be a brave Member who predicted a totally successful outcome to these
deliberations before Christmas. The past, flags and parades are among
the most difficult problems that we face. If Dr Haass does not succeed

until last year, there were no flag protests and demonstrations, not
even from those who would have preferred no flags to fly—indeed,
many citizens did not even realise that a flag was there at all. But
Sinn Fein did, and it has waged a campaign for more than 30 years to
get it removed. Even the public consultation held on the proposal to
pull the flag down indicated that very few people in Belfast were
seriously worried or offended by its presence, but, like so much

both difficult and

However, I make two points. The idea that that guarantees in perpetuity
that future Assembly elections will not coincide with Westminster
elections is false. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act does not guarantee
in statute five-yearly elections to Westminster. That could change
because of circumstances, which we debated here at enormous length. If

anxiety about that issue is that, in the other place, the Minister, and
the Member for South Leicestershire, said that there was
“general consensus” that the Assembly term should be
extended from four to five years. That is not so. There is a majority
for it, but it is not a general consensus. We take the view that all
the people in Scotland and Wales knew in 2011 that they were voting for
a five-year assembly. The people of Northern Ireland believed that they
were voting for a four-year Assembly. The information was there, 
<?notus-xml column=213?>because the Government contacted all Administrations at the same time,
but it did not filter out. When the Government came forward with their
initial Explanatory Notes, they indicated that they were not proposing
to effect the five-year change because there was not consensus on it,
but, all of a sudden, consensus materialises. It is not a huge issue
but I am making the point that when people went to the polls in Belfast
and Northern Ireland, they did not know that they were voting for a
five-year term. There has been little or no debate about whether there
should be a permanent five-year or four-year term, just as we had
people on all sides of this House with different views on that sort of
measure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0003.htm#13120380000074">On

comments of the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Belmont, when he referred to
the ongoing funding of political parties in Northern Ireland from
outside the jurisdiction, which I believe would not be tolerated
anywhere else. It is entirely wrong that people from any part of the
world can put money into a party in the Republic and that that party
can transfer money to fight elections in Northern Ireland. It
is entirely unjustified and unreasonable but it is all part of a policy

the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, in his comments about some of the more
minor provisions, which appear to be fairly innocuous with regard to
appointing certain key individuals, whether that is in terms of human
rights or district electoral areas. I say that because we have just had
what is probably the longest local government reform process in the
democratic world. It has taken 14 years from inception to finality to
carry out a minor reform of local government, because the number of
powers being transferred has gradually been eroded over the years until
it is effectively a matter of a general competence and power over
planning. That has taken 14 years but it is not my main
concern.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120380000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0003.htm#13120380000077">My

estates around the city are being brought into Belfast, which is
perfectly natural because that is how cities have evolved. However,
there are two glaring exceptions. In the north of the city, the
Rathcoole area is not being included, yet it is part of the North
Belfast parliamentary constituency. In the east of the city, the
Dundonald and Ballybeen areas are not being included but are part of
the East Belfast parliamentary constituency. When you get past
Stormont, the third entrance into Stormont off the Upper Newtownards
Road is now going to be in the city of Lisburn; anybody with any
knowledge of the area knows that that is absolute nonsense. It has been
done for political purposes and it is entirely wrong, so any thought
that some of these matters can be handed back willy-nilly to Stormont

that I want to make. We will deal with the NCA, the definition of
victims and other matters at later stages, but there is a point about
devolution in the United Kingdom in general that I hope the Government,

concerns the Sewel convention. We are getting ourselves into a position
of saying that once you hand over a power, forget about
it—devolution can just deal with it, and Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland can go about their own business. Consequently,
Parliament is becoming progressively more London-centric, and that is a
mistake. It is nice for Whitehall to get these regional problems off
the table and out of the way, but then you wake up to a headline, as
some Members may recall we once did, such as the famous <I>Sunday
Times</I> one, “John Bull’s Political Slum”. If
noble Lords do not remember it, they may have read about it. Although I
did not agree with the article, it was making the point that something
was happening in Northern Ireland way back in the 1960s that people
here did not know anything about because they were not focused on it.
Northern Ireland was dealt with by someone at a desk at the Home

from being a cash machine, what else is Parliament for? What other role
does it have?”. There is a wider issue that we as a Parliament
have to address about how we treat devolution. In the aftermath of

Lexden (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow
the noble Lord, Lord Empey, with whom I agree about nearly everything,
in the closing stages of this debate on a Bill that has a limited but
nevertheless most beneficial purpose: to help further the arrangements
under which the Province is currently governed and its electoral system
administered. As a Conservative and unionist with a long-standing
interest in Northern Ireland, I welcome it.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=215?><hs_para UID="13120380000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0003.htm#13120380000081">The Bill has been the
subject of extensive consultation within Northern Ireland. It has
undergone detailed pre-legislative scrutiny at the hands of the
Northern Ireland Select Committee in the other place, and has been
usefully improved as a result. Such careful preparation is not a
feature of all the legislation that comes before this House. As a
Member of your Lordships’ Select Committee on the Constitution,
I have from time to time put my name to reports expressing regret that
measures have been brought forward without having been given the full
and detailed preliminary consideration that they needed. This Bill
warrants no such comment, and the Northern Ireland Office is to be
congratulated on its thoroughness. The manner in which it has been
developed accords fully with the best practice recommended by your
Lordships’ Constitution
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0003.htm#13120380000082">From
my own staunch unionist standpoint, the Bill has much to commend it.
Northern Ireland ought, as far as possible, to be treated in the same
way as other parts of our country on issues that affect them all
equally. The funding of politics is one such subject. The Bill deserves
full support for setting an early date—1 January 2014, less than
a month away—after which information about new political
donations can be made available without restriction by the Electoral
Commission. At the same time, common prudence indicates that the
precise moment at which the new power can be used must be determined in
the light of security considerations. The Bill rightly leaves the
Secretary of State, who I am sure will engage in widespread
consultation, to judge when the change can safely be made, and so bring
Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the country, in conformity
with unionist principles and the wishes of the people in the Province.
In a survey carried out by the Electoral Commission at the end of last
year, fewer than one in 10 favoured the retention of
confidentiality.</hs_para>

also<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T20:53:52"></hs_TimeCode> brings
Northern Ireland into line with practice elsewhere in another important
respect, by extending the term of the current Assembly from four years
to five, and by providing for five-year terms in future. There is
nothing inherently superior about five-year intervals between
elections; indeed, a powerful case can be made for elections every
four. However, the next elections in Scotland and Wales will take place
at the end of five years, and Northern Ireland stands to gain no
obvious practical benefit from having a shorter electoral cycle. The
Bill brings a welcome consistency to this aspect of the United
Kingdom’s devolved institutions. All of them will now be
re-elected in 2016. Having been brought into a common mould, they
should retain it. Elections every five years are to become the rule in
Wales as well as in Northern Ireland. It is a rule that Scotland should
adopt
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0003.htm#13120380000084">Much
reference has been made in this debate to one particularly glaring
disparity that currently exists between the Northern Ireland Assembly
and devolved bodies elsewhere. The Stormont Assembly, with a smaller
electorate than its counterparts, has a much higher ratio of elected
representatives. Electors in Northern Ireland are therefore seriously
overrepresented in comparison with their fellow countrymen in Scotland
and Wales. The carefully defined power which this Bill 
<?notus-xml column=216?>gives to the Assembly to reduce its own size provides a most welcome
means of tackling the problem. The Assembly should use it to serve both
the interests of Northern Ireland, where every opportunity to cut its
high levels of public spending should be seized, and those of the
country as a whole. Greater uniformity between the various devolved
institutions strengthens the unity of the kingdom. At the same time,
the important points made by my noble friends Lord Alderdice and Lord
Shutt need to be noted most seriously.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120380000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0003.htm#13120380000085">The Bill has been given
wide support, and rightly so, because it bans elected representatives
sitting in the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly
simultaneously. There is nothing new about the existing practice. The
first Speaker of the Northern Ireland Parliament in 1921 was also a
Member of the House of Commons, and later went on to become Father of
it; no one turned a hair. Over the years, his example was followed by a
not inconsiderable number of Northern Ireland politicians. Today, in
the face of much public criticism, the practice has declined sharply:
only three Northern Ireland politicians currently hold dual mandates.
However, the practice should cease for one simple and straightforward
reason above all: the volume of work that elected representatives have
to undertake today makes it impossible for them to discharge their
duties adequately in two legislatures simultaneously. The era of
part-time politics for constituency representatives that existed until
after the Second World War has, for good or ill, gone for ever. The
Government should, of course, go further—although this Bill is
not the vehicle—and apply the principle of “one
representative, one legislature” in all parts of the country, as
the Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee recommended in
its report on the draft Bill. Action is to be taken in Wales, but
should not end there: Scotland, too, should be brought into line.
Certain fundamental principles should apply throughout all devolved
institutions, and that is one of
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0003.htm#13120380000086">Should
those elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly continue to be eligible
to sit in this House? The Government have not so far accepted the
arguments in favour of change. Again, there is nothing new about
existing practice. Membership of this House and of the Stormont
Parliament were combined by the first Lord Brookeborough and by the
first and second Lord Glentoran. Today, the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, is
a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Effective membership of this
House may not require the commitment of as much time as the Commons
demands, but even so the practical possibilities of working in this
House and in the Northern Ireland Assembly simultaneously are severely
limited, not least because the hours of business in both places tend to
overlap. I suggest that it will be difficult to secure acceptance in
the country at large for the proposition that the two Houses should be
treated differently in this respect. The Commons Northern Ireland
Affairs Committee recommended that,</hs_para>

much discussed question of moving towards the creation of a formal

given the growing evidence of increasing support for this move within
Northern Ireland, it is surely incumbent on us to ensure that a
transition can occur without difficulty in future. Perhaps the most
effective way of doing that would be to add to this Bill a clause

when agreement has been
reached.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13120380000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0003.htm#13120380000087">Committee
may also be an appropriate stage at which to consider action by the
current Executive that is contrary to the best interests both of the
Province itself and the country as a whole. One example is the severe
limitations that have been imposed on the new National Crime Agency,
highlighted by my friend the noble Lord, Lord Empey, on several
occasions and by the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Basildon, who knows
Northern Ireland well. The noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, of Fermanagh
descent, also made a reference to it earlier in the debate. Another
well known example is the Executive’s rejection so far of the
new Defamation Act, which was the subject of a debate in Grand
Committee in June. These issues raise fundamental constitutional
questions that relate to the future government of the United Kingdom,
as highlighted and expanded upon by my friend, the noble Lord, Lord
Empey. They are of immense importance.</hs_para>

accept the point of the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Belmont, that the
culture in the political parties of Northern Ireland is changing, and
that double-jobbing is gradually curing itself and moving out of the
system. I still welcome the provisions in the Bill to give a certain
finality to that. It is worth recalling that there was a substantial
struggle on this point. As the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, said, the
Committee on Standards in Public Life and its previous chairman, Sir
Christopher Kelly, played a major role, as the Library’s
briefing note makes clear, in entrenching judgments and moving opinion
towards the conclusion which we now have in the Bill. I pay tribute to
that work this evening; we should not forget it. The Committee on
Standards in Public Life—I declare an interest in that I am its
newly appointed chairman—also pushed very strongly on another
key element in the Bill, which is greater transparency in the area of
political

we have been absorbing some difficult news from the OECD today, it
might be worth while drawing attention to the fact that in mid-November
the OECD held a conference in Paris under the heading of
“Restoring Trust in Government”. One of the features of
that conference was an acknowledgement that the United Kingdom had a
good record in the matter of transparency as regards political
donations. One blot on the United Kingdom’s record is the
problem with respect to Northern Ireland that has already been alluded
to by the noble Lords, Lord Empey and Lord Browne. However, the United
Kingdom generally has a good record of transparency, and there is no
question but that the Bill, in some of its provisions, reduces some of
the criticisms that can be made as regards part of the Northern Irish

the less, it is a fundamental fact that a key principle of our law in
the United Kingdom is the notion that it is inappropriate to have
foreign donations working in our domestic politics. That is
increasingly widely accepted and is a key principle of our law. The
difficulty, which has been the case for some years and remains so under
the Bill, is the continuation of the arrangements that allow Irish
citizens to contribute to Northern Irish political parties. I fully
accept that 
<?notus-xml column=219?>there is a special relationship between Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and that the need to make
provisions for Irish citizens who live on the island of Ireland to play
that role is implicit in the Belfast agreement itself. That agreement
conferred new rights on those who consider themselves British, those
who consider themselves Irish and those who consider themselves both;
it did not confer new rights on those who consider themselves Irish or
American or both. However, we are effectively doing that by continuing

of the things that slightly surprise me is that, after all, in recent
times we have heard a great deal about the very good relationship
between the two Governments and how it has never been better.
We—or those who pay attention to Dublin politics—also
hear an unease about the money that arrives in Dublin politics; I am
talking now purely about politics between the Irish Republic and
America. There is growing unease on those points. One of the questions
that I want to ask the Government is: are serious discussions going on
about the implications of those matters? Is there a sense that both
Governments have an interest in at least looking more closely at
current arrangements? There are some very striking recent newspaper
reports about fundraising developments in the United States and very
striking unease in the Dublin newspapers about it. As I say, we are
stuck with the capacious definition of Irish citizenship currently
available in the Irish constitution. Finally, in the same context,
perhaps I may ask the noble Baroness if she can explain whether the new

Mandeville, said, it is the first Northern Ireland Bill to benefit from
prelegislative scrutiny. I certainly agree with his comments about the
value of such scrutiny. I very much enjoyed his speech, particularly
his references to the Somme. I recommend to him a play that I
saw in the Lyric Theatre in Belfast some time ago, called “Sons
of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme”, which he may know of
already. It says a lot about Northern Ireland
history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T21:11:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120380000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-0003.htm#13120380000100">Everyone
in your Lordships’ House tonight knows that progress is hard
won. Northern Ireland has got as far as it has today only because those
in positions of responsibility have been prepared to get together to
talk and have not been frightened to disagree before finding grounds on
which to agree. The provisions in the Bill on greater transparency for
political donations, electoral registration and administration have
been agreed by political parties and largely welcomed here tonight, as
well as being welcomed by the Electoral Commission. However, we also
need to recognise and understand why transparency is not yet the same
as in the rest of the

Northern Ireland Home Affairs Committee in the other place heard
conflicting views on this issue. This Bill seeks to find a way forward
while holding the door open for further reform in future. There has to
be recognition that, even when agreement can be found in principle, it
is a harder task to work out and then agree on the detail. We found
that with issues that are not in the Bill—with the number of
MLAs, for example. I found the comments from the Liberal
Democrat/Alliance Benches quite interesting—about not having a
smaller Parliament or reducing the number of MLAs—because those
were the exact proposals from the party opposite regarding the House of
Commons. There seem to be two different views from the Liberal
Democrats on that, but we should perhaps let that

only ones concerned about these issues. The noble Lord, Lord Lexden,
referred to one of them, as the noble Lord, Lord Empey, has done

understand the criticism of those political parties that did not
support the relevant legislative consent Motion, although I do not
think that blame is necessarily helpful in this case. I was the shadow
Minister at the Home Office at the time and I think it would have been
very productive if the Government had engaged with all the political
parties at a very early stage. I spoke to Ministers very early on in
the process about the obvious issues that would arise with policing
being devolved and the creation of the National Crime Agency, but I
never received any indication from the Government at all of any proper
political engagement with the Northern Ireland political parties on the
part of the Home Office or the Northern Ireland Office. Ministers in
both departments told me that the other department was dealing with it.
Where do you go from there? No one seemed to take responsibility.
Whoever we may think is at fault, the Government should have worked
harder and engaged more fully with the relevant people to try to
prevent this problem occurring. I would have liked to see something in
the Bill that gave confidence that the Government now better understand
those difficulties and want to find a way to engage properly in order
to move forward. It is so disappointing to see no such provision. I

think we all expected to see some movement. The substantial and very
impressive report and proposals in 2009 from the Consultative Group on
the Past, jointly led by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Eames,

drew. However, Shaun Woodward, as the former Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland, undertook a consultation to see where there was
consensus. It is shocking that in 2011, Owen Paterson, the then
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, refused to convene a meeting
asked for by the Assembly, saying that there had to be consensus before

Lady Smith, that possibly our definitions of “consensus”

to Northern Ireland when the Northern Ireland Assembly gives its
consent. Unfortunately, as a result of not securing consent, the
activities of the NCA in Northern Ireland are restricted and the level
of support that the NCA can provide to the PSNI in the fight against
serious and organised crime is reduced. However, I emphasise in

Randerson:</Member></B> It is important to remember that justice is now
a devolved issue. Although the Secretary of State and indeed the Home
Secretary take a very proactive approach in liaising with the Justice
Minister, the decision has to lie with the Northern Ireland Executive.
I understand the sense of frustration felt by many noble Lords when we
often talk here about issues that are devolved, but the whole stream of
thought behind the Bill is to enable the devolved Assembly in Northern
Ireland to operate more as the other devolved bodies do, so that
Northern Ireland becomes less of a special case. In this particular
case, the Government are very concerned that there should be a
solution, and they are actively working towards obtaining that solution
in a way that is acceptable across the parties in Northern
Ireland.</hs_para>

Northern Ireland Assembly did not agree to this because I felt that it
had no intention of agreeing to it. I asked what would happen if there

breadth of opinion or enable minority parties to be elected. The

<?notus-xml column=226?>I add my own endorsement. David Ford has tackled a heavy workload of

particularly the issue of donations from Ireland and Irish citizens
living abroad. The Secretary of State already has the power to deal
with that, should she wish to do so; but because some parties are
established on both sides of the border, it can be very difficult to
deal with that issue. However, I say to noble Lords who are concerned
about this that the Bill makes the first steps to greater transparency.
We do not yet know how much of a problem this is; the noble Lord, Lord
Bew, speculated about it. We will know in the future, when the
Electoral Commission is in a position to tell us the type of donation
and where it came from. We will have those categories in the immediate
future, even if we do not have the names of the donors. It is important
that we welcome the Bill from that

specified in the Good Friday agreement, so we would be open to changing
that only if there was broad cross-community agreement. However, I

d’Hondt, even if they cannot actually do the intensely complex

certainly provoked some very serious thought here today. The Government
are focused on the priorities of rebalancing the Northern Ireland
economy and creating a shared society. We do not view legislation as
the answer to Northern Ireland’s

the dual role of the IGC, as representative of the British and French
Governments and independent regulator under EU law. Chris is appointed
by me but, under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Office of
Rail Regulation (ORR), the independent regulator, I
must consult the ORR first. The Head of the UK delegation can
be dismissed by me, but the MoU restricts my ability to do
so to a limited number of cases where he would clearly not be fit to
act. Under the MoU, the Head  of Delegation is remunerated by
the ORR, but his remuneration comes from the money that the
Concessionaires of the Tunnel (Eurotunnel) are required, under the
Concession, to pay towards the IGC’s expenses. Chris’s
contract is with the ORR—his letter and terms of appointment
characterise him not as an employee but as an individual providing
services to ORR. He is remunerated on a fees for service
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120362000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131203-wms0001.htm#13120362000007">I

the ORR “hosts” him.</hs_para>
