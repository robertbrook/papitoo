what it would be like if the Cabinet had Christmas dinner together.
First of all, everyone would be late because they had spent their
journey arguing about the route and U-turning so often that they were
driving round in circles. The turkey would be half-cooked, like their
policies, and the Leader of the House would have to call for a pause
halfway through the meal. The Prime Minister’s lapdog, the
Deputy Prime Minister, would be encouraged to learn that election
promises are for life, not just for Christmas. Perhaps the joke in the

only if the Lords were not to pass it, and my hope is that their

House. From memory, I think that there was a majority of some 200 in
favour of Third Reading in the House of Commons. I think that that
should serve as an indication to the House of Lords of the positive
sentiment that was attached to the proposal for an EU referendum when
it left this

on board how often the House of Lords considers legislation. Their

pressed those amendments to a vote, because they wanted to discuss some
issues on Report in the context of Government amendments. My right hon.

of Lords that a wide-ranging consultation had indeed taken place, and
emphasised the benefit that will, I know, be apparent when the Lords

hon. Lady also asked about the Water Bill, which, as she said, we will
debate when we return in the new year. I look forward to that debate,
because I think it will show that we can increase benefits to consumers
in two main ways: by giving them access to more competition in the
water industry, and by giving those who are at risk of flooding access
to a continuing and secure scheme for the delivery of flood insurance.
As for the question of tariffs, the hon. Lady should bear in mind the
work that the regulator is doing with the water companies to try to
ensure that, in the next period of regulation, they deliver the best
possible benefits and value for money to consumers. I know that my

this season of good will, I think that I should conclude with good
news. Growth in the economy is 1.5% higher than it was a year ago, and
retail sales are up. We are net exporters of cars, and the automotive
industry produced more cars in the first 11 months of this year than it
did in the previous 12. Manufacturing and services are up. Moreover,
2.7 million people have been taken out of income tax altogether, and
every basic rate taxpayer can look forward to a benefit of at least
£700 after next April. Fuel duty has been frozen, unemployment
is down, and employment in the private sector is up by more than 1.6
million. There are fewer workless households than at any time since
records began. That, I think, is a source of good cheer for Christmas
present and hope for Christmas future—and I am afraid that, for

We have already had a question about broadband, but I wonder whether I

last week about broadband throughout the UK and the extra money that is
being made available. This issue affects every constituency, throughout
the UK. Because we still have anomalies in cities, towns and rural

Madeleine Moon</B> (Bridgend) (Lab):</Member> One group of people who
will not be having a restful Christmas are carers. The Leader of the
House has given a list of ways in which life is improving under this
Government, but life for carers has not improved. Their income limit
has not increased and one of the carers in my constituency, Mrs James,
has her income assessed on a weekly basis, because she works on a
zero-hours contract. If, in one week out of four, she earns £1
over the £100 allowance, she loses her carer’s allowance
for the entire month, even though her income for the rest of the month
might be £25 one week and £35 the next. Instead of paying
lip  
<?notus-xml column=906?>service to carers, could we have a genuine debate on how we can provide
proper support and income for them so that they can feel valued by this

Work and Pensions to respond to the hon. Lady on the circumstances she
describes with regard to the carer’s allowance. On the more
general issue, carers should understand that individual Members, the
House and the Government support them. I think that is evident from our
allocation of some £400 million to ensure that carers have
access to more respite breaks; from the Children and Families Bill,
which delivers additional support to children who are carers; from our
commitment to deliver health checks and support to carers; and from all
the additional carer rights in the Care Bill—the hon. Lady will
no doubt take part in the debate on that—which sets out for the

in general can take heart from the way in which the Government have
ensured that additional costs are not loaded on to them. Had the
previous Government still been in office, fuel duty would have been an
extra 20p per litre by the end of this Parliament as a consequence of
their fuel escalator, which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has
taken away. I also think that the work of the Office of Fair Trading on
motor insurance claims offers the prospect of relief to motorists in

who were treating detainees in ways they should not have done. The
Prime Minister made clear that it has never been suggested that United

the mistreatment of detainees. Nevertheless, the allegations of
involvement had done harm to our reputation as a country which believes

Prime Minister then set out his determination and the determination of
the whole coalition Government to get to grips with these allegations
so that the security services could get on and do their vital job of
keeping us safe. First, he announced that we would seek to settle the
civil compensation cases brought against the Government by the former
Guantanamo detainees. In due course, a significant settlement was
agreed with them in November of that year. Secondly, he introduced
vital reforms to improve the operational, parliamentary and judicial
regulation of the
agencies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T11:45:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
Thirdly, he invited Sir Peter Gibson to hold an inquiry that would deal
properly with the historical allegations. Sir Peter was asked to begin
immediately with his preparatory work, and his inquiry was due to start
formally when the police investigations into these matters had
concluded. The Prime Minister made it clear that he expected the
inquiry to take no longer than a

Peter and his panel and the Government have been frustrated in their
hopes of progress by how long the police investigations have taken. It
was not until January 2012 that the Crown Prosecution Service and the
Metropolitan police issued a joint statement announcing that there was
insufficient evidence to bring prosecutions in the two criminal
investigations that had been preventing the start of the
inquiry’s public work, but at the same time they also announced
that new investigations would begin into alleged renditions to Libya in
2004. Of course, it is important that these matters be
investigated  
<?notus-xml column=914?>properly by the police, but it raised the prospect of a still further

the panel’s agreement, therefore, I announced in a statement to
the House that the detainee inquiry would produce its report based
solely on its preparatory analysis. This report was to highlight any
particular themes or issues that should be the subject of further

the Prime Minister, and an open version was to be made public.
Nevertheless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T11:48:24"></hs_TimeCode>,
the report is a substantial piece of work and the product of extensive
independent analysis of some 20,000 written documents, some of which
have not been examined by any previous review. It finds no evidence in
the documents to support any allegation that UK intelligence officers
were directly responsible for the mistreatment of detainees held by
other countries overseas, and no material has been referred to the
police for further
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T11:47:58"></hs_TimeCode>,

period concerned was one in which we and our international partners
were suddenly adapting to a completely new scale and type of threat
from fundamentalist religious extremists, and many UK intelligence
officers had to operate in extraordinarily challenging environments,
subject to real personal danger. Everyone in the Government and the
agencies accepts, however, that this bravery has to be combined with
clear rules of proportionality and accountability to ensure that we
uphold the values we are working hard to defend. So, while we accept
that intelligence operations must be conducted in the strictest
secrecy, we also expect there to be strict oversight of those
operations to ensure that at all times they respect the human rights
that are a cornerstone of this country’s
values.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121959000374" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121959000374">The
questions raised by Sir Peter’s report, combined with the other
reviews that have been conducted into the period, paint a picture of
Government and agencies struggling to come to terms with the new level
of threat faced by this country. It is now clear that our agencies and
their staff were, in some respects, not prepared for the extreme
demands suddenly placed on them. The guidance regulating how
intelligence officers should act was inadequate. The practices of some
of our international partners should have been understood much sooner.
Oversight was not robust enough, and there was no mechanism in the
civil courts for allegations against the security and intelligence
services to be examined properly. Most of those problems related to a
relatively short period of time in the early 2000s, but they risked
some damage to our reputation as a nation that prides itself on being a
beacon of justice, human rights and the rule of law. I believe I speak
for the whole House when I say that if failures and mistakes were made
in that period, it is a matter of sincere
regret<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T11:50:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121959000375" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121959000375">From
its very first days in office, this Government have been determined to
enact reforms that ensure that the problems of the past cannot be
repeated. Those reforms, and changes made under the previous
Government, mean that the framework within which our agencies now
operate is very different from that during the period which Sir
Peter’s report describes. We have finalised and published
consolidated guidance, setting out very 
<?notus-xml column=915?>clearly how intelligence that could lead to a detention should be
handled, and how detainee interviews overseas should be conducted.
Compliance with this guidance is monitored by the independent
Intelligence Services Commissioner who reports annually to the Prime
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T11:51:30"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have made it clear that Ministers must be consulted whenever an
intelligence officer involved in a planned operation believes a
detainee is at serious risk of mistreatment by a foreign state, even if
that raises the risk of a terrorist action going ahead.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T11:51:51"></hs_TimeCode>We have
dramatically improved Parliament’s ability to oversee the
actions of the agencies—we did that through the Justice and
Security Bill, which I took through the House on behalf of the
Government last year. The Intelligence and Security Committee is now a
Committee of Parliament, fully independent of Government, and the Prime
Minister can no longer appoint its Chairman. It can require information
of the intelligence agencies, not just request it. It has a new
statutory right to review past intelligence operations and, for the
first time, the Committee and its staff will have direct access to
agency
papers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T11:52:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121959000376" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121959000376">Finally,
the Justice and Security Bill, which is now an Act of Parliament,
introduced new court procedures to ensure that if allegations are made
that things have gone wrong, even the most secret intelligence
activities can be examined by an independent judge in a civil court of
law. The combination of these reforms means that a line has begun to be
drawn under a difficult period of the past. Despite that, it remains
important that we deal properly with the 27 issues that Sir
Peter’s report raises. It would be wrong to leave those issues,
many of which relate to matters of policy, unexamined for the unknown
amount of time it will take for the police to complete their related
investigations. Equally, it would be wrong to ask a judge to examine
material which in any way could compromise a live criminal
investigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T11:53:41"></hs_TimeCode>.
It is the combination of those police investigations and the fact that
they thwart a judge’s inquiry that have led to the frustrating
delay in this case, which is felt by everyone
involved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121959000377" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121959000377">Therefore,
the Prime Minister has discussed and agreed with the Intelligence and
Security Committee of Parliament that it will inquire into the themes

to the Government and to Parliament on the outcome of its inquiry.
Additional resources will be provided to the Committee to undertake
that work, so that it does not affect the work it is currently doing on
the killing of drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich earlier this year, and its

this matter, learn lessons and ensure that the House can be totally
confident that there would be no similar problems in future. The delay
has been caused by the length of time taken for the police to
investigate these matters. No politician has control over the police
and it is right for them to inquire into issues where they believe it
is justifiable to do so, but the result has been a timeless delay.

judge-led inquiry normally involves the publication of evidence as the
inquiry proceeds, although in cases such as this the evidence is
sometimes redacted. The whole process of a judicial inquiry could
conceivably compromise a criminal investigation. It is true that some
recent inquiries, such as that conducted by Lord Justice Leveson into a
totally different matter, proceeded although criminal investigations
were taking place, but Lord Justice Leveson avoided, very scrupulously,
any areas that might compromise the criminal investigation.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T12:05:21"></hs_TimeCode>The trouble with
Sir Peter Gibson’s scope is that the only matters that he is

Members in all parts of the House agreed that we should make the ISC
independent, more powerful, and capable of calling for, rather than
merely requesting, the information that it wanted. I think that we now

non-governmental organisations and perfectly reasonable lobbies had

disappointed me at the time. The

country’s enemies. No country in the world would sensibly deal

Members will know, in 2005 and 2007 the Committee published reports on
the treatment of detainees and on rendition. Those reports turned out
to be unsatisfactory and incomplete, because the intelligence agencies
had not provided the Committee with all the relevant information,
which, at the time, they were under no statutory obligation to do. As
the Minister has said, that has now changed: the agencies are required
to provide all the information, and the Committee’s own staff
can go directly to them and inspect their files. It is on that basis,
and on the basis of the extra resources that we will be given to
prevent our other work from being interfered with or delayed, that the

Britain’s involvement, as only that way can we restore trust?
The Minister has said that the ISC will complete this work, but what
confidence can the public have in its conclusions when that same body
wrongly concluded that Britain was not involved in 2007, only to be
flatly contradicted by a High Court ruling the following year? Is it

determination that we get to the truth of these matters and that they
are investigated. Indeed, I share his concern that anybody from the
United Kingdom should be involved in unlawful rendition, and I used to
support his campaigns when we were both in opposition. I disagree with
him about the way we are progressing now. The judge-led inquiry cannot
proceed with taking evidence from people and publishing evidence
alongside continuing police investigations which may or may not lead to
some further criminal proceedings if anyone is eventually prosecuted.
The question is do we, frustratingly, just continue to wait—I
think it is more than three years since the Prime Minister made his
statement—or do we seek to demonstrate that we really have now
got a parliamentary Committee with the powers and authority required to
do the job and report back to this  House and the Prime

powers. He took part in the debates last year. We have considered them
and the Committee has far more powers than it previously had. One of
the things it will be looking at is how, when the previous Committee
investigated treatment of detainees and rendition, it did not appear to
have been supplied with information that was in fact being shared with
others inside the Government and which had been assembled by the
agencies for their own use. I think it is highly unlikely that that
will be repeated and I think the present Committee can be relied upon

which I give the assurance is certainly not me or anybody with my

<?notus-xml column=922?>people are drawing the conclusions that we would anticipate them drawing
if they already happened to be on one side of the argument or another
before we started, and that, I am afraid, will continue. The right hon.
Lady makes an extremely important point, and Sir Peter makes it clear
at least twice in the report he is publishing today that it is quite
wrong, and indeed impossible, to make findings of fact, and certainly
any findings concerning any individuals involved, before he has called
evidence, called them before him if necessary, given them an
opportunity to explain and completed these investigations. That is why
this inquiry identifies issues, which the ISC will now consider and
decide whether and how to pursue. It has not made any findings of fact.
In this country it would be quite wrong to make findings of fact of any
kind, or to draw adverse inferences against anybody, when nobody has
given any evidence, nobody has been challenged, and nobody has been
given a chance to give their own explanation of
events.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_19_PT_1/AF0393F84DA904F0E8F07054376DB9354541A393" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="19 December 2013">Thursday

Clarke:</Member></B> As I said in my statement, the problem with a
judge-led inquiry is that it is normal, having taken evidence from
witnesses, for it to produce evidence as the inquiry goes along. The
ISC can proceed in whatever way it wishes, however, and it is not
likely to do that. So we can start to proceed with the ISC inquiry,
whereas to proceed with a judge-led inquiry could be more difficult and
would certainly give rise to some controversy. I do not think that one
route is necessarily preferable to the other, so long as both are
strong, independent and effective in coming to their conclusions.
Whether we have done enough to strengthen the ISC will no doubt be
easier to decide when it has completed the three important reports that
it is working on. It is now looking into the background agency
information on the murder of Lee Rigby, as well as examining the whole
question of collecting material, surveillance and the balance between
security and privacy. And it is now going to look into the considerable
matters of detention and rendition, although I presume that it will not
undertake all those inquiries contemporaneously. We wish the members of
the ISC well in their labours; they have taken on a considerable amount
of responsibility. If, at the end, we decide that the Committee needs
to be strengthened further, that will be the time to look into that. It
will not be a matter for me anyway; it will be for the House to decide
on the procedures for appointing the
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121959000425" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121959000425"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13121959000750" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121959000750">Mr

is one of the things it raises; there were about 40 occasions when our
officers were raising queries about the treatment of detainees they
were involved with and sometimes joining in the interrogation of. The
question is: how were the queries handled? Not all of them appear to
have been referred to Ministers, but these are the issues that are
raised. This does underline that the agents involved were perfectly
alert, and had the usual sensitivities, to the fact that the foreign
officers with whom they were liaising were not necessarily following
the same standards that we would wish. The thing I should emphasise,
and should have emphasised more as I have gone through, is that this is
what the consolidated guidance put out by the Prime Minister underlined
when he put it out; it provided absolute clarity, for the first time,
about how such concerns should be handled, and gave much better and
clearer guidance to the officers themselves about what they should do

principle that police investigations in this country are not subject to
political control, and it is just not possible for a Government
Minister to start intervening and questioning or second-guessing what
the police are doing. I am assured that the police are carrying out
thorough investigations and I only have estimates of when they might
finish. That is why we have come to the situation, which has
dissatisfied some of my colleagues, where we really have to get on and
inquire into this, and the best way of proceeding is to put our new ISC

to the House if I explain, again, briefly the new procedure, to which
it agreed recently and first used last week. In essence, the pattern is
the same as for a ministerial statement. Mrs Louise Ellman will speak
to her subject for up to 10 minutes—there is no obligation to
take all that time —during which no interventions may be taken.
At the conclusion of her statement, I will call Members who rise to put
questions to Mrs Ellman on the subject of her statement and call Mrs
Ellman to respond to those in turn. Members can expect to be called
only once. These interventions should be questions and should be brief.

<I>(Select Committee Statement)</I>: I am pleased to have this
opportunity to make a statement about the Transport Committee’s
recent report on high-speed rail. The crowded west coast main line
currently combines long-distance inter-city, inter-regional and
commuter passenger services, together with freight. Network Rail
predicts that by the middle of the next decade the line will be unable
to meet demand for new train paths and there will be increasing levels
of overcrowding. In 2011, we looked in detail at the
Government’s proposals for a new high-speed rail line from
London to Birmingham and onwards to Manchester and Leeds. Phase 1 is
due to be completed by 2025, and phase 2 by 2032-33. This proposed new
line is a major piece of national rail infrastructure and must be seen
as part of the wider rail network. We commissioned our own research
into HS2, and considered the capacity the alternatives could provide.

new report looked again at HS2, in the light of the revised strategic

research by KPMG on the line’s regional economic impact. The
Department’s case rests on a prediction of 2.2% per annum growth
to 2036. Demand is assumed to stop growing after that, only three years
after completion of the line. Capacity remains the key issue and no new
information has emerged to challenge the conclusion we reached on this
question two years ago. Alternatives to HS2, based on upgrading the
existing line and changes to train configurations, would not provide a
long-term answer to the capacity challenge. These alternatives would
themselves be costly and cause considerable disruption over a long

policy so that rail, road, aviation and maritime issues can be
considered together, and the Committee made remarks of that nature in
our initial report two years ago. However, decisions have to be made.
The Committee repeats its concern that no decision has yet been taken
on the serious question of a direct link to Heathrow. However, we do
not have the remit to look at aviation policy at the moment. Indeed,
our recommendation is that we think there should be a third runway at
Heathrow, but we do not have the authority to take a decision on that.
Currently the timetable set out by the Government means that the Davies
commission will not report until the summer of 2015. No guarantee has
been given on when a decision on airport capacity will be made after
that, although I hope that it is soon. Given the timetable for High
Speed 2, it seems impractical to say that no decision could
be taken on that until well after 2015. However, the point he makes is

importance of local, and indeed regional, work being conducted to
ensure that the potential benefits of High Speed 2 are enjoyed in all
parts of the country. Initially, the responsibility for doing that is
being taken up in some local areas—I know that a lot of work is
being done in the west midlands and in the Manchester area—but
it is not good enough to leave that entirely to those local and
regional authorities. In the Committee’s future questioning of
Ministers and High Speed 2 itself, and specifically Sir David Higgins,
I intend to pursue that issue so that, as well as individual
authorities taking their own initiatives, there is some kind of
national oversight of what is being done. After all, this is one of the
biggest national investment decisions to be taken for a very long time.

there will be a road show conducted by HS2 Ltd that will go across the

action was taken in relation to Crossrail. Following the road show, it

Ellman:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman raises very important issues.
The KPMG report is a very useful piece of research that identifies
areas that are due to benefit from High Speed 2 but also areas that
would not benefit. When the Committee questioned KPMG about its
findings, it became clear that some considerations had not been taken
into account, including the latest information on rail improvements
being planned for the areas concerned, the possibilities of rents being
increased, and the impact of freight developments. Those are just some
examples of aspects that had been missed out. Our report says that
further reports should be commissioned, and I am sure that the
Committee will take a continued interest in that. More research in this
very important area should be pursued. It is vital not just that areas
that are seen to benefit are made aware of that, but that areas that
are worried that they would not benefit are enabled to get maximum
support so that they could share in the positive aspects of
HS2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:02:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:02:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000044"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Sheerman" PimsId="663" UID="13121967000498" xid="531" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000498">Mr

Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills came out with a
very similar view this morning. Did she take evidence about that
research, and did she take evidence from the former Chancellor of the

nice thing about cars running on gases is that they offer the motorist
a cheaper and cleaner alternative. The autumn statement contained a
10-year pledge to keep stable the advantage of certain road fuel gases
over conventional fuels. That is all to the good, but the road fuel
gases that are being given that boost are used not in ordinary
vehicles, but only in heavier or commercial vehicles. The only fuel to
receive a knock in the statement was autogas—or liquefied
petroleum gas—which is another road fuel gas used by 160,000
British motorists, so they have been put on the trajectory of a
gradually reducing benefit from running cleaner cars. It seems an

recent fires, were the same as the Summerland fire 40 years ago. The

Lachaux is a friend of mine, who has been a constituent. She moved to
Dubai, but is now stranded there. She is a UK citizen and a Muslim in a

Dubai have also tried to do what they can to help, so I am not making
any criticism about that. There has been criticism from the family, who
do not think that enough is being done by me, the Foreign Office or our
consular staff in the Emirates, but if I was in the family’s
position, I would probably feel exactly the same. Their
relative—their mother, their sister—has been completely
stranded. She has been accused by her estranged husband, who has a
record of domestic violence, of all manner of criminal activities. She
has been arrested by the Dubai police. She has been jailed. She has
been beaten up. She has had the most horrendous experiences at the

second issue that I want to raise is the firefighters pension dispute.
There is pretty much consensus among those on both Front Benches that
the retirement age for firefighters had to be changed. That was
certainly the case when I was fire Minister. The terms of the pension
scheme were that firefighters had to take compulsory retirement after
30 years’ service or on reaching the age of 55. It was felt that
a number of firefighters could work and wanted to work past that. The
changes to the rules were supported by the Labour Government and they
have been amended recently by the
coalition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:33:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000103">There
has been a big change in the situation that has led to the fire
disputes that have raged across our country for months. When we put
forward our proposals, my understanding was that firefighters would not
be penalised if they had to retire early on the basis of fitness or
health and that their pensions would not be unfairly reduced if they
could not stay on until 60. That has changed partly because of the
cuts, partly because of austerity and partly because of the success of
the fire service in reducing the number of calls, fires, deaths and
injuries. That is partly the result of better building regulations and
procedures being introduced over the past 50 years, notwithstanding the
point that the hon. Member for Southend West made about fires, which
was entirely valid. Overall, because we mostly live in double-glazed
and insulated homes with central heating and because fewer people
smoke, there are fewer fires. The fire service’s education and
prevention teams have been extremely successful in reducing the number
of fires, and therefore the number of injuries and fatalities. The
authorities therefore think that we need fewer firefighters and fire
stations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:34:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000104"><Member ContinuationText="Bob Blackman" PimsId="5580" UID="13121967000519" xid="1094" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000519"><B>Bob
Blackman</B> (Harrow East) (Con):</Member> Does the hon. Gentleman

Fitzpatrick:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because
that is exactly the point that I was trying to establish. When we
anticipated the extension of the retirement age to 60, we did not think
that every operational firefighter would be fit and healthy enough to
work until 60. We thought that opportunities would be found for them in
back-room jobs in fire prevention, school education and all manner of
support roles to ensure that we took advantage of, and did not waste,
the 
<?notus-xml column=943?>experience that they had accumulated over many years on the front
line<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:35:57"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
because of austerity and the cuts and reductions that have been made in
the service because we do not need as many fire stations and
firefighters, there are many fewer such positions for firefighters who
are not fit to fulfil other
duties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:36:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000106">Under
the new rules that the Government are trying to push through,
firefighters are faced with a massive reduction in their pension if
they go before 60. We never anticipated that there would be such a
punitive element in the pension arrangements because, as part of the
new deal, firefighters are being asked to contribute another 2.6%,
which takes their deductions up to 12.6%.
Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:38:30"></hs_TimeCode> of us know

for a number of the things that he does. Everyone on the Government
Front Bench keeps describing the firefighters pension scheme as
generous. It is a good scheme, but they are expected to pay 12.6% for
it and the reason for that is deaths and injuries. The scheme is valid
and valued, as it ought to be, because of the nature of the
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000107">Colleagues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:38:30"></hs_TimeCode>

action because nobody is listening. They might have to take a hit of up
to a 50% cut in their pension because they cannot last until 60. I am
61 and am relatively fit. I know what that job is about because I did
it for 23 years. I know what it is like to be on strike. No emergency

be happy to do so. At the moment—I am reticent to say this,
Madam Deputy Speaker—the company is appearing in a pantomime in
Walton-on-Thames and doing MacLaddin. I am afraid that is somewhat
Scottish in nature, and possibly takes a rather comical view of that,
which I am sure would be disapproved of, although I hope to go and see
the production at some stage. I am plugging the company so much because
I am hoping for a role in its pantomime next year, and that at least
one colleague from across the House will join me as one of the other
ugly sisters, or something. We will have to see.</hs_Para>

active and where we must keep up the pressure. The Virunga national

of the land has been allocated for oil concessions. It was, I think,
the first wildlife park, and it was set up a long time ago at the
beginning of the 20th century. It contains important biodiversity,
including mountain gorillas and okapis. We must keep up that pressure,

England’s habitats are vital stores of beauty, biodiversity and

populations of endangered or critically listed species such as black
grouse, curlews, hen harriers and freshwater pearl mussels. Despite the
protection that has been afforded in many ways, a lot of bird species
have declined in numbers.</hs_Para>

wishing to seem too ambitious with my Christmas list, I have asked for
something else—in fact, I have actually purchased it to ensure I
get it because by and large in this world it is better to make sure we
get what we want. It is an excellent piece of work—a bird
atlas—compiled recently by the British Trust for Ornithology. It
is a follow up to a previous work, and before any of us had heard of
the big society, this was an example of the big society in action.
Volunteers go throughout the British isles, map the bird species they
have seen over a period of several years, and then put them into a huge
compilation. The important thing this time around is that we can
compare it with the previous one, which I think was published 10 years
ago, and see exactly what has improved and what species have declined.
Some populations have declined dramatically—the whinchat
population is down by 57%; curlews are down by 44%; and lapwings by
32%—and we have to take note of that. There have been huge
reductions in some species. Not all of those problems are man-made.
Some are due to climate change. However, there are things we can
do.</hs_Para>

of the things that I am most upset about is the striking loss of a
species called the hen harrier. The male hen harrier is a
magnificent grey creature. The female is also magnificent, but not
quite so grey—more brown, really. It is estimated that its
habitat in England could sustain more than 300 pairs. Last year was the
first time ever that no hen harriers bred in England—a direct
result, I think, of man’s intervention. Unfortunately, one
habitat that hen harriers like is the grouse moor—grouse are one
of their favoured prey. You can probably sense, Madam Deputy Speaker,
where the conflict lies. Grouse moors are managed commercial interests.
However, they do not have to be managed quite in the way they are and
some offences that are committed will be criminal.</hs_Para>

down the line of suggesting that the Government should introduce a
provision for vicarious liability, where employers are legally
responsible for wildlife crimes committed by their employees. I know
that is a contentious subject, and if I was still in the Whips Office I
would be tut-tutting because it falls into the “rather
difficult” category. However, we cannot afford to lose species
such as the hen harrier just because commercial interests have taken

and at Christmas they may just forgive me for doing so. I am lucky,
because I am not a lawyer—the legal profession is probably very
lucky that I am not one too, but that goes without saying. I have
discovered that the criminal Bar and criminal barristers are receiving
a real-terms reduction of 30% in very high cost cases, and there are
other reductions as well. In real terms, they are losing income. It is
very easy for us in this House to think of all barristers as being
extremely well paid and that they can afford it and so on. That
perception is rather like the one of Members of Parliament: we are
portrayed as always being extremely well paid, and that we can do
without this and that.</hs_Para>

the truth is not always the popular perception. In fact, only a
few—a significant few—earn very high fees. The level of
competence in defence cases will be reduced, because chambers will use
their most junior members. I apologise to the legal profession for not
quite understanding exactly what goes on, because I try to keep well
away from the law—I find, by and large, that that is a useful
thing to do. I can see, however, after talking to people, that the
reductions could lead almost to the extinction of the self-employed
criminal Bar as a specialist referral profession of excellence. There
will be an increase in cost to the taxpayer eventually, even though the
reason for the reductions is to make savings; I will come back to the
issue of savings in a moment. There might also be an impact on the
quality of the judiciary, because the judiciary are promoted
from  the criminal Bar and people will have been taken out of
the system. What worries me most is that what we value most highly in
this country is, I think, our legal system: the jury system and the
fact that people can get a high-quality defence when they need
it.</hs_Para>

understand why we have to make savings— Mr Micawber was
right. I also understand, however, that there are costs involved with
prisoners not turning up on time. I am sure that if I was sitting on
the Opposition Benches I might mention some of the organisations, which
are more private than public, that are responsible for bringing
prisoners to court. The interpreter system is costly and sometimes
interpreters are not always there at the right time. Any delays in the
court system—aside from the potential misery caused to
defendants, the prosecution and witnesses—bring with them a
large element of cost. That all has to be looked at, and I will return
to that. I may have to do a bit more work on understanding how it all
works—I always think that when people talk about the Bar, they
are talking about something else, but I shall have to move away from

We should not lose our faith in the Metropolitan police and we should
thank them for what they do. While we are back at home on Christmas
day, or whatever we are doing over Christmas, police will be guarding
the Palace of Westminster. They will be outside Downing street,
whatever the weather, and potentially subject to real threats. I
remember going out with the police a few years ago. They had just had a
call through to go to a pub where a big fight was going on. They did
not know what to expect—there could have been knives or
firearms—but they went out of the van unarmed. We owe them all a
huge debt of gratitude. I still think, as I am sure many other Members
do, that we have the finest police service in the world.</hs_Para>

recently became aware of several such cases in the UK, including in the
English health system—I am not simply talking about my own
constituency, in Scotland, where this is a devolved issue. The number
of young people suffering from eating disorders, particularly anorexia,
has grown considerably. They tend to be in their early teens and they
tend to be girls, although not always. It becomes obvious to parents
when their child loses a substantial amount of weight, which can happen
quickly, and there are various patterns that are easily observed. In
the first few stages, it will sometimes seem that the child is trying
to lose weight, perhaps to fit into a dress, because of fashion
imperatives or whatever. Some weight is lost quite quickly, and the
parents will be watching, but not necessarily thinking it a medical
issue.</hs_Para>

it continues. Over a brief period of perhaps three or four months, I
child can lose 25% of their body weight. A child who is, say, 8 stone
or 8 stone 2 lbs can drop below 6 stone very quickly before the parents
have grasped what is going on. Then, they will alert their local GP,
who might, or might not, be completely switched on to the subject, and
in due course, they might, or might not, get a referral to local
services dealing with that kind of thing.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:03:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

the time it gets to the NHS, the problem will usually be quite
advanced. Often, if the child continues to refuse to eat, they will be
admitted to accident and emergency in a period of weeks because their
vital organs will be starting to fail, and they will be going slightly
mad—that is my non-clinical term. The essence of it is that once
a child gets to that stage, it is very hard and takes a long time for
them to recover, because people have to persuade them of the common
sense of eating—that it is good for them, that they should treat
food like they would medicine. It will take years and years to get that
child back on track, if ever they do get back on track, so

10 or 12 years, is hard pressed. It works its budget hard, but by the
time people approach the local services for those with eating
disorders, they do not have the resources.</hs_Para>

is a subject that should concern everyone in this place. Having spoken
to a lot of people about this, I have noticed that if someone has a
child heading towards being admitted to A and E, their best chance is
to put them in a private hospital using private resources. There is a
clear pattern. The NHS will do what it can, but if someone can afford
private health care, the child will stand a much better chance. This is
not just about 
<?notus-xml column=950?>jumping the queue or opting for minor elective surgery; it is about life
and death—some 20% of sufferers actually die—and the
well-being of young men and women over many years. If a parent can beg,
borrow or steal the cash, my advice, unquestionably, would be to use
private provision.</hs_Para>

want to dwell for a moment on the report of the trust special
administrators into the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which
came out yesterday. There are a number of good things in the report.
Within the remit they were given—I think that that will need to
be considered by this House because it needs quite a lot of
change—they have done some good things. Those include
recommending a merger of the University Hospital of North Staffordshire
with the Stafford element of the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust.
They have also recommended that Cannock hospital goes to the Royal
Wolverhampton Hospitals Trust. For Stafford, that is a 
<?notus-xml column=951?>good thing. We will become part of a large university hospital trust and
be able to share services across a wider area. In addition to the
excellent staff that we already have, we will be able to attract
high-quality staff from across the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:10:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000150">We
are also retaining our accident and emergency department. At the
moment, it is open for only 14 hours a day, but that is better than the
nothing that was proposed earlier this year. However, I still believe
that we need a 24/7 A and E department. Perhaps our use of the current
department will reveal the need for an increase in hours, but at least
we have retained the department and we can build on it in the
future.</hs_Para>

have also retained acute services. At the start of the year, it was
thought that Stafford would become a community hospital—not an
acute hospital. I am glad to say that those fears have not been
realised. The recommendations also include, for the first time,
provision for a frail elderly unit, which is incredibly important as it
builds on the work of the Cure the NHS group, founded by Julie Bailey,
and the Francis report that came out as a result of that. I hope it
will be a beacon for the care of elderly people across the country. It
will show that, in Stafford, we can do such things to the highest
standards. We will also have a large range of other services. The trust
special administrators have said that 90% or more of current attendees
at Stafford and Cannock will be able to continue to use those services.
Cannock hospital has also been retained. In fact, more work will go on
at Cannock, 60% of which has been unused for many years. I welcome
that, as does my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:12:07"></hs_TimeCode>

lot of good things are going on in Stafford, and I welcome that.
However—and this is a big however—there are things that I
oppose and will continue to oppose, the most important of which
revolves around paediatric services. Yes, there will be a paediatric
assessment unit, but it will be linked with A and E and, therefore,
open for only 14 hours a day. That means that children who get sick
overnight will have to travel 20 or more miles to the nearest unit.
That is not acceptable for my constituents or indeed for the
constituents of surrounding constituencies. In addition, it will not be
a consultant-led paediatric unit, and it will have no in-patient beds
for children. That is a problem for children who turn up at night with
serious illnesses, or perhaps a very high temperature. Their parents
will be extremely worried and will want their child to be taken in and
observed for perhaps a day or two before they return home. If the
child’s condition is more serious, they will want them sent to a
major unit such as in Stoke or Birmingham.</hs_Para>

those who need in-patient child and adolescent mental health services
in Staffordshire—indeed, throughout the country—is not
nearly sufficient. Our general hospital in Stafford takes in a number
of such young people, some of whom are suicidal. It should not have to
do that, but it takes them in because there is nowhere else for them to
go. I do not believe that the administrators’ proposals take
that into account, although the issue was raised in the
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:14:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000154">The
original proposals said that no women could  give birth in
Stafford, unless they were having a home delivery, but I am glad to say
that the administrators 
<?notus-xml column=952?>have listened to the people and have recommended that we should have a
midwife-led maternity unit. However, that is still not enough, because
we need a consultant-led unit. With our growing town, the Army coming
in and the number of houses being built, we will get up to the 2,500 to
3,000 births a year in the coming year, and that will justify such
provision, networked together with the University Hospital of North
Staffordshire. I will continue to make that case to Monitor and to the
Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:14:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000155">The
question of the critical care unit was also raised. I am glad to say
that the administrators accepted the need for a level 3 critical care
unit at Stafford, but we need to look at the details in the report,
because I want to ensure that the unit is robust and will be maintained
and sustained. There are question marks over that, but as I am not an
expert on the matter, I will have to wait for the consultants and
clinicians in my constituency to get back to me with the
details<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:15:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#13121967000156">I
pay tribute to the community in Stafford, Cannock and the surrounding
areas who have shown such resilience. When downgrading of the hospital
to a community hospital was first proposed, they showed tremendous
support for its work. As is well known, the hospital has been greatly
troubled over years, but it has come on tremendously in the past two or
three years. Only two weeks ago Stafford had the best hospital
standardised mortality ratio in the whole of the west midlands. That is
a far cry from where it was four or five years ago. I pay great tribute

comes back to the House, I will make some remarks on it if I am given
the opportunity to do so. In fact, I would take my remarks much wider
than that. I have written a paper to Monitor on all the faults of the
TSA process that I have experienced at first hand. One in particular is
that when an administrator is installed, the trust loses its board. The
chief executives and the executives lose their support. I am not saying
that the TSAs do not try to do some work, but their focus is on the
financial side and the future. Inevitably, they are not so focused on
running the hospital now, and that is a serious omission. There are
many other serious points that I want to make, and I would welcome a

matter carefully, because there will be others in the future. Indeed,
we need to assess whether the whole process of a company-like
administration is  
<?notus-xml column=953?>the best way to cope with a failure in the hospital context, and I am
pretty sceptical about that. Perhaps we can use our mutual experience

want to touch on a number of other areas that affect my constituents.
We have already heard today at some length about High Speed 2. I will
not go into too many details other than to say that the railway line
runs straight through four villages in my constituency. I understand
the national need for increased capacity, but I do not think that this
is the right solution. I wish that the approach to HS2 and rail
capacity had been similar to that of aviation. Instead, what we seem to
do with railway capacity is to come up with a solution and then look
around for problems for it to address. With aviation, we are doing it
the other way around, although I know that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:19:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) and others might not

also need to consider mitigation measures and compensation. It comes
back to what I have said time and time again to my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State for Transport: we need to be reasonable and fair
in our compensation, as the French are with such schemes, not miserly.
I am afraid that I have seen instances of my constituents who were
dealt with in a less than generous manner when their whole life was

not due to start in my constituency until 2026. That means 30 years of

also want to mention Staffordshire university. It has an important
campus in my town, but it is considering moving away from it, perhaps
partially and perhaps fully. That would be a major error. The
university is very good for Stafford and Stafford is very good for the

first in the country to introduce a course in computing, through
English Electric. It has produced many fine graduates over the years. I

me also raise the question of a western access road in Stafford. I was
talking to somebody from a neighbouring village last night who said
that they never come to Stafford because of the congestion and traffic.
That is partly because of the popularity of the town, but it also shows
that the road network—the town has two rivers, a canal and two
main line railways, the one from Birmingham and the west coast main
line, that merge—has an infrastructure problem. The western
access road, for which we need £25 million, would help 
<?notus-xml column=954?>in some way to alleviate the congestion and make Stafford an even more

the problems with traffic congestion that those roadworks are causing,
but the parks will result in many hundreds if not thousands of highly
skilled jobs being created for the area. We had the great news earlier
this year that two more signal regiments will come to Stafford from

build many more houses—we need more houses for our young people

we are on the subject of housing, I want to bring up one matter that
has proved contentious in politics in the past few months—that
is, the question of the spare room rent, the spare room subsidy, the
bedroom tax or whatever one wants to call it. There has been a lot of
understandable debate in the House and I believe that we will need to
consider the issue quite carefully. The principle of it is based on
what the previous Government introduced in the private sector, and I 
<?notus-xml column=955?>believe that that principle is probably right. However, the percentage
of rent that has been introduced at the beginning results in genuine
difficulty in many parts of the country. Eventually, a decision will

in evictions.</hs_Para>

urge the Government to consider how, without getting rid of a policy

they can deal with the fact that the cost of 14% or 25% of rent is far
too high for most people at the beginning, particularly when there are
no other properties for them to move in to. I will leave that one in

Unfortunately, we are seeing it in the Central African Republic and the
killing has started again in South Sudan. Whatever else this House

nobody else will, including other Parliaments around the world. I truly

her life. Debbie underwent a procedure called hysteroscopy, which looks
inside a patient’s uterus and is used to investigate symptoms
such as pelvic pain, abnormal bleeding and infertility. Biopsies are
often taken and tissue is often removed. The patient’s vagina is
opened with a speculum, as during a cervical smear test, and a
hysteroscope is inserted. A hysteroscope is a thin tube with a light
and camera on the end, as well as any other instruments that might be
needed. As I am sure I need hardly point out, this procedure is highly
uncomfortable and clearly has the potential to be very painful
indeed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000182">At

looked at the private rented sector, one of the problems highlighted in
the evidence we received was that the poorer quality of the private
rented sector housing damages the health and well-being of the people
who live in those homes. The English housing survey conducted earlier
this year shows that properties in the private rented sector have the
lowest proportion of the three standard insulation
measures—cavity wall insulation, good loft insulation and full
double-glazing—and they are most likely to fall into the lowest
energy efficiency bands. Over a third of private rented homes are not
classified as meeting the decent homes standard. We would not expect
people to live in socially rented accommodation of that standard, and
the number of private rented homes is almost double that of socially
rented homes. At the same time, almost one in five fail the housing
health and safety tests, compared with just 9% of social sector
dwellings. Also, damp is more likely to be found in private rented
sector accommodation than in any other type of housing, and it is less
likely to be dealt with by landlords. That is a scandal that must be
addressed.</hs_Para>

use of six-month assured shorthold tenancies has grown in this country,

evict a tenant and recover the property if they so choose. These

evidence of people traffickers accommodating their victims in illegal

in many constituencies across London. Some of the solutions he set

this Christmas faced with the threat of their homes being bulldozed. We
saw what happened with the original third runway proposal for Sipson,
where a compensation scheme was introduced and BAA bought up virtually
all the properties. People are living in those properties, but the life
of the village—some have described it as a shell; I do not think
it is that bad—is somewhat different from what it was. We are
engaging the new residents in community life as best we can, but the
blight caused by the threat of a runway being built over their homes

Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir John Randall) in former
years. A population of 10,000 to 15,000 people now face an overall
threat to their accommodation and from noise 
<?notus-xml column=967?>and pollution. Parents are sitting down at Christmas thinking that their
home is going to be demolished some time in the future. They are
planning their children’s education knowing that two of the best
schools in our area—Heathrow and Harmondsworth primary
schools—would be bulldozed as well. It looks as though other
schools, particularly along the M4, perhaps Pinkwell and Harmondsworth
primary schools, would be rendered unusable as a result of noise and
air pollution.</hs_Para>

right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip talked about Cherry
Lane cemetery becoming an issue again. The last time we had this
misfortune, the BAA documents that were leaked to us demonstrated that
the road network that would service the new runway and the expanded
airport ran through Cherry Lane cemetery. In particular, it ran through
the children’s area of the cemetery, and that of course caused
immense distress within my community. That threat will return with the
road structure that would be proposed for the new third and fourth
runways.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:17:50"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Gentleman will remember that in our previous campaign, John Wilkinson,
who was the Member for Ruislip-Northwood and served on the Commonwealth
War Graves Commission, raised that very point. It was one of the key
issues that was raised at the time of our very broad-based campaign
against the expansion of Heathrow

want Members to go away and think how devastating the announcement from
the Davies commission is for these families. However, I am optimistic,
as I think the right hon. Gentleman is, that we can defeat this. Any
Government who sought to expand Heathrow airport, which would impact on
perhaps 2 million people in terms of noise and air pollution, would
face opprobrium. The political impact would be significant; I think it
would determine a shift in a number of seats. On that basis, I cannot
see any Government politically sustaining the policy of expanding
Heathrow airport.</hs_Para>

in case anyone tries, let me give this warning: we will campaign on a
scale that this Government and previous Governments have never seen
before. It will be a campaign in which we mobilise local residents, but
because of the impact across London, it will unite communities across
London. There are already plans for a march all the way from
Harmondsworth through every constituency affected—all the way
through west London and into central London—which will garner
support as we go along. It will be a crusade that will march right the
way through west London and pick up hundreds, if not thousands of
people in opposition to 
<?notus-xml column=968?>the Government. There will also be support from green campaigners who
are concerned about the impact of the expansion of Heathrow airport on
climate change. There will be direct action campaigns by
environmentalists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:19:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000258">Last
time this happened, a climate camp appeared in my constituency: 1,000
people turned up overnight, built a village and launched a direct
action campaign, which contributed to influencing the Conservative

lie down and let their homes be bulldozed and their schools demolished,
and they will not be threatened with having to dig up their dead from
the cemetery. People will fight
back<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:20:13"></hs_TimeCode>, and as
part of that fightback I will convene a meeting at Heathrow primary
school on 16 January. I encourage Members to come along, because it

FBU put forward a draft proposal that instead of guidance, the fire
Minister should adopt regulations linked to the pension scheme. If he
had accepted that, one of the main points of the dispute would have
been resolved, but that was refused. The FBU has warned of further
strike action. It has balloted its members and received overwhelming
support for strike action. As a result of the legal process that unions
have to go through, it has now had to call the dates for the strikes.
The Minister wrote yesterday to say that he was willing to meet it
again, but as I said in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member
for Poplar and Limehouse, the FBU is willing to meet any time, any
place—wherever the Minister wants—but the talks have to

have a lot of time for the fire Minister, but given the seriousness of
the dispute, I would say at this point that the issue has reached
Secretary of State level. As happened in the last fire dispute, the
Secretary of State has to come to the table to start negotiations. In
the last fire dispute under the previous Government, I remember the
Prime Minister getting involved at one point to try to hammer out the
issue so that people were not put at risk. We are within days of
another dispute leading to another strike, and the Secretary of State
needs at least to get involved in starting off negotiations. His coming
to the table would demonstrate a seriousness of

other issue, which I will not go into in depth, is that of
contributions. That was mentioned by my hon. Friend, who gave the
figures in percentage terms. Under the new pension scheme, there will
be an increase in contributions each year for four years: for members
of the 2006 scheme, contributions will go up from 8.5% in 2011 to 12.6%
in 2015. A firefighter on a salary of £29,766 will pay more than
£4,000 a year for their pension alone if those increases are
imposed. That is a significant increase for people who are on a
relatively modest wage for professionals in this

Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir John Randall) spoke about
the Metropolitan police. I am anxious about what is happening in the
Met. A range of cuts are feeding through. Safer neighbourhood teams
were one of the best policing reforms that were undertaken by the last
Government. It is good to have a local sergeant, two police constables
and a couple of police community support officers located within the
ward and to have the guarantee that they will not be pulled out of the
ward for other extraneous duties. The cuts that are coming through now
are undermining safer neighbourhood policing in our areas. There are
not sufficient PCs, the recruitment of PCSOs is not happening and safer
neighbourhood teams are being combined. That is breaking down the local
connection.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000281">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:34:28"></hs_TimeCode>
retirement of a large number of officers who had long service means
that we have lost a lot of experienced police officers. When we lose
that experience we also lose the supervision, and I am anxious about
that. In my constituency, as in many across London, we are losing
police officers and their visibility on the streets is being reduced.
At the same time—I agree about this with the right hon. Member

quality of

will refer to one happy piece of news. The Independent Workers Union of
Great Britain is a small trade union that has been running a campaign
to secure the living wage for cleaners, particularly in central London
and the City. One employer that has been a difficult nut to crack is a
company called MITIE. The union organised its workers and there have
been disputes and demonstrations. MITIE issued a letter to all its
staff, basically saying that any appearance on a demonstration related
to the living wage would be interpreted as gross misconduct and they
would be dismissed. After a short campaign by the cleaners and an
early-day motion in this House, and thanks to the hard work of the
union organiser, Chris Ford, negotiations have taken place over the
past couple of days. MITIE is now in negotiations with the union about
the living wage in relation to the contract. It has withdrawn its
threatening letter to the staff and even sent out a letter apologising
to them. I congratulate the IWGB—in particular the organiser,
Chris Ford—on that success, and also the employer for seeing
sense and coming back to the negotiating table. I hope that will send a
message to other employers.</hs_Para>

of glamorise John Lewis as a wonderful mutual—apart, that is,
for the fact that it has outsourced its cleaners who are not part of
the mutual system and not paid the London living wage. Again, the IWGB
has been running a campaign on that, and I have been on the picket
lines, trying to urge that company to recognise that its cleaners
should be part of its mutual structure and paid properly. The other
group of workers who I think will be mobilised over the coming period
are fast-food workers. They are largely not unionised and many are on
the minimum wage with poor employment conditions. We have convened a
meeting in the House of Commons next year to bring together all those
unions, and others who want to campaign for the rights of fast-food
workers in the new

from a paedophile gang of military personnel from both the UK and the

him while living on that Army camp in Cyprus, but I understand that he
is not eligible for 
<?notus-xml column=973?>compensation through the Criminal Injuries Compensation (Overseas)
Scheme because his father was not military personnel, even though he
was attached to the Cyprus base. There is a UK national Criminal
Injuries Compensation Scheme, but my constituent is excluded from that
because the offences took place outside the United Kingdom. There is
also a Europe-wide scheme, but again my constituent is excluded by
reason of the offences taking place prior to the implementation of that
scheme. My constituent is excluded from other possible avenues for
compensation. He is at present without a remedy for the grievous harm
he has suffered. I understand that GCHQ comes under the jurisdiction of
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, so it might be thought reasonable
for it to implement a matching scheme to provide compensation for those
in my constituent’s position, or, alternatively, to offer a
one-off compensation award under the same principles as the overseas
scheme.</hs_Para>

for him to have closure in this matter. We need to find some form of
compensation, whatever it is, just to say that somebody has owned up to
the fact that it was not dealt with properly, and that the abuse he
sustained all those years ago still affects him now. I have met him

hugely because the infrastructure is not there. These homes will create
more surface run-off and cause more flooding. I want the Planning

local management of waterways so that the people who know exactly when

less flooding. It is good that the Government are negotiating Flood Re

welcome the opportunity of a Christmas Adjournment debate and the fact
that a Member can raise any issue they want, the system that we have
had in other times when there have been themed debates with a Minister
replying is a far more satisfactory way of dealing with parliamentary
business. I do not doubt that the Deputy Leader of the House will
report in great detail to each Minister concerned and ensure that we
get an answer, but the whole point of the House of Commons is to hold
the Government and Ministers to account rather than using it as a
sounding-board Chamber where anyone can raise anything they like and it

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:52:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harrow East (Bob Blackman), whom I compliment on his contribution,
I want to raise the issue of housing in London. I
re<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:52:11"></hs_TimeCode>present an
inner-city constituency, which has somewhat different characteristics
from those of Harrow. Nevertheless housing is a huge issue. Roughly
speaking, my borough divides 40:30:30—council and housing
association houses and social rented accommodation make up about 40% of
the borough’s housing; private rented houses about 30% and
owner-occupied houses 30%. The owner-occupation rate is well below the
national average, and falling very fast. The private rented sector is
well above the national average and rising very fast. The social
ownership section is increasing a bit through the work of the housing
associations and the council’s commendable building programme to
try to provide homes for people who desperately need them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121967000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000308"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>The
problem we have is an enormous housing list of people in often
desperate housing need. The chances of them being housed in a
council-owned house or a housing association place are very limited, so
the council fulfils its obligations to them in the only way it can,
which is by placing them in the private rented sector. Many of those
private flats are not in the borough; they are some distance away. That
in itself creates a problem. The applicants accept the accommodation
because they have no choice. They aspire to return to the borough, so
the large numbers of families who are placed outside the borough make
very long journeys to ensure that their children maintain a place at
the same school, which is important from the point of view of the
continuity of education for primary school-aged children.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121967000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000309"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:54:18"></hs_TimeCode>The
other issue is that the benefit level cap on housing expenditure, the
housing allowance, is way below the average rent in the private sector.
The transitional money the Government approved on the introduction of
the cap is drying up and disappearing. Frankly, what we are going
through is nothing more than a process of social cleansing from inner
London, as families on benefit—sometimes in work, and sometimes
not in work, as it affects people almost equally—can no longer
remain in the borough and must therefore be accommodated elsewhere.
That exacerbates the whole
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000310">We
have a high degree of housing stress among those families. I meet
families all the time and I am very worried about the impact of such a
degree of housing insecurity on a whole generation of children as they
grow up. Members of this House all earn a good salary, have reasonable
accommodation to live in and do not feel a sense of housing insecurity.
We should try and put ourselves in the mindset of young parents trying
to bring up children in the private rented sector knowing that they
have no security of tenure and could lose their flat within six months.
If they complain, they are likely to find that their tenancy is
terminated. The effect on the parents is extreme stress, but the effect
on the children is great uncertainty about their place in life and the
ability of their parents to provide for them. We are damaging a whole
generation of people through the housing policies that are being
adopted in this
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000311" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000311">I
am not making a partisan point, because my party, when in government,
certainly did not do enough to build the necessary new housing. It
certainly did not do 
<?notus-xml column=977?>enough to bring in much tougher regulation of the private rented sector
any more than this Government have. I applaud what my council is trying
to do by developing new council properties of a good and high standard
and what it has achieved through the decent homes standard. The estates
are in a much better condition than they ever used to be. Nevertheless,
we live in an area where property prices are rising fast. I think I am
right to say that more than 80% of the borough does not earn enough
money to be able to buy a property within Islington, so the only option
for those people is the private rented sector.</hs_Para>

areas in which the sector must be reformed, and quickly. I have with me
a copy of the report by the Communities and Local Government Committee
on the regulation of the private rented sector, which is an
interesting, well-written document that calls for the simplification of
the regulation of the private rented sector and better education of
both landlords and tenants. I agree with all that. Sometimes, the
report’s proposals are a bit too timid but I agree with the
general thrust of what it is trying to
say.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000313">We
must be a little bolder. I introduced a ten-minute rule Bill on the
subject, and I want to see fundamental change in three areas of the
private rented sector. The first is the role of the letting agents. At
the moment, there is almost no regulation of letting agents. Anyone can
set up a letting agency, there are no checks on them whatsoever and
anybody can claim to be a letting agent and start renting out
properties. I think they should all be regulated so we know who is
working where, so that they have to provide proper information to all
prospective tenants, and so that they are not allowed to introduce
arbitrary and often totally unfair charges such as search fees, which
are always non-returnable and often expensive. There should also be
much clearer explanation for prospective tenants of what they are
getting
into.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000314">Agents
are also often deeply discriminatory. A sign in a window that reads,
“No DSS” shows first of all that they are deeply out of
date with the structure of the social security system in this
country—it is now the Department of Work and Pensions and it is
a housing allowance, not DSS as it was about 20 years ago—and
also fundamentally discriminates against somebody who is perfectly
legally claiming what they are entitled to from the DWP. Why should
they not be allowed to rent because they are claiming? The
investigation by “Panorama” showed the race
discrimination and racial profiling by the agencies, which are a scar
on our society that deeply disfigures people’s lives and life
chances. Discrimination is wrong in any aspect, whether it be financial
in respect of benefit claimants or racial discrimination as operated by
some agents. We must have proper regulation of these
agencies.</hs_Para>

number of London boroughs are actively considering setting up their own
letting agency to manage the number of people they place within in the
private rented sector and offering the service to landlords and tenants
alike. I think that would be a wholly good thing—it would be
properly run, properly managed and probably a lot cheaper for everyone
concerned than the present
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:00:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000316">The
second area relates to points raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:00:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harrow East about the condition and maintenance of private sector
properties. Yesterday, I  
<?notus-xml column=978?>met an interesting gentleman from the Electrical Safety Council, who
told me his concerns—they were held by the fire service and many
others, too—about the lack of regular electrical checks in the
private rented sector. It can often be an extremely dangerous place to
be. There are supposed to be gas checks and all kinds of checks, but
they are often never carried out.</hs_Para>

have had experience of tenants in the private rented sector making
wholly legitimate complaints about the condition of their
flat—the lack of insulation, the poor quality windows, the high
energy bills they incur because of all that and infestation by vermin.
They usually find that nothing is done about that, and if they contact
the environmental health service, they might find their tenancy
terminated at the first possible opportunity by the landlord.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:01:39"></hs_TimeCode> is scandalous
that if tenants try to exercise their rights, they lose their property.
Although that might mean that environmental health can enforce better
conditions for the next tenant, it is not much help for the tenant who
has been evicted for having the temerity to try to exercise their
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:02:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000318">The
third area is probably the most controversial—the question of
the rent levels charged. If I look across the whole country, I realise
that the rent levels charged in the private rented sector vary
enormously, often over quite short distances. The rent levels in
central London are massive; if we move a short distance towards the
outer London boroughs, the rent levels are a bit less; if we move a bit
further out of London, they become much less; if we move to other
regions in the country, the rent levels might not be the main problem,
but there could be other areas of
regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:02:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000319" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000319">My
private Member’s Bill—I have no notion of whether it will
ever become law; certainly not in this Parliament, although I hope the
idea will become law at some point—is not only about empowering
local authorities to set up letting offices and agencies, but about
requiring simplified advice to be given to landlords and tenants about
how the properties will be operated. Authorities will also have the
power to impose a level of regulation on the rent levels charged in the
private sector.</hs_Para>

that respect, a number of formulae could be adopted. One would be
simply to take a figure and declare it to  be a reasonable rent
for the area. Rent levels could be based on the capital value of the
property and the cost of maintaining its value if money has been
borrowed to purchase it. Alternatively, because the structure of the
private rented sector is changing fast, we could require large private
sector landlords—there are some of them around
nowadays—to provide at least 50% of their properties for rent at
an affordable level, as we would require for any new large housing
development.</hs_Para>

we do not regulate the private rented sector, we are condemning, in the
case of my borough, a third of the population to a life of
insecurity—and the numbers of private rented properties are
likely to rise considerably over the next few years. All the

probably be 25%, if not more, by the end of this decade. Other
countries manage to have a pretty fully regulated private rented
sector. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:04:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

of the problems in my constituency is that it contains a large number
of very small landlords who only ever think of the headline return in
the form of the rent. They never think of the cost of maintenance, the
cost of repairs, or the cost of simply managing a property. We need to
devise a much better system. The Select Committee report was a good

disappointing. No doubt we shall return to the issue in the

me end with this thought. We all want to enjoy a nice
Christmas—who doesn’t?—but we also want to enjoy a
degree of security in our lives, and I think that we should consider
for a moment the very large number of people who live in the private
rented sector. Not all landlords are bad; some are good, decent,
generous people who look after their tenants in the way in which we
would all want to be looked after ourselves; but, unfortunately, not
all of them are like that. There are some terrible rogue landlords, and
some terrible practices.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:06:04"></hs_TimeCode> used to say
awful things about Rachman and what he did in winkling secure tenants
out of north Kensington all those decades ago, but there are very few
secure tenancies now. Landlords no longer need to winkle people out.

tenant in, and charge the new tenant a higher rent—and so the

Brooks Newmark</B> (Braintree) (Con):</Member> I want to begin, rather
than end, my speech by wishing all the staff of the House, and the
police, a happy Christmas. They serve all of us here in Parliament
extremely well, and I hope that they will have a relaxing Christmas
holiday and a happy new
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:07:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000329">I
also want to thank certain groups in my constituency which I know will
be working very hard over Christmas. The Salvation Army does a
tremendous job in looking 
<?notus-xml column=980?>after the homeless, not just in Braintree but, I believe, in all our
constituencies, and Braintree Foyer looks after young people so well
when they have nowhere to go. Then there are the church groups, which
serve our food banks incredibly well. As we know from our recent debate
on the subject, the use of food banks has increased—there is no
denying that—and many of the church groups in our communities
are playing a leading role in that regard.</hs_Para>

me now issue a plea to everyone in my constituency, and to all who are
listening here. Many elderly people will be alone this Christmas, and
if someone can spend just one or two hours with an elderly person, it
will make a very big difference to that person at this very important
time of the
year.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:06:58"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

promised that I would be brief, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I will be, but I
want to raise one constituency issue. I want to talk about two aspects
of infrastructure, the first being trains. Unfortunately, we in
Braintree are not well served by trains. There is a main line to Witham
and then onwards, and there is a branch line from Witham to Braintree.
As a branch line, we only get one train an hour. That causes enormous
problems, and ever since I became a candidate in 1999—long
before I was an MP—I was calling for a loop to be put in between
Braintree and Witham because that will allow more people to travel
along that line rather than waiting the one hour, as they have to, or
getting in their
cars.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000332">The
big problem is that Braintree has grown enormously even in the past 15
years that I have lived in the area. As a result, when people get on
the train at Braintree they find that it is already at capacity, so by
the time it reaches Cressing or White Notley, let us say, on the way to
Witham it is often totally full. That creates huge problems, and one
way to alleviate that pressure is to build a loop between Braintree and
Witham.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121967000333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000333">I ask Greater
Anglia and Abellio, who are the controllers of the train line, to think
about these three Cs: capacity, cancellations and communication. With
capacity, the issue is that the trains are often full at peak times, as
I have mentioned, so it would be very useful for them to think about
investing in that loop which I and others have been asking for. That
will take people off the roads and on to the trains, and as they will
be using the train services more, it will make the loop more
economically viable.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121967000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000334">The second C
is cancellations. In the past month or so there have been three
cancellations of the 6.45 am train. If someone is planning to catch a
train at Cressing and they have a meeting in London that morning, and
the 6.45 am train is cancelled and they do not know about it in
advance, they have a big problem. The bigger problem is that,
unfortunately, Greater Anglia has not put on any other services, such
as a bus service, to take them to Witham, and it might not even inform
passengers that there is a problem.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121967000335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000335">That brings
me to my third C: communication. It is very important that Greater
Anglia communicates with passengers, explaining that there is a
problem, rather than passengers simply standing on the platform and
seeing the train whizz past them. That can be extremely frustrating if
they have a morning meeting in London or elsewhere.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121967000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000336">I therefore
ask Abellio and Greater Anglia to think about those three issues of
capacity, dealing with 
<?notus-xml column=981?>cancellations with care and efficiency, and communicating with
passengers. That is extremely important. They should think seriously
about building a loop between Braintree and Cressing, because I think
that will deal with a lot of the problems they face. I know from having
talked to Braintree district council and Essex county council that they
would be willing to put in some money to try to get this loop between
Braintree and Cressing, as would local businesses. So again I make my
plea to Abellio and Greater Anglia to think about building this loop,
and perhaps the Secretary of State for Transport—the ex-Chief
Whip and my ex-boss—will also consider that plea of
mine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121967000337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000337">My
second infrastructure point is to do with the A120, and it relates very
much to something my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton
(Neil Parish) was saying. Drivers come up the M11, let us say, and then
get on to the A120 at Stansted and have a beautiful two and three-lane
highway all the way to Braintree, but when they get to Braintree they
hit Galleys corner, which is known as cholesterol corner for two
reasons: first, because of the KFC, the McDonald’s and the other
fast food outlets that are located there, and secondly, because a major
traffic blockage forms there.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121967000338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000338">While I
appreciate that when the new Secretary of State took up his post he
generously gave us a little over £300,000 to deal with the
little pinch-point at Galleys corner, unfortunately that only dealt
with a tiny piece of the problem. What we really need to do is dual the
road the eight or nine miles between Braintree and Marks Tey in order
to alleviate the blockage. I want Members to imagine a fast road that
goes all the way from London through to Stansted and then on to
Braintree, and then suddenly it stops. For eight or nine miles, there
is a single-lane carriageway, the A12, to Marks Tey, at which point the
road becomes the A120, and a dual carriageway, again, and continues all
the way to Harwich.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121967000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000339">Alleviating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:15:07"></hs_TimeCode>
the pinch-points along this transnational, perhaps trans-European,
network is important. Many groups in Braintree have campaigned for this
to happen, including the Braintree business council, the Braintree
business forum, Councillor Siddall, who is in charge of businesses on
Braintree district council, and my friend Malcolm Hobbs. They have all
have campaigned for the dualling of the road.</hs_Para>

do not deny that this would be an expensive project. It could cost up
to £300 million, which is an enormous amount. However, time is
money, and if people are stuck in their cars, that can be expensive for
them. There are local groups in Braintree that are willing to invest in
the project, and we could form a public-private partnership to achieve
this. Essex county council, Braintree district council and various
local businesses have all said that they would put in some money to
alleviate the problem.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121967000341" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#13121967000341"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:15:58"></hs_TimeCode>I
make a direct plea to the Secretary of State for Transport and even to
the Chancellor himself, who has been extremely generous in giving money
to other infrastructure projects around the country, to alleviate this
minor road block by putting some money into this project. It would
create jobs locally and alleviate pressure and blight in several
areas.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend also expressed concern about some aspects of freedom of
information. He then went on to talk about air pollution, describing it
as a hidden killer. I agree with him on that. The fact that people do
not visibly drop dead from air pollution means that it is not treated
with the same seriousness as heart attacks and strokes. He was right to
say that its principal source, apart from industry, is the tailpipes of
the cars and other vehicles that we all drive around in. The Government
take the issue seriously and we are working towards the legally binding
pollution limits set out in European Union legislation. My hon. Friend
also rightly highlighted the importance of alternative fuels, such as
liquefied petroleum gas, and the fact that they can make a big
difference to air quality. He went on to touch on the issue of fire

pollution. European regulations require air quality to be up to a

hon. Friend then discussed the Disclosure and Barring Service, which
was previously the Criminal Records Bureau. I suspect that many hon.
Members will have encountered issues with the CRB and the DBS relating
to turnaround times. Often it is not clear where the delays are
occurring, because sometimes they are in securing a response from the
police. He touched on the issue of school governors, and I think we can
all agree that they play an essential role and make a substantial
contribution. I suspect that many hon. Members will have been, or may
still be, a school governor. As he stated, they need specific skills,

the fact that the Government and the Minister who leads on these issues
have been strong in pushing for parity of esteem; in other words,
people with mental health issues should treated in exactly the same way
as we would expect people who need to go through the acute health

Gentleman has had the support that he needed from the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office and the consular staff, although I understand
perfectly why the family will feel that that is not sufficient, given
the very serious predicament that their family member is in. I am
pleased to hear that a meeting with the Minister has already been
agreed, and I am sure the hon. Gentleman will pursue the matter as
assiduously in that meeting as he has done previously. I am sure that
the FCO and consular staff will do everything in their power to help
resolve the problem, although all of us who have had experiences of
constituents abroad dealing with other legal systems know that that is
one of the biggest challenges any Member of Parliament can face in
taking up issues on behalf of

hon. Gentleman touched on the issue of firefighters’ pensions.
He obviously has extensive knowledge of that, which he brings in a very
positive way to the Chamber this afternoon. He highlighted some aspects
and recognised that it is a good scheme for firefighters. He will know,
and I know as a result of a chance meeting with a firefighter while I
was out canvassing at the weekend, that the contribution that
firefighters make to their pensions is quite significant. The figure
that I was quoted was £900 a month as a pension contribution. I
am aware that

Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon.
Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis), has stated his
willingness to engage with the Fire Brigades Union, and I hope that
will be pursued, as it is not in the interest of the FBU, the
Government or the wider public for strike action to go ahead. If there
is a possibility of the talks finding a resolution, let us pursue that

right hon. Friend dwelt at some length on his interests. From the trip
that we both undertook to Venezuela and Brazil some year ago, I know
about his interest in environmental matters, wildlife and especially
bird life. I recommend that he does not walk around Clapham common in
the dark with his bat detection material. He may want to choose another
location. He spoke about the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
concerns there about its wildlife park. I agree that that is a
significant issue, but the DRC has a much wider range of issues that we
need to contribute towards resolving, as well as that
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:28:53"></hs_TimeCode>. My

hon. Member for Falkirk (Eric Joyce) raised the serious issue of eating
disorders. It is something the Government take very seriously,

young people between the ages of 14 and 25, and there might be as many
as 1.1 million people—a substantial number—in the UK
directly affected. Since April the relevant services have been

Mercian, which we will do. He referred to the role of the trust special

he was pleased with some of the outcomes of the process but had
concerns about others. I echo those concerns in relation to my local
hospital, St Helier. It is a category 6 hospital, so one of the safest
in the country, and the best in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for
dealing with hip fractures, yet it is proposed, as a result of a

on HS2. Given that today we had Transport questions, in which HS2
featured prominently, followed by a statement from the Chair of the
Transport Committee, I do not think that there is anything further that
I could add. Finally, I was pleased to hear him speaking up for the
Government’s position on international development. Following
the actions of the previous Government, we are ensuring that we deliver
0.7% of GNI for international development. That gives us credibility
around the world when we are talking about the subject. We are

I hope that she, on behalf of us all, will thank her constituent and

hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) talked about beds in sheds.
Members will know that the Prime Minister has visited Southall to look
at that issue. We heard other contributions this afternoon on the
private rented sector. It was clear from the cross-party consensus that
emerged that something needs to be done. I am sure that the Backbench
Business Committee 
<?notus-xml column=986?>would respond positively to a cross-party request to discuss those
issues, because clearly it is unacceptable that people are living in
sheds. It was noted that in Slough there were just over 6,100 houses
where people were potentially living in sheds, although I suspect that
some of them were cannabis farms, because of the heat generated. He
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:34:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:36:26"></hs_TimeCode>also
highlighted the number of fires that had happened over a three-year

only has a very negative impact on the people who are having to live in

serious.</hs_Para>

against that runway on behalf of his local community, under the
coalition Government and under the previous Government. He also
discussed HS2, the Fire Brigades Union dispute, and staffing in the
House of Commons. He then talked about safer neighbourhood teams. As a
London Member of Parliament, I think that unfortunately the changes
that have happened mean that there is less visibility on the streets,
and people are raising that in terms of the profile of the police. That
is an area that we need to monitor.

wage, he highlighted the more positive developments in relation to

Gentleman will be aware, North Wales police has announced plans,
following public consultation, to improve service provision in north

magistrates courts. We are aware that the police will vacate their
existing premises in Wrexham in 2016-17, which will have implications
for the court and how it deals with custody cases, but when
circumstances change in this way, the Courts and Tribunals Service will

hon. Gentleman might feel that the lack of cells will automatically
lead to the closure of the court, but that is not the case. He did not
dwell on this in his speech, but he will be aware of it and the
consultation by the local police. I can reassure him that an open and
transparent consultation process is used when deciding whether to close
a court. Crucially, any proposals on the future of a court are
considered with emphasis on the local area and how justice is best
served there. Several factors will be taken into consideration before
starting a consultation, including an assessment of the work load and
utilisation of the court. The Courts and Tribunals Service also takes
into account whether a suitable alternative location for the work is
available and whether it could be accommodated elsewhere without a
detrimental impact on service
levels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T17:06:46"></hs_TimeCode>. If a

when there are proposals to change the deployment of magistrates or the

decisions are made only once the views of relevant parties have been
considered through the open and transparent consultation processes. I
stress that the Government are committed to providing court users in

have been better to have had this debate during consideration of the
amendment to the Immigration Bill on Report, so that we could have
dealt with the issue on the Floor of the House before the restrictions
were lifted, which, sadly, is likely to happen in less than two

sadly—have debated this topic before, at Committee stage. A
month has passed, and a few things have changed. I was the lone
signatory to the amendment at that point, but more than 74 MPs have now
signed it for Report. A few of the facts have probably changed since
then as well; obviously, there was already a petition with more than
150,000 signatories, but since that point, we have learned that despite
the 
<?notus-xml column=294?>Government’s many welcome measures over the course of this
Parliament, net migration rose in the last year, which causes concern
to those of us who are committed to our manifesto promise to reduce
immigration to the tens of thousands. Can that be achieved, especially
if large numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians take advantage of the lack
of restrictions? The Government have made a series of welcome
announcements of policies to tackle immigration. Welfare measures were

John Baron</B> (Basildon and Billericay) (Con):</Member> I congratulate
my hon. Friend on securing this debate, but I put it to him that
perhaps those measures, particularly the changes in benefits, risk
being too little too late. They also risk feeding a minority’s
views and prejudices about immigrants. My experience is that the vast
majority come here to work, and they work hard. They come not because
of the benefits, but because the average salary here is so much higher
than in their home country. Would it not be a better option to extend
the transitional controls and stop people coming in, to give us time to
assimilate those already here? Given that whichever route the
Government take, they will be challenged, they might as well go for the

of migration over the past decade was clearly higher than the country
could cope with. Members of the previous Government are now recognising
that they made mistakes, especially relating to the accession of the A8
countries a decade ago. It is worth reminding ourselves that 5,000 to

perception of people locally that they are taking jobs. The reality is
that many local people simply will not take those jobs; that is why
they are being filled by eastern Europeans. That is the skills gap at
the low end. It is not that there are no jobs; many people locally will
simply not take the jobs, because they do not want to work for such pay

the drivers of the Government’s welfare reforms is to encourage
people to take work if they are offered it; if they choose not to take
work that is available, they do not get the benefits that they would
presumably like to keep. For the welfare reforms to work, however, we
need jobs to be available, so that people can be gently encouraged to
take them, even if they are perhaps not their first choice. If the jobs
that exist are taken by those who have just arrived in this country,
those necessary and important welfare reforms become much harder to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:41:43"></hs_TimeCode>. We must
remember that a first job can be the start of the career ladder; it is
not necessarily the end of it. Encouraging people to take jobs even if
they do not think that they are suited to them, or if the jobs are not
quite what they are after, is perfectly appropriate

shall try to get back to the thread of my argument. Let me set out why
I tabled an amendment in Committee to keep in place transitional
restrictions—and I am grateful that 73 other MPs have chosen to
sign that amendment for Report. Looking at the criteria in the
accession treaties that allowed us and other western European nations
to keep restrictions until the last possible minute, we were allowed
the restrictions, and chose to keep them, because there was still
serious disruption in our employment

ago, the Government commissioned an independent assessment from the
Migration Advisory Committee of whether the test was still being met.
The

pre-recession level of employment was 72.7%; two years ago, that was
down at 70.6%. Unemployment before the recession was 5.1%; two years
ago, it was 7.8%. The claimant count was 3% pre-recession and 4.6% two

Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:43:44"></hs_TimeCode> figures

we need to do more work with them. The last thing that they need is
competition from another wave of immigrants. We also need to look at
the argument about what the level of immigration could do to the

Mills:</Member></B> That is one of those welcome problems, in that we
all want our economy to be growing so strongly that we become a much
more attractive place—but there are clearly down sides in
dealing with the legacies of recession, with unemployment and
especially youth unemployment still far higher than we might like. We
need to get our own people who are struggling into the jobs that growth
generates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

my contention, if the treaty had allowed the restrictions to continue
for a further period, I am in little doubt that we would have wanted to
extend them, if we could, and that brings us to my next point. We
signed that treaty a decade ago, but we had not at that point predicted
a catastrophic recession, which would take many years to recover
from—we are still trying to recover from it—and we had
not appreciated just what the level of immigration from the previous
accession wave would be, which was far in excess of our estimates. I
suspect that had we known those two things when we were signing the
treaty, we would never have agreed to restrictions on those two
countries being lifted so soon or at this point in the economic
cycle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:47:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000038">The
question becomes, does Parliament say, “We have to accept that
we approved the treaty”—it was passed by this
House—or actually do we have the right to say, “With
hindsight, that was a mistake and it is now not in our national
interest to continue with what we agreed”? We need to change
that. Let us simply keep the restrictions already in place for a
further defined period—that is a proportionate response to a
clear problem—at least until our economy is fully recovered from
the shock experienced in the recession. That is not an unreasonable or
disproportionate thing to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:47:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000039">It
is worth noting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:47:55"></hs_TimeCode>
that I was only trying to keep the restrictions that have been in place
since Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU. That would not stop
completely people from those two countries finding work here. If able
to find work in this country and get a work permit, they have been
permitted to work here since they joined the EU—that would not
change. So my suggestion of not lifting restrictions that are already
in place is proportionate at this point. If the Government are not
minded to accept that relatively gentle and proportionate measure, I
sincerely hope that they think again in the two weeks left before the
new year and try to find some other way of keeping the
restrictions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000040">Some
interesting policy ideas have been announced as different ways to
tackle the problem. I was quite attracted by the idea that accession
countries whose gross domestic product per capita is well below the EU
average should not get full access to freedom of movement until their
GDP was nearer the EU average—perhaps three quarters of the
average. That would tackle the issue raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:49:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North West Leicestershire (Andrew Bridgen), because it
would mean that the brightest people in those countries could not

gross national income per capita in both Bulgaria and Romania is about
$16,000, compared with our GNI of $37,000, so those two countries would
fail the test, were we to apply it now. That test is attractive, but
its prospective introduction would not fix the problem that might well
hit us from 1 January. Surely it would therefore be better to keep the
restrictions we have in place while we are trying to achieve those
reforms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000042">The
second idea, which was leaked this week, was to have a cap on EU
migration. Again, that is an attractive idea and one that, I suspect,
would contribute greatly to enabling us to meet our target of net
migration in the tens of thousands, although there would be some
practical issues with enforcing a cap, and I suspect that other EU
member states might not be as keen on the idea. But I find it
intriguing that although it is seemingly impossible 
<?notus-xml column=299?>to try, in response to a clear issue in our
employment market, to keep in place for a bit longer restrictions that
have been allowed until now by the accession treaty, it is thought that
a complete and utter unravelling of freedom of movement—even
between the main western European nations—might be possible. I
am afraid that I am not so optimistic that we could achieve that aim in
a renegotiation; but even if it could, it is a measure for a long time
in the future, not one that can help us out in the coming years if
large amounts of people decide to come here.</hs_Para>

have some questions for the Minister. I understand that Governments
have had their fingers burnt making estimates in the past, but will he
set out whether the Government believe that a large number of people
from Romanian and Bulgaria will try to come to the UK when the
restrictions are lifted? Independent estimates suggest figures of
between 30,000 and 70,000 people a year for the next five years, which
would put the total at something like 350,000. I do not expect an
accurate assessment, but do the Government think that number is way
over the top, is an underestimate or is about right? The people of this
country want to know whether their fears are unrealistic or entirely
realistic.</hs_Para>

nearly all western European nations have kept the restrictions in place
until the last minute, I would presume that those countries fear that
there might be an issue. It is also worth noting that Romania and
Bulgaria will not be joining Schengen on 1 January, as they were meant
to, again because of concerns across Europe about what that might
entail.</hs_Para>

responses to this problem and has outlined some important ideas, but
surely there is one blindingly obvious policy solution that we need to
consider seriously, which is to withdraw this country from the EU
completely. Is it not absurd that people need a visa to come to this
country from Singapore, a country with an incredibly high number of
talented and able people—we would benefit from greater labour
mobility for such people—but we have unrestricted movement of
people from Bulgaria? If we were outside the EU, like Switzerland,
where one in five members of the labour force is a non-Swiss national,
we could benefit from all the advantages of labour mobility and have
all the necessary requirements to control
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000046"><B><Member ContinuationText="Nigel Mills" PimsId="5712" UID="13121969000367" xid="1224" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000367">Nigel

do not think that we can convince the Government to pull us out of the
EU in the next fortnight, and so we probably need to take some
different measures in the meantime. He may have noticed that the
five-year period I am proposing for keeping the restrictions will take
us well past the referendum that we hope will take place on our EU
membership. At that point, the people will have been able to choose
whether they want to stay in and have unrestricted migration or to
leave and reintroduce our border controls. I hope he would agree that a
five-year time frame for keeping the restrictions would be one way of
helping to meet his aspirations in that

between nations rather than a treaty, and, fortunately, one that we are
outside as we were thankfully not required to join. Having had a
pleasant meeting with the Bulgarian ambassador in a TV studio not that
long ago, I know that there is some annoyance among those nations
because they feel that they have met the criteria for Schengen but are
not being permitted to join it. There were some strong quotes from Mr

the newspapers can see. I have already mentioned the <I>Daily

problem will not arise or to take some action to protect our employment
market and protect those people in our constituencies who are
struggling to find work. The only realistic answer is to keep
proportionate restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians in place for a

Dorries (in the Chair):</Member></B> Order. Gentlemen, we have
permission to impose time limits on speeches in this debate, but if
everybody keeps their remarks to about 15 minutes in length I hope that
we will not need to do so. The wind-up speeches will begin at 4
o’clock, so if Members keep to that 15-minute guideline we will
not need to impose any limits, but if speeches take longer
we will have to impose a limit of eight to 10
minutes.</hs_Para>

Vaz</B> (Leicester East) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship for the first time today, Ms Dorries. I welcome
the measured way in which the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel
Mills) put his case. I congratulate him and the hon. Members for
Wellingborough (Mr Bone), for Kettering (Mr Hollobone), for Bury St
Edmunds (Mr Ruffley) and for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) on applying to
the Backbench Business Committee for this debate. It is good to see so
many people here in Westminster Hall on the day that the House rises,
but what a pity it is that the debate is not being held in the Chamber
itself, where we could have had an even longer and more detailed
debate.</hs_Para>

Newmark:</Member></B> I respect the fact that the right hon. Gentleman
is here, but I find it strange that an enormous amount of Conservative
Members are here to discuss this important issue. I cannot believe that
the issue is of concern only to those Members of Parliament who 
<?notus-xml column=301?>happen to be Conservatives or to their constituents. Surely there are
Labour MPs with the same concerns, so why have they not joined him here
today?</hs_Para>

Vaz:</Member></B> The remit of the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee
does not extend to controlling the diaries of members of the
parliamentary Labour party, but it is their loss: I think it is
important that we should be here participating in this
debate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121969000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000055">We should
start by acknowledging the strong and important relations that we have
with Bulgaria and Romania. I visited both countries while I was
Minister for Europe, when we started the enlargement process. The
ambassadors representing the two countries here are excellent, as are
our ambassadors in Sofia and Bucharest; in particular, I want to
acknowledge the way in which Martin Harris, our ambassador in
Bucharest, is ensuring that good relations between our two countries
are fostered even at this challenging time.</hs_Para>

Affairs Committee has been looking at the issue of the transitional
restrictions for a number of years and has made a number of
recommendations. Earlier this year, with the hon. Member for Rochester
and Strood (Mark Reckless), who is currently sitting on my
right, and the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison), I went
to Bucharest to meet members of the Romanian Government and to talk
with members of the Romanian community. If there are regrets—I
have a few regrets in my speech—my primary regret is that the
Immigration Minister and the Home Secretary have not taken the
opportunity over the past year to go to Romania and Bulgaria and engage
with those Governments. We talk about push and pull factors—why
it is people decide to travel all the way from Bucharest or Sofia to
live in Leicester, London or Manchester—and we should have
worked with other Governments to find out the problems and look at the
issues.</hs_Para>

in response to the hon. Member for North West Leicestershire (Andrew
Bridgen), the hon. Member for Amber Valley referred to the number of
talented people leaving Romania and Bulgaria. When we were in
Bucharest, we spoke with the president of the Romanian equivalent of
the British Medical Association. He lamented the fact that so many
talented young Romanian doctors had decided to leave Romania to work in
the United Kingdom and in other countries—on average they
trebled or even quadrupled their salaries when they came to our
countries—which was having a detrimental effect on Romania and
Bulgaria. That is why I wish that the Home Secretary and the
Immigration Minister had visited, because they would have been able to
establish a dialogue and try to see what we could have done to help
those
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:00:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000058">One
way in which we could have helped was in respect of the huge amount of
money that was allocated to Romania when it joined the European Union.
It may surprise Members to note that 87% of the £20 billion that
was given to Romania in pre-accession funds have still not been
accessed, because sufficient assistance is not being given to the
Romanian Government to ensure that they get the funds. If those funds
were accessed, the jobs that people seek to find here might have been
made available in those countries.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:01:07"></hs_TimeCode>Across the
House, we all support the enlargement of the European Union; I cannot
remember an occasion in the past 26 years when any party has voted
against enlargement. We allow 
<?notus-xml column=302?>countries to join the European Union, but then we leave them on their
own. Our Ministers should have engaged more—under the previous
Government and under this Government—to ensure that there was
proper access to those funds.</hs_Para>

big question that remains unanswered is why we still do not have
estimates of how many people will come here next year. On 21 October
2008, the then shadow Immigration Minister, the right hon. Member for
Ashford (Damian Green), said that one of the greatest failures of the
last Government was the failure to predict the consequences of
enlargement in 2004. Given that, research should have been conducted so
that we would be aware—at least have estimates—of the
numbers that would be coming into this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:02:19"></hs_TimeCode>. For the
reasons outlined
by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:02:20"></hs_TimeCode> the hon.
Member for Amber Valley—the pressure on housing, on schools and
on the health service—if we had even estimates it would be
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:02:26"></hs_TimeCode>. When we
went to Bucharest, we came across a university that had conducted
research and had produced estimates. It is very remiss of this
Government not to have done the
same<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:02:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000060"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Bridgen" PimsId="5593" UID="13121969000375" xid="1220" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000375">Andrew
Bridgen:</Member></B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the
people most vulnerable to the next wave of mass immigration are not the
people in this room? They are previous immigrants, particularly the
last wave of immigrants. Competition for jobs, housing and public
services will be intense, particularly in inner city areas such as his
constituency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:03:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Keith Vaz" PimsId="4426" UID="13121969000376" xid="614" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000376">Keith
Vaz:</Member></B> They are intense, but I think we can deal with such
issues. It is right that in the first wave of enlargement, a million
people came, but a lot of those people have returned. We will come on
to benefits later, but what upsets people more than anything else is
the issue of those who, for example, claim benefits in the United
Kingdom—38,000 from the EU—yet their children live in
other EU countries. There are simple changes that we could make to
satisfy our constituents, because I do not believe that the Romanians
and Bulgarians who will come to this country are coming to go on
benefits. They are coming to work. The migration process is for that
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:03:50"></hs_TimeCode>. Last
week, the Select Committee had before it the chairman of the Migration
Advisory Committee. We specifically asked Sir David Metcalf whether the
Government asked him and his committee to conduct research into the
number of people coming into this country after 31 December. He
specifically said no. He said that they are set their homework by the
Government, and the Government did not ask them to do that. I think
that that is big mistake. We have estimates of annual migration that
vary from 10,000, according to the Bulgarian ambassador; 20,000,
according to the Romanian ambassador; and 50,000, according to
Migration Watch. We have such problems because the Government were not
prepared to ask the very body they
established<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:04:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:04:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000062"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T13:59:51"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Mr Christopher Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="13121969000377" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000377"><B>Mr
Christopher Chope</B> (Christchurch) (Con):</Member> On the issue of
changing the benefits system, does the right hon. Gentleman agree that
it is difficult to contemplate the Government making changes when, at
the moment, they do not even have data on the nationality of individual
claimants? Back in January this year, I was told in answer to a
parliamentary question that the UK’s benefit 
<?notus-xml column=303?>payment systems do not record details of claimants’ nationality.

would have liked figures. Now that we have the former Foreign
Secretary’s mea culpas on the issue of estimates, it is
important that we have them, even though there are only 12 days to go.
So the first issue is estimates. The second is the confusion about what
will happen on 1 January. According to the permanent secretary Mark
Sedwill in evidence to us last week, Olympic-style arrangements are
being put in place at 
<?notus-xml column=304?>our airports from 1 January onwards. As far as I am concerned, that is

what will he achieve by going to an airport? He can see people coming

how they will proceed after 31 December and see whether, because I do

makes a very good point. He is right to say that Bulgarians and
Romanians can come here if they satisfy the current requirements. I am
absolutely in favour of continuing with that. The problem—it is
a good point that he brings up, and it is one that I was moving on
to—is that in Bulgaria the minimum wage is 73p an hour, and in
Romania it is 79p, but in the UK the minimum wage is £6.31 for
over-21s—nearly 10 times more than in Romania and Bulgaria.
Bulgaria and Romania are two of the poorest members of the EU and do
experience, I am afraid, levels of corruption.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:22:26"></hs_TimeCode> 2010, gross
domestic product per capita was £3,929 in Bulgaria and
£4,682 in Romania, compared with Britain’s
£22,426. Furthermore, there are 1.5 million people seeking work
in Bulgaria and
Romania<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:22:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000103">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:22:51"></hs_TimeCode>

Immigration Bill can go before it is incompatible with EU law and the
free movement of people. We are therefore left in a preposterous
scenario in which the EU is trying to control not only who can come

worry about all the different arrangements, but we should be able to
say to people from the EU, “No, you cannot come in unless we say
so.” As the right hon. Member for Leicester East said, this goes
back to the fundamental issue of whether we can get that control and
still remain in the European Union. If we do not take decisive action
now to control who settles in the UK, the figure will only rise. If we

Hollobone:</Member></B> My hon. Friend needed to pay more attention to
the presentation. The estimate is 30,000 to 70,000 a year, with a
central estimate of an increase of 50,000 a year in the population for
five years, as the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:41:59"></hs_TimeCode>right hon.
Member for Leicester East said. The estimate is based in part on the
precedent set by the A8, but also on the growth rate of the current
Romanian and Bulgarian population in the UK and the number of national
insurance numbers issued, as well as the disparity in incomes and
living standards between the UK and Romania and Bulgaria. My
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:42:31"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Friend the
Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood) will appreciate that the
disparity between us and Romania and Bulgaria is rather bigger than the
one between us and Poland.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:42:31"></hs_TimeCode> Romanian or
Bulgarian moving to the UK to work at the minimum wage could increase
his take-home pay by four and a half to five times, after accounting
for the cost of living. Families could increase their income by between
eight and nine times. To put it another way, workers on the minimum
wage in the UK could earn in one hour roughly what could be
earned in a day in Romania or
Bulgaria.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000137">There
are other factors to consider. Spain and Italy, where unemployment is
now very high, especially among the young, have
n<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:43:11"></hs_TimeCode>early one
million Romanian and Bulgarian workers each. A worker from Romania or
Bulgaria could increase his take home pay in Spain or Italy by at least
50% if he or she were to move to the UK. Another serious issue, to
which I have not had a satisfactory response from the Minister despite
raising it on the Floor of the House, is that Romania is known to have
issued some 600,000 passports to ethnic Romanians from Moldova. Moldova
is not a member of the European Union and yet a significant proportion
of its population has the right to move to, live in and work in the UK.
I am sure that that was never the intention of the accession treaties.
The number of ethnic Roma from Romania and Bulgaria who might migrate
is another factor to consider, but the numbers are extremely uncertain.
Substantial numbers of Roma people live in poor conditions in a number
of EU countries. An estimated 2.5 million Roma live in Romania and
Bulgaria.</hs_Para>

The announcement was good, but do the measures also apply to tax

new three-month rule for entitlement to out-of-work benefits extend to
people from other EU member states or only to those from the new

concern. To put the issue into a pithy sentence, I would say that we
are importing a wave of crime from Romania and Bulgaria. I put it as

two-year prison sentence or a sentence of 12 months or more for an
offence involving drugs, violence or sexual crime. We should be able to
deport any foreign national, whether from an EU or non-EU state, to
their country of origin if they are convicted of any crime in this
country. That is one thing on which I agree with the

am delighted to participate in this important debate. It has been very
interesting so far and I very much look forward to hearing what the
Minister has to say in response to many of the points that have been
made. However, a myth can be halfway round the world before the truth
has got its boots on, so I welcome the opportunity this debate gives to
add some facts and figures, and indeed corrections, to some of the
quite barmy assumptions that have been made in the wider

wish to challenge a couple of the points that have been made already
today. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T14:54:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Clacton (Mr Carswell), who is no longer in his
place, suggested that we should adopt Switzerland’s immigration
policy, or that our relationship with the EU should be that of
Switzerland. Well, read any of the Swiss newspapers or visit
Switzerland, and guess what the key issue is for the Swiss? It is
immigration, and the numbers of immigrants into that country are
proportionally much higher than they are for the UK.</hs_Para>

right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz) is also no longer in
his place; I do not know why people decided to depart just as I got to
my feet. He made some interesting points about jobs. That issue needs
to be clarified, because it is very much the case that Romanians and
Bulgarians can work here. First, they have the right to travel here
visa-free and, secondly, they can indeed work here, whether they are
self-employed, have particular expertise—as doctors, nurses and
so forth—or participate in agricultural work. There are
restrictions in place, of course, for temporary work permits, and there
are quota schemes, to allow low-skilled workers to come here too.

understand that the biggest group of foreign nationals who helped to
build the Olympic stadium actually came from Romania. Apparently, there
were more Romanians working on that stadium than people of any other

am not arguing that more or fewer Romanians and Bulgarians should come
here. I am simply saying that this important aspect of the debate on
immigration needs to be considered in a sensible and measured way. We
need to have a policy that is not determined by fear. I genuinely worry
that the debate around immigration—to mention this is to slip
slightly into a bigger debate on whether we should be in or out of the
EU—has become very binary. It is the little Englanders, if you
like, versus the multicultural open-door approach, but I would argue
that in many cases that does not apply, by any stretch of the
imagination.</hs_Para>

these brackets. I am saying that they are wrong and it does not help

wonderful part of Great Britain that very much reflects the national

the Member for Braintree (Mr Newmark), who is sadly no longer in his

from the administrative errors, pressures on housing, benefits and
health services, and so on, as he implies, the scale of migration in
the last decade has 
<?notus-xml column=320?>challenged the very Britishness of some communities—what defines
us: our values; our culture; who we are. Of course, that is an evolving
thing and measured migration can be absorbed into it, but when
overloaded—when diasporas move here on such a large
scale—there is such an impact that it can be unmanaged, in that
sense, and have a negative impact on those who are already
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:08:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000180">Let
us not slip away from what Labour did in the last decade that was so
wrong. It introduced eight Acts of Parliament, but it had no control
over immigration despite those and illegal immigrants were free to
abuse our state services. Migration from non-EU member states also
increased during that time. Indeed, twice as many came from non-EU
countries as EU countries. I hope that the Minister will confirm that
that is
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000181">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:08:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>
the five years leading up to the economic downturn—this is the
real message—more than 90% of the increase in employment was
accounted for by foreign nationals. We were creating jobs in this
country and giving them to people from overseas. That cannot be right.
To put that another way, one in 10 new jobs was given to a British
person. I am pleased to say that that is not the case today with the
1.1 million new private sector jobs that have been
created<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:09:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:09:11"></hs_TimeCode> compound
matters, employers targeted eastern European countries, to pay less
than the minimum wage. In 2009, for example, 2,000 firms were fined for
doing this. Thanks to stricter rules, that figure has now
fallen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000182"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:09:31"></hs_TimeCode>Another
area of abuse was student visas, and we felt the impact in Bournemouth
too. Bogus students were attending bogus colleges, but, thankfully,
that has also now stopped. International education is clearly
important, with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
estimating that it is worth £8 billion. It is important to get
our approach right, and given the importance of language schools to
Bournemouth, people there expect us

Labour’s biggest failure was failing to inspire a younger
generation to work. Thanks to the something-for-nothing culture, a
skills gap developed. If it does not pay to work, or if British people
lack the necessary skills, that creates a huge space in our labour
market for people from overseas to fill. We cannot blame people for
wanting to come here and work hard, but the real answer lies in
training our own people to fill these jobs.

originally had, I think, 17 different stages that could be put to
appeal. In addition, it will oblige temporary immigrants seeking to
stay longer than six months to pay a surcharge on their visa to cover
NHS costs, should they use the health service. Finally, it will tackle
sham marriages, to which more than 10,000 visa applications were linked

three months. If, after those three months, an EU

Migrants will also be able to claim for only a maximum of six months
unless they can prove they have a genuine prospect of employment. In

no faith in what can be achieved, but I believe that, for the first
time in many years, Britain is taking the lead in the EU, and British
influence is increasing. Labour gave away our opt-out and our fishing
rights, and it opened our borders when Germany, France and others
decided to keep theirs closed. In contrast, this Government have
managed to secure a trade deal with South Korea, and there is a trade
deal with America in the offing. We have also had the first

things came about not just because of agreement in Europe, but because
they were British-led initiatives. When we decide to step forward and
we understand what is going on, other nations around Europe follow us.
I am not sure Labour particularly understood that, and nor, if we are
fair, did this Government. We can influence the direction of travel in
Europe; we do not have to leave that to France and Germany, and we
should not have an attitude that says we should. If we do leave things
to them, and we do not affect the decisions that are made upstream

23,000 workers from Romania and Bulgaria have come to this country in
the past 12 months, under the existing rules; they have
been able to come if they are self-employed or work in
agriculture, or, equally, if they can get a work permit to do a job
that the UK Border Agency thinks cannot otherwise be done by an
indigenous British worker. They certainly like coming to
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:22:35"></hs_TimeCode>; 23,000

also know from the statistics that there are now 135,000 Romanians and
Bulgarians working in the UK, which compares with a 1997 figure of

persuasive evidence that people in that part of south-east Europe

Friend is correct in suspecting that London will be a huge magnet for
Romanians and Bulgarians. There are perfectly understandable reasons
for them to want to come to this country, and many will no doubt want
to work hard. Perhaps some will take jobs illegally under the minimum
wage level of £6 an hour. We do not criticise those individuals

mentioned. Italy did not have transitional controls, and there are 1
million Romanians and Bulgarians there. Spain and Germany did, and
500,000 Romanians and Bulgarians went to Germany and 1 million to
Spain. I do not say that that is conclusive, but it may be one aspect
of what was meant when it was suggested that there is a range of

try their luck in the United Kingdom, where, if they do their research,
they will understand there are many job vacancies that remain unfilled,
despite the economic recovery, and that there could be rich job

am getting rather tired with the argument that all immigration to this

a 2008 report of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which
made the point that total output can be driven up by increasing the
number of people in the country. The greater the population, the
greater the economic growth. That is an economic truism that no one
disputes. However, the Committee also said that that was beside the
point. What matters is not GDP, but GDP per capita. A much

there is a bigger cake; but there are also more people who want a slice

generate more economic growth; it is about getting the right people in,
with the skills and specialisms that we need. That, almost by
definition, means small numbers of immigrants, who will meet a
high-skill, high-value-added specification—not tens or even
hundreds of thousands, as there were in the case of Poland and other

Another grossly inadequate body, in my view, is the Office for Budget

we will not cut our deficit and our national debt. Those figures are
“Through the Looking Glass” stuff. I repeat again that
the current Home Office Ministers understand that truth, but they are

employment is now at an all-time high. In the past, as the number of
job vacancies increased, the response from employers in this country
would have been to increase wages to attract the best workers. When the

levels in the UK have been fairly flat recently, but since 2004, wages

Paying below the minimum wage is, of course, illegal, but it is
certainly anecdotally true that many immigrants do not have a tendency
to inform the authorities that they are receiving £3 or

million young people not in employment or training, it is imperative
that they are given a chance to get on the work ladder. The route to
proper employment has to start somewhere, and 1 million young people in
our country are not doing anything at all. It is fairly inevitable that

that the European Court of Justice is now considering our habitual
residence test, which is a modest control over access to benefits? We
might hope that the European Union was moderating its view and becoming
more reasonable about our country’s rights to decide who should

as I heard in this room yesterday when I was in the Chair, our
constituents are complaining about numbers of rough sleepers and
homeless people, shortages of housing and of school places,
particularly in primary schools, and pressure on hospitals. We have
heard today about the pressure on the criminal detection and
enforcement agencies, because of the propensity of certain groups of
Romanians to engage in low-level crime. We have problems with building
on green-belt land and so on. So many of these problems are associated
with the fact that we are allowing this country’s population to
rise far faster and to a greater extent than the people want. We are a
small island. We are the most densely populated part of the European
Union. Enough is enough. We are now facing large numbers of additional
people coming to our country and we can do nothing about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0001.htm#13121969000231">Most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:45:28"></hs_TimeCode>

this, one is normally surprised at the information that comes from the
brilliant researchers in our House of Commons Library. I will close by
drawing attention to the disparity that they have identified between
the number of people estimated to have come from Bulgaria and Romania
on one criterion—the one that the Government use—which
says that net migration averages at fewer than 10,000 since 2007, and
on another, which shows that the increase has been 25,000 a year or
148,000 in total over that period. The helpful Library note also refers

the Government have taken a lot of action on immigration, much of which
is in the detail of what has been done—I credit both Ministers
for their work in that area—I am concerned that in several key
areas we have relaxed what we should have done and perhaps originally
intended to do. One such area was the number of people whom we allow in
on inter-company transfers. When the Prime Minister went to India, he
came under pressure, from Liberal Democrats and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T15:49:19"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State for Business, Innovation and Skills, to put in place this
loophole whereby people with incomes of down to the £24,000 or
£30,000 level are allowed to come in for a certain period but
then leave, and other people come in and also earn below the proper cap
for inter-company transfers. That has put people in the IT industry in
particular under intense pressure in terms of holding down wages in
that sector and, I fear, has also increased the number of people in the
country.</hs_Para>

is post-study work, which expanded under the Labour Government. As far
as I can see, anyone can come here and do any course, and then stay on
and work afterwards, or indeed while they are doing the course, with
few if any questions asked. I was delighted when the Home Office said
that it would get rid of that, but unfortunately it was then watered
down under pressure from universities and, as ever, the Liberal
Democrats. I would love to hear from the Minister whether they signed
up to that policy, and whether it is a Government policy.</hs_Para>

that anyone who comes here and gets a degree from a university can stay
on and work. We are subsidising our university sector through our
immigration 
<?notus-xml column=330?>policy. The Government go on as though everyone else does it, but they
do not. I studied in America, and it is difficult to stay on there
afterwards. I think only Australia has a more obviously generous system
than we do. Our universities should compete on the basis of their
academic excellence, not on the basis of “If you come and study
with us rather than with some other competitor, you’ll be able
to stay on and work in the British labour market, and potentially stay
on for ever thereafter.” The fact that we have allowed that
loophole makes net migration higher than it otherwise would be, and we
are further from hitting our target.</hs_Para>

was 214,000. So net migration has been cut by just under 15%, which is
barely one seventh, not more than one third, but I promised my

Minister to <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> in which he seems—perhaps
I am wrong—to set aside that target. He seems to accept, or at
least suggest, that the immigration target might not be hit, because we
are taking in more people from the European Union. If we are not going
to hit the target, as we promised our electors we would, we should
change policy to ensure that we do hit it, either by getting rid of
loopholes for Indian IT workers, post-study work or numerous others I

be bound to apply that law, as will our judges. If Romanians and
Bulgarians come to this country and take employment contrary to that

important issues that we need to reflect on, and I welcome the
opportunity to do so.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:00:09"></hs_TimeCode> particular, I

a similar debate on his new clause in the Immigration Bill in Committee

the Leader of the Opposition has said, that we made some mistakes in
2004. Those mistakes had consequences; we should have interrogated the
numbers further and we should have looked at the possible impact both
culturally and economically over that time. I know that the combination
of immigration and inadequate labour standards in many cases meant that
there was a pressure on wages and employment; some of the jobs that
came into the country through economic growth were taken by people from
outside the United Kingdom. I know from my own constituency in north

cultural issues, because of that

Only yesterday, I was pleased to see the Prime Minister—again, I
give credit when it is due—visiting a raid on a beds-in-sheds
encampment in Southall. One aspect of immigration that greatly upsets
my constituents in north Wales is when individuals share properties in
squalid conditions and so are able to undercut wages locally, because
the low standard of their accommodation means they do not have the
outgoings that other people have. We also wish to look at extending
legislation on gangmasters. It is perfectly reasonable to

Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and Britain now sit in the same chamber to

Chappelle in 1915 and at the Somme in 1916, and in Sinai in 1917. He
was fighting people who now sit in the same Parliament here and
elsewhere in Europe. That is good for the stability of Europe. Perhaps
I made a slip, but the point I am making is that the stability we have
gained, through a wider economic union and through shared social

student immigration, tourism and business investment. There may not
actually be that many people coming from Bulgaria and Romania in
January at all—whether to claim benefits or to work—but
the danger is that today’s debate could send a signal that
Britain is closed for business, when there is a positive case to be
made for some aspects of immigration and for managed migration.
However, we need to have controlled migration, to remove people who are
here illegally and to ensure that we have strong borders. We also need
to ensure that we deport foreign criminals, as the hon. Member for

will not spend a great deal of time being partisan—that is not
my natural way—but I want to make a couple of points. Part of
the reason for the concern that our constituents have—a number
of hon. Members touched on this—is the record of the previous
Government, and the fact that they did not put transitional controls in
place for the previous accession of new EU member states. Of course,
the important thing was not just that we did not have them, but that we
were the only significant country that did not have them. That was the
reason for the very significant influx then, and that is a different
position from the one that we face
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:16:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0002.htm#13121969000293">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:16:14"></hs_TimeCode>

sorry, but it is, of course, the hardest word, and he could not quite
bring himself to say it. Interestingly, the Opposition have never said
that they accept that they made any mistake on non-EU immigration. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:16:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood) said, that was twice as
large—twice as many people came from outside the EU—and
it was completely controllable, as there were no issues about free
movement. The Labour Government also messed that up, but not
only have we heard no apology for that, we have not even heard an
acknowledgement that it was a mistake. Perhaps in due course that
statement will arrive; we wait with bated

other thing that we have been criticised for is not taking action
previously. The shadow Home Secretary,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:17:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

criticised us for not having made changes
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:17:09"></hs_TimeCode> the benefits

Member for Delyn will leap up and correct me if I am wrong, but I do
not recall either of them acknowledging at any point, while he was at
the Home Office or she was the Secretary of State for Work and

frankly, do I recall them doing anything about it. We are being
criticised by the Opposition for not having taken any steps when our

Friend to say more, I will just observe this: we were not, as we have

hon. Friend the Member for Stockton South (James Wharton). The right
hon. Member for Delyn is a little isolated: the only Labour Members who
were here today, aside from him, are in favour of a referendum on our
EU membership, want us to renegotiate that membership, and were willing
to vote for that excellent Bill. Perhaps he should reflect on that and
think about whether it might be more sensible for the Labour party to
change its official position to support the Prime Minister when he
leads that renegotiation after we win the general election with a
Conservative majority Government, and then support us when we put that
new position to the people.</hs_Para>

The reduction is now nearly a third, rather than over a third.
Non-European economic area migration is at its lowest level for 14
years, and is back to the level that it was at when we were last in

progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121969000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0002.htm#13121969000299"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Reckless" PimsId="5627" UID="13121969000476" xid="1136" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/halltext/131219h0002.htm#13121969000476">Mark

Harper:</Member></B> It depends on the sort of visa applications. Some
people coming to Britain do not count as immigrants, because they are
not here for a long enough period of time. I will have to check the
information, but my understanding is that our visa numbers suggest that
the downward trend on non-EU migration will continue, based on our
reforms. It is right to say—this goes to the heart of the
debate—that the reason for the increase in the last set of
figures was an increase in migration from the European Union, but not
from eastern Europe. Interestingly, it was from the more traditional
countries—the western European countries, with which there is
not a massive disparity in GDP, although our economy has been rather
more successful than theirs in creating jobs.</hs_Para>

placed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:21:00"></hs_TimeCode>. My hon.
Friend the Member for Bournemouth East made this point strongly, too.
Between 2003 and 2008, when the economy was growing under the previous
Government, more than 90% of employment growth was accounted 
<?notus-xml column=339?>for by foreign nationals. Yes, the economy was
growing under the Opposition, but the benefit was largely going to
people who were not UK citizens—not the people for whom we all
work. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:21:30"></hs_TimeCode>We have

agenda, more rigorous education and more apprenticeships are helping to
make a difference. Since the second quarter of 2010, there has been a
1.1 million net increase in employment, and more than three quarters of
that rise in employment has been accounted for by UK nationals, so the
employment growth that we have seen since we came to power has largely
benefited UK citizens, which is a significant turnaround. It is exactly
what we wanted to achieve, and it is being achieved not only by the
Home Office, but by our policies on immigration, on welfare, and on
apprenticeships, training and education, which are all aligned and
delivering the same outcome. That is significant, and it means that
hundreds of thousands of families in Britain today have somebody in
employment; they would not have had somebody in employment if the
policies followed by the Opposition had continued. That is welcome, and
it is something of which we can be

migration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-19T16:22:45"></hs_TimeCode>. My
hon. Friend the Member for Rochester and Strood referred to the Prime
Minister’s remarks. Just to be clear, he was drawing attention
to the difficulty of the task, particularly given the problems in some
of our western and southern European neighbours’ economies. In
the interview, he reasserted the importance of delivering on our
policy; he was simply drawing attention to the fact that it is a little
more difficult than we had first thought, because of the difficulty in
the European economies, but we are absolutely still committed to the

is worth putting the numbers in context. It is still the case with our
reforms that, even having driven down migration from outside the
European Union, 48% of immigration to Britain is from outside the EU,
compared to 36% from the EU; the remainder are British citizens who
have been overseas for more than a year and are returning to the United
Kingdom. We should remember that many British citizens go to other
European countries. According to the 2010 figures, there were 2.2
million EU nationals in the UK and 1.4 million Brits in EU countries.
Interestingly, only five European Union countries have more than
100,000 citizens in the United Kingdom, and it is not the ones people
might think: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Poland. In the case of
Ireland, there are historical reasons not connected to the EU. Poland

Member for Delyn on this point—that for that Bill to take

had debated the new clause this side of Christmas or the other side of
Christmas, it would have made no difference, because the measure cannot
become law until the Bill progresses through Parliament, and that is
not likely to happen until towards the end of this Session. As the

2007, and the seven-year transitional controls expire at the end of the
year. It is worth being careful about language. We are not lifting
them; they expire. They cease to have any legal effect, because of the
terms of the accession treaties. I am not doing anything to lift them;
they simply become legally ineffective at the end of the year, because

self-employed, self-sufficient or studying. They are already in
Britain. As one or two hon. Members suggested, some people already here
might not entirely be doing what they purport to be doing. They might
be working. We might find that they regularise their status in the new

not whether they can come to Britain. People can come to Britain for
three months,

with more confidence the significance and impact of the risks
identified). Nevertheless, the issues found across Government are
sufficiently important that senior management attention is recommended.

interfere with the jurisdiction of a local planning authority unless it
is necessary to do so. This is because local authority Councillors are
elected to represent the views of local people and, in the main, it is
these Councillors who are in the best position to decide whether a
development should go ahead. In determining a planning application the
local planning authority are required to have regard to all material
considerations including the development plan, national policies and

to rationalise the routes of appeals in family cases and to bring them

the Bowman Report outlined above, the general position in family
proceedings is that appeals from decisions made at district judge level
and below in a county court and High Court are taken away from the
Court of Appeal and routed to a county court or the High Court as the
case may be. The power in section 56 of the Access to Justice Act 1999
has been used to achieve this rerouting (see the Access to Justice
Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals) (Family Proceedings) Order
2011 (S. I.2011 /1044). An order under section 56 is made by

30.4 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010. The general rule is
that the person who brings or seeks to bring the appeal must file the
appellant’s notice at the appeal court within such period as may
be directed by the court which made the decision to be appealed or
where that court does not make a direction, the appellant’s
notice must be filed 21 days after the date of the decision which the
person wishes to appeal. The period for filing the notice by the court
which made the decision to be appealed may be longer or shorter than 21
days. Rule 30.7 provides that an application to vary the
time limit for filing the notice must be made to the appeal court. The
case management powers in Part 4 of the Family Procedure rules give the
court power to extend or shorten the time for compliance with a rule,
practice direction or court order (even if an application for extension
of time is made after the time for compliance has
expired).</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121977000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/petntext/131219p0001.htm#13121977000043">The

appeals rules in a targeted consultation of interested parties between
27 July and 20 September 2013. They are now considering amendments to

to the routes of appeal from decisions of judges as part of the work

of Profession for Statistics gave evidence, both regarding the release
of statistics and the measures in place to ensure these are accurate
and complete. Both hearings were part of routine Parliamentary

record the total costs of military operations. The net additional costs
of military operations in Afghanistan for the financial years 2001-02
to 2012-13 are recorded in the MOD's annual report and accounts for
those years, which are available in the Library of the House. Net
additional costs are those which the Department would not have incurred
had the operation not taken place. The Department's estimate of the net
additional cost of military operations in Afghanistan this year was
published in the MOD's 2013-14 main estimates. The estimate for costs
in 2014-15 will be published in that year's main estimates. In both
cases the final spend will be published in the relevant year's annual

our efforts on gender issues in the international context. We work
closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for
International Development in the production of the UK National Action

the activity across Government and focuses bilateral and multilateral

Optimisation Study (AIOS) indicate that, in the short to medium
timescale (now to 2025), unmanned air systems (UAS) could provide a
capability covering unit and force protection—but not wide area
surveillance—above water. Unmanned wide area surveillance for
anti- submarine warfare (ASW) would be more challenging before 2035.
Further work is needed to understand: the specific capabilities that
could be delivered and how they could be integrated, air worthiness
certification and the affordability of such systems. The next phase of
the AIOS will consider the role of UAS in order to inform decisions
leading up to and part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review
planned in 2015.</hs_Para>

bringing down the cost of operating prisons. We propose to make
significant cost reductions over the next few years through the

are a number of factors that affect the number of assault incidents at

the size of the population held at the prison, the type and role of the
prison and the gender of the prisoners accommodated. For example,
younger, male prisoners are more likely to be involved in an assault
than other prisoners. Differences in population size of establishments
mean it would not necessarily be correct to conclude that a prison with
a higher number of incidents than the average is a less safe prison;
nor that a prison with a lower number of incidents than the average is
a safer
prison.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121979000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/text/131219w0001.htm#13121979000183">In

export animals for further fattening or for slaughter are subject to
inspection by Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA)
inspectors at the premises of departure, with the exception of one
vehicle that had to be inspected at the port in September (see
following table). To re-inspect vehicles which have already been
subject to inspection would not be proportionate. However, a proportion
of these vehicles are selected for a check by AHVLA inspectors on
arrival at Dover port to ensure that there are no overt signs of
welfare problems or technical faults with the vehicle that may have
occurred during the journey to the port. Up to 15 December 39 vehicles

2050 pathways calculator helps to engage a range of audiences with
energy and climate issues. This is a simple, user-friendly model of the
UK's energy system, launched in 2010, which allows a wide variety of
people to explore the full range of options to meet the UK's 2050
carbon reduction target and is based on rigorous scientific evidence.
People can use this open-source tool to see the impact of a range of
changes in the energy sector, and expert users can explore the full
detail of the calculations.</hs_Para>

make it easier for children and young people to use, DECC launched the
My2050 educational online game in March 2011. This is a visual internet
simulation that helps people imagine how the energy system may evolve

encourages users to submit their preferred '2050 pathway'. Over 17,000
pathways have been submitted to date.</hs_Para>

Network Rail’s performance shows a clear link between
under-performance on maintaining infrastructure and the recent level of

from April 2014, ORR has set new regulatory targets for Network Rail.
These focus on how Network Rail manages, maintains and renews the

to devolve Greater Anglia (West Anglia) services from Chingford to
Liverpool Street, Enfield Town to Liverpool Street and Cheshunt to
Liverpool Street (via Southbury) to Transport for London (TfL). This
change is currently scheduled to take place in summer 2015. There are
no firm plans at the present time to devolve further rail services to
the Mayor and TfL, but we are reviewing with TfL the future operation
of Ealing to Greenford and Romford to Upminster services and how these

poverty. Relative low income is one measure, and is used in the
Households Below Average Income National Statistics publication.

McVey:</Member></B> Short-term benefit advances and universal credit
advances are available to support claimants to meet day to day
expenses, normally whilst the claimant is waiting for their first
benefit payment. To be offered an advance there must be a likelihood
that benefit will be paid and the claimant must be in financial need
(defined as a serious risk of damage to the health or safety of the
claimant or a member of his family). These advances are not a specific
benefit or a separate scheme like the Social Fund and the process
reflects this. Where the claimant tells us they are in financial need
then DWP staff will consider an advance where appropriate. This will
most commonly happen at the new claims stage when DWP staff are
discussing with the claimant what will happen next. In universal credit
this discussion can include budgeting
advice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121981000588" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/text/131219w0003.htm#13121981000588">A
budgeting advance is an advance of benefit that may be available to
universal credit claimants on low income who have been claiming
universal credit, or a qualifying legacy benefit, continuously for six
months or more in order to meet an intermittent need or expense. This
could include buying essential items like furniture. Where the expense
is linked to obtaining or retaining employment, such as paying up-front
childcare costs, the six month qualifying period may be waived.
Information about claiming Budgeting Advances is available with other
budgeting advice on the DWP universal credit website and the GOV.UK

the Government of Guatemala on the trial of Efrain Rios Montt. However,
the UK recognises the historical significance of this case and has
worked closely with EU member states in Brussels and in Guatemala City
to monitor its progress. UK representatives also joined EU colleagues
in observing trial proceedings and have engaged in discussions with
prosecution lawyers. In April, prior to the initial conviction, the
spokesperson of the EU High Representative issued a statement on behalf
of member states reiterating our willingness to assist Guatemalan
national efforts to combat impunity and emphasising the need for trials
to be independent, impartial and fair. Following the announcement that
the trial will resume in 2015, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will
continue to monitor the case and will consider a joint EU response to
any future
developments.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13121981000091" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/text/131219w0003.htm#13121981000091">Occupied

identify a corresponding cut in regulation elsewhere with the same
