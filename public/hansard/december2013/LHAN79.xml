has been made. The controlled approach to the reassessment of
recipients of disability living allowance began only on 28 October
2013. There is not enough information yet to assess the effect this

Wigley (PC):</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister recall that
exactly 12 months ago his department estimated that by 2018 there would
be 428,000 fewer enhanced mobility claimants aged 16 to 64 on the new
PIP system, compared with the old system? Does he appreciate the
anxiety this has caused to those dependent on these payments to finance
their Motability vehicles? Will he update the House on the latest
position, and do everything in his power to lift the threat felt by
those people whose degree of disability almost certainly will mean that
they should not lose their Motability entitlement but who, until they
know, will inevitably fear the
worst?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312023000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="1312023000197" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000197">Lord
Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I emphasise that we are looking to create
a thorough assessment under PIP that is balanced and also looks after
some of the gaps in DLA, particularly concerning people with mental
health problems, who have not done as well under DLA as they should do
under PIP. With regard to the concerns about the transition, we are
working with Motability to put together a package of £2,000 per
person for those who move off the enhanced DLA but not into PIP so that
they can purchase a second-hand car at the appropriate
time.</hs_para>

Thomas of Winchester (LD):</Member></B> Will my noble friend tell me
why his department took no notice of the responses to the 11th-hour
consultation on the key moving-about descriptor in the PIP assessment?
This descriptor enables a claimant to have enough points for the
enhanced rate of mobility, which opens the door to the Motability car.
Responses to the consultation were overwhelmingly against what the
Government have proposed. I wonder why they bothered to have the
consultation if they are not going to take any notice of
it.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, nearly 30% of those who
get enhanced mobility payments turn them into a Motability car, so
approximately 100,000 to 120,000 people stand to lose their car. We 
<?notus-xml column=3?>know that when they go to appeal, 60% win their appeal but in the
process, given the time it takes, they will have lost their car before
having the additional expense of starting all over again. Will the

their car until the appeal has been heard?</hs_para>

going through. It is difficult to draw a line between people with
enhanced mobility and those on Motability. That is one of the things
that we will be looking at as we do this review, which will report
towards the end of next year—before large volumes of people are
due to go in, so we will be able to look at this

disaster, the bedroom tax is hitting them, disabled kids have had their

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, we are handling an extraordinarily
difficult economic and financial position. As noble Lords are of course
aware, we have had a decline in GDP of 7.2% from its peak in 2008-09.
That is more or less the same level as what happened in the 
<?notus-xml column=4?>1930s. Handling that decline has been enormously difficult and one of
the most interesting things about the way we have handled it generally
is that, unlike every other developed country, we have spread the
inevitable difficulties across the whole economy, rather than, as
elsewhere, the poor being hit far worse than the rich. That has not
happened in the adjustment that we have made in this
country.</hs_para>

the reply, and for letting me have sight of it before today. He will be
aware of the force-level formula which relates build rates to the
planned life of a warship. Although this Answer undoubtedly raises a
whole raft of questions, not least those relating to manpower and
shipbuilding, I want to focus on just one. Have we really decided that
this great maritime nation of ours needs only 13 frigates? Only four
years ago, 18 was considered too risky; at the time of the Falklands,
we had 40. Has there been a realistic, in-depth study of the
requirement for the number of frigates—I am talking about
frigates, not destroyers or 
<?notus-xml column=5?>other things—or is the number 13 based purely on an arbitrary
cost figure? In the final analysis, defence of the
nation is the top priority for any Government of whatever hue, and I
believe that we are standing into

That is why we are undertaking the Type 26 global combat ship

around 2020, and the programme will help sustain surface warship
capability in the United Kingdom after the construction of the

one of the ideas that have been put forward. However the noble Lord
will be aware that humanitarian corridors are not defined in
international law and, although there have been some successes in the
past, such corridors require all parties to agree to their
establishment. In the absence of such agreement, establishing these
zones usually requires foreign military intervention, which is not on
the table at the moment. The noble Lord will also be aware that
humanitarian corridors and safe areas have not always worked in the
past. A case that comes immediately to mind is the Srebrenica genocide,
which occurred in a safe

is to ensure that we alleviate humanitarian suffering. The second is to
prevent Assad from using chemical weapons on his own people again.
However, this is against a backdrop of finding a political solution
that brings the conflict to an end. It is good that the date of 22
January 2014 has now been set for Geneva 2. In relation to
Iran, parties to Geneva 2 are those that have formally endorsed the
Geneva communiqué. Iran has not yet done so publicly. There is a

which is all about coming forward with a proposal to establish a
transitional governing body. This has to be done with mutual consent,
so the regime must play its role. However, it seems incredibly
unrealistic to expect real progress in Syria if Assad has any role in a
body that has full executive powers and, therefore, control over the
military, security and intelligence apparatus. Large parts of Syria do
not accept him or expect him to play such a
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312023000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000045"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T14:59:29"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Boothroyd" PimsId="4075" UID="1312023000239" xid="1541" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000239">Baroness

international stage. We pushed and worked with the noble Baroness on
the UN Security Council presidential statement during the UN General
Assembly meeting in October this year. That asked specifically for
humanitarian agencies to have immediate, unfettered access to all parts
of Syria. Therefore, the establishment of a humanitarian corridor is
part of a process; it is one of a number of options that could bring
that about. However, first and foremost it is about having unfettered
access. We have access to all 14 governorate regions of Syria, but
unfortunately not to all the populations within those regions.

takes us to Clause 69, Chapter 3, on the “Closure of premises
associated with nuisance or disorder”. The heading ends with
“etc”. We have talked quite a lot about the
“etc” in this Bill. I am concerned in these amendments
with who may be affected by a closure order. For instance, Clause 69(1)
provides that there may be a closure notice

closure notice will prohibit access by everyone, essentially, subject
to some particularities. It occurred to me that premises that may well
be affected are pubs, which very often have staff living in them. There
are particular rights for people who habitually live on the premises,
but “habitually” is quite a high test. The provision that
I have just mentioned is about access to the premises. I read that as
allowing the people listed to continue to occupy the premises, but I
may be wrong in that. The guidance that the Government have issued in
draft suggests that it means access in order to collect belongings.
Will the Minister confirm, or otherwise, that the closure notice could
mean that people will be turned out of where they live? The amendment
removes the word “habitually” and Amendment 56ZK is

56ZG would add a right of access not just for the owner but also for an
operator. I am again thinking about pubs and other leisure or business
places. The owner is not necessarily the person who operates the
business on the premises. In a later clause, there are provisions for
rights of appeal. Again, I seek 
<?notus-xml column=13?>to add an operator in there, because I am not clear whether an operator
would have an interest in the premises for the purposes of these
provisions. Interest in land has a narrower meaning than I read it

suggest that there should be access by anyone designated and agreed by

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments
address aspects of the new closure power. As noble Lords will recall,
the power has two key parts: the closure notice and the closure order.
Where informal measures have failed, or are inappropriate, the closure
notice allows the police or the local authority to close quickly those
premises for up to 48 hours out of court. In some cases this will be
sufficient to resolve the problem, but in others a longer-term closure
order might be required. Following the closure notice, the police force
or the local authority that issued it can apply to the court for a
closure order to close premises for up to three months, although this
can subsequently be extended by the court to a maximum of six months.
This allows the local authority or the police to find a solution to the
problem while protecting victims and
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:17:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

seek to exempt the operator of the premises and anyone else designated
to secure the premises from the effect of a closure notice. The purpose
of the closure powers is to restrict the number of people who are able
to access premises, and therefore to reduce the nuisance or annoyance
associated with it. The clause allows the owner as of right to access
the premises so that they may secure and maintain it and obtain any
items or information they may need. As my noble friend has explained,
there may be cases where a person other than the owner is in control of
the premises. Alternatively,  the owner may not be able to
attend and secure the premises. The closure powers cover a wide range
of premises and therefore a wide range of situations. To include the
term “operator” may make the definition too wide,
enabling a large number of people to claim that they cannot be
prohibited from accessing the premises by the closure order. This could
have the effect of undermining the closure notice
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:18:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312023000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000069">However,
Clause 69 already contains provisions to allow the closure notice to be
tailored to the appropriate circumstances, which was a concern my noble
friend raised. Subsection (3) allows for the police or for the local
authority to define who is prohibited, at what times and in what
circumstances. The police or the local authority will therefore
consider what the appropriate arrangement is on a case-by-case basis.
It is in their interests to have the premises properly and safely
secured, as this will help ensure adherence to the closure notice. They
will be able to make arrangements to ensure that the appropriate people
can access the premises, whether this be the operator or someone
designated by the
owner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:19:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312023000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000070">The
list of those whom a closure notice cannot prohibit relates to those
who should not be prohibited by an out-of-court notice in any
circumstances. It is our view that this should remain as those who
habitually live there or who own the premises. The clause adequately
caters for my noble friend’s point as regards the operator of
the
premises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312023000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000071">Amendment
56ZJ seeks to amend Clause 69(4). Subsection (4) states that the
closure notice cannot prohibit access to those
who,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1312023000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000167">“habitually

means that those people can continue to access and, indeed, occupy the
premises. However, a closure order can prohibit those who live in the
premises and the owner. A closure order can be made only by the court.
That is an important distinction between the two measures. It is for
the court to decide who should be prohibited. The breach of closure
notice is also a criminal offence, whether or not it is specified. It
is important to be clear who can enter premises subject to a closure
notice. It also needs to be clear to those who may seek to enter
premises as well as those enforcing the closure notice. Whether this is
specified or not does not change the fact that the closure notice
cannot prohibit those who habitually live on, or own, the premises, as
I have already said. Therefore, even where an oversight occurs, it will
not result in an individual having breached a closure notice as the
notice cannot prohibit access. As I say, a closure order can be made
only by the
court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:20:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

allow the owner, occupier or operator of the premises to appeal a
closure order. I am pleased to reassure my noble friend that the Bill
already allows for this. Clause 77 sets out two categories of people
who can appeal a closure order. These are, first, a person on whom the
notice was served and, secondly, a person who has an interest in the
premises but on whom the closure notice was not served.
Clause 72(2) covers the serving of a notice. It lists a
number of ways the police or local authority can serve the notice and
requires that they do all of these, if possible. Therefore, in the
majority of cases, the owner, operator and occupier will be served the
notice and therefore can appeal under Clause 77(1)(a). If, for some
reason, it was not possible to serve the notice on the owner, operator
or occupier, they would be able to appeal under Clause 77(1)(b), which

framed these provisions around the four conditions that have to be met.
We often decry the growth of compensation culture and we do not want to
add to it here. Of course, where the owner or occupier of the premises
subject to a closure notice or order has suffered financial loss, was
not in any way associated with the anti-social behaviour on the
premises and took reasonable steps to prevent such behaviour, that
person should be entitled to claim compensation. However, we do not
believe that the ability to seek compensation should extend more widely
than this. To do so would open up the police and local authorities to
numerous claims, and would make it more difficult for applicants to
know whether their claim was likely to be successful. Importantly, this
amendment might also deter police and local authorities from exercising

Harris of Haringey (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the problem with this
Bill and the discussions that we have had in Committee is that,
throughout, it has not always been clear who wants the changes that are
proposed in it. Most of the proposals made by the Government are not
evidence-based and many of them are ill thought through. Furthermore,
there is a serious danger that the Bill will be irrelevant. Overall,
levels of crime have declined over the past 15 or so years, and the
trend in burglary is particularly marked. However, there is no cause
for complacency there. A report on the front page of today’s
<I>Times</I> talks about a, “Sudden surge in property
crime”. Therefore, the stability with which we have seen crime
figures move downwards is not something that we can take for
granted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Bill is the fact that the Government are seeking to do something
that would have the effect of undermining all their objectives in this
legislation. Indeed, they are seeking to undermine the progress that
has been made over the past 20 or so years in reducing crime levels.
Certainly, over the past 20 years those building new
developments—new-build homes, refurbished homes and so on,
schools, play areas, hospitals and many others—have increasingly
been informed by or have adopted the principles of Secured by
Design<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:32:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that 20-year period under this initiative carried out under the
auspices of the Association of Chief Police Officers and adopted by
many local authorities? First, Secured by Design
developments—those using the approved products and
materials—are now half as likely to be burgled, and show a
reduction of 25% in criminal damage. That is evidence that these
measures make a difference. Secondly, the additional cost of using
Secured by Design standards in the average home is modest, estimated at
only around £170 per property, yet, as I have already indicated,
these are changes that make a real difference to the risk of burglary
and criminal damage.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312023000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000085">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
it is estimated that in one year alone, some 700,000 burglaries have
the potential to be thwarted if appropriate security devices are
installed—representing an annual saving of more than
£1.97
billion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:33:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
Fourthly, the Association of British Insurers has estimated that the
introduction of Secured by Design standards across the UK would bring
more than £3.2 billion-worth of savings to the economy over 20
years. Finally, householders who are not offered security
recommendations after a 
<?notus-xml column=19?>burglary are 69% more likely to suffer a repeat incident than those who
are offered advice.
Therefore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>, the
lesson is that the Secured by Design initiative has made a real
difference. This is a success story that is widely copied and cited
internationally, and it is the subject of many academic studies
testifying to its
efficacy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:34:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government’s approach to something that clearly makes a
difference and clearly works? It is the old, traditional approach of,
“If it ain’t broke, take it to pieces anyway”. I
appreciate that the Minister is not responsible for the activities of
the Department for Communities and Local Government, but we are always
assured that government is a seamless whole, working together in the
interests of the people of this country.</hs_para>

Communities and Local Government issued a consultation document seeking
views on its recent review of building regulations and housing
standards. The proposals put forward by the department suggested a
two-tiered standard of security: a basic minimum level that would be
generally required and a so-called “enhanced” standard.
The basic standard is demonstrably inadequate and has been shown to
have little security benefit. Yes, that basic standard might specify
stronger locks; but if it does not say anything about the flimsiness of
the doors, you may have a nice, firm lock, but the door will burst open
with one firm kick while the lock remains in place. That does not do
much for security, though it may please the lock-makers.</hs_para>

“enhanced” standard would be lower than the existing
Secured by Design standards. It is most significant that that could be
required by local authorities only where what is described as a
“compelling” case exists for the higher standard to be
the norm. In legal terms, “compelling” is a strong test
to meet. To make a compelling case, a local authority would have to
demonstrate that the development would be subject to an elevated rate
of burglary—you will be expected to be able to demonstrate that
before the building is even built. Moreover, you will have to determine
that there will be a higher than normal impact of burglary on tenants
even before a property is let.</hs_para>

goes without saying that this test will be almost impossible to pass in
respect of a new development. As the test has to be applied site by
site, it is not even clear that it will simplify matters for
developers; it is likely to produce confusion and added uncertainties
for them, because when they submit a proposal they will not know
whether the authority will attempt to apply the enhanced
standard.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312023000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000090">As I
said, the enhanced standard will not be as beneficial as the proven
Secured by Design guidelines. It will not be open to a local authority
to require the proven Secured by Design guidelines, even if it wishes
to do so; and to apply even the so-called “enhanced”
standards, it will have to go through a complicated process to
demonstrate the compelling case required by the Department for
Communities and Local Government, with all the implicit threats of
legal action that that entails.</hs_para>

localism. In my naivety, I assumed that the Department for Communities
and Local Government was supposed to promote localism. If this is
promoting localism, it is a very strange way of doing it, because it
removes from local authorities the power to set what they regard as the
most appropriate standards in their area. In practice, it is a
centrally driven dumbing down of standards: the Department for
Communities and Local Government is dumbing down the standards of
security that must be met by new developments. That is putting
communities and householders at greater risk; it is putting at risk
progress in reducing crime, especially burglary.</hs_para>

responds, will he tell me where the demand is for this dumbing down?
Who is it—apart from the burgling fraternity,
obviously—saying, “We want lesser security”? I am
not aware of this great demand. What representations were received by
the Department for Communities and Local Government before it made
these proposals? Did it consult the Home Office? If it did, what the
Home Office say? Did it say, “Yes, please, Department for
Communities and Local Government; undermine all the work we have been
doing to reduce crime for the past 20 years by removing these
requirements for better security in the home”? Did it listen to
local authorities? Did it listen to the communities affected and those
who would have to live in ill-secured properties?</hs_para>

forward as a simplification of the planning process. It has been

residents elect their local councillors to protect their local
interests and to make local determinations of policy. So what is the
problem that Ministers think that they will solve by preventing that
local, democratic discretion? What this risks is that progress made
over the past two decades in designing out crime, reducing burglary and
making anti-social behaviour harder will be put into reverse. This is,
in short, an act of vandalism—anti-social behaviour of the worst
sort.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312023000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312023000096">The

protecting people against crime is an investment—better than
facing the spiralling costs of enforcement while waiting for the

Secured by Design, they will be able to with the amendment. If they

Design, I merely say quietly to the Minister that there is a great deal
to be said for any actions which mean that you get started right. So
much of what we do is retro-fit. It is being faced with a difficult

so that it was more difficult for people to find themselves in a
vulnerable position, and more difficult for those who wish to be
criminals actually to be criminals?”. My reason for speaking is
this: I look round the House and it is probably true that there is a
high proportion of us who were lucky enough to have been brought up in
circumstances where our environments encouraged us to behave properly.
That may not be true of everybody, but of an awful lot of us. The older

do without any question. It is the natural way of developing today. I
say that and declare an interest because I advise a number of

conclusions. First, it must be said that this is about a commercial
initiative of the Association of Chief Police Officers, or rather a
subsidiary company of ACPO. It is an accreditation-based approach in
which, as I understand it, Secured by Design would become the
accreditation body and would set the standards. As I see it, this
amendment paves the way to giving this statutory backing.

also need in the context of their built environment, whether it is

perverse incentive here. If people feel that Secured by Design somehow
gives a warranty or guarantee or underpins a relatively crime-free
environment, they may tend to forget those things. I think that getting
people better in tune with the real risks, bearing in mind that this is
a movable feast and that criminal activity is always changing and

It can sometimes be difficult across government to see how the actions
of one department impact on another. I say to the noble Earl, Lord
Lytton, that the reason that the amendment is before us today is that
Secured by Design is in great danger of being totally undermined by the
action of the Department for Communities and Local Government. There
seems to be a holy grail of deregulation, to see what we can pull out
of regulation, without making a proper assessment of where regulation
is good or bad, of what is its

by Design is there to protect people in their homes. One of the

sentimental or monetary value; it is the intrusion into one’s
home, the place where we expect to be the most safe, but where we

have to say: it works. The noble Lord, Lord Deben, mentioned his

are interesting because they show the situation before and after. Prior
to the work being undertaken in Nottingham City Council area, a
particular estate, Bells Lane and Broxtowe, suffered 227 burglaries.
Following the work undertaken by Secured by Design, there was a 42%
reduction in the number of burglaries, yet in the city as a whole there
was a reduction of just 21%, so it was inevitable that Secured by

with his call to legislate to designate a body of police leaders and

are already doing this and will continue to do so. It is right that
they are reviewing the standards for building security. Over the years
these have grown considerably in number, making a review sensible, but
the police do not need a statutory duty to do this. In addition, Crime
Prevention Initiatives Ltd, through Secured by Design, already works
closely with standards test houses, manufacturers and, increasingly,
with building developers. I am not persuaded that we should seek to
prescribe its working model in legislation, as subsection

elected, that says, “We would really like to go along with the

noble friend Lord
Greaves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:21:18"></hs_TimeCode> has

“locality” means the same as where it is used elsewhere
in the legislation—for instance, with public spaces protection
orders—and whether it is wider or narrower than
“neighbourhood”. Of course, in any event, how appropriate
is it here? His Amendments 56ACA and 56ABA on Clause 86 deal with
conditions surrounding 
<?notus-xml column=31?>a breach of an IPNA which is not in the dwelling house or its locality,
but which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to a resident or
occupant of housing in the locality or to the landlord or manager.

proposed new power must inevitably lead to a rise in evictions. If this

the amendment seeks to address—and are thus unlikely to be
rehoused in comparable accommodation in their neighbourhood. How does
this sanction address the underlying causes of anti-social behaviour?
Surely making a whole family homeless due to the behaviour of one
family member, or indeed a visitor, is both a both a double punishment
and counterproductive. My understanding is that even if mandatory
eviction would not amount to a breach of the human rights convention,
it is still a public policy proposal that doubly punishes the most
vulnerable families in our society. A mandatory requirement for the
judge to order possession removes all but the bare minimum of judicial
discretion in deciding whether or not an individual or a family is to

From my experience as a Member of Parliament, the most vulnerable
people I ever came across were decent families whose whole lives had
been made totally unacceptable by their neighbours. I am afraid it is
one of the facts of life that up till now no measures have been
introduced that have dealt with this issue. Unless these measures are
very serious, these people will go on suffering, not just for a year or

the need to protect those who are the victims of anti-social behaviour.
Very often they are just the sort of people who are held up as being
vulnerable to the effects of the provisions in the Bill. From my
experience of a barrister practising for public authorities, I add the
observation that it has become quite a regular feature of litigation
that public authorities are sued for failing to take sufficient steps
to protect those who are the victims of anti-social behaviour. The Bill

reasonable to grant possession. The Government say that it takes on
average seven months to get an outcome from the courts in anti-social
behaviour possession cases, and that the existing discretionary grounds
apply only to anti-social behaviour and criminality in, or in the
locality of, the property. Indeed, in the light of the riots two and a
half years ago, the Government are also proposing later in the Bill to
extend the scope of the discretionary ground so that landlords can seek
to evict a tenant who adversely affects the lives of those in

purpose of the new absolute ground for possession, say the Government,
is to speed up the possession process in cases where anti-social

Government’s draft guidance states that the court must grant

set procedures have been followed. In addition, the court’s
discretion to suspend possession will be limited to no later than 14
days, or six weeks in exceptional
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312024000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#1312024000021">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:34:15"></hs_TimeCode>

that the tenant, a member of the tenant’s household or a person

than 48 hours under a closure order for anti-social behaviour. The last

disingenuous on this point. There has never been a power of possession
applied to owner-occupiers in such cases as there is no landlord-owned
property to possess; it is the property of the person living in the
house. We have already debated the mechanisms whereby that sort of
anti-social behaviour is dealt with both by individuals who might

grounds for possession for anti-social behaviour under the Housing Act

In practice, this means that a significant amount of time is required
for the court to consider the matter, leading to extensive delays. This
prolongs the suffering of the victims who have to continue living next
door to the perpetrators. Indeed, the evidence 
<?notus-xml column=36?>we have suggests that it can take an average of some seven months from
application to the grant of a possession order, as the noble Lord said.
The provisions in these clauses seek to short-circuit that process by
removing the requirement on the landlords to prove to the court that it
is reasonable to grant a possession order where criminal or anti-social
behaviour has already been proven in another
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120217000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#13120217000003">Under

our intention or belief that the new absolute ground will increase the

shows that eviction for anti-social behaviour is an exceptional course
of action. There are, on average, some 2,000 each year in the context
of 4 million social homes in England. Overwhelmingly, landlords look to
alternative remedies and tools to address the anti-social behaviour and
its causes before resorting to possession proceedings. However, where
landlords do seek eviction, it will avoid duplication and delay in the
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120217000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#13120217000004">The

of Clause 86(1) and Clause 89(1) to make explicit that, when the court

ground, it may do so only where it considers this to be proportionate.
We 
<?notus-xml column=37?>have been here before in Part 1 and Part 4 of this Bill. I do not think

noble friend went on to speak to Amendments 56AB, AC, AD, AH, AJ and
AK—the first ones relating to secure tenants and the second to
assured tenants. These seek to amend three of the conditions that must
be met for a court to grant possession under the absolute ground so
that the anti-social behaviour of a visitor to a property could not be
considered. These amendments would mean that the absolute ground could
be used only when the anti-social or criminal behaviour was done by the
tenant or by a member of the household. The provisions for the absolute
ground are in line with existing grounds for possession. They make
clear that tenants are responsible for the anti-social behaviour of
visitors to their property as well as that of members of the household.
This is a well established principle, based on the fact that, in
practice, there is sometimes very little that differentiates a regular
visitor to a property from a resident. Landlords have indicated that
excluding the anti-social behaviour of visitors from the absolute
ground is unhelpful when they are seeking to take action against
persistent, serious anti-social behaviour by those who spend much of
their time at the property, but where it is not clear whether or not
they are strictly members of the household. We would not expect a
landlord to seek possession as the result of the behaviour of an
occasional visitor. It is important to remember that public authorities
will need to ensure that any decisions they make to bring possession
proceedings under the absolute ground are

amendments seek to amend the first, second and third conditions so that
the anti-social behaviour must have taken place in the vicinity of the
property instead of the locality. I do not think that these amendments
will improve the Bill. “Locality” is a well established
term in local housing law. Existing provisions for possession under
anti-social behaviour require the anti-social behaviour to have taken
place in the locality of the property. Landlords and the courts are
therefore familiar with this term and its meaning in housing actions.
The amendments would simply reinvent the wheel and create new confusion
over what area is covered by the term “vicinity”. In
addition, they would create inconsistency with existing possession
provisions, which are based on the offence being committed in the
“locality” of the property.</hs_para>

term “locality” in this context dates back to the Housing
Act 1996. Parliament preferred it then as suggesting a wider
geographical area than “vicinity”, while still
maintaining the link between the tenant’s behaviour and the area

neighbours, while locality could capture the impact of a
tenant’s behaviour on an estate more widely. I think that that
argument still holds good
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120217000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#13120217000009">My

are the innocent victims of circumstances when quite the reverse is the
case. The type of tenant that we would expect to be evicted under this
new ground would be someone who, as described by my noble friend Lord

turn to Clause 87, which ensures that tenants are given adequate notice
of the landlord’s intention to take action to seek possession,
are told the reasons why possession is being sought and are informed of
how they can access advice. It relates to tenants with secure
tenancies. Clause 89 introduces corresponding notice requirements for
possession of assured tenancies under the new absolute ground.
Amendment 56ADD, in the name of my noble friend Lord Greaves, seeks to
remove the requirement that the tenant receives information about where
advice can be sought. I believe that this is an important safeguard to

This clause provides tenants of local authorities with a right to seek
a review of any decision by the landlord to seek possession on the new

introduce undue delay because of the timescales specified. The
amendment would require that the matters my noble friend sets out are
included in regulations made in respect of such reviews. I assure my

there to be consequences, including, potentially, having their home

while maintaining the integrity of our policy, we will, but as we do

will start by commenting on why we have the Statement, which has all
the hallmarks of being rather rushed. Only a month ago, we were
debating the Annual Energy Statement. That was intended to be the
document in which the Government set out their near-term priorities on
energy policy—but here we are, less than a month later,
considering a whole raft of new announcements. It is a bit odd, and the
timing seems to be related more to trying to air difficult discussions
ahead of the Autumn Statement than to anything
else<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:11:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120217000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#13120217000042">The
rushing of this has serious implications. As noble Lords will be aware,
the Statement does not have an impact assessment attached to it. It is
subject to consultation—although you would not believe that
given what we have read in the newspapers—which will not begin
until January. We are in danger of having energy policy being made up
on the hoof. The serious implications are that that will destabilise
people’s confidence in our market. If we had an impact
assessment, we could see what the full implications of this raft of
policies would be. That would help us understand the impact on jobs in
the insulation sector and the implications for households, including
fuel-poor households. How many of them will now miss out on ECO
measures as a result of the announcement today? I should be grateful if
the noble Baroness could give me an estimate of how many households
will now not receive much-needed help to insulate their homes as a
result of the carbon-saving proportion of the ECO being cut by
one-third.</hs_para>

other curious aspect of this package is that we are now being told that
the Government have managed to get a voluntary commitment to reduce
network charges. Why is that voluntary? Do we not have a regulator that
is meant to be putting the consumer first and assessing whether
distributed network charges are appropriate? It is highly irregular for
a department to be ringing round asking for voluntary cuts to a charge
that is subject to price regulation. Clearly, our price regulator is
not up to the

raises another question about whether any of this will actually be
delivered. Is it true that Ofgem has powers that it can use to ensure
that the savings that the Government are making for the energy
companies will be passed on to the consumer? Given that it seems
incapable of regulating the distributed network operators, why should
we believe that it will do any differently with this package of

am grateful that the noble Baroness repeated the acknowledgement that
fuel poverty is still a priority. At the moment, the fuel poverty
targets have been abolished and we are expecting to see new targets for
what the Government propose to do on that policy. When we will see

“address” it but to tackle it and reduce the number of

package also contains a number of measures to try to boost uptake of
the Green Deal. I think that that is being wrapped up as an additional
boost, but actually it is clear that the Green Deal is failing so
abjectly that the Government have been forced to rethink and introduce
the very incentives that were suggested and should have been included

that 15,000 households are expected to be supported by this landlord

the issue of landlords and the energy efficiency of their properties,
it has come to my attention that the Government were recently forced to
pay £6 million of taxpayers’ money to the administrating

complied with the law in providing energy performance certificates is
vastly under what was expected. Why is this? Why do we have a situation

other question about the 15,000 households is: how will the Government
ensure that the target is actually met? Their progress on the Green
Deal is, as we know, lamentable. Fewer than 1,000 households have taken

make a couple of comments on the carbon implications of this package.
The Government have been relatively clear that this will see a 3
million tonne increase in carbon emissions and have sought to introduce
policies to mitigate that, one of which is a totally non-specified
policy in the transport sector. Can the Minister give us any more
information on what that policy is likely to be? The transport sector
is not renowned for cheap or affordable carbon saving, so I would be
interested to see what the impact assessment will say on the cost of
that transport policy compared to the cost of cutting carbon through
energy efficiency. We all know that energy
efficiency is one of the best ways to reduce carbon. It is one of the

it comes to value-for-money policies on carbon cutting, will the noble

to encourage that and to make sure that we do not have coal burning

closing, I have a horrible suspicion that the organisation that will be
celebrating the most out of this will be EDF Energy, which seems almost
word-for-word to dictate government energy policy. I notice from its
press release that it is now gunning for the home-display elements of
the smart metering rollout. I wonder how long it will be before they
are cut. It is also interested in reducing network charging. The thing
I find most regrettable in all this is that the Secretary of State in
the other place stated that he was standing up to the big six. I am
afraid nothing could be further from the truth. This is policy as
dictated by the big six. A Labour Government would stand up to the big
six, split up the companies so that they are ring-fenced from
generation and supply, and introduce far greater competition into the
energy market. That is the way to get prices down. Much greater
competition in every element of the energy supply chain is the only way
that we can get out of the bind we are in at the moment. It is

try to address genuine concerns from consumers. I have constantly
raised the point from this Dispatch Box that we need to ensure that we
put consumers first. The Government have looked, listened, heard and
responded to try to ensure that what we propose is, first, doable and
is not just jingoistic language that says, “Let’s
price-freeze now and pay later”. If we go by what the noble

because this country sorely needs the scale of investment that this
Government have been pushing for since we came into government in 2010.
She also asked how many households will miss out because of the
extension. The extension actually means that more households will be
able to gain from energy-efficiency measures, because it will go from
2015 to 2017. I do not know why the noble Baroness thinks that we are

seen a reduction in carbon emissions, perhaps not of the scale and size
that we would like, but it is going in the right direction: 4% is still
better than the rising emissions that we were
seeing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120217000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#13120217000060"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan" PimsId="4858" UID="13120217000157" xid="1875" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0001.htm#13120217000157">Lord

would not be unreasonable to remind her that we have had one of the
worst economic slumps since the 1930s. The level of industrial activity
made a bigger contribution to that than any policy of the

incompetence has had a role to play.</hs_para>

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I was quite pessimistic when the
negotiations started between the Treasury and the DECC on this matter
but I congratulate the Minister on the outcome. It has not moved us
backwards; it has actually moved the energy efficiency and carbon
agenda forward. I very much like the fact that, for new home buyers or
people moving, there will be that discount or a contribution towards
energy efficiency. Certainly, there needs to be a deal for landlords;
that is also good. The other thing that has not been mentioned so far
is that we have had a reaction from distribution network operators, who
seem to have been left out of this
somehow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:28:41"></hs_TimeCode> and have
some responsibility themselves. Perhaps from that small move on
taxation, we will have a more progressive regime. On the existing
regime, we have affordable warmth, the carbon-saving community
obligation still in place and the low-carbon regime that comes out of
the Energy Bill, which we hope will pass unchanged. Those are all items

no less a personage than the Prime Minister, and by almost everyone
else who has been briefing on his behalf, that any intervention in the
energy markets was at best a return to the 1970s and at worst
Marxism—presumably a return to the 1870s. Today, in her
introductory remarks—I think I am quoting her
correctly—the Minister talked about “forcing transparency
on the market” and later referred to “bearing down on
prices”. Will she clarify for us whether the Government now
accept that it is not only proper and reasonable to

noble Lord as I probably responded to him last time. We need to ensure
that there is greater competition. I hate to go back to my earlier
point, but under the previous Administration, the number of energy
companies reduced from 14 or 15 to six. The big six is a Labour
creation. If we have less competition, it is because that competition
was taken out by the previous Government. We have now seen seven new
entrants in our energy mix. We will see a greater number of entrants
coming forward because we have created confidence for smaller providers
to come into the marketplace. We do not need intervention as the noble
Lord expects. We need to ensure greater
competition.</hs_para>

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps the Minister can clarify
the arithmetic, particularly in relation to the eco. Past DECC figures
suggested that the eco costs consumers about £47 a year. This
Statement claims that we will save £30 to £35 of that
cost, yet 60% of the eco relates to affordable warmth and other fuel
poverty measures, and they are going to be maintained according to this
Statement, so the full cost must fall on the other 40%. By my
calculations, that works out at roughly £7, not £30 to
£35. The only way to square those figures is by extending the
period by another two years, which means halving the annual expenditure
on the fuel poverty programme. Even then, the arithmetic does not work
out. If that is indeed the case, and the insulation industry seems to
be taking that to be the case, does it not justify the stance that we
on this side of the House took that the Government’s commitment
to the fuel poverty strategy is only to address it rather than to
reduce the numbers in fuel poverty? The only measure that we have yet
seen is an attempt by the Government to refine fuel poverty downwards,
as the Select Committee in the other place pointed out. Will the
Minister explain those figures and perhaps justify the
position?<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:39:32"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

repeat a Statement made by the Secretary of State for Scotland in the

evening of Friday 29 November. Before repeating my right honourable
friend’s Statement, I am sure I speak for all parts of your
Lordships’ House in expressing our deepest condolences to the
family and friends of those who lost their lives in this terrible
tragedy, as well as expressing our own thoughts for those injured and
our thankful appreciation of those who have given such valiant service

the House will be aware, at approximately 10.25 pm on Friday
evening, a helicopter, operated on behalf of Police Scotland, crashed
into the roof of the Clutha Bar in Stockwell Street, Glasgow. It was
reported that there were around 120 people in the bar at the
time of the accident. Police Scotland has overnight
confirmed nine fatalities. This includes the
pilot of the helicopter and the two police officers on
board. A further 32 people were injured in the crash and
12 remain in hospital. Three of these casualties are being
treated in intensive care, where their condition is described as
serious but stable. The search of the building continues and it remains
possible that more casualties could be
found.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120217000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#13120217000091">I
am sure that the House will also wish to recognise the outstanding work
of the emergency services, for the speed, professionalism and courage
of their response on Friday night and into the early hours of Saturday
morning. Police, fire and ambulance services all responded
magnificently, working in difficult and dangerous circumstances. In
particular, we should recognise that police officers had to respond in
circumstances where they were dealing, not just with the death of
members of the public, but also with two of their own colleagues, PC

of the most remarkable stories of courage and selflessness from Friday

lengthy. I know that all those affected will be

paid to the emergency services. Without in any way anticipating the
results of the inquiry, it seems that rather a lot of helicopters fall
out of the sky these days. We have seen it in the North Sea and not a
stone’s throw from here. Would this not be a good time perhaps
to review the maintenance regime that applies to helicopters and the
rules that surround it? I appreciate that this was a police helicopter
and that we do not know the circumstances. However, should we not look

helicopter crashes and fatalities in recent times. Over a long period
of time the safety record has generally been good. However, I 
<?notus-xml column=55?>am sure the whole House will agree that any accident must be thoroughly
investigated if lessons can be learnt. It is also important to remind
ourselves that helicopters fly many different types of operations and
that a helicopter taking large numbers of passengers out to
installations in the North Sea is somewhat different from the operation
that was undertaken by police and other emergency helicopters in this
situation. I am not sure that a generic inquiry would necessarily be
the best way forward. However, it is important that there is a thorough
investigation of the various accidents that have happened. I am in no
doubt that the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and other relevant

As we know, these helicopters are used a lot by police and emergency

what the noble Baroness said about Jim Murphy. Those of us who saw that
interview realised the spirit of someone whom many of us know. It was
all too typical of Jim to do something like that. On the particular
helicopter—the EC135—as I said, it is obvious that at
this stage of the investigation the cause of the crash in unknown. That
type of helicopter has been operated successfully, both in the United
Kingdom and internationally, and has a good safety record. At this time
we are not aware of any information that would lead us to consider this
type as unsafe, but if at any time the European Aviation Safety Agency,
which has the approval process, is concerned that the aircraft type is
unsafe, it can ground all operations. However, that decision has not

extraordinary risks to make sure that we continue to be safe and well.
I associate myself and the Liberal Democrat Benches with those remarks.
Will the Minister commit the United Kingdom Government to ensuring that
whatever review is carried out as a result of those investigations into
helicopter flights over cities and rural areas, recommendations are
acted upon, because

ordinary for Glasgow where, perhaps because of the industrial culture
and legacy, there is a tendency to run towards the danger when others
are in danger. In any case, however it may surprise others, it remains
inspiring. I obviously associate myself with the condolences for those
who have lost loved ones or family, and those who are injured. I will
ask the Minister one question. I understand he said that the search
continues inside the Clutha Bar for others who may be there. Does he
have any information as to whether there are known and

the self-effacing way in which Jim handled the interviews was because
he recognised that he was not alone among those who responded to that

what I said—and what the Secretary of State said when he stood
up and made his Statement in the other place—which is that the

Hamwee (LD):</Member></B> This group of amendments takes us to Clause
91, which provides for possession in the event of riot-related

my noble friend Lord Greaves, who also tabled Amendment
56ACC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:11:22"></hs_TimeCode>. He
proposes to leave out the words “a person” from the new

another

My noble friend, who cannot be here today, asks whether—as he
and I read the legislation—this could include, for instance, a

Amendment 56AB would restrict the ground for possession to the
commission of a serious offence, using the definition in new Section
84A in Clause 86 for convenience. I understand and appreciate that
granting possession will be a discretionary matter, but the court must
take account of some circumstances being such as to justify the
exercise. I was concerned, as I have been on similar points, by the
Government’s response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
which said that it was not persuaded by the Government’s
justification for this ground for possession. The Government say that
this is likely to happen only very exceptionally. The ground is
discretionary, which means that the court will not be able to make a
possession order unless it considers it reasonable to do so. The court
may be less likely to conclude that it was reasonable to evict when the
crime was not committed in the locality of the property. As it is a
riot-related offence, it may have been committed some way away and have
nothing to do with the
property<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:13:57"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
talking here about offences which, in all likelihood, are unrelated to

Bill is, rightly, victim focused, but I am concerned that this

of a criminal offence and be imprisoned, and the effect of that on his

committed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:17:06"></hs_TimeCode>
offences during the riot on that occasion were dealt with speedily and
firmly. Sentences of imprisonment were the norm, and some were lengthy.
To some extent, one could say that they were deprived of the right to
remain in a dwelling house by that very process. The courts have
sufficient powers to deal firmly with offenders caught up in a riot and
appeals against sentences were, for the most part, unsuccessful. The
criminal justice system—some would say “for
once”—in general responded very well to what

am concerned that this measure is a step too far. While a court would
still have to be satisfied that it was reasonable to grant possession,
the fact that the relevant offence can be committed not only by the
tenant but by someone residing in the dwelling house means that a
tenant wholly innocent of involvement in a riot could potentially lose
their home. I do not think that this is a necessary or appropriate
provision, given all the other powers that exist elsewhere in the Bill.
I am also concerned that what is essentially a procedure by way of
civil remedy should carry with it a criminal offence of this sort
connected with the civil recovery of possession. Although I share the
Government’s concern that those involved with riots should be
dealt with in a way that sends out a message to any potential rioters,

with the Government’s reasoning and motivation for this
additional ground for possession being included in the Bill and
appreciate the strong signals that are needed for people involved in
rioting. I was in London in the summer of 2011 so I can directly share
the concern of the Government and the general public about the serious
nature of the offences of those who participate in riots, especially on
that scale. However, as my noble friend Lord Faulks outlined, the
criminal courts have sufficient powers to deal with those matters. If I
recall correctly, some courts even sat through the night, and many
offenders were clearly extremely shocked to be sentenced to a period of

quite taken aback when I received from a Conservative Peer a message of
glowing tribute for the two speeches I had made in the Chamber that
day. Since I had not been anywhere near the Chamber that day I was
somewhat mystified, and that is why I want to make it clear that the
speech before last was not made by me, but by someone with a similar
name. The noble Baroness currently in the chair and I also have the
same sort of problem from time to time, except that there is one big

have a further point. Had I been making these points in another place
with the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, in the chair, she would have
ruled me out of order long before now, but that does not happen here.
My point is that that the numbering and lettering of these amendments
is even more confusing than the confusion between our three names. I
hope the clerks will look at some more logical way of numbering and
lettering amendments. After all, 56 is not the only number that you can
use for an amendment. There is 57 for example, and so on. These As, Bs,
Cs, Ds and so on are most confusing. However, I am going on too long,

Faulks and Lady Berridge, although I am not on the Joint Committee on
Human Rights. At the time of the riots in London and across the country
a couple of years ago, I supported severe punishment by the courts of
otherwise minor relatively offences, because those offences took place
during a riot. I do not support lenient treatment of minor offences
committed during a riot. However, as my noble friends have indicated,
the provision to order possession of a property when the offence has
absolutely nothing to do with protecting neighbours, for example, from
anti-social behaviour, is a step too far. It is politically motivated
and is not driven by the needs of justice. Therefore, it should be no

“Offences connected with riot” and presumably the

an earlier point: why are there two classes of victim of riotous
behaviour? Riotous activity by a tenant of social housing or an assured
tenancy can lead to eviction, but riotous activity by an owner-occupier
cannot, and there is no redress of comparable severity that would apply
to an owner-occupier but not to someone in rented accommodation. Will
the Minister address this point? In a Bill intended to put the victim
first, what is the thinking behind the Government’s apparent
decision that there should be two classes of victim when it comes to
action that can be taken against those who cause misery through the

Clause 91, tenants, including the individual convicted of riotous

punishment over and above that handed down by the court for riotous
activity. This additional punishment is not evenly applied, since it

would like to talk about the subject of this debate—that is, the
specific proposals in Clause 91. As the law stands, thuggish behaviour
against neighbours or in the locality of a tenant’s home may be
a basis for eviction. However, looting, or other riot-related criminal
activity, by tenants further away from their homes would not usually be
taken into account. I do not think that is right, although the noble
Lord may think that it is. People who wreck other people’s
communities through riot-related offences should face the same
consequences that they would if they carried out such behaviour in
their own neighbourhoods. Clause 91 enables that to happen. It also
sends out a strong and important message for the future that if you get
involved in a riot, whether that is near your home or not, there may be
consequences for your

I emphasise that we would expect landlords to seek to evict under this
new ground for possession only exceptionally. With regard to the
concern raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights—that 
<?notus-xml column=64?>the ground amounts to a punishment and may disproportionately
affect women and children—it is important to note that
safeguards will be in place. The new ground is discretionary, and so,
just as is the case for the existing discretionary grounds for
possession for anti-social behaviour, the court would have to consider
whether it was reasonable to grant a possession order in the light of
the facts of the case. The impact on the whole household and any young
children is likely to be a relevant factor in
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120229000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#13120229000041">Amendments
56AM and 56CC to this clause would mean that possession action under

and not a member of their household, had been convicted of an offence.
Amendments 56B, 56C, 56D and 56E would mean that only convictions for

I have said before, it is an established principle of tenancy law that
a tenant is held responsible for the behaviour of members of their
household. There is also an issue of wider parental responsibility
here. In practice, though, the landlord would need to prove that it was
reasonable to grant possession, and we consider it unlikely that the
court would find this to be the case where a child of a tenant has, as
a one-off, got caught up in, and committed, an offence during a riot.
Clearly, a tenant, or any other parent, should be held more responsible
if their teenage child makes their neighbours’ lives a misery
over a period of years than if they just let them out of their sight
for a few hours. Similarly, in practice we would not expect this new
ground for possession to be used where the conviction was for a minor
offence. We would expect these provisions to be used only exceptionally
and in relation only to serious riot-related offences. Therefore, a
landlord might, for example, consider possession action where one of
their tenants had been convicted of a serious assault on a police
officer, but not where they had stolen a pair of trainers from a shop.
Again, even if a landlord were to apply for possession on the basis of
a minor offence committed at the scene of a riot, we would not expect
the court to consider it reasonable to grant possession. Therefore, we
would, in practice, expect the impact of Amendments 56AM, 56CC, 56B,
56C, 56D and 56E to be
limited.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120229000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#13120229000043">I

within a household a new tenancy should be granted. In general,
however, decisions about who should be allocated available social
housing locally should rest with the landlord or, where nominations

differentiation. That is where my logic—perhaps not
his—takes me. I am grateful to the Minister. My amendments on
the transfer of a tenancy sought to ameliorate the situation, although
I recognise landlords’ concern. As regards what is reasonable
for a court or a landlord to do, I am not sure whether the
reasonableness concerns the seriousness of the offence or the nature of
the household—for instance, whether there is a child in the
household. I have a bit of a difficulty there. Having said that, my
noble friend made my argument extremely well. I am very glad that this

community remedy should have an objective of more than punishment. The
Offender Rehabilitation Bill, which has been through this House and is

a change in general thinking along these lines as well. My amendment

reparation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120229000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#13120229000052">Amendment
56G is on a completely different point: consultation on the community

that I have omitted to mention the London boroughs, but I am sure that
the Minister will tell me that, for this purpose, they are

They ask about the relationship between the requirements that the

noble friend’s amendments also probe the concept of the

share this concern. I think I saw a government statement recently
announcing changes in the use of unconditional cautions; I might be
wrong, but this is not central to the amendments. Apart from, perhaps,

interested to hear the Minister’s response to the amendment
moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Subject to hearing from the
Minister, it is difficult to see what the problem would be with
inserting “two” rather than “one” in Clause
93(3). As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has also pointed out, when
it comes to Clause 93(5), although there is consultation, it does not
seem as if local authorities are going to get much of a look-in. If the
Minister was going to move to two rather than one of the objects having
to be carried out, it would be even more important to consult with
local authorities.</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may deal with that

thank my noble friend Lady Hamwee for raising these issues about this
important part of the Bill. Dealing with low-level crime, out of court
where appropriate, means that victims get justice quickly. My noble
friend is absolutely right: there is a review going on at the moment of
informal cautions and the consequences of out-of-court settlements.
Damian Green announced this in a Written Ministerial Statement on
19<Sup> </Sup>November. These remedies strengthen the armoury. They
mean that the offender has to face immediate consequences for his or
her actions which can make her or him less likely to offend in the
future. The community remedy will give victims of low-level crime and
anti-social behaviour a say in the punishment of offenders out of
court. It will also ensure that victims and the public agree that the
punishments used are meaningful, rather than a token slap on the
wrist.</hs_para>

Bill provides that the actions on the community remedy menu must have
the objective either of assisting in the offender’s
rehabilitation, ensuring that they make reparation or providing a
punishment. Some actions will have more than one of these elements; for
example, cleaning up graffiti is a reparative action but it also has an
element of punishment. In other cases, appropriate actions may have
only one of the elements required. One of the actions we have suggested
in the draft guidance is that the offender could be asked to sign an
acceptable behaviour contract, whereby they agree not to behave
anti-socially in future. This assists the rehabilitation of the
offender but it need not have a reparative or punitive
element.</hs_para>

know that my noble friend is keen to avoid actions that are purely
punitive in nature. However, I see no reason why this should not
sometimes be appropriate. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 already
provides that a conditional caution may impose a financial penalty on
the offender. On its own, this would be a punitive punishment and may,
in some cases, be entirely appropriate. So we should not rule out that
option.</hs_para>

56G and 56H would make the community remedy document subject to
consultation and agreement with the local authority as well as with the
police. The PCC has a duty to consult the chief constable and to agree

police officers will be using the community remedy document and will

I believe that the role of the local authority is a little different.
The PCC should consult with community representatives and the public.
We would expect this to include local councils, as they are likely to
contribute a number of actions to the menu. Professionals such as youth

resources are available locally to deliver the more formal
sanctions.</hs_para>

noble friend has tabled a number of amendments—alongside those
in the name of my noble friend Lord Greaves, who is not in his place

formalise the relationship between the PCC, the police and local
authorities in establishing the community remedy document. There is
much to be gained from this relationship and, since the community
remedy document will be established in advance—one might say in
slow time—there is nothing to lose by making the responsibility
to consult a statutory one. However, I believe that the responsibility
to agree the actions to be included on the community remedy document
should rest with the PCC and the chief constable. PCCs are
democratically accountable to the public, and the responsibility of
ensuring that the community remedy meets the needs of local people
properly rests with the PCC.</hs_para>

many of the same reasons, I do not believe that the decision about whom
it is appropriate to consult in preparing the document should be a
joint responsibility of the local authority and the PCC, which is what
Amendments 56GA and 56GB, tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves and
spoken to by my noble friend Lady Hamwee, seek to do. Responsibility
for preparing the community remedy document properly rests with the
PCC, and so, by and large, should the decision on
consultation.</hs_para>

56HA and 56HB, also tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves, would mean
that the community remedy would be used for anti-social behaviour only

currently drafted, that duty applies when someone has admitted to
anti-social behaviour or a low-level criminal offence which the officer
has decided will be dealt with using a conditional caution. The
community remedy provides a means to engage the victim in considering

conditions to attach to the caution. The police officer will take
ultimate responsibility for the sanction offered to the offender and

doubt that members of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners

will be considerable input. However, essentially it will be about local

of the local authority and the relationships between the local
authority and local policing bodies is destined to go on and on.
However, wherever the word “community” is seen, I move
almost seamlessly to local authorities. Police and crime commissioners
are indeed democratically accountable but so are local authorities.
Local authorities are going to be more local than most of the police
and crime commissioners, whose areas of responsibility are very wide,
and of course they cannot impose a penalty themselves. Anti-social
behaviour is very much a local authority concern. I am not seeking to
downplay the role or status of police and crime commissioners—I
would expect both to contribute. However, I thank the Minister for his

decision-making through a local scrutiny
panel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:56:53"></hs_TimeCode>. I have
taken the wording of the amendment from the recently published
government document, <I>Review of Simple Cautions</I>, which was
written by the College of Policing and the Government and was published
in November this

is a method by which out-of-court disposals can be reviewed by
magistrates, district judges, PCCs, the police, the probation service
and YOTs. In London, I understand that MOPAC, the Mayor’s Office

understand that the necessary legislation is in place for scrutiny
panels to be established and that a number of PCCs have already
introduced some form of scrutiny panel. The prime purpose of these
panels is of course to help the public maintain confidence in
out-of-court disposals. I am moving this probing amendment because I
believe that the rollout of scrutiny panels has been very patchy across
the country. As far as I know, no scrutiny panels have been established
in London, and I believe that that is a cause for
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:58:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

worth reviewing the figures relating to the massive change in recorded
crime that we have seen in recent years. In 2008, there was a maximum
of 360,000 cautions. Currently, the number of cautions issued by the
police is about 200,000, which represents a huge reduction. In London,
in our youth courts over the past three years we have seen a halving of
the number of cases brought to
court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:59:03"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
any number of explanations for this huge reduction in recorded crime,
and I shall not go through all the possible ones. However, I will list
some of them because I know that they have been widely debated in the

first is that there is indeed a genuine reduction in the level of
crime, which of course is to be welcomed. A second explanation that is
commonly advanced is the cuts to the police service. A further
explanation is the massaging of reported crime figures, as was alleged
in the Public Administration Select Committee on 19
November. A further explanation is the removal of police targets for
offences brought to justice. Another is that the police are
concentrating resources on gang-related offences rather than specific
drug-related ones: namely, possession with intent to supply. That
explanation is specific to the London
area.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13120229000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#13120229000109">7

are other, more improbable, explanations: I will list just a couple.
The first, which I heard from a police officer, is that the riots of
2011 led to a reduction in the current levels of crime because the
offenders were locked up for such lengthy periods that they failed to
instruct a younger generation in crime. The second is that the banning
of lead in petrol in 1998 led to this reduction in crime.</hs_para>

say, there is any number of reasons for this. However, the Government
will be well aware that there is widespread scepticism about the
reliability of the figures used. The method put in place by the
Government to try to address that scepticism is the scrutiny panel. I
am moving these amendments—which are probing; I understand that
the legislation is in place—to try to get the Government to roll
out the scrutiny process more thoroughly. My experience is that in
London it is just not happening. It is a very important part of the

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the issues that my noble friend
Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede raised is the apparent extent to which
Clause 94 could be used to 
<?notus-xml column=71?>keep cases that would justify court proceedings under the terms of the
Bill out of the courts, where an individual has admitted to engaging in
anti-social behaviour or committing an offence to a constable,
investigating officer or a person authorised to issue additional
cautions. Even where such a person thinks that the evidence is enough
to seek an injunction under Section 1 or to take other court
proceedings, they can still make a decision not to seek an injunction,
not to take court proceedings, not to give a caution and not to give a
fixed penalty notice. Instead, they can tell the offender to carry out
any action listed in the community remedy document, including making a
payment to the victim.</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Ponsonby, for tabling his amendment. As he explained, it is
probing in nature and seeks to establish a local panel to scrutinise
the strategy and use of cautions and out of court disposals in
particular. I listened carefully to the reasoning given for the
reduction in crime; there were some interesting
comments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120229000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#13120229000083">I
draw your Lordships’ attention to the out of court disposals
review that is currently taking place, in partnership between the
Ministry of Justice and the police, and in conjunction with the Home
Office, the Attorney General’s Office and the Crown Prosecution
Service. The review will look at all out of court disposals currently
used against adults and consider how they might be reformed. The aim is
to ensure that out of court disposals are as effective, simple and
transparent as possible. The review includes conditional cautions and
community resolutions, both of which will be subject to the community
remedy. This public consultation was launched on 14 November to seek
the views and 
<?notus-xml column=72?>experiences of professionals, victims’ organisations and the
public. The consultation will conclude on 9 January and the
review as a whole will conclude later in the

key themes of the review—picking up on a point raised by the
noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby—are transparency and accountability.
The consultation asks the public to consider whether they think there
is more information about out of court disposals that should be shared;
whether they are able to hold the police to account for the way that
out of court disposals are used; and how they think that the Government
can make the out of court disposal system more accountable.</hs_para>

particular, the consultation asks for views on what sort of offences
out of court disposals are appropriate for. I agree that the use of
cautions for serious offences and repeat offenders requires careful
consideration in each specific case. The <I>Review of Simple
Cautions</I>, to which the noble Lord referred, has already been
completed. The review made it clear that cautions should no longer be
used for indictable only offences, and certain serious either-way
offences, unless there are exceptional circumstances, and that those
who persist in criminal activity should no longer expect to receive a
caution. Those changes have been made to the guidance on simple
cautions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120229000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#13120229000086">The
out of court disposals review is also looking at this issue. Currently,
the guidance for all out of court disposals indicates that they are
available for all offenders, but are primarily intended to address
first-time offending. The latest data, for 2012-13, show that 60% of
those getting a caution—that is, either a simple or a
conditional caution—have not received a previous
caution.</hs_para>

the issue of senior officer oversight, the simple cautions review
recommended that there should be greater local accountability and
scrutiny of decision-making. The review further recommended that each
force should have a senior officer identified as responsible who would
provide local leadership and accountability and who would make use of
local scrutiny panels. We are considering that recommendation carefully
as part of the wider out of court disposals review. There are clearly
links between the matters considered in the simple cautions review and
the out of court disposals review, and we will consider these alongside
each other. Further, I assure the noble Lord that the issues he and
others raised in this debate, will be fed into the out of court
disposals

draft guidance on the community remedy signposts existing CPS guidance
on the use of conditional cautions. The community remedy will work with
any changes to conditional cautions or community resolutions that take

restrict any changes to those systems.</hs_para>

will pick up a few points made by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser. He asked
about the crimes for which the remedy might be used. They are low-level
criminal damage, low-value theft, minor assault without injury and
anti-social behaviour, and are currently set out on page 15 of the
draft guidance. In addition, the noble Lord asked whether the offender
could insist on prosecution. The answer is no. He asked whether the

covered that particular issue. I was asked what records are kept. The

Most of us would have thought that the behaviour of some kids in her
street was insignificant—eggs thrown at her windows, for
example. It was annoying and irritating, and it went on for some time,

in legislation or guidance—I would prefer in legislation. One
thing that struck me about the Fiona Pilkington case was the comment

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a good debate

how it might operate in 
<?notus-xml column=77?>practice. We have had the four trials—the noble Baroness, Lady
Smith, referred to the one in Manchester and the report that we have
had on it. We can all agree that persistent anti-social behaviour
causes significant harm to victims. That has been made quite clear by
everybody who has spoken—my noble friend Lady Newlove, the noble
Earl, Lord Lytton, and my noble friend Lady Hamwee. However, people can
sometimes find themselves being passed from the police to the council,
to the landlord and back again, or reporting the same problem over and
over again.</hs_para>

community trigger will give victims and communities the right to demand
that agencies that have ignored repeated complaints take action. It is
an important safety net and is at the heart of our reforms
to put the victim at the centre of the response to anti-social
behaviour. I hope that no authority in every instance to has
to wait to be reminded three times of anti-social behaviour. Some
anti-social behaviour will need immediate response, but the community
trigger will give victims the right to a review of the
authority’s response when three notifications have been
made.</hs_para>

56K, from the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Basildon, relates to the
threshold for using the community trigger. The Bill provides that the
threshold will include the number of complaints that a victim has made
in a certain timeframe; for example, three complaints in six months.
However, it will also include an assessment of the victim’s
vulnerability, because we know that it is often the most vulnerable in
our society who are at greatest risk. Many agencies complete a risk
assessment when a case is reported, and will revisit the assessment
periodically, because vulnerability and resilience to vulnerability
change over time in certain cases, though not in all.</hs_para>

they are being deliberately targeted and how much it has affected
them—and the support available to the victim, such as whether
they live alone or have a close network of friends and family, and
whether their health is affected. The answers are scored and the result
provides an indication of the potential harm—I use that phrase
definitively, because it appears in the Bill—that may be caused
to the victim. It is not a definitive assessment, but it assists the

cuts to the support mechanisms for the most vulnerable in our society
and a compounding of the problem through the increases in the cost of

us just imagine what that looks like. Picture the Millennium Stadium
full. Now picture it again and again and again. The number of people
living in poverty in Wales today would be enough to fill the Millennium

course, the point is that those cuts will not be equally distributed;
they will be focused on those least able to cope with them. Merthyr
Tydfil will be one of the areas hardest hit in the whole of Britain,
where adults will lose an average of £722 per year. The biggest
single loss of income will be felt by around 350,000 working-age
benefit claimants and 330,000 families in receipt of tax credits as a
result of increasing benefits in line with inflation by the consumer
prices index rather than the retail prices index in future. This
matters because the CPI inflation rate does not take into account rises
in mortgages, rents and council tax. Guess what? These are going up,
fairly significantly.</hs_para>

when you think it cannot get any worse you hear that the Government
plan to reduce the income of 42,000 disabled people in Wales by
removing their disability living allowance, costing them around
£55 to £83 a week. This also means that their carers lose
carer’s allowance. This will not mean that they cut down on
little luxuries. There was never a latte in the local coffee shop for
these people. They will have to decide between putting the heating on
and feeding their children. Approximately 600,000 children live in
Wales and of these around 200,000 are living in poverty—one in
three of the total—according to a new report 
<?notus-xml column=81?>from Save the Children. Wales has the highest rate of child poverty of
any nation in the UK. What does this mean in reality? It means that
parents are skipping meals and are dreading Christmas as they know they

want to touch briefly on the bedroom tax. This policy is ripping people
away from their communities or forcing them into the hands of loan
sharks. Again, Wales is hardest hit, with 46% of housing benefit
recipients who live in social housing affected—40,000
households. Let me give a picture of what this policy means for Emma.
Emma is 57 and lives alone in a three-bedroomed social housing
property. She took tenancy of the property with her husband,
who died two years ago. She has lived in the property for 25
years and brought her children up there. She looks after her
grandchildren and is in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance of
£71 a week. Once she has paid the bedroom tax of £18.50 a
week, TV licence at £2.75, travel at £5, electricity at
£10, telephone at £5, water at £8.50 and gas at
£10 she is left with £11.25 a week for
everything else. Emma is still making a valuable contribution to
society but can anyone pay for all their food, clothes and other basic
requirements for a civilised life from £11.25 a week? Wales is

that the Welsh Government are sensitive to the pressures of costs

week, up from 16 hours, to qualify for working tax credits. These
people have demonstrated that they are able and willing to work but
they will lose up to £3,800 a year if they are unable to find
additional hours. Wales has seen the largest increase in the UK of
people who want to work more hours but cannot find them due to the

However, it is not just the people living on welfare who are suffering.
Wales has the highest proportion of workers of anywhere in the UK,
around 300,000 people—the same as the population of
Cardiff—earning less than the living wage. Minimum wage jobs
account for close to 7% of jobs in Wales compared with the average of
5% across the UK. Labour local authorities are leading the way in

Bourne of Aberystwyth (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the
noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, on securing this debate. It is good to see
the spotlight on Wales. The noble Baroness and I go back quite a way. I
anticipated that there would be some valid points and some party
political ones and there were some of both although they did not often
coincide, sadly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T19:48:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
I thought, first, I would look at some of the points on welfare,
secondly, look at the cost of living issues and then, thirdly, try to
put it in the context of Wales in general, particularly looking at some
of the devolved elements that
apply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#1312032000002">The
welfare changes have to be seen against the background of the deficit.
The noble Baroness did allude to that. The deficit did not suddenly
happen. A gaping deficit confronted the country in 2010 as Gordon Brown
left office and the coalition Government under David Cameron took over.
I think it was common ground among the parties that this deficit needed
to be dealt with. Against that background, it was anticipated, and
indeed acknowledged, that welfare reform was a key part of that. There
have often been warm words 
<?notus-xml column=83?>from the Official Opposition about the need to tackle welfare reform,
but nothing specific, and when any particular reform is put forward
they always shoot it down. We need more than warm words. We need some
concrete evidence of what they would do.</hs_para>

the reform process the most vulnerable need protection. We have sought
to do that with pensioners. For example, pensioners are now getting a
protected pension with a rise in line with the consumer prices index,
or average earnings, or of 2.5%. That did not happen under the previous
Government and there was, on one occasion at least, a derisory increase
which was howled down even by people on the Labour side. We need to
recognise that pensioners are being protected, as they are on the spare
room subsidy. The noble Baroness referred to that welfare
reform.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312032000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#1312032000004">On
some of the cost of living issues, first, what has happened on energy
bills did not suddenly happen. The noble Baroness is well aware of
that, having worked as a director for an energy company for much of the
period in which these increases were happening. I am sure that her
abilities and talents were being used to try to keep those increases
down. But this is not something that suddenly happened and we are
seeking to address that, too.</hs_para>

Baroness did not refer to was the fact that employment has remained
strong. Indeed, it has gone up at a time when it was anticipated,
certainly by the right honourable Leader of the Opposition, that
unemployment would go up. That has not happened. It has gone down in
Wales in the past year by 22,000. Some policies have been pursued
effectively in Wales by the Welsh Government; for example, on
enterprise zones, a policy of the coalition Government, but with a
Welsh spin. I declare an interest as a chair of the Haven Waterway
enterprise zone in Pembrokeshire. We have seen local unemployment fall
in Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire over the past several months,
which is all to the good. Again, there is agreement among the parties,
and this is certainly the case in Wales, that there had to be a move
from public sector growth to private sector growth. That has long been
anticipated.</hs_para>

something in a wider context about the devolved settlement after 14 and
a half years of devolution. I strongly support devolution, of course,
but that does not mean that I support all the policies that have been
pursued in Wales. We have seen Welsh GDP fall back not just against
English GDP, although that has been the case over the past 14 years,
but as against many parts of eastern Europe. We are now behind them,
too. Sadly, that is something to be placed at the foot of the devolved
Government. The noble Baroness also referred to increases in council
tax, but one reason for those is that the freeze which has happened in
England has not happened in Wales. That is because the Welsh Government
choose not to use the Barnett money to reduce council tax in Wales.
That is their privilege but it has been the main reason that council
tax has gone up by so much in Wales. That needs to be
recognised.</hs_para>

ask the noble Baroness to use her undoubted talents to persuade the
Labour Party to embrace the Silk commission on Part 1. Again, I 
<?notus-xml column=84?>declare an interest as a commissioner on the Silk commission. The power
of taxation and the power to borrow money, which largely do not exist
in Wales at the moment, would be all to the good. Such powers would
strengthen Wales’s hand and the Welsh economy. I hope that we
can develop consensus among the four parties so that we are able to

year when the Chief Secretary to the Treasury left a note saying that
there was no money left. The noble Baroness took some populist swipes
and pressed the right buttons about bankers and about a Cabinet full of
millionaires who had had private education. I did not know that she was
personally opposed to private education. She also talked about the poll

obesity and excessive alcohol, with £140 million going on that

That is not the way to go about legislation. Those policies should be
fully discussed and open to amendment in Cardiff itself. I could go on
at length. However, when it comes to accountability, how is it that the
First Minister of Wales puts off a referendum for introducing tax
powers which would make that Government accountable to the people of

declare my interest. I am a consultant to the Welsh Government in
developing a cultural heritage strategy for Wales which will, I hope,
address the problems of poverty and disadvantage to greater effect in
Wales. My greater interest is that I grew up in Wales at a time when it
was celebrated as being among the most successful and spirited
communities in the country. The same places are now notorious for
levels of disadvantage. The toxic concentration of long-term
unemployment, underemployment, low skills, low wages, chronic sickness
and low educational achievement has not only reduced living standards
but reflects living standards in Wales. The Government of Wales are
absolutely right to say that poverty in Wales is everybody’s
business, which is why every government department in Wales has to make
a contribution—and that includes culture.</hs_para>

generation who do not know what it means to go to work; we have an
entrenched low-skills and low-pay culture and there is no room at all,
anywhere, for complacency in Wales. These people

was at the end of the 19th century, where surveys and investigators
come to look at the impact of poverty. The figures are horribly
familiar: 26.5% are economically inactive, higher than the rest of
Britain by 3.5 percentage points. Disability rights, as my noble friend
has said, have hit disabled people in Wales
hardest of all. With the transition from IB to ESA, the loss by 2014-15

Morgan of Drefelin (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the
noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Ely, on securing this important debate.
It is great to have a spotlight on Wales. I know that time is very
short so I will confine my remarks to the findings of an extremely
revealing snapshot report published by Shelter Cymru in November this
year. It looked at “the bedroom tax”—I do not want
to cause offence to the Minister by not referring to it as “the
spare room subsidy”—and, based on Shelter’s direct
experience, working with people in housing need in Wales, it reported a
real increase in the number of people threatened with homelessness as a
result of the spare room subsidy, or bedroom tax. It said that
landlords were pursuing possession proceedings, sometimes when the
bedroom tax was the sole source of arrears, and that some vulnerable
people, very worryingly, were facing real injustices because of the
failure of their local authorities to provide the level of service
suitable to their needs.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312032000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#1312032000024">All this paints a
worrying picture but I ask the Minister to respond to two specific
important points. First, what can the UK Government do, in partnership
with the Welsh Assembly Government, to encourage social services to
work together with housing agencies to ensure that vulnerable people
are not unfairly subject to possession proceedings? Shelter Cymru has
seen a number of cases where the bedroom tax has caused serious
difficulties for people who should have been protected due to their
vulnerability. In one case, a woman in a three-bedroom house was facing
possession action for rent arrears but was unable to move. She was in
the process of having her two children returned to her from care. If
she downsized, she would not have been able to have her children back.
However, because the children were not resident, her discretionary
housing payment application was turned down. Only after
Shelter Cymru’s intervention did social services agree to clear
the arrears and consider paying the shortfall until the children could
be returned to their mother. What does the Minister feel that she can
do to help bring those agencies together in the interests of vulnerable
people?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#1312032000025">Secondly,
I ask the Minister for her response to the handling of the
discretionary housing payments, specifically for disabled tenants. We
all know that this was a key measure in the Government’s
approach to the introduction of the spare room subsidy—or
bedroom tax. The provision of funding for discretionary housing
payments was, as I understand it, intended to soften the impact, albeit
in the short term. However, while discretionary housing payments have
indeed offered a temporary lifeline for some households in Wales, some
landlords are not routinely letting tenants know about 
<?notus-xml column=88?>DHPs and there is great concern about the future increase in
homelessness that this will lead to down the track when people’s
awards run
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#1312032000026">In
particular, there is serious concern that many housing benefit
departments are counting disability-related benefits as income for the
purposes of DHP, making it considerably less likely that disabled
people can successfully apply. We know that it is within local
authorities’ discretion to disregard income from
disability-related benefits when making their assessments for DHP,
since these benefits are intended to be used for the extra costs of
disability. Surely it must be good practice for these
disability-related benefits to be completely disregarded in calculating
eligibility for these important transitional payments. If not, it means
that disabled people need to work extra hard to justify their case in
applying for DHP. As we know, there is nothing in the letter of the law
to prevent local authorities from doing this, but I would argue that
this really is extremely poor practice. It means that while disabled
tenants are more likely to be affected by the bedroom tax, they are
less likely to be able to access this assistance. They have fewer
options to self-mitigate the impact of these reforms as they will often
have to wait longer in order to achieve a downsize option.</hs_para>

Howarth of Newport (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I ask the Minister:
what responsibility do the Government consider they have to assist the
industrial areas of Wales? Wales is experiencing economic change on an
unprecedented scale and at an unprecedented pace. Digital technology,
globalisation and the rise of new industrial economies have unleashed
tsunamis of disruption on the regions that pioneered the first
Industrial Revolution, notably south and south-east Wales. The mature
industries of Wales are being battered by competition from businesses
in newly industrialised economies that enjoy state-of-the-art
technology, which Welsh industries certainly ought also to have, and
pay very low wages, which could not and should not be paid in
Wales.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312032000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#1312032000029">Where
manufacturing continues and prospers—and there are still
magnificent manufacturing businesses in Wales, and we are very proud of
them—the workforce is being hollowed out by automation and
off-shoring. That hollowing out is occurring among the white collar
workforce as well as the blue collar workforce. We are seeing the
development of the gap between the 1% and the 99%, with fabulous
increases in wealth and income for a tiny minority at the top and
really significant real-terms falls in income for a great many people
lower down the scale. Therefore, the challenge for the Government is to
develop policies to overcome the traumatic distributive consequences of
contemporary economic growth.</hs_para>

duty to help businesses and individuals cope with this whirlwind of
economic change, but the coalition’s response to that challenge

financial services and exportable services, the Chancellor has
engineered an asset bubble, which he calls a recovery. The Governor of

recovery but, from the Chancellor’s point of view, these are
policies not in the interests of Wales but to help his party get

benefits and at the same time he cuts the taxes of the 1%. Instead of a
strategy to raise our educational levels and skills to those of our

tax-raising powers; thus they would be able to borrow to pay for
infrastructure and all will be well. Ministers must know that that
strategy is disingenuous. The sums cannot possibly add up. Devolution

Anderson of Swansea (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I commend the
initiative of my noble friend, in part because she focuses on the
issues of real concern to the people of Wales and not to the elites. I
cannot plausibly claim that there was some recent golden age in which 
<?notus-xml column=91?>we were close to the top of the UK premier division of prosperity and
jobs. However, I do claim that our position is poor and deteriorating
relatively as a result of government policies. We no longer have the
high-wage jobs we had in the past. We now seem increasingly to
specialise in low-wage, tedious jobs in areas such as call centres.
Jobs in the high-paying financial sector elude us. Regional job
creation and decentralisation of government entities, such as the Royal
Mint and the DVLA in Morriston, seem to have

Silk report has some alarming statistics on earnings differentials. Of
the 1.4 million taxpayers in Wales, only 4,000 paid tax at the

squeeze on public sector jobs. There is greater poverty, greater
dependence on welfare and, therefore, more vulnerability to the
Government’s welfare changes. The Rowntree Foundation report,

the highest proportion of workers who earned less than the living wage

will make three points. First, earlier, we heard about the
Government’s plans to cut energy bills. However, it appears that
they will do little to help off-grid consumers, of whom there are many
in rural Wales. My party, Plaid Cymru, wants to see the establishment
of a not-for-distributable-profits company, Energy Wales, which could
buy gas and electricity on the wholesale market, pass on savings to
consumers and invest in services. Dwr Cymru provides a viable model for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:25:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#1312032000050">Secondly,
I draw attention to the 51% increase in excess winter deaths in Wales
compared with the UK-wide figure of 29%. Last year’s figures
showed Wales increasing from 1,260 to 1,900. Hardship can lead not only
to misery but to death. People in rural communities in particular are
suffering. That is why I want to see winter fuel payments made earlier
in the year to off-grid pensioners so that they can buy gas at a lower
price<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:26:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0002.htm#1312032000051">Thirdly,
I will not trespass into Barnett, but I will point out that if the
total public spending per capita in Wales was at the same level as that
of Scotland in 2012-13, Wales would have received a staggering
additional £1.6 billion—more than £500 per person.

the key actions that we have taken to help hard-working people is to
reduce the income tax burden by raising the threshold to

in Wales out of income tax altogether and will benefit 1.1 million
taxpayers in Wales. That will make a real difference to low-income

and encouraging investment in our energy infrastructure, which will

has got steadily worse. The picture on GVA, which several noble Lords
referred to, is also one where Wales, versus the rest of the UK, has
steadily declined since the turn of the century. These are not issues

concerns from noble Lords about government policy to reform the

there are, for example, 200,000 people in Wales who could work but who
have never worked. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews,
for pointing out that this is a third-generation problem in Wales, not
something that started recently. Worklessness is a persistent problem
in Wales and successive Governments have failed to reform the system.
However, this Government are working tirelessly to improve the
incentive to work, as work remains the best route out of

important that local authorities in Wales are pursuing that in the way
that they should. I was concerned, however, to hear the noble Baroness

to social landlords—are not letting tenants know about
discretionary housing payments in some cases. I will take that issue up

Bourne, made reference to council tax increases. Once again, those are,
as he pointed out, the decision of the Labour Government in Wales. As a

the Government should heed the wisdom of the many people who are in
favour of this amendment and not stick to the somewhat tired, hackneyed
argument that fewer orders mean less bureaucracy. There is real fear
that, in setting their face against the overwhelming support for dog

they are weakening public protection, which is the key point

our other amendments in this group. One concerns a risk assessment of
seized dogs. Obviously, we appreciate and understand that some dogs
have to be seized for public safety, and sometimes for the dog’s
own protection if there is immediate concern about its potential to
attack a member of the public or another dog. In those cases, clearly
the dog has to be seized, and local authorities and the police can
seize dogs that they deem to be dangerous. However, concerns have been
raised with us by organisations, including the RSPCA, that on occasion
dogs are returned to their owners, or released from kennels, in not
exactly tip-top condition; indeed, they are in a poorer condition than
when they went in. Not only is that bad for the dog; it is extremely
bad for the public purse if dogs are kept in kennels for longer than is
necessary. Therefore, we suggest that within 48 hours of a dog being
seized its behaviour should be properly assessed by suitably qualified
people to determine whether it needs to remain in kennels and whether
it is a prohibited breed of dog. This simple amendment seeks to improve
the case management of seized dogs, thereby improving their condition
and easing the burden on the public
purse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000078">Our
amendment 56MC proposes that joint guidance should be issued by Defra

legislation to deal with dangerous dogs. I do not know whether the
Minister has had the opportunity to review the guidance but it is
pretty weighty. Not only is there the guidance itself, but annexes as
well. Animal welfare organisations have repeatedly asked the Government

<?notus-xml column=98?>to reduce the length of the guidance. They have advised me that they do
not consider it fit for purpose given that those involved in dog
welfare cannot cope with it. We need to have concise, accurate guidance

conclusion, the increase in dog-related deaths in recent years is
extremely sad and worrying. These amendments seek to include effective,
clear measures in legislation to deal specifically with the problems

application to dangerous dogs. I hope that the Minister will look
favourably on these amendments and consider, first, the issue of dog

the background to these amendments. However, there are a couple of
issues that I wish to raise. I do not believe that these amendments are
going to be carried but they show some of the fundamental problems that
we are facing. One of the major problems is the Dangerous Dogs Act
1991. That was a knee-jerk reaction which led to types of dogs being
named. Amendment 56LF talks about trying to work out what prohibited
dogs are; for instance, a pit bull is actually a mongrel, so is very
difficult to define as a particular type of dog. Breeders of pit bulls
call them long-legged Staffies; they attempt to get round it that way.
An expert trying to look at this has had difficulty, and it has cost
the Metropolitan Police and the police in Liverpool and in other places
millions of pounds kennelling those animals. I know that this is a
specific 
<?notus-xml column=99?>point but there are cost implications of trying to work out within 48
hours whether the dog is a prohibited animal. Behavioural assessment
will also cause difficulties because a lot of this work will fall to
the dog charities. At the moment they are facing a massive problem with
bull breeds being
abandoned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000085">The
issue of protected animals is raised in these amendments and we might
well come back to it in further pieces of legislation. It is a
particularly difficult issue to deal with. I have a rather useless and
cowardly dog, but next door’s cat is particularly on his wish
list. I do everything I can to try to stop him chasing this cat, but if
a cat were seen as a protected animal—which it is not at the
moment, though I know some people are calling for it—that would
be a problem we would have to look at.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312032000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000086">I understand the tenor
of these amendments, and that this is an issue that we may return to
further down the line if the Bill does not achieve its objectives. The
Government deserve commendation for the attitude taken by the Minister
and by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, who met and worked closely with
us. That the guidance runs to more than 100 pages is a problem, because
who is going to read it? If people do not read and understand the
guidance and realise where it fits with other pieces of legislation,
there is going to be a problem of enforcement. I have to admit that I
found it difficult just reading the Bill and cross-referencing it. I
hope that the Minister will consider attaching a very short
précis to the start of the guidance to make the issue
simpler.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-02?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_02_PT_1/C173208F106758B8A07FD645E5831A1A7E6C78BF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 2 December 2013">Monday,

I had the privilege of meeting them recently when they gave Peers a

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:57:28"></hs_TimeCode> am sure that

similar impact to issuing a dog control notice. However, it is clear
that community protection notices are inadequate. Their shortcoming
lies in their broad application. The Commons EFRA Select Committee

That is vital when it comes to tackling dog-related incidents.
Preventive measures address much earlier both repeat offenders and
one-off attacks affecting individuals. We believe that the measures set
out in our amendment are far superior to CPNs, as they are specifically
aimed at dogs. The RSPCA’s statistics fully support this
conclusion. In England and Wales in 2012 it issued 12,658 informal
advice notices, which, in practice, are similar to DCNs. The compliance

straight off, in that under my roof there are not one, not two, but
three rottweilers that live quite well. I have taken lessons from that
immortal movie, “Crocodile Dundee”, in which he calmed
the rottweilers. I am used to having dogs. Living in the wilds of Angus
in Scotland, one goes out sporting with dogs; one has labradors and
spaniels. I have also become acquainted with dogs in the course of my
political duties. During 1974, I went off into Forfar. In the spare
spaces there on the council estates were packs of large dogs. I was
told, “For goodness’ sake, take care: you may get
bitten”. I armed myself; in one pocket of my coat I had Smarties
and small beans. In the other pocket I had Rolos and a large Mars bar.
It may be incorrect—I will wait to hear from my noble friend and
the experts—but I found that those forbidden, or not, substances
were a particular help. On the second or third night that I was
carrying out what I call political duties, I found that there were old
friends who recognised that this was the man with the Rolos or the
large Mars bar. As far as I was concerned, that kept dogs under
control.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312032000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000099">I do

knowledge the progress made in extending the law regarding private
property and dangerous dogs. In supporting 
<?notus-xml column=102?>the amendments, I do not wish to undermine the Government's proposed
action but rather to strengthen it. I recognise that the noble Lords,
Lord Henley, Lord De Mauley and now Lord Taylor of Holbeach, are fully
in sympathy with the plight of the 23,000 postal workers who have been
attacked and injured both physically and mentally by dogs in the past
five years. They have been on the rounds, as it were, and witnessed
what the CWU members are up against. Again, I fully acknowledge the

also appreciate that the Government wish to simplify and rationalise
the law around anti-social behaviour. But in attempting this, I do not
believe that they recognise the specialist requirements for dealing

my noble friend Lady Gale said, having met some of the parents of
children killed and maimed by dogs, it is clear that the human cost is
devastating. However, the economic cost is also worrying, with the loss
of approximately 4,500 working days due to injuries sustained by postal
workers. Campaigners feel strongly that the introduction
of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:06:08"></hs_TimeCode> dog control
notices would provide an effective preventive measure for alerting the
authorities to the potential for dogs that could act dangerously in the
future. In nearly every case, attacks have been the culmination of
incidents that, if put together and acted upon, could have prevented
that accident. The Government have argued that the new “flexible
tools package” of orders will be as effective as the dog control
notices introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland, if not more so.
However, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, as my noble
friend Lady Smith has already pointed out, does not agree with that
argument<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:06:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000104">Specific
dog control notices would be a message for the dog owner to take action
before an attack and would raise the profile and awareness among dog
owners. Many of them exercise their dogs in public parks. They get to
know each other and also know the good dog owners and the not so good
ones. It would encourage a communal network. Issuing dog control
notices should be a simple procedure. They could be issued by those
trained to recognise examples of poor control. Action should be taken
on the first occasion that a dog attacks anyone. It is the first time
in studying for this debate that I have heard of this “one
bite” rule or “one free bite” rule, which is
appalling and trivialises the seriousness of the issue.</hs_para>

PDSA has estimated that more than 1 million dogs display aggressive
behaviour towards people and pets on a weekly basis. Its research shows
that an overwhelming 87% of people believe that pet owners should face
tough penalties if their dog attacks another person or animal. For the
Government to introduce penalties for attacks on private property is
commendable, but they are after the event, after the injury and after
the death. Specific dog control notices would establish a framework to
encourage better behaviour, preventing serious incidents and would
establish a record of behaviour
patterns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:08:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000106">The
overall impact assessment concentrates entirely on the issue of making
it a criminal offence to allow a dog to be dangerously out of control
on private property 
<?notus-xml column=103?>belonging to the owner of the dog. That is hardly surprising, but it is
concentrating on legal sanctions after an attack. As I have already
said, many attacks are the culmination of behaviour that is well known
in the community. The overall impact assessment then refers us to the
specific impact assessment on these measures published at the same time
as the Bill. That took a bit of finding. It dates back to 9 May 2013. I
assume that it has not been
updated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:09:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Looking
at the specific impact assessment, the concentration is on replacing
dog control orders with public spaces protection orders, with community
protection notices replacing litter clearing notices and defacement
removal notices. There is no mention of dangerous dogs, although I
understand that it is supposed to be an overall umbrella notice which
covers everything.</hs_para>

realise that the subject of dog control notices has been debated in the
other House, and despite all the major stakeholders supporting this and
the proposals for compulsory microchipping, the Government have set
their face against it. Obviously, local government is in a difficult
position, as it is strapped for cash and cutting back on areas such as
dog wardens. Therefore it is not surprising that it has shown no
enthusiasm for dog control notices. However, the concern is that
community protection notices would be a blunt and unwieldy measure. The
danger is that they would be slow to serve and open to challenge in the

that is the case, why are the two impact assessments completely silent
on this? Looking through the draft guidance for front-line
professionals on the reform of anti-social behaviour powers, the
section on community protection notices makes no reference to dogs. It
does say that before anyone is issued with a community protection
notice, the accused should be given a written warning—presumably
posted through the letterbox by a postal worker. We have to get to page
48 of the 64-page draft guidance before the actual word
“dog” is used, and that is only in relation to public

further guidance will the Minister give on issues such as the

receipt of one of these new community protection

accompany a community protection notice? Nothing in the draft

Lady Donaghy. Much of this Bill is about anti-social behaviour where
someone is “likely to” do something, “threatens

causing harm and various sorts of problems. This is all about people.
The dog provisions which we are being asked to consider in these
amendments are preventive, not reactive. I would like to see much more
of a similar attitude to “likely” behaviour or
“possible” behaviour of dogs in the preventive way that

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:04:59"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, this
has been an interesting debate, particularly for me. When I became a
Minister in Defra, a little over two years ago, one of my first
priorities was to consider the whole business of dogs. I was motivated
by exactly the same sentiments as most noble Lords have been: that
attacks on communications workers, children and adults by dogs are
unacceptable. They are a cause of great distress, and I wanted to do
something about it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312032000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000114">Roughly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:15:04"></hs_TimeCode>
two years ago—in December, at any rate—we had the first
round table of all the dog charities and various interested parties,

Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:15:03"></hs_TimeCode>. We found
that we had an awful lot of common ground. I think that underlying this
debate is an awful lot of common ground. I am pleased that noble Lords
have welcomed the fact that the Government are dealing with this issue.
My noble friend Lord De Mauley, now in Defra, is seeing through a
number of things, including the issue of microchipping of dogs. Defra
has produced its own manual on dogs. The anti-social behaviour guidance
for professionals is one document, but another slightly more
substantial document is available to deal with dogs. I took note of the
reference of the noble Baroness—or was it my noble friend Lord
Redesdale?—to its size and the fact that some simplification of
it might be
due<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:16:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000115">I

Lady Smith. I also thank my noble friends Lady Hamwee and Lord

shall deal with the specific items to which noble Lords have spoken.
First, because it is the most significant and I think everyone has
mentioned it, Amendment 56MA provides for dog control notices. I put it
on 
<?notus-xml column=105?>record that I fully understand the intention behind the amendment. The
Government agree that there is a genuine need for an additional tool to
address poor dog ownership and enable early action to prevent dog bites
and attacks. We should not have the one-bite law; we should be able to
anticipate the bite before it happens. I accept
that.</hs_para>

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:17:54"></hs_TimeCode> hope that I
can go some way to showing that the provision is not necessary and that
everything the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, wants from such a notice is
already available to enforcement authorities in the provisions in Parts
1 to 4, as noble Lords have said. The very same new clause was debated
and rejected on Report in the Commons. The measures in Parts 1 to 4 can
address all types of irresponsible behaviour with a dog, regardless of
its specific manifestation. For example, a community protection notice
can be served in cases where there are too many dogs in one home, where
an owner does not have proper control of his dog, where a dog strays
and in many other scenarios too.</hs_para>

that all the requirements suggested under the new clause such as
muzzling, neutering, microchipping, keeping a dog on a lead, attending
training classes can all be required under a community protection

there in the Bill. I take some comfort from the fact that

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000119">Moreover,
the measures in this Bill go further and are far more flexible. They
allow officers to make any reasonable requirements based on the
specifics of the case with which they are dealing. For example, the CPN

the presence of a dog, to fix a post-box guard or to mend fencing to

is “out of control” already and the notice does not
appear therefore to be preventive. The test for the CPN is much more
useful and applicable. The behaviour of the dog owner or the person in
charge of the dog simply needs to have a detrimental effect of a
persistent or continuing nature on the quality of life of those in the
locality. It can address issues concerning the owner as well as the dog
and sometimes the two things go hand-in-hand. This could involve all
manner of possibilities including allowing a dog to be out of control.
It could include scenarios where the dog or dogs are not out of control
but, for example, where there are too many dogs on a property, an owner
persistently allows their dog to foul in a public space, or even where
a dog is threatening a legitimate visitor to a property, such as a
postal

note the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, about the
requirement in the CPN for a written warning. I assure her that that is
not a problem. It will not delay a notice being issued. In fact, it is
a helpful addition to the measures. The provision for a written warning
is in place for a number of reasons. It ensures that suitable evidence
can be provided to meet the 
<?notus-xml column=106?>threshold test of persistent or continuing behaviour, which is one of
the elements of a CPN. In terms of use, a written warning could be a
simple tear-off form. Alternatively, a written warning could be
included in any correspondence with the individual of an acceptable
behaviour contract which makes it clear that any breach will result in
the issuing of a CPN. There need not be much of a delay between the
written warning and the issuing of the CPN itself. It is a very
flexible measure that can be used to address owner, premises and
dog.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312032000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000123">For
example, let us say that a dog is running out of control in a park and
perhaps is frightening children. The officer sees this happening and
requests the owner to bring their dog under control and put it on a
lead. The owner fails to do this so the officer issues a written
warning that they will issue a CPN unless the person complies. In many
cases that will be sufficient for the person to take the necessary
action but, should they refuse for whatever reason, the officer could
wait for a short time—perhaps five minutes—before issuing
the CPN. There has not been an unacceptable delay and the CPN should
secure the necessary behaviour change. In many cases, a CPN will not be
needed because the written or even verbal warning will have done the
trick.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000124">I hope
the Committee will agree that it is better for a dog owner to address
the problem themselves rather than to be compelled to do so under the
terms of a notice. In our earlier debates many noble Lords pointed to
the virtues of early, non-statutory interventions before the powers in
the Bill are exercised. I note too that the noble Baroness had a
concern that dog issues may be lost in the
breadth of ASB measures and be downgraded by local authorities. I do
not accept that concern. Local authority dog wardens have dogs as their
priority. They, other local authority officers and the police will be
able to use these powers in relation to dogs. I believe they will
greatly enhance what they can do for dogs. We have been careful to
explain in the draft practitioners’ manual how they can be
applied to dogs, which I will cover later on. I will just say at this
stage that the manual includes some excellent examples of how local
authorities have been able to co-ordinate initiatives to tackle
problems with dogs. These new powers will go a long way to helping
those
initiatives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000125">I
recognise that some animal welfare organisations continue to support
and argue for the introduction of specific dog control notices.
However, the practitioners—the people who will be actually using

There will be simplification, but also flexibility. Crucially, it will
allow them to do more with less. The Local Government Association is on

dealing with dogs. I note that a number of noble Lords said that it is
fairly bulky. Well, it is. It has two basic elements: the legal
guidance and a specific guide to particular issues. However, I am told

been drafted in co-operation with local authorities, the police and the
Welsh Government and I thank them for their support. We are
looking for comments so that we may ensure that we are equipping
officers with what they need. The existence of the draft manual shows
that we aim to produce such guidance as envisaged by

Many people can very satisfactorily control dogs that are not on leads.
Likewise, with regard to muzzling, I want defined once and for all
whose liability it is, what the requirements are and, above all, who an
appropriate person might be. This is only a first step in a
still-unfolding problem. I wish it was not. People have seen
dogs—their own or other people’s—practically
shredded in public places and parks. Very often, those in charge of
them are attacked at the same time. It happens too often, but perhaps
not sufficiently often for it to be an even bigger public issue than it

community protection notice and, in some cases, the injunction to

make requirements of the owner to ensure that the dog is brought under

Act 1871. Based on the evidence before it and using the
civil burden of the balance of probabilities, the court can impose an
order that requires the dog to be muzzled, on a lead or, in the most
serious cases, destroyed.</hs_para>

Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 where a dog is dangerously out of control, and
it is right that we maintain that threshold for this criminal offence.
In other cases, where a dog is more generally out of control,
authorities may require the owner to be subject to the new measures,
such as the CPN introduced in the Bill, or may use the Dogs Act 1871.
Given that there are a number of ways to address an incident such as
the one described by my noble friend, and in the spirit of the Bill of
reducing duplicate legislation, I ask my noble friend to withdraw her
amendment. I agree that it may well be useful if I talk to my noble

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, government Amendment 56M
relates to the maximum penalty for dog attacks. Following an amendment
tabled in Committee in the House of Commons by Richard Fuller, Defra
consulted over the summer on possible increases to the maximum
sentences for offences under Section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991
of allowing a dog to be dangerously out of control—the very
measure that we have been discussing in the previous amendment.
Specifically, that is the aggravated offence where an out-of-control
dog kills or injures a person or an assistance
dog.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000151">Some 3,180
people and organisations completed the online survey and a number of
organisations sent written representations. In summary, some 91% of 
<?notus-xml column=113?>respondents considered that the maximum penalty should be increased. We
have taken into account the results from the survey, the written
representations and the need for the maximum penalty to be
proportionate to the offence.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312032000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000152">The amendment provides
for an increase in the maximum penalty for an aggravated offence under
Section 3 of the 1991 Act, to apply in England and Wales, as follows:
14 years’ imprisonment if a person dies as a result of a dog
attack, five years’ imprisonment if a person is injured by a dog
attack, and three years’ imprisonment for an attack on an
assistance dog that results in injury or death of the dog.</hs_para>

the high public concern that two years is an insufficient penalty for
these offences, and the fact that seven adults and 10 children have
died in dog attacks since 2005, and some 10 assistance dogs are
attacked by other dogs every month. As now, each of these offences
could also be punishable by an unlimited fine instead of, or in
addition to, imprisonment; and, of course, the courts have the option
of passing a community
sentence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000154">I
should make it clear that these revised sentences will apply only to
the aggravated form of the offence in Section 3 of the 1991 Act; that
is, the offence where a person or an assistance dog is actually killed
or injured in a dog attack. Where someone actually sets their dog on to
a person, the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 is likely to come
into play. As noble Lords will be aware, the Act comes with its own
sentencing regime. Were someone to be killed by a dog set upon them, if
this is found to be an act of murder or manslaughter, the maximum
sentence that would apply is life imprisonment. As now, it will be for
the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether there is both
sufficient evidence to charge a person with the Section 3 offence and
whether it is in the public interest to mount a prosecution. Once a
case comes to court and a person is found guilty, it will be for the
judge to take into account any mitigating or aggravating factors when
passing sentence. We can, and should, leave it to prosecutors and the
courts to make decisions in light of the facts of each individual
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000155">Of
course, increasing the maximum penalty for dog attacks is only one
aspect of trying to target irresponsible dog ownership and to encourage
more responsible approaches. The Government consulted on a range of
measures to encourage responsible dog ownership in 2012, and published
a summary of results and the way forward in February this year,
including bringing forward the other measures in the Bill relating to
dogs and the compulsory microchipping of dogs by 2016. However, I hope
noble Lords will agree that increasing the maximum penalty in the way
that I have described is an important additional step. I commend the
amendment to the
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000156"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Smith of Basildon" PimsId="5786" UID="1312032000241" xid="2058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000241">Baroness
Smith of Basildon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
noble Lord for bringing this forward and for his explanation. I know he
said at Second Reading that he would bring forward the amendment and he
has been kind enough to write to noble Lords about it. I think this
came from amendments proposed in the other place, where Richard Fuller
raised the point and the Government agreed to do a consultation 
<?notus-xml column=114?>on it over the summer. Therefore, we are supportive and want to see
better sentencing guidelines around dangerous dogs. The culpability of
those responsible and the actions taken against them are central to the
measures the Government have taken. It also comes back to the point I
made to the noble Lord earlier. I do not want to hark on about dog
control offences too much but it is about prevention. Tougher sentences
help with preventing such attacks taking place, and encourage more
responsible dog ownership. That certainly is a
positive.</hs_para>

maximum penalty and we all recognise that in most cases the maximum
penalty would not be the penalty given. Is 14 years comparable with
other legislation? Are there other kinds? Where has this come from? I
am sure it is not something the Minister has just dreamt up. I assume
that there is other legislation that is seen as similar or relevant,
which the period of 14 years would have been taken from.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="1312032000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000159">I think there was some
discussion in the Commons. This measure is for when a person dies as a
result of being injured, but what if a dog is used as a weapon? We know
that there are cases when somebody is injured because a dog is
deliberately set on a person. What if they die? Is that the same
penalty? What if somebody deliberately sets a dog on another animal, or
a pet? With the penalty for somebody who dies as a result of being
injured—in the case of an assistance dog, whether or not it
dies, the penalty is three years—is there any distinction
between an attack occurring when the owner has tried not to have their
dog attack an individual and an attack occurring when the owner sets
the dog on an individual? I do not think that it would be covered by
dog fighting laws, if a human is attacked. If the Minister has any
information on that, it would be
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000160">Furthermore,
is the five years’ imprisonment for a person being injured
something that is found in other legislation? I am speaking slowly,
because I think that inspiration is about to arrive for the Minister on
this issue. Where do the 14 years, five years and three years come
from? Is there comparable legislation? The crucial point is whether the
attack is deliberate, and whether a dog is forced to attack another dog
or person. Many years ago, I helped to home a dog that had been the
victim of quite serious attacks by other dogs. This poor dog was quite
an aggressive creature with other dogs, but it had had half of its jaw
bitten off and was in a terrible state. So I have seen at first hand
and cared for dogs that have been very seriously attacked by other
dogs. I am trying to get to the base of whether this is about something
that happened, which should have been prevented, or something that is
deliberate. It would be very helpful if the noble Lord could answer
these
questions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000161"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="1312032000242" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000242">Lord
Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> The most important thing is to
recognise that the prosecution of these cases is in the hands of the
prosecuting authorities and adjudication of sentences is in the hands
of the court. But there are particular aspects to the legislation. The
noble Baroness 
<?notus-xml column=115?>asked me whether there was something comparable: 14 years’
imprisonment is the same penalty as for causing death by dangerous
driving, so there is a parallel with
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000162">The noble
Baroness made a further point. I thought that I referred to
it—and, certainly, I half thought that I mentioned it in my
previous contribution. It is getting late and my memory may not be
right, but I certainly have it here in my notes and may have said it in
my speech. When a person deliberately sets a dog to injure someone,
using a dog as a weapon, other offences would apply, such as murder or
manslaughter, which as the noble Baroness knows carry a maximum of a
life sentence, if that is shown to be the case. I am sure that I
alluded to that in my previous
remarks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312032000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-0003.htm#1312032000163">Why
did we decide to increase the maximum penalty for injury to a person to

debates on the dog legislation is that they have reinforced the fact
that this is an area in which the legislative framework has been
imperfect. I hope that I have convinced noble Lords on the flexibility

There is specific draft guidance being given to professionals. I shall
make sure that all noble Lords who have spoken in this part of our
discussions this evening, including those who might have done, such as
the noble Lords, Lord Trees and Lord Greaves, get a copy of that
guidance, because it will help future discussions. I hope it will

valuable step in improving our trade relations with Latin America.
Together with our important trade negotiations with such countries as
the US, Japan and Korea, it demonstrates that the EU is looking to
advance its trade with countries large and small, developed and

only have the economies of Peru and Colombia enjoyed strong recent

UK exports to the combination of Colombia and Peru almost doubled. With
this FTA in place, providing British firms with improved access to
these rapidly growing markets, UK export levels should grow even
further. We have already seen a variety of UK firms set up businesses
in these countries, from fragrance house CPL Aromas, to retail firms

this trade agreement. I will mostly confine my remarks to Colombia,
which I was lucky enough to visit last year as part of an IPU

remarks. Originally, this free trade agreement was to be for the whole
Andean region of Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. For reasons which
I imagine partly are what the Minister was alluding to when he said
that this would send a strong message, Bolivia and Ecuador are not
included in this agreement. There are two obvious difficulties with
that. One difficulty is that, for those of us who believe that open
markets and free trade bring prosperity, it will make an even more
two-tier Andean region. We have seen some of the effects of
Colombia’s successful push against illegal coca growing, which
has been pushed towards Bolivia and Peru. I am nervous that we should
do anything further to divide the region when I am sure it would
benefit from a more cohesive
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:38:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000011">That
said, I shall concentrate the rest of my remarks on Colombia.
Obviously, Colombia has particular issues because it is coming out of
decades of conflict and is just entering into, it seems, a successful
peace negotiation. That puts a particular onus on those of us who are
entering into a free trade agreement to put human rights issues right
at the heart of our considerations, partly because human rights are
self-evidently incredibly important but partly because the speed of
development is going to have a tremendous impact on Colombia, with all
the interest in it and indeed with the Colombian Government’s
own efforts to develop its infrastructure and to raise the people of
its regions out of poverty, especially as a lot of the development will
be concentrated on the extractive industries and agriculture.</hs_para>

The Peruvian Government propose that people would have to speak an
indigenous language and to practise communal land ownership to be
entitled to the right of prior consultation, but these practices may
not have survived the disruptive and discriminatory influence of
colonialism and subsequent Administrations. In any case, decisions on
which communities are to benefit from ILO 169 are not to be made for at

thing that the British Parliament has this opportunity to ratify this
agreement. It is often said about the European Union that things are
imposed upon us against our will. This is a case where we, as
Parliament, have to ratify this agreement. That is a good thing. Our
Ministers agreed to the opening of negotiations, originally under the
Labour Government in 2007, for what was then hoped to be the Andean
pact. Ministers have all along supported the Trade Commissioner of the

I think that there is a general view on all sides of the House and
across the United Kingdom that free trade is a good thing and brings
benefits all round. The noble Lord, Lord Popat, outlined what those
economic benefits are; modest perhaps, but worth while from a European
point of view, in the case of these agreements. Free trade has been
part of the British progressive tradition ever since the repeal of the
Corn Laws in the middle of the 19th century. Business has not always
been a strong defender of free trade, though. Joseph Chamberlain wanted
the imperial preference as a result of pressure from West Midlands
manufacturers who wanted protection. Similarly, in the 1930s there was
a lot of protectionist pressure. Generally speaking, however, business
has supported free trade, as have the trade unions, on the principle
that it brings economic benefits all round. But while free trade brings
clear income gains to all the countries that participate in free trade
agreements, such an agreement does not in itself ensure that the income
gains are fairly distributed within those countries or that the wider
questions of democracy and human rights are
guaranteed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T15:56:24"></hs_TimeCode>. That

third general observation is that being members of the EU and
negotiating these agreements through the European Union gives us
enormous potential clout. You have only to look at what happened just
this weekend. The Government in Ukraine are tottering because of a free
trade agreement that the European Union had signed with Ukraine, but
which the Government have decided not to implement. That is an example
of how free trade agreements can be a force for democracy and political
change. But we have a responsibility as members of the EU and thus part
of what is the most powerful trade bloc in the world to use our
economic power as much as we can to promote democracy and human

the situation in Peru in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is,
but certainly Colombia has had an appalling human rights record.
According to one UN source, there have been some 4,716 complaints about
extrajudicial killings by the Colombian army. It is country where the
rule of law falls well short of European standards and one where trade
unionists have been subject to systematic violence and murder. The
record in Colombia shows an appalling number of motorbike
assassinations of community 
<?notus-xml column=8?>and trade union activists. Given that, what should we do? If we wash our
hands of any kind of economic relationship with countries like Colombia
and Peru, we are not advancing the interests of their people. We can
pass resolutions of protest at congresses and in committees, and we can
try to make such countries international pariahs, although I think if
we tried that we would find that there are an awful lot of
international pariahs in this world in the form of countries that do
not reach the standards we set for ourselves. Indeed, the Prime
Minister is presently in a country with, let us say, a poor record of
respect for the rights of trade union organisation, free collective
bargaining and individual liberty. We cannot go around the world
treating countries as pariahs for these reasons. The question is how we

the Official Opposition, is that we must do our best to ensure that the
protections and safeguards in the agreement are used to the maximum
extent. One of the innovations in the agreement was, as I understand
it, provision for the European Parliament to be involved in the

what is likely to be in this report, and assess the latest human rights

Thirdly, will the Government initiate, possibly at European Union
level, a review of the relationship between trade policy and the
promotion of ILO 4standards and human rights monitoring and
enforcement? We need to think about what the relationship should be
between trade policy and these questions and about what part questions
of human rights, trade union rights and social rights should play in
the enthusiasm—which we on this side of the Committee certainly
share—for more free trade agreements to be concluded by the EU,

difficult for the Minister to answer these questions today but I hope
that they will be given proper consideration. I do not think we can
close our eyes to the human rights issues that occur daily in these

predominantly for internal political reasons. However, in May 2013, it
formally expressed interest in resuming negotiations. The Commission
has confirmed that the country has now offered the necessary
clarification on the previous stumbling blocks that remain outstanding.
Bolivia withdrew from the negotiations in September 2008, predominantly
due to its rejection of certain elements of the deal including those on
intellectual property and state purchases. Nevertheless, it remains
open for Bolivia to accede to the agreement, should negotiations
reopen. Contact between Bolivian and EU officials

Committee’s major concern was human rights and what provisions
we have made in this agreement to address those. The European Union is
very strong on human rights and we take a strong view too. The UK
pushed hard for a legally binding human rights clause in the text of
the agreement, which is consistent with our policy to have frank
dialogue with Colombia and Peru on human rights. The clause is backed
up by international law, and Clause 8 of the agreement allows any party
to take appropriate measures against any other party which violates
essential elements. Various monitoring mechanisms, which the noble
Lord, Lord Liddle, mentioned, are in place to make sure that human
rights abuses are well monitored.

primary function of the agreement is to support trade between the EU

growth. However, increased prosperity should support increased respect 
<?notus-xml column=10?>for human rights. The role of monitoring human rights rests with
domestic and international bodies including the United Nations. We
regard trade agreements as important for economic growth and prosperity
in developed and developing countries. This FTA supports that growth
and prosperity. The promotion of the UK’s prosperity and the
promotion and protection of human rights are mutually supportive
priorities that are at the heart of the UK’s foreign
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000045">It
is right that the UK engages with Colombia commercially, as we would do

issue that was touched upon, the role of our embassy in Bogotá.
The embassy supported a UN-led research initiative to help improve the
protection of trade unionist human rights and the development of
positive labour relations, an area cited by the noble Lord, Lord
Liddle. Our embassy is very active on human rights issues, including
employment legislation. It regularly raises individual human rights
cases with the Colombian Government, including those of indigenous
communities that are at particular risk, and meets with individual
human rights defendants. Staff from the embassy have attended the

which have been raised by noble Lords, but we firmly believe that we
should not let these stand in the way of a progressive trade agreement
and fostering a context of prosperity in which human rights will
improve. Liberalising trade brings prosperity and prosperity, in turn,
helps to bring political stability. I strongly commend the free trade
agreement to all Members of the Committee. It delivers not only for
businesses, but for jobs and for consumers in the UK as well as in
Colombia and Peru. Colombia and Peru are fast growing economies where
there is and will continue to be growing demand for UK goods and

My Lords, I am grateful to the many Members of your
Lordships’ House who have taken a close interest in the
Government’s proposal to extend the infrastructure
planning regime to business and commercial development as an
opt-in for developers. This change was debated thoroughly in
your Lordships’ House during the passage of the Growth and
Infrastructure Act 2013. During the evidence sessions held at the start
of the Act’s passage, both the CBI and the British
Chamber of Commerce expressed support for the
Government’s proposal. The CBI said that companies which are
R&amp;D intensive could see scope to use the infrastructure planning
regime
and,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13120216000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000186">“that
those kinds of developments are very much in Britain’s interest
not only from a local point of view in creating local jobs, but in
terms of driving growth and developing Britain’s industrial
strengths”.</hs_quotefo>

British Chamber of Commerce said that it supported the change that
would make it possible for a large industrial development that is
nationally significant and with export potential to benefit from a
faster planning

Growth and Infrastructure Act provided a new provision enabling
business and commercial projects to make use of the nationally
significant infrastructure planning regime, and enabled regulations to
be made setting out the particular types of projects that could benefit
from this option. The Government carried out a consultation last winter
to inform detailed design of these regulations. We received over 100
responses, which have allowed us to refine our approach to ensure that
it will benefit a wide range of businesses. These regulations therefore
prescribe the types of business and commercial projects that will be
able to use the infrastructure planning regime. The regulations do not
place any additional burdens on business but open up the streamlined
infrastructure planning regime as an option for the most significant
business and commercial schemes.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120216000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000050">Increasing the speed
and certainty of the planning regime is vital to our economic growth
and has been a top priority for the Government. The Government have
made significant strides in simplifying and speeding up the planning
system, with the new <I>National Planning Policy Framework</I>
published in 2011, streamlined and web-based planning guidance and
important legislative changes through the Localism Act 2011 and Growth
and Infrastructure Act 2013. However, over the past few years there has
been a decline in the speed with which local planning authorities
determine large-scale major commercial and industrial applications.
This is despite a reduction in the number of cases that authorities
have to process. Over the five years since 2008-09, the proportion of
large-scale major applications that were determined within 13 weeks
fell from 68% to 53%. Delay results in additional costs and uncertainty
to developers, delaying much needed new investment and jobs.
Large-scale major business and commercial schemes 
<?notus-xml column=12?>can be complex and controversial locally and may require a number of
different consents, not just planning
permission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000051">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:16:19"></hs_TimeCode>
response to these concerns, the Government announced their intention to
extend the nationally significant infrastructure planning to business
and commercial projects, as an option for developers. The
infrastructure planning regime—which is focused on nationally
significant projects relating to energy, transport, water, waste and
waste water—allows for a single consent regime which is useful
where multiple consents are required and a streamlined process for
considering applications. The infrastructure planning regime offers a
number of potential benefits to developers, including statutory
timetabling of a maximum of one year from the start of the examination
to decision and removing the potential for call-in or appeal. These
features could provide important benefits to developers of the most
significant business and commercial projects.
Increased<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:17:14"></hs_TimeCode>
certainty could also enable developers of the most significant business
and commercial projects to secure the necessary finance faster to
commence their projects once a decision has been made.
By<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:17:20"></hs_TimeCode> offering a
new, streamlined option for the determination of these business and
commercial projects, we are providing a way for these important
projects to be built more quickly and provide a crucial boost to the

therefore enable business and commercial development—including
offices, research and development, industrial processes, storage or
distribution, conferences, exhibitions, sport, leisure and
tourism—to benefit from the option of using the infrastructure
planning regime. It might assist noble Lords if I briefly explained how
the regulations will work in practice. If a developer wants their
business or commercial project dealt with though the infrastructure
planning regime, they will need first to make a written request to the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to use the
regime. The Secretary of State will make a direction for the
application or proposed application to be determined through the
infrastructure planning regime, if he is satisfied that the project
both falls within one of the prescribed types of project and is
nationally significant.</hs_para>

assist developers, the Government have published the factors that the
Secretary of State will take into account in considering whether a
project is nationally significant or not. These are set out in a policy
statement published alongside the draft regulations, which is available
in your Lordships’ Library and the Printed Paper Office. The
Secretary of State will consider carefully all relevant matters
concerning national significance, including whether the project is
likely to have a significant economic impact over a period of time. Job
creation and new investment into the economy would be taken into
account. Consideration will be given to whether the impact of the
project is wider than a single local authority area; major business or
commercial schemes can generate, for example, economic benefits across
more than one local planning authority area. The Secretary of State
will also take into account the physical size of the project and its
importance to the delivery of a nationally significant infrastructure 
<?notus-xml column=13?>project or other significant development. This could potentially benefit
a complex mixed-use business

the direction is given, the project will need to comply with the
requirements of the nationally significant infrastructure planning
regime. These requirements include comprehensive pre-application
consultation with the local community, local authorities and statutory
consultees. The local authority plays a vital role in the
infrastructure planning regime, preparing a local impact report and
representing the views of the community during the pre-application and
examination stages. This enables developers to recognise and understand
the issues for local communities and allows them to refine their
proposals

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for her very full introduction of these regulations. She also thanked
the many Members of the House who took an interest in the Growth and
Infrastructure Bill—clearly a waning interest given the lack of
presence in the Committee today. However, we all agree on the
importance of generating new investment and jobs for our economy. I
think it is fair to say that these regulations carry no surprises in so
far as they are entirely consistent with the June 2013 response to the
November 2012 consultation. They are part of a range of measures which
have as their root the assumption that it is the planning system which
is holding back growth and that opening up pathways for developers to
circumvent local planning authorities should be facilitated. We could
spend a long time debating this—the purpose of planning, the
engagement of local communities, the balanced judgments that good
planning should entail and much else—but clearly we have before
us an SI that emanates from primary legislation which we must accept as
a fait

take this opportunity briefly to ask about the designation of local
planning authorities which are deemed not be dealing expeditiously or
in a quality way under what was Clause 1 of the Growth and
Infrastructure Bill. How many of those local authorities, which is an
adjunct to this, have currently been designated? I have a few more
questions for the Minister. We support the exclusion of the
construction of dwellings from the scope of these regulations, but we
would like some clarification. The SI covers developments that wholly
or mainly comprise the activities set down, but it must not include the
construction of one or more dwellings. Can it be confirmed that any
minor part of a development, such as a residential floor atop of an
office development, would preclude this procedure being adopted? That
would seem to be what runs from a strict reading of the
regulations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:23:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

legislation committee commented on the consultation process and made
reference to the fact that the consultation ran for six weeks over
Christmas, which it suggested was at odds with good practice. It went
on to point out that it took the department five months to publish its
response. Perhaps we might hear from the Minister why that was so.
There was also some suggestion of disparity between the conclusions
drawn by the Government and the level of responses received under the
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:24:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of the position we are dealing with, we support the exclusion of new
coal development and oil and gas, as well as the exclusion of retail
and generally the exclusion of development of homes, but we are
disappointed that there is no commitment on the production of national
policy statements. Those criteria could have applications to
developments which might have a regional or even sub-regional basis. As
the Minister outlined, the criteria adopted are: whether a project is
likely to have a significant economic impact or is important for
driving growth in the economy, and I would be interested to understand
how significant economic impacts are determined for this
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:25:01"></hs_TimeCode>; whether
a project has an impact across an area wider than a single local
authority area, which could occur in many developments and hardly be
indicative of something of national significance; and whether a project
is of a substantial physical size, which, similarly, may be indicative
of some regional project rather than something which is of national
significance. There is also reference to the creation of sports stadia
and it is suggested that where seating capacity is less than 40,000
seats that should not be seen as being of national significance. A
40,000-seater stadium is not that unusual across the country. We in
Luton aspire to maybe 25,000—we could do with 5,000 as it
stands—but 40,000 does not seem to me indicative of something

have a few more questions. Will the Secretary of State be required to
publish the reasons for his decision to assume authority to decide any
particular application? In the absence of a relevant national policy
statement, what will be the role of the local plan in guiding
decision-making? What if anything will be required of local planning
authorities in relation to this process? In particular, can the
Minister remind us of what is entailed in consultation under this
planning route? It appears that a new consent service unit has been
established whose task is to improve co-ordination and communication
between the Planning Inspectorate, applicants and consenting bodies.
Can the Minister give us a clue as to how large that service unit is
and how many individuals are involved in it? Can she also say how many
applications are currently proceeding on non-business and commercial
projects through the national infrastructure process and what the
performance levels are? In particular, I am driving at whether the
Minister is confident of the capacity for it to do more and to take on
projects that might run from this
SI.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000061">There was

the noble Lord will know, it was my noble friend Lady Hanham and not me
who took the Bill through your Lordships’ House, so it is
something with which I am becoming familiar in some detail at this
stage. I will try to respond to the numerous points raised.
A good place to start is to remind the Committee that we expect that in
most cases the local authority will be able to provide a swift decision
on business and commercial developments, and that that will remain the
route for the vast majority of applications. We are providing an
alternative route and, in doing so, some certainty for developers,
because of the statutory timetabling of the infrastructure planning
regime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:30:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000065">The
noble Lord raised a point about the length of the consultation, and
about why we only consulted for six weeks. It is worth reminding noble
Lords that, in accordance with revised Cabinet Office guidelines, we
now take shorter periods for consultation where we believe that the
issue is one specific to, or of primary concern to, professional or
trade areas, or, in this case, local authority bodies. Therefore, six
weeks was considered to be adequate for people to respond, and the fact
that we received over 100 responses suggests that people felt they had
adequate
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:31:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000066">The
noble Lord asked why there was no national policy statement. We do not
think the case for one here is strong, mainly because this is a new
option for developers; it is not mandatory and the Secretary of State
retains some discretion in deciding whether or not an application
should follow this route. In this context, therefore, we do not think a
national policy statement is needed.
He<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:32:30"></hs_TimeCode> asked about
housing, and whether the criteria exclude any residential element. That
is absolutely right: we are firm and clear that responsibility for
housing should remain with local authorities, so if one of these plans
included housing that would render it unsuitable for this type of
application. However, I remind noble Lords that most big projects would
want to use the existing routes—this is an option, not the way
they have to

asked how many local planning authorities are designated as poorly

the consent service unit, the team responsible for this new process. It
is a small unit of three people, with secondees from Natural England

asked why we have not explained how we will decide whether a project is
likely to have a significant economic impact. I can best answer that by
repeating a point I made in response to another question; namely, that
the Secretary of State will need to consider these applications on a
case-by-case basis. Therefore, it is not possible for me to be explicit
in the way in which he would like me to be. To illustrate my point,
perhaps I may use the example of whether a sports stadium is nationally
significant or not, or whether cross-local authority issues may mean
that it is nationally significant; in many cases it will not be. The
point trying to be made by this is that, of itself, one element of a
big plan might not warrant it being designated as nationally
significant but, when combined with something else, a 40,000-seater
stadium, for example, might qualify it as being nationally
significant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:36:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000071">The
noble Lord also asked about a policy framework for the business and
commercial category, such as a national policy statement. I think that
I have already answered that point. He also asked about the importance
of local plans and how they fitted into the new regime. The local plan
is likely to be an important and relevant factor to be taken into
account. It is part of the type of things to be considered as and when

asked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:37:03"></hs_TimeCode> about the
number of cases going through the major infrastructure regime more

we had capacity for more. Some 14 decisions have been taken under the
infrastructure planning regime and another 20 are being considered
either at the Planning Inspectorate or by Ministers. A further
approximately 60 are at the pre-application stage. The regime is seen

Children and Young Persons Act 2008 enables local authorities to
delegate specified relevant care functions to a provider of social work
services. Part 1 has, to date, been brought into force only for

background to this is that in May this year the Department for
Education laid a draft legislative reform order as an affirmative
instrument under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. This
draft LRO proposed removing the requirement for direct registration and
inspection by Ofsted of social work services providers in England in
parallel with Part 1 of the 2008 Act being brought fully into force.
The department’s intention, as I understand it, was that if the
LRO had been approved, inspection of arrangements involving such
providers would have become part of the local authority inspection by
Ofsted.</hs_para>

Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee first considered the
draft LRO in June. In its third report of the current Session, it
recommended that the LRO should be subject to the super-affirmative
procedure, because it considered that the noble Lord’s
department had not adequately demonstrated that the LRO would not
remove any necessary protection.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:42:09"></hs_TimeCode> committee
considered the draft LRO for a second time in July, taking account of a
letter received from DfE Ministers responding to the points raised in
its third report. However, the letter was not persuasive and the
committee remained of the view that the department had not justified
its statement that the LRO would not remove any necessary protection.
Therefore, in its seventh report, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee recommended that the LRO should not
proceed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000081">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:44:45"></hs_TimeCode>

principal reason for raising this order today is to find out from the
Minister exactly what government policy is, to look for reassurance
that the Government will not attempt to reintroduce an LRO in the near
future in order to reduce the amount of regulation on providers of
services that are contracted with the local authority, and to seek some
reassurance about the potential conflict of interest with regard to a
private provider in contract with a local authority then placing a

(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for
proposing and speaking to this Motion. Noble Lords will be painfully
aware of the tragic cases recently in the news, so I do not think I
need to name them. The noble Lord said that we do not have a very
positive view of local authorities; in fact we have a completely
open-minded view of them, but the facts are that there are currently 26
local authorities in government intervention following recent Ofsted
inspections and, of the 50 local authorities inspected since June 2012,
17 were found to be inadequate, only four were found to be good, none
was found to be outstanding and the remaining 29 were judged adequate,
which will become “requires improvement” under the new
Ofsted framework. That is an extremely disappointing and depressing
picture and it shows that the status quo is just not good
enough.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000090">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:49:40"></hs_TimeCode>
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education recently
made an important speech on how to improve support for children in
need, and many have noted how keen he is to encourage local authorities
to improve and spread best practice. An important part of this is to
allow innovation. We are committed to giving local authorities the
tools they 
<?notus-xml column=20?>need to make their own decisions on how best to deliver services. We
wish to give them every freedom to delegate social care services if
they so
choose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000091">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:50:45"></hs_TimeCode>
first step towards this was the commencement of Part 1 of the Children
and Young Persons Act 2008, which was enacted by the
previous Government. From 12 November, all local authorities have been
free, if they wish to do so, to delegate children in care and care
leaver services—only those services—to third parties.
This follows the social work practice pilots which were put in place
under the previous
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:50:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
Commencing the Act has enabled the pilots which are still in operation
to continue if they wish to do so and given freedoms to other local
authorities to delegate. It is
a<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:54:12"></hs_TimeCode> purely
permissive provision. No local authorities will be forced to delegate
functions under the CYPA, although we will not hesitate to intervene
more directly where councils are failing vulnerable children, as in
Doncaster. It is an important first step towards our aim of expanding
this permissive approach to
delegation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:51:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000092">The
noble Lord is quite right that the Government’s original
intention was not to make these regulations. He points out that the
16th report from the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, which
sought to make a legislative reform order, would have removed the
Ofsted registration requirement. However, whether or not these
providers are registered has no bearing on inspection, and the way
Ofsted will inspect, which is essentially following the child, is not
affected by whether or not they are functions performed by the local
authority or functions subcontracted by the local
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000093">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:50:24"></hs_TimeCode>
are determined to give local authorities the opportunity to contract
out to a range of providers. He mentioned some specific private
providers—that would be possible. Providers could also include
charities such as Barnado’s or NSPCC, or social work practices
which have been spun out from the council, such as in Staffordshire or
Bristol. As the noble Lord may know, we are great fans of the mutuals

Minister for his comprehensive response.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T16:52:36"></hs_TimeCode> come back to
the point he raised. My understanding is that these regulations are
needed as a consequence of the fact that the draft LRO will not
proceed. That is, in a sense, why I ask the question. Under the
original proposals, the provider who receives a contract from the local
authority would not have been inspected as an individual body but as
part of the local authority inspection. Can the Minister say whether we
can expect another LRO to be brought forward in the next year or two,
or whether it is now settled policy that the provider, when it comes to
inspections, will be inspected as a separate entity rather as an
adjunct of the local authority? I am trying to elicit what future
policy is likely to be—I think that I have grasped what current
policy is as a result of this order and the fact that the LRO was not
introduced. It is a question of whether this is a settled policy or
whether the Government will come back in the next few months with
further
proposals.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-02?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_02_PT_1/940965D1666FADD9EADE6D3530A3E42865FB7A28" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 2 December 2013">Monday,

raised the very important point of conflict. Before expanding on any of
those paths, we would look at that very carefully. We feel that some
valuable lessons were learnt from the pilots. The advantage of a pilot
is that one learns and expands on good practice. Evidence was found of
positive change for children, parents, carers and the workforce,
including increased opportunities for direct work with children and
young people. There are examples of very good quality support for
carers and of small integrated teams working well to offer a
personalised service, as well as a number of other examples. We feel
that we should take this opportunity. We may continue to expand but we
would consult on that. It is only fair that these children and young
people have the opportunity of the whole range of experts who may be
available to them, rather than just those who happen to be working for
a particular local authority. I hope that the answers that I have given

Alderdice (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, we are indebted to the noble
Baroness, Lady Hodgson of Abinger, for bringing this matter to our
attention. Our involvement in Afghanistan over the past number of years
gives this country an especial responsibility. It is often not
difficult to convince people that when things are bad they should
engage. However, we must always be extremely careful that when we
disengage we do not leave a situation which rebounds into something
which is worse than before we got involved. One of the first principles
one teaches young doctors is: first, do no harm. One of the great
dangers is that we have raised the expectations of democrats in general
and women in particular in Afghanistan. There is a real danger of a
reaction against that, and those who followed our lead and took our
encouragement being the ones who will suffer
most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:06:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

anxieties for many people is that, despite the change in political
institutions, the resilience of an old culture is so strong that it may
overwhelm all the achievements that there have been. As the noble
Baroness has pointed out, there are some things which have improved
significantly: political engagement by women, even at a relatively
senior level, albeit in smaller numbers than one would like to see;
political involvement through elections; and, of course, education,
which the noble Baroness also mentioned. Recently, when the UN Women
deputy executive director for policy and programme, John Hendra,
visited one of the governorships, the governor there pointed out that
12 years ago there were two girls in school in the 12
schools in his governorship, and now there were 10,000; and in the
country as a whole, that number approaches 3 million, as the noble
Baroness has
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:08:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

things. In fact, they are essential if there is going to be further
development. At the same time, however, we are very much aware of the
high level of violence; not just the almost traditional, tragically
cultural, violence that there has been, but 
<?notus-xml column=25?>very specifically targeted killings of, for example, senior female
journalists and government officials. That makes it quite clear that
any woman who speaks out or stands up is regarded as a target for those
who want to turn things back and attack the position of women. This is
a serious problem and the question for us must be what we can
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:08:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

pointed out that, as a donor Government we have some, albeit perhaps
modest, leverage. That is one of the reasons I was rather disappointed
in reading the last monthly monitoring report to which I had access,
that of October 2013. Although there is mention of political and
educational issues, both very positive, there is very little else about
what DfID and our other government departments are doing in support of
organisations which are protecting the rights of women.</hs_para>

to me was the account of the trilateral meeting in Downing Street on 29
October, where the Prime Minister met President Karzai of Afghanistan
and Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan. Pakistan is not a country that
has particularly distinguished itself as a protector of
women—absolutely the contrary in recent times. So I ask myself
why we are not engaging more with India. There have been difficulties
and some horrific incidents in India recently, but the people, the
politicians and the Government of India regard those as dreadful
aberrations that must be stopped, which is a very different thing from
those countries that regard them as culturally
congruent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:10:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000120">This
neglect of India as a key partner is something that goes right back to
the beginning of the engagement. I remember talking to both senior
American security officials and senior Indian army officials about
whether we had consulted India in any way before the invasion of
Afghanistan. The answer was that we never even thought about it. Here
is our ally, with 1 million men under arms, just across from
Afghanistan, which could make a real difference and have real leverage;
but we do not seem to be engaging with it. When we leave, we may have
some little leverage and involvement, but India will be there. Can the
Minister say what we are doing to engage not just with
Pakistan—which is perfectly reasonable and
appropriate—but with India to ensure that, in the region, there
is leverage there to ensure some maintenance of the possibilities for
democracy in general and the position of women in particular? India, as
a country, at least recognises the importance of this matter even if it
does not always have a perfect record—no country does, I
suppose—in dealing with these kinds of
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:11:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000121">I
have a real fear that that any improvements we achieve in Afghanistan
and some of the other places where we have intervened may be short
lived. It is not just that we might return to the status quo ante but
that there might even be a reaction against them. Along with the noble
Baroness, I seek reassurance from the Minister about our involvement
with those who are likely to have positions of
responsibility—not just those who are currently in government
but those in the Taliban. Those of us who were advising engagement with
the latter some years ago were told it was a nonsense, but of course in
the end it was an inevitability, not a nonsense. We should try to find
some way of 
<?notus-xml column=26?>ensuring that they understand that, if their country is to benefit as
part of the community of nations, it must measure up to some of these
important requirements that the community of nations now rightly
recognises, in particular on the position of

subject, and we welcome her and her considerable expertise to the

the International Development Secretary and my noble friend Lady Warsi
for the time, effort and focus they have all put into this very

Afghan woman e-mailed me to say how grateful Afghans are that we, as a

assistance in many ways, reaching out to women and promoting their

can to ensure that this support is not wasted. I hope that this debate
will be reported in Afghanistan and that women there will know that we
are on their side, and that we support and are concerned for the women

my noble friend pointed out in her powerful and well argued speech,
there are a number of signs of appeasement of Taliban and other
conservative forces by the Afghan Government. Last year President
Karzai supported a new code of conduct, issued by a group of prominent
clerics, which permitted the beating of wives by husbands and the
segregation of men and women in offices and schools. As both my noble

of which has been on assisting women in Afghanistan to make a
contribution, is Future Brilliance, of which I am proud to be a
trustee. Its vision is to create stability in fragile states by
offering world-class training that contributes to the nation’s
prosperity through the skills, ambition, professional knowledge and
participation of its people. One person whom the charity has helped is
Khala Zada. It took her two months to persuade her sons to let her come
to Jaipur to be trained. A 50 year-old 
<?notus-xml column=27?>illiterate widow from rural Afghanistan, Zada runs a small business
making jewellery by hand. The six-month course would teach her about
design, techniques and sales but, as a woman coming from a country of
gender inequality, she was not allowed to make the decision herself.
She had to get permission from the men in her life—her adult
sons. Finally, in January this year, she left her home accompanied by
one of her sons and his wife to enrol alongside 35 other Afghan men and
women—the ratio was two men to one woman—at the Indian
Institute of Gems and Jewellery in Sitapura, Jaipur’s new
jewellery quarter. The institute had hoped for more women than men, but
it proved difficult for the women to get permission to travel for the
training<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:16:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000127">Zada
is a pioneer in this new scheme to create a network of skilled Afghan
artisans who will set up businesses and spread their knowledge. The
advantage is that women jewellery-makers will be able to work from
home—a key benefit should the Taliban return to power once UN
peacekeeping forces pull out. She will be able to expand her business
and employ more women so, in terms of maximum return on capital
employed, taking just this one woman and investing in her personally is

said, education is the silver bullet. Education for all children, but

girls travelling to school in their black uniforms and white
headscarves. There are now more than 8 million children attending 4,000
schools across Afghanistan and nearly 40% of these are girls. This is a
fantastic improvement. As Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF,

women’s rights in Afghanistan, such as the provision of gender
equality in the new constitution and the establishment of the Ministry
of Women’s Affairs. Although the Afghan Government’s
quashing last week of the proposal to reintroduce stoning for the
offence of adultery was good news, its emergence in the first place, as
we have heard in the debate, was a sign of how fragile gains in human
rights over the past decade have been, particularly for women. As
foreign troops head home before a 2014 deadline for the end of combat
action in Afghanistan, and political attention fades with it, many fear
that years of slow progress are at risk of being swept

debate is a timely wake-up call for all donors to realise that if there
is not constant pressure on the Afghan Government to respect
women’s rights, there will be no women’s rights. As we
have heard from the noble Baroness, many women have severely limited
physical freedom and no political voice, and violence against women and
girls is an everyday occurrence. Some 60% to 80% of all marriages are
forced marriages; 57% of girls are married before the age of 16; 98% of
women have no formal papers, citizenship or identity; 25% of women are
in employment compared to 88% of men; and women’s life
expectancy is 44.8 years. Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for
Human Rights, stated on her visit to Kabul in 2013 that violence
against women was “endemic” in Afghanistan and urged the
authorities to speed up the implementation of the Elimination of
Violence against Women law. I am aware that the FCO has funded a study

Baroness, Lady Hodgson, 
<?notus-xml column=30?>said, gender gaps in Afghanistan are widespread in health, education,
economic opportunities, power and political voice. A combination of
traditional customs and rigid interpretation of Sharia law places
serious restrictions on women’s rights. Like the noble Baroness,
Lady Jenkin, I welcome the Government’s confirmation that the UK
will continue supporting girls’ education in Afghanistan until
at least 2017. The £47 million committed to the DfID
Girls’ Education Challenge fund between 2013 and 2016 has helped
and will help a quarter of a million girls to access quality schooling

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:34:37"></hs_TimeCode>
Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Hodgson for highlighting this
important issue. This is a timely debate. Along with her, I had the
privilege this morning of addressing the Afghan Deputy Minister for
Women’s Affairs, Fawzia Habibi, and her fellow parliamentarians
Shukria Barakzai, Dr Nilofar Ibrahimi and Raihana Azad at the Chatham
House event on the status of Afghan women
post-2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:32:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

friend’s deep concern—echoed, I know, by everyone who has
spoken in this debate today—that the considerable progress that
women have made over the past decade in Afghanistan may be eroded and
some gains may be lost. The protection and promotion of women’s
rights in Afghanistan is a central pillar of our activities in
Afghanistan and a cause to which I am personally committed; indeed, my
maiden speech many years ago was on the issue of Afghan women’s
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:33:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

cynic when we first intervened in Afghanistan, I have seen the progress
and the transformation that have taken place and the contribution that
women are making at all levels of Afghan society. I have had the
privilege to meet some of the truly inspirational women who are risking
their lives and leading the way on this issue. It is a central issue
against which we will be judged when we consider the sacrifices that
have been made in Afghanistan and whether they were worth the state in
which we leave
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:33:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Members of your Lordships’ House would take part in what I think
is an incredibly important debate. All noble Lords said that the gains
made must not be lost, a message that we continuously reiterate to the
Afghan Government. Last week my right honourable friend the Secretary
of State for International Development highlighted the importance of
this with President Karzai during her visit to Afghanistan. My noble
friend Lady Jenkin referred to the gains on education, employment and
political participation. I co-chaired the joint commission on the
enduring strategic dialogue between the UK and Afghanistan, and I
stressed those gains when we had that meeting a few weeks ago in
Afghanistan, which I co-chaired with the Afghan Deputy Foreign
Minister, Mr Ershad Ahmadi.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:36:04"></hs_TimeCode> is one
female vice-presidential candidate in the forthcoming presidential
elections, 
<?notus-xml column=32?>Habiba Sohrabi, who is an ex-governor of Bamyan province. When I spoke
with presidential candidates, I said that it is not just about having
front-facing candidates but whether you have women in all aspects of
your decision-making, in terms of your policy, the inner circle and the
campaigning theme which is going to take these elections forward. I
think I gave them some food for thought, given that at least two of the
candidates could not mention a single
lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:35:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000148">Challenges,
therefore, remain in many parts of the country, but Afghan women are
starting to take control of their lives. They rightly want a voice in
deciding Afghanistan’s future. Next year’s elections are
a real opportunity for women to play an even greater role in shaping
their society. As the noble Lord, Lord Collins, mentioned, through the
Asia Foundation DfID will provide up to £4.5 million to
strengthen women’s political participation as candidates and
leaders and in other
ways.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000149">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:35:38"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Collins, and my noble friend Lady Jenkin raised the
issue of girls’ education. We welcome DfID’s commitment
to provide education for 250,000 of the poorest girls in Afghanistan,
and this complements the UK’s existing funding for education
there. As my noble friend Lady Jenkin notes, virtually no women were in
education in Afghanistan in 2001, and to date over 2 million girls have
been educated, largely thanks to funding by international donors
including
DfID<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:36:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000150">My
noble friend Lady Hodgson, followed by the noble Lord, Lord Collins,
asked about the new DfID programme announced by my right honourable
friend Justine Greening. DfID will provide a further £8 million
to the UNDP’s Elect II programme, bringing DfID’s total
support to £20 million, and this will support the three key
Afghan election institutions, including the independent election
commission’s gender unit. The UK will also provide £7.5
million to strengthen political governance in two main ways: first by
capacity building for parliament, and secondly by developing skills for

was pleased that the Afghan Government reaffirmed their commitment to
implement the measures included in the human rights reform agreed under
the Tokyo mutual accountability framework, the TMAF. At the Afghan
Government’s request, the UK will co-chair the first ministerial
review of progress against the TMAF in 2014. The final timings and
venue of that have not yet been fixed, but as soon as I have more
information I will update the

lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan must be our primary aim, but
we will continue to make clear that any political settlement involving
the Taliban must preserve the progress made to date and respect
Afghanistan’s constitutional framework, including the
protections it provides for women and minorities. Reconciling the
Taliban must never be at the expense of gains made in women’s
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000153">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:37:30"></hs_TimeCode>
is for the Afghan Government to ensure that women’s rights are
protected. We welcome their intention to publish a national action plan
for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women,
peace and security, and the fact that UN Women and other partners,
including civil society, are being consulted 
<?notus-xml column=33?>in its formulation. The British Government will continue to provide
assistance where appropriate. It is important that the Afghan
Government ensure that a strong political will is galvanised behind
implementing it

regard to women’s rights generally, I think I said this morning
that we must keep them on the agenda. It will be so easy, when we have
withdrawn our combat troops at the end of 2014, for this to start
slipping. One way to do that is through the Afghanistan universal
periodic review at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. The review will
take place in early 2014, and that will provide an opportunity for us
and the rest of the international community to raise our concerns, and
for the Government of Afghanistan to show the strength of their
commitment to safeguard women’s
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:38:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000155">Afghan
civil society also plays a vital role, and our support for it will have
to endure. The British Government recognise their contribution through
the DfID-funded Tawanmandi programme, which has been referred to in
today’s debate. This includes a specific focus on women’s
rights. To date, for example, 66% of grants awarded either focus
specifically on gender issues, or have a strong gender component.
Funding for this is going to continue until at least
2016<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:39:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000156">We
must also acknowledge that Afghanistan, as many have said, is a deeply
conservative country. Substantial improvement to the situation of
Afghan women is likely to take place over the long term, and progress
is likely to come in short steps. Against this backdrop we should
recognise the courageous efforts of all those across Afghanistan who
are working to defend the rights and fundamental freedoms of others. In
particular I applaud female human rights defenders, who face enhanced
risks from conservative elements of their society. The Government will
continue to support and defend these brave individuals who, by seeking
to protect the rights of others, are challenging historic and very
conservative social norms.</hs_para>

continue to contribute to the work of the Afghanistan Independent Human
Rights Commission. We will continue to work closely with all our
international partners to improve our understanding of the risks faced
by human rights defenders so that they can be mitigated. Every time I
visit Afghanistan—I think that I have visited four times in the
past 12 months—I make a point of meeting the Afghan Independent
Human Rights Commission and Sima Samar, an incredibly inspirational
individual at its head. We will continue to raise our concerns and,
where appropriate, to issue public statements condemning violence.
These days, with the progress in terms of social media and
being Twitter-linked to many female Afghan parliamentarians, it only
takes a direct message for us to become aware almost instantaneously
when things are starting to go wrong in
Afghanistan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:40:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Hodgson also raised the issue of stoning for adultery and the penal
code, which of course has been in the media. The Secretary of State for
International Development raised concerns about these reports in her
meeting with President Karzai last week. I think that we saw some
rowing-back from what was then described as a consultation. However, 
<?notus-xml column=34?>even a consultation is dangerous territory for the Afghan Government to
be starting to venture into. The UK opposes abhorrent practices such as
stoning, which are a disturbing reminder of the type of justice carried
out under the Taliban. That has no place in modern
Afghanistan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:41:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120216000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-gc0001.htm#13120216000159">The
noble Lord, Lord Collins, asked about recruitment of Afghan women to
the police. The UK agrees that the recruitment of women in the police
has not been a high enough priority. The Afghan Ministry of Interior
has set up a working group. The EU police commission to Afghanistan is
seconding in some expertise to come up with a comprehensive approach to
the role of females in the police. Its aim is to increase the number of
police women by adjusting selection procedures, improving working
conditions and providing better training. However, the risks are
incredibly high for these individuals. I saw a tragic case. One female
officer whom I had met on a recent visit to Helmand was attacked and
killed by the Taliban purely for being a member of the local
police<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:42:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:42:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Alderdice raised India, which, of course, is an important regional
power and an important country in terms of the future of Afghanistan.
It is actively involved in Afghanistan, including among other things
through the development work that it does there. The
Pakistan-UK-Afghanistan trilateral procedure is one of a number of
forums created to try to create a better process between countries in
the region in order to progress on issues such as women’s
rights. Other processes are, for example, the Heart of Asia and, of
course, bilateral relationships. It is not an either/or situation
between Pakistan and India in terms of Afghanistan. We regularly keep
the Indians updated on the trilateral process. Indeed, the Prime
Minister did so on his recent visit to India when he spoke with
Manmohan Singh. At the last trilateral meeting, both Afghanistan and
Pakistan indicated that they would like us to continue with this and to
try, effectively, to act as an annoying friend to allow the two to

noble friend Lady Hodgson spoke about the Elimination of Violence
Against Women law being a key deliverable in the TMAF. Our £7.1

supports the Afghan national police response unit, which investigates
domestic violence and provides support to female victims of
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>. DfID has
made tackling violence against women and girls a strategic priority for
its work in Afghanistan. It will make announcements in the near future

is only one part of our approach to tackle the spread of TB. We are
using every tool available including tougher movement controls for
cattle  (the latest of which I announced to the House on
28th November (Col.23WS)), better biosecurity on farms and
working to develop effective and usable cattle and badger vaccines. We
continue to make good progress on all aspects of our draft strategy to

aim of the extension was to achieve the earliest and greatest possible
impact on bTB in the area, in line with the CVO’s advice that a
further significant reduction of the badger population in the first
year would increase the likelihood of disease benefits in cattle over
the full four years of the
cull.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312026000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-wms0001.htm#1312026000010">The
decision to extend has been shown to be the right one, with significant
numbers of badgers removed at the point that the extension was ended.
In the additional 5 weeks and 3 days of culling, 213 badgers have been
removed, giving an overall total of 921. This represents a reduction of
just under 40% in the estimated badger population before culling
began.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312026000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131202-wms0001.htm#1312026000011">The
extension in Gloucestershire has therefore been successful in meeting
its aim in preparing the ground for a fully effective four year cull.
In the Randomised Badger Culling Trial there was a range of culling
effectiveness across the ten areas in the first year of the culls, but
the trial still showed overall benefits at the end of sustained culling
and these benefits have been maintained for at least a further seven
years. The two pilots in Gloucestershire and Somerset have similarly
shown a range of culling effectiveness and at the end of four years of
sustained culling long-term overall benefits can be expected to be
delivered.</hs_para>

Northover (LD):</Member> The UK position has not changed. In conflict
situations where denial of abortion in accordance with a national law
prohibition would threaten the woman’s or girl’s life or
cause unbearable suffering, international humanitarian law principles
may justify offering an abortion rather than perpetuating what amounts
to inhumane treatment in the form of an act of cruel treatment or
torture. Clearly this will depend on the woman’s choice, her
condition and the safety and security of the humanitarian staff, as
well as other contextual factors.</hs_para>

the scope of the EU’s competences as they affect the UK. In
particular, it is looking at where EU competences lie, how they are
used, and what that means for Britain and our national interest. For
the purposes of the review, we are using a 
<?notus-xml column=8?>broad definition of competence: put simply, competence is everything
deriving from EU law that affects what happens in the UK. That means
examining all the areas where EU Treaties give the EU competence to
act, including the provisions in the Treaties giving the EU
institutions the power to legislate, to adopt non-legislative acts, or
to take any other sort of action. But it will also explore areas where
the Treaties apply directly to member states, without needing any
further action by the EU institutions. The review comprises 32 reports
divided into four tranches with the full breakdown available at
www.gov.uk/review-of-the-balance-of-competences. Once complete, it will
provide the most extensive analysis of the impact of EU membership on
the UK ever undertaken. This includes in those areas, such as health,
foreign policy and taxation examined in the first tranche of reports,
