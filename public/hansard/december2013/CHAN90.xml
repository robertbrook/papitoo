looking back over history, it can be easy to see victories over
prejudice and hatred as somehow inevitable. As the years lengthen and
events recede, it can seem as though a natural tide of progress
continually bears humanity ever upwards—away from brutality and
darkness, and towards something better—but it is not so.
Progress is not just handed down as a gift; it is won through struggle,
the struggle of men and women who believe things can be better and who
refuse to accept the world as it is, but dream of what it can
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000014">Nelson<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:37:07"></hs_TimeCode>
Mandela was the embodiment of that struggle. He did not see himself as
a helpless victim of history; he wrote it. We must never forget the
evil of apartheid and its effect on everyday life: separate benches,
separate buses, separate schools, even separate pews in church;
inter-racial relationships criminalised; pass laws and banning orders;
and a whole language of segregation that expressed man’s

Mandela’s struggle was made ever more vital by acts of extreme
brutality —such as at Sharpeville and Soweto—on the part
of the South African authorities. His was a journey that spanned six
decades: from his activism in the ’40s and ’50s, through
nearly three decades of incarceration, to his negotiations that led to
the end of apartheid and his election to the highest office in South
Africa. It was, as he said, a long walk to
freedom.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000016">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:38:05"></hs_TimeCode>

Even after long years of imprisonment, he rejected offers for his
freedom until all conditions that would have prevented his struggle for
justice were removed. What sustained him throughout it all was a belief
in human dignity—that no one is naturally superior over anyone

life’s work not to rest until the evil of apartheid was ended.
Mandela knew that there were millions across our country who said no to
apartheid in ways large and small, from mass concerts to quiet shows of
solidarity. There can be no doubt that he had a warmth of feeling for
this country. He visited just months after his release from prison and
a number of times in the following years, including the time when he
spoke so memorably in Trafalgar square at that great event to make
poverty
history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:39:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000020">The
character of Nelson Mandela was shown not only in the determination
with which he fought, but in the grace with which he won. Nearly three
decades in prison could so easily have left him bitter. On his release,
he could have meted out vengeance on those who had done him so much
wrong. Perhaps the most remarkable chapter of Mandela’s story is
how he took the opposite path. In victory, he chose
magnanimity. Indeed, with characteristic generosity, he
invited his former jailer to his presidential inauguration. He employed
as his private secretary a young Afrikaner woman who became his
confidant and, in an image that is printed indelibly on our minds, he
roused his country behind the Springboks in the most
powerful gesture of
reconciliation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000021">Nelson
Mandela’s Government pursued a very deliberate policy of
forgiveness. F. W. de Klerk and other National party officials were
brought into his Government of national unity. The Truth and

desperate hope was for an African renaissance, with South Africa at its
heart.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000022">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:41:34"></hs_TimeCode>

rapid social change that had taken place, but who had the vision to see
through the destructive attitudes towards AIDS in South Africa. All

legacy was about more than just removing the most explicit signs of
discrimination and segregation, and he recognised too that to build a
brighter future South Africa must confront the darkness of its past. In
doing so, Nelson Mandela laid down a blueprint that has made it
possible for other divided communities, such as in Northern Ireland, to
reject violence, overcome their differences and make a fresh beginning.
That is why I hope, in communities where people are still struggling to
replace violence and conflict with peace and stability, that the
principles of forgiveness and reconciliation that Mandela embodied are
followed by others too. Recently, for example, the House debated the
alleged human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. Surely there could be no

Mandela was the greatest man of his generation, yes, but across the
generations he was one of the most courageous people you could ever
hope to meet. Winston Churchill said that courage was the greatest
human virtue of all, because everything else depended on it.
Nelson Mandela had eloquence, determination, commitment, passion, wit
and charm, but it was his courage that brought all those things to
life. We sometimes think of courage as daring, bravado, risk-taking and
recklessness, and Nelson Mandela had all those in admirable quantities,
but he was the first to say that true courage depends not just on
strength of willpower, but on strength of belief. What drove Mandela
forward, and what made him the great architect of a free South
Africa—the first great achievement of Nelson Mandela—was
the burning belief that everyone, every man and woman, was equal:
everyone born to be free, everyone created not with a destiny to be in
poverty, but created to have dignity in life.</hs_Para>

need speak only of what I saw in the times that I worked with him: how
quietly and without fanfare he went about his work. In 2005 I flew to
South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela to persuade him to come to London
so that he could then persuade the Finance Ministers of the need for
debt relief to relieve poverty, and this he did. Then in 2006, he and
his wife Graça Machel—a leader in her own right, who
shared his ideals and will now carry his legacy into the
future—launched the British programme for education for every
child so that we could be the first generation in history where every
child went to school. He warned us when we had that press conference in
Mozambique that to get every child to school we would have to end child
labour, child marriage and child trafficking, and that we would have to
end the discrimination against girls, a campaign that he and his wife,
Graça Machel, have been involved in ever
since<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:02:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
Typically, Nelson Mandela said at the beginning of the conference that
the cause was so urgent that he had now come out of retirement so that
he could prosecute the cause, and at the end of the press conference he
said that it was now up to the younger generation and he was returning
to his retirement.</hs_Para>

good fortune was to meet Nelson Mandela not so long after he left
prison, and I remember his first greeting: “Ah,” he said,
“a representative of the British empire,” and then he
flashed that same smile that could light up a room and then the world.
Then 10 years ago, at the birth of my son John, I picked up the
telephone and there was Nelson Mandela on the phone: he, too, had lost
a child in infancy, and from that time on, on his birthday, the day

First, Oprah Winfrey bid for it, then Elton John. Both of them
surpassed a £1 million. Oprah Winfrey then went beyond that

about. He was particularly intrigued by Amy Winehouse, who is sadly no
longer with us. I remember him going down to meet her and her joking
with him that her husband and Mandela had a great deal in
common—both of them had spent a huge amount of time in prison.
At that point, he wanted a drink, but Graça, his wife, had
banned drink from the occasion, at least for him because of his fragile
health. I can never forget this occasion: Mandela, with all these great
achievements behind him, at the celebration party for his 90th birthday

he said about them, at least today. But he admired and respected Her
Majesty the Queen, and he told me that he wanted the Queen to invite an
African rain princess from his tribe to a reception at Buckingham
palace. He had got nowhere with the diplomatic channels, so he decided
to telephone her personally. The story goes of the conversation, in
words that only Mandela could use—“Hello Elizabeth,

by Mandela on the bare walls of that bleak prison cell was a facsimile
of the British painting by a famous artist, Frederic Watts. The
haunting image he had in this prison cell was of a blinded girl sitting
on top of a globe of the world. The painting, entitled
“Hope”, is about the boldness of a girl to believe that,
even when blinded and even with a broken harp and only one string, she
could still play music. Her and Mandela’s belief was that even
in the most difficult and bleak of times, even when things seem
hopeless, there could still be hope. I believe that that explains why
over these past few days we have both mourned the death of Mandela and
celebrated his life with equal intensity. Who else could unite the
whole world of sport unanimously, in every continent of the world, with
applause? We are mourning because as long as Mandela was alive we knew
that even in the worst of disasters, amidst the most terrible of
tragedies and conflict, amidst the evil that existed in the world,
there was someone there, standing between us and the elements, who
represented goodness and nobility. And we are celebrating today because
the lessons that we have learned from him will live on. He teaches us
that indeed no injustice can last for ever. He teaches us that whenever
good people of courage come together, there is infinite

Malcolm Rifkind</B> (Kensington) (Con):</Member> On the day of
Mandela’s release in 1990, I was waiting with many millions of
people for him to emerge from prison. I remember a particular thought
at that time: although he was a global figure—the whole world
knew of Nelson Mandela—no one had the faintest idea what he
looked like. No photograph of him had appeared since he went into
prison 27 years earlier, as a relatively young man of 46—now he
was emerging as a relatively old man of 73. I met him for the first
time when he came to 10 Downing street when John Major was Prime
Minister, and I recall that as he entered, the whole staff of No.
10—70 or 80 people—spontaneously drew themselves
up into  
<?notus-xml column=11?>two lines to applaud him as he walked to the Cabinet

Mandela was not a saint, as we have heard. He was a politician to his
fingertips. He actually believed in the armed struggle in the earlier
part of his career and perhaps to some degree for the rest of his
career, but, unlike many in the African National Congress, he
eventually decided that ways of peace were more likely to deliver than
the armed struggle. I recall going to South Africa four years after
1990 when he was President and having dinner with the then deputy
Defence Minister of South Africa, Ronnie Kasrils. Kasrils was a white
South African communist and a founding member of Umkhonto we Sizwe. He
had been educated at the London School of Economics and was a strong
believer in the armed struggle. I said to him, “You are a member
of the South African Communist party and it was often argued at the
time by the South African Government that you and your colleagues were
trained in the Soviet Union. Was that true?” He said,
“Yes, it was true. We were trained in Odessa, in
Ukraine.” Then I asked him why he believed in the armed
struggle, particularly as Nelson Mandela eventually decided on a
political solution. He said, “Well we believed that the white
Afrikaners, the apartheid Government, would never give up power
peacefully. It would only be the armed struggle that would get them out
of power.” I said to him, “Is that what they taught you
in the Soviet Union?” I remember he groaned and said,
“No, no, that is what they taught me at the
LSE<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:10:40"></hs_TimeCode>.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000067">I
lived and worked in southern Africa, mainly in southern Rhodesia, for
two years in the 1960s. I got to know South Africa well, and I must
confess that, at that time, I too assumed that there would be no
peaceful resolution of the problems of apartheid and that, whether one
liked it or not, it would only be by revolution or by armed struggle
that they would change the political system. I was wrong, and I was
wrong because there was not one hero in South Africa but two, and it is
worth remembering this. It was not just Nelson Mandela, who undoubtedly
deserves the vast bulk of the credit, but the South African President
FW de Klerk. Without both of them, there would not have been a peaceful
resolution. In some ways, it was more difficult for de Klerk than for
Mandela. [<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps> “Oh!”] Let
me explain what I mean; it is a serious point. Mandela was receiving
power at a stage when most of the struggle had already been won, and de
Klerk was having to persuade his own people to give power up before
they had been defeated. The world had not seen such a situation before.
To his credit, de Klerk realised that he needed the legitimacy of the
electorate of South Africa, who were, quite wrongly but in practice,
all white at that time. He called the referendum and, by the
sheer force of his leadership, persuaded more than 60% of white South
Africans to accept that the days apartheid were over. Even then, it
required Mandela—and it is to his credit—to go through
long months of negotiation, not always with the support of his
colleagues in the ANC, in order to deliver a transfer of power that
offered the prospect of peace for all the people of South Africa.
Mandela once notably said, “This is not about moving from white
domination to black domination. 
<?notus-xml column=12?>There must be no domination of either community.” He was an
extraordinary man in not only believing that but practising it with
every fibre of his being.</hs_Para>

we look today at the lessons of Mandela’s extraordinary life and
incredible achievements, at his contribution not just to South Africa,
which goes without saying, but to the wider world and at why he has
become such an iconic figure, two factors stand out. First, he is
perhaps the best example that we have had in the past 100 years of how
political leaders, by force of personality, transform themselves from
politicians into statesman, and can by their sheer personal effort
change the world and make what was impossible possible and then deliver
it. He is not the only one who has done so. We should not think of him
as unique. Gorbachev, by the force of his personality, helped to end
the cold war and deliver the liberation of eastern Europe without a
shot being fired, and few would have believed that possible. Lech
Walesa, an obscure trade unionist at first, built up the Solidarnosc
organisation and toppled the once mighty Polish Communist party. Anwar
Sadat, a controversial figure in many ways, was yet another example.
The extraordinary decision that he took to fly from Egypt to Jerusalem
and address the Israeli Knesset as Egyptian President led to peace
between Israel and Egypt. In our own day, we have Aung San Suu Kyi, and
we all know what she has done and how it is transforming Burma. Being a
political, charismatic figure is necessary but it is not sufficient. It
must be combined with political skills, and of course Mandela was a
politician to his fingertips as well as being a man with all those
other talents.</hs_Para>

second lesson is that although of course political leadership is
needed, we should also recognise, as Mandela did, the strength of
diplomacy as a way of getting political change. Even after Mandela had
been released, it took months and months of negotiation that could have
collapsed at any stage into internal civil war. In a year when we have
seen how diplomacy, which is not always fashionable, has produced
agreement on Syrian chemical weapons and an interim agreement on
Iran’s nuclear programme, it is worth taking comfort from that
and seeing how Mandela’s example can deliver in an extraordinary
way.</hs_Para>

conclude by simply saying that when we pay tribute to Nelson Mandela,
as we rightly do, we should pay tribute to him for what he stood for
and we should acknowledge what he achieved in South Africa but we
should also recognise what he taught the world about the resolution of
what seemed like intractable political problems through patience,
personality, courage and diplomacy. Military solutions and armed
struggle are sometimes unavoidable, but often they are
avoidable and he demonstrated that better than anyone in our

years later, in 1966, after my parents had been jailed, declared banned
persons and deprived of earning a living, our family sailed past Robben

out over the Cape rollers and imagining how Mandela and his comrades
were surviving in that cold bleak cell. As an African, he was permitted
5 oz of meat daily, whereas coloureds were allowed 6 oz; he was
permitted ½ oz of fat, and coloureds 1 oz: the evil precision of
apartheid penetrated every nook and cranny of life, banning
inter-racial sex as well as segregating park benches, sport, jobs,
schools, hospitals, and much, much more. The apartheid state had hoped
that, out of sight on the former leper colony of Robben Island, with
its freezing cold waters that had devoured all escapees, Mandela would
be out of mind, but the longer he was imprisoned, the bigger a global
leader he
became.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000079">In

record, not out of any recrimination—some Conservative Members
pressing the BBC to pull the plug on its coverage. Then, almost
miraculously, something occurred that we had dreamed of, but deep down
doubted would ever, ever happen—on that historic day in February
1990 Mandela walked out of prison to freedom, providing an image for

was very different. Nelson Mandela’s struggle for freedom, and
that of his African National Congress, was long and bitter, taking
nearly 100 years from the days under British colonial rule when the
roots of apartheid were established. Under Britain in 1900, 50 years
before apartheid was formally institutionalised in South Africa, most
of its features were already in place in the bustling gold-rush city of
Johannesburg. By then, Africans were prevented from walking on the
pavements—they had to walk on the streets—they had to
carry “passes” to work in the city, they could not use
buses and trains designated for whites, they were dreadfully exploited
in the mines, and they had no political
rights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000081">We
all say in Britain that we were against apartheid, and doubtless we
were, but some did things about it —others did not. The
anti-apartheid struggle was for most of its life engaged in a big
fight, here in Britain too. The executive secretaries of the
Anti-Apartheid Movement—first, Ethel de Keyser, then Mike
Terry—were indefatigable. Its chairman, Lord Bob Hughes, and
treasurer, Richard Caborn—former Members of Parliament
—were real stalwarts, along with Neil Kinnock and Glenys as
well. Protests to stop whites-only Springbok tours provoked fierce
anger. I remember them well: “Hain the pain”, as I
recall. Some people might still feel that. Yet, as Nelson Mandela
confirmed to me, the Springboks’ sporting isolation was a key
factor in making whites realise that they had to change, so that today
that wonderful black rugby star Bryan Habana can be a Springbok,

demonstrating never

Mr Speaker, for volunteering most graciously that you were on the wrong
side of the anti- apartheid struggle as a young Conservative. I give
credit to the Prime Minister for apologising for his party’s
record of what I have to describe as craven indulgence towards
apartheid’s rulers. And if Nelson Mandela can forgive his
oppressors without forgetting their crimes, who am I not to do the same

it really does stick in the craw when Lord Tebbit, Charles Moore and
others similar tried over recent days to claim that their complicity
with apartheid—that is what I think it was—somehow
brought about its end. To my utter incredulity, Lord Tebbit even told
BBC World in a debate with me that they had brought about
Mandela’s freedom. I know for a fact that Nelson Mandela did not
think so. At every possible opportunity he went out of his way to thank
anti-apartheid activists across the world for freeing him and his
people.</hs_Para>

most of his life he was a believer in non-violent legal peaceful
change. by force of circumstance—the suppression of his African

his marvellous speech, another equally engaging side to his greatness.
He had an infectious capacity for mischief. In London a few weeks after
our marriage in 2003, I introduced my wife Elizabeth to him.
“Is this your girlfriend?” he asked. When I replied:
“No, she’s my wife”, he chuckled, “So she
caught you then?” When Elizabeth, who can be somewhat feisty at
times, exclaimed indignantly that she had taken a lot of persuading, he
laughed, “That’s what they all say, Peter, but they trap
you in the end!” By then she realised that he was teasing her
and we all ended up laughing together. He had apologised earlier for
not coming to our wedding, instead sending a message, which contained
these impish words to us newly-weds: “But perhaps I will be able
to come next

was not just his towering moral stature, his courage and capacity to
inspire, that endeared Nelson Mandela to so many. Despite being one of
the world’s most 
<?notus-xml column=16?>prominent statesmen—perhaps the most revered—he retained
his extraordinary humanity. When he was with you, you had all his
attention. When he greeted you, his eyes never wandered, even though
you were surrounded by far more important people. Whether you were a
mere child, a hotel porter, a cleaner, a waiter or a junior staff

the same occasion when Elizabeth met him in 2003, my parents were also
present, enjoying a reunion. The conversation somehow turned to my
ministerial driver, whom Mandela promptly summoned. “I was once
a driver, too,” he told him as they shook hands, referring to
the time in 1961-62 when he was on the run and went underground, dubbed
the “Black Pimpernel”, often moving about the country
dressed as a chauffeur, in order to invite no attention, with cap and
uniform and his white “master” in the back, as was
stereotypical in those days and so a good form of
disguise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000089">An<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:30:02"></hs_TimeCode>
ordinariness combined with extraordinariness was not Mandela’s
sole uniqueness. His capacity for forgiveness is what made him the
absolutely critical figure, first during secret negotiations in the
late 1980s from prison with the Afrikaner nationalist Government and
then after his release, both in the transition and in healing a
bitterly divided nation.</hs_Para>

brings me to his status. Gandhi, Kennedy and Churchill are all iconic
figures, the last for his inspirational wartime leadership and the
first two more for having been assassinated. Yet today ask almost
anybody anywhere which global statesman they admire most, and
“Nelson Mandela” will as likely as not be the answer.
Other world figures are usually famous within their own professional
disciplines, sections of society, interest groups or age groups. Many
attract hostility, cynicism or plain indifference. Nelson
Mandela’s unique achievement was to command fame, admiration and
affection from virtually everyone, everywhere in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000091">So
if, as I believe, he is more iconic than anybody else, why? His life
story of sacrifice, courage, endurance and suffering in the great and
noble cause of liberty, democracy and justice places him among a very
select few: the Tolpuddle martyrs, Chartists, suffragettes, Gandhi
himself, anti-colonial African leaders, Che Guevara, Lech Walesa,
Solzhenitsyn and Aung San Suu Kyi, to name just some. But Mandela
towers above them all in the popular imagination, perhaps in part
because he was the first such figure to be projected to the
world’s peoples through the powerful modern media of global
television and the internet. He was quite simply far better known than
any comparable
figure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000092">Equally,
however—this is the lesson I draw—he survived, and indeed
prospered, even under the fierce media spotlight of 24-hour news,
over-hype and spin. Uniquely, he remained untarnished and undiminished
by that modern media beast’s unrivalled capacity for building up
then knocking down, leaving him serenely above all its insatiable
prurience and obsession for triviality and instant novelty. Where most
political careers end in failure or opprobrium, Nelson Mandela’s
continued to soar long after he stepped down as
President.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000093">Mandela’s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:32:35"></hs_TimeCode>
greatness, his stature, derived not just from an extraordinary
biography that dwarfs the rest of humankind; it came from the warm glow
of humanity that he radiated, his common touch, humbleness,
self-deprecation, humour and dignity. Prison could have 
<?notus-xml column=17?>embittered, adulation could have gone to his head
and egotism could have triumphed. The clutching of the crowd and the
intrusive pressures of the modern political age could have seen him
retreat behind the barriers that most leaders and celebrities today
erect around themselves, not necessarily through any fault of their
own, but in part to retain some personal space, but the consequence of
which all too often becomes either aloofness or insincerity and its
companion, cynicism. But none of that happened to him. Throughout
everything, Nelson Mandela remained his own man, neither seduced by the
trappings of office, nor deluded by the adulation of admirers, always
friendly and approachable. That is why, for me, he was the icon of
icons, and perhaps always will
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000094">President<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>

reconciliation and forgiveness that astonished the world. It was built
on a base that had been prayed for and actively worked for in South
Africa for years before his release. Nelson Mandela was the pivotal
figure around whom all this work became based and whose attitudes
overcame the fear and negativity from people who knew intellectually
what needed to be done but simply could not see how it could happen. It

talking here about a politician. Certainly in the civil encounters with
President Mandela in one capacity, and with Mr Mandela post-presidency

mention humour because my first introduction to Nelson Mandela was far
from fortuitous. He was then President, and enormous numbers of
parliamentarians had somehow all descended on South Africa at the same
time. They had come from New Zealand, Australia, here, Ireland,
France—all on fact-finding missions. It was interesting that
these fact-finding missions all coincided with the rugby world cup that
was taking place in South Africa. Given that there were more visiting
foreign politicians in the country than even visiting foreign rugby
players, the President held a great gala reception. The leader of our
delegation, my friend Rupert Redesdale, Liberal Democrat hereditary
peer, was introducing the British delegation to the President, and he
was pretty apprehensive in the presence of the great man. It came to my
turn, and he said, “Mr President, one of my colleagues from the
House of Commons in London. This is Nigel Kennedy.” The
President’s characteristically firm handshake and jovial welcome
confirmed two things for me there and then. First of all, he had never
heard of Nigel Kennedy, but far more distressingly, he sure as hell had
not heard of me

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:48:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Glasgow South West (Mr Davidson), the then Member for Govan, who I
am glad is in his place today—looking back, I was not so glad he
was in his place on that occasion that evening—and I were
photographed with President Mandela. What a wonderful memento to 
<?notus-xml column=21?>have. A few months later I was passing through
Glasgow, my favourite city, and as I always do when I am there, I
picked up a copy of the Glasgow <I>Evening Times.</I> The front page

confirmed that the Clyde would be very much on the preferred bidders
list for the latest warship that they were seeking interest in
globally, and there was a photo of the hon. Gentleman and the President
himself, with the caption, “Local MP, Ian Davidson, lobbying
President Mandela on a recent visit to South Africa”. But the
funny thing was that when I looked at the photo, I discovered that I
had been airbrushed out of history. Perhaps that has been the story of
my life ever since.

night of the concert in Trafalgar square and, as we would say at home,
it was a gey dreich night. It was cold, windy and wet, with horizontal
rain. Mr Mandela was tired, and he was wearing an overcoat. First, he
insisted on working the room in South Africa House and speaking to
everyone there. Then he went outside and enthralled the young, if
rather soaked, audience who had been listening to the music.
At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:50:05"></hs_TimeCode> that point,
his minders were pretty keen to move him along and get him to his bed,
which he clearly needed. But no—the coat came off and he came
back up the stairs in South Africa House and worked the room again. We
came face to face for a second time. He looked at me and said,
“We talked earlier”, and I said, “Yes we did, Mr
Mandela, it was an honour to meet you and we a very nice chat.”
“Oh good,” he said, “I will move on, but I did not
want you to think I had been rude.”

week ago, we were in this place paying tribute to those in Glasgow who
had suffered as a result of the terrible helicopter crash. Many of the
most heartfelt international tributes from outside this place came from
South Africa. A week is a long time in politics. Last night, as rector

steel of his commitment to his principles. After meeting him, most
people, including Presidents and Prime Ministers, realised that they
did not measure up to his standards. Most of us at least felt inspired
to try to do a bit better in future.

is inevitable on these occasions that we speak, as it were, through the
prism of our own recollections. Of course, Nelson Mandela created many
iconic images, but one in particular sticks in my mind, and it has
already been mentioned. Let me put it in context. I had not really
understood the absurdity of apartheid in sport until 1965, when, at the
White City stadium in London, two teams from South Africa were
competing in the annual athletics championships, a black team wearing
black blazers and a white team wearing green blazers. They were able to
compete against each other at the White City stadium in London, but
they could not compete against each other in Cape Town or Johannesburg.
If I had any doubts about the absurdity of apartheid in sport, they
were most certainly extinguished on that occasion.</hs_Para>

heard, sport in South Africa was a deeply divisive issue. When in 1995,
at the rugby world cup final, Nelson Mandela wore a South African rugby
shirt to present the winner’s trophy to the South African
captain, he made an extraordinary gesture. Indeed, it goes a little
further than we have heard today, because Mandela wore the No. 6, which
was the jersey number of the white South African captain. I shall
finish now, because so many hon. Members wish to speak, but by that
simple act he turned what was divisive into something that was a force
for unity. Surely on that occasion there was no better way to express
his ambition for his country.</hs_Para>

unease before the meeting in Shell house in Jo’burg. We could
hardly have been seen by the ANC as great historic allies, and we were
not exactly on the right side of the struggle against apartheid. But I
will never forget three things from that first meeting with President
Mandela, as he was then. First was his extraordinary warmth. Secondly,
he seemed to understand intuitively that the Conservatives on the
delegation felt uneasy. He went out of his way to put us at ease, and
when we went around the table introducing ourselves he said to
the Conservatives, “I’m really grateful to 
<?notus-xml column=28?>Margaret Thatcher for what she did, and I am very
grateful to your current Prime Minister, Mr Major, for all he’s

he appointed his former jailer, Jannie Roux, who went on to become a

70% of South Africans believed that the situation would end in an
appalling civil war and a bloodbath. I believe that Nelson Mandela was
personally responsible for preventing that from happening and for
preventing an utter catastrophe. Also—what an example this is to
other African leaders—he never, ever went out of his way to try
to better himself at the expense of his fellow countrymen. He never let

Leeds, we have our memory of that day in April 2001 when he came to our
city to receive its freedom—the highest honour we were able to
bestow. We cheered his arrival in a packed Millennium square as he
climbed the stage and, in his characteristic way, paused to greet every
person who was on it, including the children who had been singing:
everyone mattered and everyone was included. He then addressed us, and
he began with these immortal words: “It is wonderful to be here
in Liverpool.” There are other occasions on which uttering those

reading out those petty, demeaning rules on how much food the prisoners
on Robben Island could get. When I visited and saw those things written
on the signs, my jaw dropped, because there was represented a
perpetuation of racist difference instead of what Mandela
stood for, which was to embrace our common humanity. It is

of those who helped him in their small and various ways. There were
millions who did so, including those who went to the concerts and those

Jewish people, the people of my faith, played a crucial role in various
stages of Mandela’s life, especially in his early decades.
Apparently, the only white person he ever called a boss of his was
Lazar Sidelsky, a Jewish lawyer from Johannesburg, who in the 1940s
hired him as a legal clerk. In his 1994 autobiography, “Long

years later, Mandela apparently attended the Bar Mitzvah of
Sidelsky’s son, Barry. Countless other Jewish people had close
relationships with Mr Mandela—people such as Isie Maisels, Harry
Schwarz, Joe Slovo and Lionel Bernstein. Many others helped him in his
long struggle and, in many cases, suffered for it. Arthur Goldreich
helped to hide Mr Mandela and the ANC in the early 1960s. He apparently
set up a fake farm to do so, but was unfortunately uncovered in 1963 by
the South African apartheid security forces and later managed to escape

Pogrund, the former deputy editor of the <I>Rand Daily Mail,</I> South

at a time when it was not only unfashionable to report on black
politics in South Africa but illegal. As has already been
said, Mr Mandela was a politician, and the importance of having
those political references transmitted in newsprint cannot be
overstated. In 1961, Pogrund helped Mr Mandela to organise
an illegal strike. In the 1980s, he was among the first non-family

possible—who can take the lead in other perennial conflicts
around the world, and who can, like a colossus as Nelson Mandela was,

Mandela’s ilk to work towards reconciliation in those parts of
the world. Nelson Mandela was always firm about Israel’s
right to a peaceful existence, but he strongly supported the

reconciliation, he chose not to dig up the hatred and the anger, which

with the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:35:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Northampton North (Michael Ellis) that Nelson Mandela would
have had a loathing of anti-Semitism while at the same time supporting
the Palestinian cause. He would have recognised that the Palestinian
cause is another injustice that must be righted at some
stage—and the earlier the better.</hs_Para>

paying tribute to this outstanding personality today, we should
remember, as he would always wish us to, all those who dedicated
themselves to the liberation movement in South Africa and worked
tirelessly when they were forced into exile. It should not be forgotten
that when Mandela faced a possible death sentence in 1964, seven others
were in the dock with him. They included Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki,
whose son was to be the second President of South Africa after
apartheid, and Denis Goldberg. They were all sentenced to prison for
life and they all knew before the sentence was passed the sharp
possibility that they would be executed.</hs_Para>

should not be forgotten either, such as Steve Biko, who was not of the
ANC but had his own black consciousness movement. He was arrested on a
number of occasions and the last time he was in police custody he was
murdered. He was beaten to death in November 1977. Others were murdered
outside South Africa, of course, including, as my right hon. Friend the
Leader of the Opposition said, Ruth First, the wife of Joe Slovo. As
Members will know, Joe Slovo was one of the leading senior military
commanders in the ANC. Like 
<?notus-xml column=32?>Ruth First, he dedicated his life to a free South Africa. Slovo survived
all and became a Minister in Mandela’s Government.</hs_Para>

I may stray just a little from the consensus today—only a
little—I think that we should be asking ourselves in paying
tribute to Nelson Mandela how it was possible for the apartheid regime
to last more than 40 years. My knowledge of South Africa at 15 was very
limited. I knew about the war involving Britain that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:38:07"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Neath (Mr Hain) mentioned, obviously, and I knew
that Africans in that country were not having a good time of it, to say
the least. But when I read in 1948 that the National party had won the
election, I knew immediately, like so many people in this country and
despite my young years, that far worse was to come for the black
majority.</hs_Para>

years after the decisive defeat of European fascism, with Nazi Germany
defeated at long last, why, when a regime came into being with a
Government elected by whites that was determined to bring about the
strictest form of segregation based on colour and to remove the few
rights that Africans had, did western powers show such indifference?
Later, it was not indifference alone. We know, as was widely reported,
how every form of humiliation was put on the majority of people living
in South Africa, such as the notorious pass laws, which made their
lives difficult from day to day. We know the repression and the manner
in which people such as Nelson Mandela and the rest were forced,
against their wishes in the main, to take up armed struggle. The ANC,
which was established in 1911, was anxious to avoid violence until
1960, but after Sharpeville that was not possible. Ironically,
Sharpeville was not organised as a demonstration by the ANC. I remember
the reaction of the Labour movement when Sharpeville occurred on 21
March 1960. It was an early Easter, and the London Labour party, for
instance, cancelled its weekend meetings and joined a massive
demonstration in Trafalgar square. Far from opposing the regime, there
was indifference when the apartheid Government were elected. Britain,
the United States and most democracies were quite willing over those 40
years, to sell all kinds of military equipment to South Africa and to
train its military personnel.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1312098000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000189">We raised the
issue on many occasions in the ’60s, ’70s and
’80s, before Nelson Mandela and his colleagues were released,
and before the ban on the ANC was lifted, and every time we did so in
the House of Commons the response from the Government of the
day—certainly from Conservative Governments—was
“We oppose apartheid”. I do not question that—I do
not believe for one moment that Mrs Thatcher was in favour of
apartheid. In fact, she would have realised that that was
counter-productive. The accusation is not that those politicians were
in favour of apartheid—some may have been, but the majority were
not—but that they refused to take any action to undermine and
isolate the system and see it destroyed. That is the accusation that I
think historians will make against those in power. That does not apply
only to Britain—the United States carried far more
responsibility for keeping the regime in office.</hs_Para>

the lesson has been learned: when tyranny occurs, we should take a
somewhat different attitude. I hope that there is no repeat of what
occurred when apartheid was able to exist for such a long time. I also
have to ask why so many Members of Parliament, and 
<?notus-xml column=33?>future Members of Parliament, were willing to go on
so-called fact-finding trips, with all expenses paid by the South
African Government? It was argued that they wanted to see the position
for themselves, but I noticed when they came back that they did not
condemn the regime, which is an indictment of parliamentarians of the
past that I hope will also not be repeated.</hs_Para>

was one of the great people of our times. He was an outstanding
personality, he gave inspired leadership to his people and in his own
way—27 years’ imprisonment, apart from anything
else—dedicated his whole adult life to freedom in South Africa.
I wish only that we could say that Britain played a decisive part in
helping to remove the apartheid regime, and in paying tribute to
Mandela we should recognise our own faults and
limitations.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="1312098000333" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000333">4.43

a great probability of huge conflict and further killing to add to all
the injustice, suffering and oppression that had gone before.

Friend the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) said in
his moving speech, we were privileged first to visit South Africa
together in 1986 with our friend, Peter Pike, and Anthony Cordle, who
arranged for us to go. I have very rarely been in tears in my public
life, but we landed on the day before the anniversary of the Crossroads
massacre. We stayed 
<?notus-xml column=34?>in the house of John Reid, the pro vice chancellor
of Cape Town university. He was breaking the law by having black
students living with him and his family in his house in a comfortable
suburb of Cape Town.</hs_Para>

side of the railway line was the destroyed settlement of Crossroads.
When we went to the memorial service the next day South African defence
force tanks circled around us—the Casspirs—where 20,000
people’s homes had been destroyed. It was more than I had ever
imagined a place where liberty had been extinguished for the majority
of the people, and the oppression of the military and the South African
economic strength was bearing down on them. I pay tribute to those such
as our friend Garth Collins, who had started building bridges, which
meant that from staying in the townships, in places such as Soweto, and
visiting activists there, we could in the same day go to talk privately
and confidentially to people in the Government who understood that they
would have to change their ways.</hs_Para>

remember Peter Pike and I meeting P.W. Botha. We saw him coming towards
us and we had a terrible moment: do we shake the hand of somebody whom
we have opposed and campaigned against all our lives—Peter as a
trade unionist and anti-apartheid activist, Alistair and I—or do
we not? We did so, although, I have to say, it was difficult. Nelson
Mandela showed that you have to reach out, shake people by the hand and
seek to persuade them that they need to change their
ways<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:48:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000199">In
1994 I was privileged to host some young South Africans, mainly black
and coloured South Africans, who were here on the day of the first
election—that great day in April 1994 when the election took
place in South Africa. Colleagues might remember that three polling
stations were set up in London, one of which was at Methodist Central
hall, for the first-ever democratic election. These youngsters wanted
to be the first people to vote in this first-ever free election, so
they camped overnight on the steps of Methodist Central hall. There
were lots of journalists outside and they went in to vote. As they came
out, the journalists were asking, if I may say so, rather simplistic
journalistic questions. They stopped a young girl and asked,
“Didn’t you find it very complicated to choose who to
vote for, given that long list of parties on the ballot paper?”
There was a little pause and she said to the journalist, “I
didn’t find it complicated at all. We’ve had a lot of
time to think about it.” A young black guy, perhaps 18 or 19
years old, was asked, rather predictably, “What did you feel as
you cast your vote?” He paused and then very wisely said,
“I put a very big cross so that nobody could ignore my
opinion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:54:55"></hs_TimeCode>.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000200">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:55:02"></hs_TimeCode>
liberation moment, when those people queued to vote in that first
election, that transformational moment, was Mandela’s doing. It
was no accident that he was able to deliver it, because he had worked
and prepared for it during his time on Robben Island. He learnt to
speak Afrikaans fluently in order to engage not only with his jailers,
but with people in the Government. He went out of his way, even before
his formal release, to meet people secretly.</hs_Para>

moment when he walked on to the pitch at the rugby world cup final in
1995 also followed huge preparation. Mandela had met Francois Pienaar
on many occasions and they had become close friends. We 
<?notus-xml column=35?>remember his wonderful comments when he commended
Francois Pienaar and the Springbok team, which I believe had only one
non-white player in the squad, while wearing the Springbok jersey.
Francois Pienaar said, “We are playing this game for you, Mr
President, not only for South Africa.” The crowd, which
was almost entirely white, chanted “Mandela, Mandela,
Mandela” from the stands as South Africa went on to win. For
those Members who are interested in sport, I recommend a wonderful book
by John Carlin, “Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game
That Made a Nation”, which tracks the history of that rugby
world cup tournament up to that moment. It is inspirational

had the huge privilege of being back in South Africa earlier this year.
I was met by Helen Zille, Premier of the Western Cape, who kindly
accommodated me in what had been the district administrator’s
residence. I did not know it until I went into the house, but the room
I was given to sleep in was the room in which Mandela had slept the
night before his presidential inauguration—it is now called the
Madiba room. I texted family members and friends back home to share my
excitement. One replied, “He was a great man, and I assume
somebody’s changed the sheets since then.” But as I sat
at the desk from which he composed his Cabinet and looked out over
Table Mountain, it was only then that the significance of the
transformation he had brought about in politics in South Africa
completely dawned on

Member for Derby South (Margaret Beckett). Mandela was a political
leader of a political party of a political movement across a continent,
and it was in that role that he stood for office and was returned as

Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown), have alluded to: he
made us realise that we all have a mutual responsibility for each other
across the world. There is so much injustice, discrimination, poverty
and inequality, including in South Africa, still to fight. I hope that
he will inspire the people of South Africa, all its leaders and all its
parties, to rise to the challenge and the rest of the world
never to stand by for so long when such oppression goes on, 
<?notus-xml column=36?>to such disadvantage to so many. The most commonly heard phrase today

do him a disservice if we do not use that inspiration in our own lives

1976, shortly after the Soweto uprising, the ANC asked me to go to
South Africa because at that time I was co-ordinating the
student campaign in the UK against apartheid. The ANC wanted me to meet
those involved in the uprising to explore how we could work together to
build international solidarity. I travelled widely throughout the
country until I was forced to leave having drawn the attention of the
South African security forces.
Among<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:56:59"></hs_TimeCode> many
powerful memories, I recall staying illegally in an Indian
district in Cape Town in a house with a distant view of Robben Island.
The woman whose house it was, who was not herself involved in politics,
was probably puzzled by my presence there, having done a favour for a
friend in putting me up. I probably did not recognise the risk that I
was putting her at by being there illegally. We were talking one
morning in her kitchen, and she pointed across to Robben Island and
said, “When you go back to your country, tell your Government

is important that when we reflect, we learn the real lessons. A lot has
been said today about reconciliation and rightly so. Reconciliation is
built on forgiving, but not on forgetting. The starting point for the
reconciliation process that Mandela put in place in South Africa was to
confront the truth of those who had been involved in the apartheid
regime’s oppression. Around the world, many of those who have
been quick to praise Mandela now should recognise, with humility, that
they were as quick to condemn him in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:01:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000212">The
eulogies of the past few days have glossed over the reality of the
struggle. The story has been told almost as if white South Africa had,
in time, come to their senses, realised that they had got it wrong with
apartheid and thought it was about time they released Mandela and
negotiated a peaceful settlement. Actually, however, the Prime Minister
was right to say in his opening remarks that justice in South Africa
was not handed down; it was hard-fought for. The truth is that freedom
was not, as the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington (Sir
Malcolm Rifkind) suggested, benevolently gifted to Mandela and the ANC
by the regime. They fought for it and they won it in a victory over the
apartheid state. They were opposed at every step of the
way—brutally—by the regime and were too often let down by
western Governments who put their economic interests first, blocked
sanctions, applied the veto at the UN Security Council time after time
during the ’80s and condemned Mandela as a

was only after years of civil resistance, often at appalling personal
cost to the people of South Africa, that that resistance had made South
Africa ungovernable. It was only when, despite the opposition from
Governments including ours in the ’80s, sanctions had made South
Africa more isolated internationally that the regime recognised it had
no future. It was driven to the negotiating table by the uncompromising
campaign led by Nelson Mandela and the ANC, and in the negotiations
before and after his release he made no
concessions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:03:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312098000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0001.htm#1312098000214">Compassion,

have pointed out, he did not. Instead of revenge, he sought
reconciliation. To honour his life, we should be learning from his
values, seeking to build understanding and respect between communities,
challenging at every opportunity the politics of hatred and division,
committing ourselves to the cause of equality and justice, applying
those values in our debates

September 1990, just a few months after Nelson Mandela had been
released, I was in Johannesburg, in the offices of the Johannesburg
<I>Star, </I>discussing as a newspaper lawyer with the editor of the
newspaper issues to do with freedom of the press and wider freedom of
expression, to do with censorship and self-censorship, which the media
in South Africa had either had imposed upon them or had felt sensible
to impose upon themselves. There came a time when our conversation came
to an end and I said to the editor, “Just across the street are
the offices of the ANC. Do you think if I went in there and asked to
see Mr Mandela, they would let me?” Whereupon the editor said,
“Of course they won’t, but you might as well have a
go.” So I went across the street, pressed the button on the lift
and went to the top floor of the building, and the girl behind the desk
in the ANC offices said, “Hello, can I help?” and I said,
“Yes, I have come to see Mr Mandela.” She said,
“If you sit there, he will be with you in a moment.” So I
sat there.</hs_Para>

“Well, he will be with you in a minute.” He went back,
and about 10 minutes later, Mr Mandela, Mr Slovo and a note
taker—so reminiscent of our modern government—came into
the hall and ushered me into a boardroom, where Mr Mandela sat at the
end of the table, Mr Slovo sat on his left, I sat on his right and the
note taker sat opposite. Mr Mandela said to me, “Welcome to
South Africa. Thank you for coming to see me.” I said,
“On the contrary, thank you very much—” and he
stopped me and said, “You are not Dutch.” I said,
“No, I am English.” He said, “Whoever let you in
should be taken out and shot.” Whereupon he roared with
laughter, gripped me firmly by the hand and said, “Let’s
talk. Who are you? What are you here for?” I was not a Member of
Parliament; I was simply a jobbing lawyer across the road at the

send me your maiden speech.” I am afraid that I let him down; I

back almost to the beginning of Nelson Mandela’s journey, at the
end of the Rivonia trial. I went with my father, who was the general
secretary of the south Wales area of the National Union of Mineworkers,
to Llandaff cathedral. Like many cathedrals and churches across the
world, Llandaff had decided, under the leadership of the World Council
of Churches, to hold a vigil through the night at which people would
pray and show their solidarity with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and
all the other African National Congress leaders who were under sentence
of death. They were to be executed the following morning. It was our
duty and privilege to be there, just as it is a privilege to recall
that moment. Bishop Glyn Simon and Dean Eryl S. Thomas read from the
New Testament through the night until dawn. That gathering was
remarkable for its diversity of political opinion and faiths. There, in
microcosm, was a kind of mirror image of the African National Congress:
it was representative of the emerging Wales anti-apartheid movement,

second memory is of two particular moments in Cardiff in
December 1969, when Wales played the Springboks. First, when the main
march came to the bottom of St Mary street, it met a separate march
from the black community in Butetown, which unified with ours. It was
led by the Cardiff International athletic club—the
CIACs—with the banner that I understand was made specially for
the occasion, and with one of its proudest members and sons, the late
great Joe Erskine, the British and European boxing champion.
Symbolically, the two marches unified at that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:16:47"></hs_TimeCode>. A second,
but sadder, moment was when one speaker said that it was a shame for
Wales to have the people’s game played behind barbed wire. The

I have a received memory, not a personal one. A matter of a few yards
from this Chamber, the then Leader of the Opposition, Neil
Kinnock—he played an enormous part in the anti-apartheid
movement in Wales and Britain, and internationally—welcomed
Nelson Mandela to the shadow Cabinet room in 1990. It was very striking
that Nelson Mandela paused and looked at a particular Welsh
miners’ banner that had been made in 1961, a year after the
Sharpeville massacre. It was in the brilliant, beautiful colours of the
African National Congress—black, green and gold. Importantly,
the banner showed a white miner shaking hands with a black miner, with
a miner’s lamp shining between them to symbolise the light of
the world. I had arranged for the banner to be there, and I had
insisted that the Welsh slogan, not the English one, was shown. Nelson
Mandela was puzzled by the slogan, “Mewn undeb mae nerth a
heddwch”—in unity there is strength and peace—and
he asked about its significance and meaning. Neil Kinnock replied,
“You will understand when I tell you that that is the banner
from the South Wales miners. That is the Abercraf miners’
banner.” Neil said to me, with pride, that Nelson Mandela had
said, “I do

Thatcher has been wrongly quoted as saying that Nelson Mandela was a

Given that it was involved in sabotage, although it tried to avoid the
loss of life, that was accurate. If one reads the book by Lord Renwick

her instruction to her diplomats was to try to get matters resolved.

father served as our ambassador to South Africa in the early 1970s. The
only doubt about his taking the appointment came when the Prime
Minister asked the permanent under-secretary at the Foreign
Office, “Is Jim Bottomley so much against apartheid that he will
be no use as an ambassador?” Shortly after that, my mother
arranged for Sam Moseneke, the principal of one of the big schools in
Atteridgeville, to come and stay in our house with three of his
colleagues. They said, “Do you know, where we are from, we would
not be allowed to stay in your

of the groups that helped to make a difference was the churches, or at
least some people in the churches. I pay tribute to Trevor Huddleston,
who was a colleague of my tutor, Harry Williams, in the Community of
the Resurrection. Having been picked as a novitiate to succeed his
predecessor in Sophiatown, he was observed by a young man, aged about
14, lifting his hat as a mark of respect to that young man’s
mother. The young man was Desmond Tutu, who went on to make his great
contribution to the movement before the transition to one person, one
vote, and after that to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Oom
Bey, or Beyers Naude, of the Dutch Reformed Church said that people had
a greater duty to God than to man. He refused to backtrack when the
Dutch Reformed Church declared that his view of apartheid was wrong.

Longbottom, who was the MP for York, and Barney Hayhoe, who was the MP

with Maurice Foley and Dennis Grennan, who had been a president of the
National Union of Students. Some argue that it was funded by tobacco
money, others by the CIA, but what is known for certain is that it
funded education in this country for many potential African leaders,

South African ambassadors—I would particularly mention Dawie de
Villiers, the rugby player—would invite Members of the House of

Every person in Africa knew that communism meant that people could live
only where the authorities said they could live, that they could take
only the jobs that the authorities said that they could take and that
they did not have an effective vote. Why would any African, especially
a black African, want to go communist? One answer, I suppose, is that
the communists in South Africa were one of the groups that were
fighting with Nelson Mandela to try to overturn the apartheid

last point that I want to make about Nelson Mandela—leaving
aside the anecdotes about how lucky we were to meet him, rather than
the other way around—is about democracy within the ANC. When
Mandela’s successor was voted out of the party leadership by a
democratic vote of the party, the person who succeeded him then waited
until the presidential election to become President. As far as I know,
the ANC is probably the only African political party in which that
would happen. In a way, that type of democracy should be better known

terrorist—which Mandela did not—but became Prime Minister
of Israel and made peace with Egypt. He was the last Prime Minister of
Israel to make peace with anyone. I asked, “What did you learn
from Menachem Begin’s memoirs?” He said, “Menachem
Begin was in prison for a long time, and his book said that the most
important thing to do if you were in prison was to 
<?notus-xml column=45?>sustain your values.” I do not think that
Nelson Mandela needed to be taught that lesson, but—as has been
said so widely in the House this afternoon—he certainly did
sustain his values. He never, never, never took revenge of any kind.
That was not because he was a softie. He was a tough man—you
cannot get through 27 years in prison without being a tough man. But
what he knew was that you can solve a huge political problem by being
generous, forthcoming and reconciling, and that is what he

“The Long Walk to Freedom”—I reviewed it and was

first mini campaign in school. Like generations of morally indignant
sixth-formers before me, I was smarting against all forms of lazy
privilege, and I remember blasting out “Free Nelson
Mandela” at the South African cricket team visiting my school
from some speakers that I had erected on the clock tower for that
purpose. My teachers did not share my enthusiasm, but I was glad to
have done a little for the cause. It seemed to me that sports sanctions
would be a way to put pressure on the regime without harming the most
vulnerable in that country. I remember well the 
<?notus-xml column=46?>looks on the faces of those privileged young cricketers from one of
South Africa’s elite public schools—confusion, anger,
resentment and a little shame. It was a heady taste for me of what
politics can do.</hs_Para>

later I graduated from university and saw, as we all did, his release

valuable that was; it also needed statesmanship, and few other than
Mandela could have fulfilled what history demanded of him at that time.

cheering the South African rugby world cup success, healing a nation
and resetting it towards the path of a better future? Having seen for
myself the intensity of the association between the Boer culture, rugby
and apartheid, it was a stunning act of generous reconciliation. For me
it marked a personal end-point, from demonstrating at the departing
all-white schoolboy cricket team, to visiting the Afrikaans rugby club,
to watching him clad in green that day, I could see the power of
reconciliation work its magic through the medium of sport. Rugby, once

sometimes dislocating when you arrive in a country and you are the

one of those young people, who was also growing up in the context of
not having a father in my house—broken, to some extent, by two
successive recessions and some of the discrimination of that age, he
left us when I was 12—I am truly grateful for the role model
that was Nelson Mandela. For me and so many like me, he provided a
tremendous dignity and courage, which perhaps was the reason why during
the very difficult 
<?notus-xml column=48?>1980s we did not pick up Molotov cocktails and cause chaos on our own
streets—we chose another path. He was that role model: as an
articulate lawyer; as a freedom fighter; as a prisoner—it is
important to land on that period in prison, because none of us knew
what he looked like and he was just that image of a boxer that we had
to hold on to; as a man who walks out of prison so many years later,
with grey hair and his wife; as a politician; as a leader; and as an
elder statesman.

discrimination and nastiness across the world. I proudly boycotted

20th century can be summed up in one word, that word must be
“freedom”. I am talking about the freedom for people to
be who they want to be in their own lifetime. We take it for granted
that in that century, women could not be who they wanted to be and
working people could not always be who they wanted to be, whatever the
colour of their skin. The same goes for black people and people of
colour. More recently, we have faced those battles on 
<?notus-xml column=49?>behalf of gay men and women. That is the legacy of
Nelson Mandela. Perhaps he has that legacy because, unlike Martin
Luther King, Gandhi and, before them, Abraham Lincoln, he was not shot
and killed. Yes, he was in prison for 27 years, but I think that
Members will recognise that in making it to 95, he was free for more
years than some of us will be on this planet. That is a great thing. He

we think of Mandela, it is also important that we do not forget those
other young men and women from countries such as India, Nigeria,
Guyana, where my parents are from, Jamaica and so many other places who
were fighting against a colonial power that effectively took the view
that a small minority can govern a majority. It may not have been as
pernicious and nasty as what we saw on our screens in the 1970s and
1980s, but sometimes it was. Mandela sits with those other figures such
as Nyerere, Kenyatta and others who fought for liberation. That is why

did not really understand what was happening in South Africa until in
1975 I left my small mining community and went to Ruskin college in
Oxford. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:01:07"></hs_TimeCode>
college had a Kitson committee, named after David Kitson, who was one
of the prisoners in South Africa at the time. He had been born in South
Africa and had been over here working in industry for a while. He went
to Ruskin on a trade union scholarship and was in jail in South
Africa. I went to the first meeting of the Kitson committee and ended
up being active in it later on. One of my fellow students told us about
her life and her journey. She was from South Africa and had come out of
South Africa in the boot of a car. She told us what apartheid
was—it was not just segregation between white and blacks, but
segregation over several areas. She said that she fitted into one of
what were called the “Cape Coloureds” categories. She
also said that she and her brother were at different schools. They
lived with their family in their house, but they were at schools that
were next to each other and when they used to share their sandwiches
through the school railings they were shouted at by the pupils for
mixing with the students in the school next door. Her brother was her
twin brother. 
<?notus-xml column=51?>They had been born within minutes of one another and
apartheid had segregated them because that was how the system worked. I
could not understand how anybody anywhere could do that to anybody and
I became active in anti-apartheid for many years. I remember Mike Terry
very well and Charlotte street, as we used to go up there quite a lot,
and I was active in the trade union movement, too. Her name was Rita
Taberner, and she said something that has stayed with me all my life:
how could politicians and Governments do such things to their own
people? It is extraordinary that that could happen.</hs_Para>

have two other reflections, and the first is about when Mandela came
out of prison. It was a Sunday—I remember it well. I had just
left the Leader of the Opposition’s office, but I phoned him up
and he was watching it, too. We could not believe what we were seeing.
It was a bit like the Berlin wall. I never thought I would ever
see the Berlin wall come down or that apartheid would end. Those were
the two things in my politics of the ’60s and ’70s that I
thought were there for life, and to see that happening was
extraordinary. Of course, that was no easy journey for Nelson Mandela.
He was dealing with the tensions in the ANC between where he wanted to
go and where other members of the ANC wanted to go. Some did not think
that that was the way forward; I understand that peace and
reconciliation was his brainchild and that he had to fight hard for it
to work. Many of us thought that it would end up in a bloodbath South
Africa—after my experience of 1975, I would not have been at all
surprised if that had been the case. That was the level of the man and
the people around him who wanted to go that way for South Africa and
its
people.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:04:37"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

other memory is from when Mandela spoke in Westminster Hall. One of
your predecessors, Mr Speaker, Baroness Boothroyd—who is in the

that she had been part of the British black sash movement who used to
stand outside South Africa house wearing black sashes, just as women in

sashes to complain against the regime, and she never thought that she

might say that Nelson Mandela was destined to lead. First, coming from
a family with heritage and influence, he was politically motivated from
an early age, studying law, opening the first black law firm in South
Africa and focusing on human rights. That background, coupled with his
unique style of leadership, convinced his peer group that he was worth
supporting in the fight against apartheid. He displayed a rare
combination of determination, humility and integrity, willing to engage
with the hotel porter he met in passing with the same energy and
enthusiasm as with the VIP guest he had arranged to meet. To put it
simply, he had enormous personal presence, not just because of his rank
or appointment but because of his infectious smile, his provoking
message and his tenacity and endurance in thinking that good would
triumph in the end.</hs_Para>

political activities saw him tried and imprisoned for 27 years. Who
would have thought that just four years after his release apartheid
would be over and Nelson Mandela would be President? As many others
have, I visited Robben Island off Cape Town and peered through the bars
of Nelson Mandela’s cell. It is very hard to imagine anyone
emerging from such an experience without feeling embittered towards
their captors, so it was with some apprehension that South Africa, and
the world, waited to see what Nelson Mandela would do with his power as
President and where the country would go. He continued, after all, to
have strong ties with Russia and the South African Communist party.
Such was his popularity that he had almost a free mandate to take South
Africa in any direction he chose.</hs_Para>

recall Nelson Mandela’s release from prison. I was president of
Loughborough student union at the time and I must confess that that was
an academic establishment that was as yet unknown as a cauldron of
simmering political activity. I recall that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:09:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg) was the president of the
National Union of Students at the time and we conversed on many
occasions. We debated a motion at Loughborough students union to change
the name of the union building to the “Nelson Mandela
building”—something that many other universities had
already done. At Loughborough, perhaps unwisely, the motion was
defeated, because although Nelson Mandela’s cause was very much
supported, students were not sure where he would take South Africa,
bearing in mind the fact that the ANC still had an extremist wing. It
is perhaps that second significant chapter of his life, evolving from a
campaigner to a statesman, that distinguishes him from many others who
have liberated their country, then taken the reins of power. Perhaps
the best and saddest example is Robert Mugabe, not far away in Africa,
who not only failed to endorse any system of democracy but continues
corrupt practices to retain power, as well as encouraging racial
division and, indeed, hatred of Britain, the former colonial
power.</hs_Para>

Mandela’s ability to face down hardliners in his own party and
convince a sceptical white community helped South Africa to re-engage
with the world community. In government, he proved to be pragmatic and
even-handed, taking time to look at and, indeed, learn from a number 
<?notus-xml column=53?>of models of government, and working with de Klerk,
who had his own task of winning over people with extremist views if
civil war was to be avoided. How different things might be, for
example, had Mandela not supported the freedom of the press or an
independent judiciary. Establishing the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission was a stroke of genius—a concept that has been

the wounds of division.</hs_Para>

astonishingly, as has been said by hon. Members, Mandela stood for only
one term—perhaps a lesson for us all in recognising our sell-by
date. Interestingly, such was his ability to reach across divides, even
in death his work continues. Attending the memorial service alongside

President Castro of Cuba and the new Iranian President Rouhani. Who

difficult questions for the ANC now that it has lost its iconic
figurehead, and it must ensure that South Africa’s multiracial
free-market democracy can flourish. Those are questions, however, for
another day, and Britain’s involvement in that is for another
day too. Today and this week are about saying goodbye to a man who
survived and defeated apartheid, and united a country. Sadly—and
this applies only to a minority—some people have questioned why
in this country so much attention has been given to Nelson
Mandela’s death. A small but arguably growing slice of our
society takes for granted the leadership and sacrifices that he and
others closer to home have made. I pondered that very point this

awkward questions for us in the House, as some members of the younger
generation know more about James Arthur, perhaps not the best role
model, than leaders who triumphed over adversity to give us the very
freedoms that we could be in danger of taking for granted. Thankfully,
many people of our generation have been inspired by Nelson Mandela and
others to recognise how their own high profile can be used to shape a
better world. AIDS awareness is a clear example of that. Rightly, they

been many fine tributes today. It is not my job to go through them, but
they are all heartfelt and sincere. Something that occurs when someone
of the stature of the late President Mandela passes away is a scramble
for superlatives. Sometimes that is tiresome, because superlatives do
not always fit. In this case, the superlatives all fit, because his
life was beyond comparison so, by definition, superlatives apply. I
believe, like many people in the Chamber and throughout Britain, Europe
and the world, that he was the greatest statesman of the last century.
To spend 27 years in prison, many of them in solitary confinement, with
no contact with the outside world, and on release not to have any
rancour, still less hatred or vengeance, is truly remarkable. Like the
right hon. Members for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson) and for
Rother Valley (Mr Barron), I was in the audience in 1996 when the
President addressed both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall. He
made a memorable and moving speech, typically fitting for the occasion,
honest and completely down to earth. In many ways, he showed humility
and strength of character beyond reproach, and I will always remember
that day.</hs_Para>

today to thank Nelson Mandela for the many sacrifices that he endured,
for showing the way to reconciliation and peace, against massive and
seemingly insurmountable odds. It has been said, and I believe it to be
right—I referred to the use of superlatives—that he was a
colossus of history. I believe that he will continue to inspire
millions of people for many years to come, and rightly so. There have
been many quotations today from many wonderful speeches that he made
down the years. May I remind the Chamber that he also said that there
will never be world peace without a resolution of the Palestinian
conflict? Perhaps the greatest tribute that we can pay him is to
redouble our efforts to achieve that in his glorious
memory.</hs_Para>

onwards, when the National party won the election, to the massacre at
Sharpeville, the riots in Soweto, the killing of schoolchildren and the
murder of Steve Biko and so many others who died, often completely
ignored and forgotten. We should also recall the poverty of the black
majority population in South Africa—a poverty inherited from
colonialism, a poverty arising from work in the mines and so many other
places, a poverty of children going to school where there was no water,
no electricity, no books and very little else, and unbelievable
discrimination in employment, land ownership and everything else. It
was a system of dividing people on racial grounds that the Nazis would
have been proud of. The idea that there would be some sort of
accommodation with apartheid was something that many of us found

was not as though the evil of apartheid extended only to the country of
South Africa. It extended to the neighbouring states and greatly
influenced the white supremacist regime in Rhodesia led by Ian Smith.
It also included the war in Namibia—South West Africa, as it was
then called—and it spread over into the problems
faced by all the front-line states during the apartheid era because of
their wish to impose sanctions on South Africa. It also spread over
into Angola. The war in Angola was one of the turning points in the
defeat of apartheid. Let us remember that it was the South African
defence forces that went to the aid of another minority regime in
Angola, and they were finally defeated in the battle of Cuito Cuanavale
in 1988. Those were the significant changes that brought about a

personality of Mandela was an extraordinary one. I was asked a question
when I was visiting Holloway school last Friday morning and went into a
history lesson. There was a discussion about the civil rights movement
in the USA, the anti-apartheid movement in Britain and of course the
anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. The students asked me whether
Mandela would have been a better or worse president if he had never
gone to prison. It is an impossible question to 
<?notus-xml column=56?>answer. All I could say was that I remember
distinctly my mother telling me how evil the Rivonia treason trial and
the Sharpeville massacre were, and how wrong it was that Mandela and
all the others went to prison. In their suffering they obviously read
and learned a great deal. In his final unconditional release from
prison—it is very important to remember that it was an
unconditional release from prison; he was offered all sorts of get out

want to conclude with some thoughts about the people who were in prison
with Mandela and also suffered a great deal. My constituency, Islington
North, is a place where many people have sought refuge at various times
and have been welcomed. I was very proud that David Kitson, one of
those imprisoned with Mandela, lived in my constituency for a long
time. Denis Goldberg, who was also in prison with Mandela, lived nearby
and ran a bookshop for a charity called Community HEART which still
exists, collecting books to be sent to schools in South Africa. We also
housed the offices of the British defence and aid fund for victims of
apartheid. I was a trustee of that, with the great Ethel de Keyser and
others. We were able to fund education for victims of apartheid and do
our bit to try to help the next generation of African leaders who had
been born in the front-line states in exile camps to get some kind of
university education. Many people did incredible work in that

involved in local government or as Members of Parliament during the
1970 and 1980s did our bit. Okay, it might be said that it is gesture
politics to name a street Mandela street or to name your student union
building the Nelson Mandela building, but in that act you are showing
which side you are on in the battle against apartheid. When we were
being condemned by the media at that time, I always thought,
“Suffer the little children to come unto me, for they know not
what they do.” Now they are all agreeing with us, as
unfortunately they were unable to do at that
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:27:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Many of

also housed in my borough the offices of the African National Congress

from the Metropolitan police, the South African secret service and
every other secret service one could imagine. Indeed, 
<?notus-xml column=57?>the Anti-Apartheid Movement was infiltrated. The ANC
offices were infiltrated. There were some ghastly goings-on in London
via the long reach of the South African secret service. Also under

number of parliamentary colleagues of mine, including the late great
Tony Banks and Stuart Holland, a former Member, and I were arrested
outside South Africa house. It was one of those strange moments when
you are arrested by the police and you say, “On what charge am I
arrested?”, assuming that one is going be told that one is
creating an obstruction or some such charge. The police said no, it was
under the Diplomatic Immunities Act, for behaviour that was offensive
to a foreign diplomatic mission. The police officer asked me,
“What do you plead? Why have you come here?”. I said,
“I’ve come here to be as offensive as possible to the
South African apartheid regime, but I offer no plea, so you will have
to offer a plea of not guilty on my part.” The cases all went to
court and we were all exonerated on the grounds of our moral outrage at
apartheid and all given compensation, and all that compensation was
given to the ANC and the Anti-Apartheid Movement. Some things do come

in thanking so many people for all their work in the Anti-Apartheid
Movement I must mention my friend the late great Bernie Grant, who went
to South Africa to witness the release of Nelson Mandela. When he
returned, Margaret Thatcher invited him to Downing street to discuss
what he thought about it all—it must have been a pretty surreal
moment for both of them. I hope that a record of the meeting
was kept, but I imagine that its release is subject to the 100-year
rule, or perhaps a million-year rule. I can well imagine what Bernie
would have said, but I am not sure about the

following thoughts. After his release, Mandela of course became
President of South Africa and did enormous and wonderful work, but
poverty has not been conquered there. There are still children who need
better schools and people who need homes, electricity and water, as
Denis Goldberg reminded us at a Community HEART fundraiser. But Mandela
also had things to say about other issues around the world. He was
deeply concerned about the plight of the Palestinian people and sent
them messages of support, not because he wanted the conflict to
continue but because he wanted it to end.</hs_Para>

of Mandela’s great legacies was to say, as President, that he
did not wish to preside over a Government who had nuclear weapons or
weapons of mass destruction. He took South Africa out of the nuclear
equation, thus enabling Africa to become a nuclear weapons-free
continent. There are many lessons we can learn from that. In
Nelson’s memory, let us change things a bit here. That will make

Horwood</B> (Cheltenham) (LD):</Member> I hesitate to rise and echo the
tributes of so many eloquent speakers. I think that the one
contribution Mandela made that has not yet been mentioned was his
founding, in retirement, of the global group The Elders, along with his
wife Graça Machel, Jimmy Carter, Mary Robinson, Kofi Annan and
others, at a time when surely he had earned the right to put his feet
up and spend more time with his family. He was a truly extraordinary
man.</hs_Para>

am also slightly daunted, because I think that this is the first time
in a parliamentary debate that I have followed three leaders of my
party. Honourable mention should also be made of one of their
predecessors in particular, David Steel, who was president of the
Anti-Apartheid Movement before becoming leader of the Liberal party. I
am not sure whether he would ever admit to having been inspired by the
example of the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:32:47"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Neath (Mr Hain) when he was in the National
League of Young Liberals—it is a shame that he is no longer in

Liberal Students, to invite Donald Woods to be that year’s

speaker.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120927000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120927000025">Donald<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:37:50"></hs_TimeCode>
Woods was an anti-apartheid activist and a banned journalist who
helped, along with Helen Zille of the <I>Rand</I> <I>Daily Mail</I>, to
expose to the world the murder of Steve Biko, which of course denied
South Africa another potential great leader. That is a salutary lesson
about how many people lost their lives in the struggle and how, when
Mandela said at the Rivonia trial that his ideals were ones for which
he was prepared to die, that was no rhetoric, because he faced the
imminent possibility of the death sentence. How different history might
have been if that had been the outcome.</hs_Para>

was one thing to be a liberal and an opponent of apartheid in this
country, but it was quite another to be that in South Africa. Alan
Paton and the Liberal Party of South Africa were increasingly militant
opponents of apartheid there. It was a Liberal party activist, Eddie
Daniels, who was the first person Helen Suzman met on her first visit
to Robben Island. He famously told her, “Don’t waste time
talking to us. Go and talk to Mandela at the end of the row.
He’s our leader.” It was an early indication of the
extraordinary way in which Mandela reached out to people beyond his own
natural constituency and to those from different political backgrounds
and traditions in South Africa. Daniels was sentenced to 15
years at Robben Island for violent sabotage, and he served every day of
it because he refused to renounce the armed struggle. Sometimes we have
to be prepared to fight for freedom.</hs_Para>

Liberal Party of South Africa faced being banned in 1968 for the
appalling crime of having party members who were from different races.
It chose to disband, 
<?notus-xml column=59?>rather than accept that outcome. For decades it
looked as though moderate voices were likely to be drowned
out in South Africa. We had the likes of Eugene Terreblanche on the
extreme right and some extreme voices on the other side making it look
as though the only possible outcome was a bloodbath. It is an
extraordinary testament to Nelson Mandela and the others who led the
ANC and other political parties at the time that they managed to
achieve a peaceful transition not only to a multiracial South Africa,
but to a multi-party democracy.</hs_Para>

Long before the rock concerts and the well-intentioned celebrity

Friend the Member for Neath (Mr Hain) spoke about his mother’s
fantastic relationship and friendship with Nelson Mandela. I cannot
boast anything of that order. However, my mother never tires of telling
me the story of one day when she was in Cape Town; I was not living
there at the time. She was, as many people do, walking with her head
down through the city streets during her lunch break, and she bumped
into someone she only knew was a tall man. She looked up, and it was
not just a tall man—it was Nelson Mandela. They spoke, and he
inquired as to who she was, what she did, what she believed in, and
what she thought. She said, “I apologise, Mr
Mandela”—I do not know what was going on his mind;
perhaps he was thinking, “She’s not going to vote for
me”, which of course she did—“I do hope you
don’t mind, but I have to get back to work, so we have to stop
our conversation.” I do not know whether my mother is the only
person who has done this.</hs_Para>

Mandela came to the UK and went to the grand receptions, the truth is
that I, like others, was probably a little intimidated by him. I did
not seek a

looking at his life, that one of the things that was not

are lost are missed not because of their achievements but for their
unfulfilled and uncompromised promise. It is so rare for anyone to
enjoy simultaneously a long life and near-universal love and respect,

to those who are denied a life beyond middle age. A man born before the

continent was defeated by an idea, and defeated by a group of
undernourished prisoners on a barren rock in an Atlantic bay. The
reconciliation after apartheid was a man-made miracle where millions of
women and men played their part, but Mandela was undoubtedly the
chemistry. In a troubled world, observers anguish that if only we had
more Mandelas, so many of the problems facing us could be resolved.
That is a pessimist’s view. I look at it in a different way,
which is that at least we had one Mandela, and for that we should all

travelling into the townships and homelands and using his privileged
access as an anthropologist to document the appalling treatment of
black people under apartheid, the pass laws and the use of control
mechanisms, then passing on the information to his contacts in the ANC.
While in South Africa, he wanted to dedicate a book that he had written

Dave Watts</B> (St Helens North) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful to be
able to pay my tribute to Nelson Mandela. He was a great leader and
statesman and a wonderful loving human being. Despite having to endure
27 years in jail he remained committed to his cause, forgave his past
enemies, and led his country from the dark times of apartheid to
freedom, democracy and equality under law. As I look back on his life,
I cannot but believe that that 27 years was wasted in prison. Imagine
Nelson Mandela 
<?notus-xml column=66?>as President as a young or middle-aged man. Imagine
the difference that he would have made to South Africa. Imagine the

real friend at all times, and I do not think that that is a bad quality
in a man. Desmond Tutu also said that he was a gift to South Africa.
Certainly he was a gift to South Africa, but he was probably a gift to
the whole world. He made us aware that despite any atrocities that we

perspective. It is from one who never met Nelson Mandela personally,

perspective is a point of coincidence, which I modestly share with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:05:03"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Neath (Mr Hain), whose speech today will resonate movingly
down the years. That point of coincidence is not because, like him, I
moved from one party to another, from the SDP to the Conservatives; he
moved the other way. It is not because I boycotted all South African
goods, at least until 1990. I never went to South Africa until the
2000s. It is not because as a young man I marched in London against
apartheid, or because I signed numerous petitions or as a member of
Amnesty International stayed in a cage trying to write letters and be
active on behalf of political prisoners. It was because of what Nelson
Mandela was doing that so many of our thoughts, particularly as young
people, were shaped by him and what he stood for.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:05:48"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) spoke exceptionally movingly, not just
about solidarity and freedom but about Nelson Mandela’s

our families, from generation to

me, the point of coincidence with the right hon. Member for Neath is
that I was born in Africa. I was partly brought up and educated there.
In my case, it was in a country then called Tanganyika. It has been
proudly independent as the United Republic of Tanzania for the last 50
years, and was host for many years to the ANC, not least for its
training at Morogoro and elsewhere. For people such as us, we never
quite shake the red dust of Africa from our feet. It is interesting
that for my parents not only is Julius Nyerere a great hero, but so is
Trevor Huddleston and so is Nelson Mandela. For them and for my
constituents, and for those few of us who are proud enough to have even
a minuscule part of Africa in us, I want to make one point. Although I
did not have the chance to meet Nelson Mandela personally, I have
through my work on malaria and development met Graça
Machel—his third wife, now his widow, but who when she met him
was already the widow of one President —who has shown such
commitment to the improvement of lives in her native Mozambique and to
the improvement of all lives in South Africa. She worked with Nelson
Mandela right through to the end, and through her strength, dedication
and devotion to him she showed deep commitment and care. But above all
she is now an advocate of his legacy, and our deep condolences go to
her and to all Nelson Mandela’s extensive
family<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:07:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120927000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120927000083">As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:07:55"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn) and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:08:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friends the Members for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) and for
North West Norfolk (Mr Bellingham) and others have said, Nelson Mandela
was a giant of values and practice—a man of great standards,
leadership, vision and inspiration, who has transcended politics today.
The legacy that Graça Machel and others will want to carry
forward is his championing of seeking peace and reconciliation, for
which I and so many others will continue to battle. It includes his
determination to bring down poverty, to build the capacities of good
government, and to fight for jobs and justice for all, in all
countries, and particularly in South Africa and the other nations of
Africa. His dedication to the fight against AIDS and other tropical
diseases that are totally treatable and avoidable was another feature
of his leadership. He said that ultimately his birthright was South
Africa and the African continent. He was an inspirational leader, a man
who set standards for us all to which we can only aspire, as it will be
impossible for us to reach them, but none the less they are worth
aiming for. He did in the end say that he belonged to South Africa, but
he embraced all of Africa and all the peoples in it. As we politicians
reflect today on his extraordinary life and on the electoral mandate
that has enabled us all to come to this place, I hope that his
legacy—and the leadership of Graça Machel as she
takes it forward—will mean that all the peoples, the leaders and
the Governments of the 54 countries of Africa will embrace Nelson
Mandela and what he meant for their future. His legacy and, above all,
his courageous heart will guide them and help them to build the freedom
and opportunity that the 1 billion and more Africans deserve. That is
the greatest legacy that he can give, and I am absolutely sure that he
will then be beaming down from above with his inimitable
smile.</hs_Para>

that visit, I also remember attending a reception at a hotel in a
rather nondescript place called Midrand, which, as the name implies, is
halfway between Johannesburg and Pretoria. I was talking to an
Afrikaner lady, who expressed her concern about what would happen to
South Africa now that it was in the hands of the majority. Obviously, I
found that conversation rather uncomfortable. I pointed out that they
were indeed the majority and that, as it had been an agreed

before the reception ended, the president of the chamber of commerce
announced that two of the young girls from the typing pool wanted to
sing for us. Two very small girls stood on the podium, put their arms
round each other and sang, a cappella, “Nkosi Sikelel’
iAfrika”. As they sang, tears started to run down the cheek of
the Afrikaner woman. When they had finished singing, she turned to me
and said, “This is still my country. It’s time I learned
the words.” That encapsulated the impact of what Nelson Mandela
was able to do. He made people understand that they had to move on, and
that they had to do so without recrimination and without looking
back.</hs_Para>

more often than not, those conflicts are between black and black,
rather than the civil war between the races that many people feared. I

and heard many things that had impressed me. I said I was impressed by
how the country was determined to move forward as a rainbow nation of
people who wanted to work together to put the past behind them and to
go forward together as one nation. Joe Slovo said to me, “We
won’t forgive, we can never forget, but you won’t build a
new nation on bitterness and revenge.” That seemed to me 
<?notus-xml column=70?>fundamentally to sum up what Nelson Mandela had achieved: only when
people can move forward, embrace the future and turn their back on the
divisions of the past, can they face the world and claim that they have
delivered freedom. There is a long way to go—it is still a long
walk—but, without Nelson Mandela, perhaps the first step would

South Africa, we could not do so together. I remember the tears of many
people in that mess room when they reflected on that experience. They
had experienced the same thing in America before the civil rights

the hatred that race brought in various communities. It is emotional to

Mandela’s love and devotion were not reserved only for his
family, but extended to his country, his people and all those who have
ever stood up to tyranny. His philosophy of reconciliation and of a
search for forgiveness; his political endeavour for a peaceful,
democratic transition from the dark night of apartheid; and his
relentless courage in the face of adversity allow him to stand tall in
comparison with those who sought to keep power through the sword and
without the consent of the
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:39:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120931000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120931000034">Few

key message, however, is that of forgiveness. After his release, Nelson
Mandela called not for revenge but instead for the Truth and

vengeance, such as the difficulties in Bangladesh, Kashmir or, as was
mentioned earlier, Sri Lanka, we see that the problem is that those
acts of vengeance give rise to other acts of 
<?notus-xml column=75?>vengeance, and things go off the rails. To that

debate and to our tribute to Nelson Mandela. Obviously, people in
Ireland—north and south—supported the Anti-Apartheid
Movement, inspired by men like Kader Asmal, who helped to found the
movement here in London and then founded it in Ireland when he moved
there. I spoke about him in my maiden speech in this House in 2005,

not everyone in Ireland had the same view. In Northern Ireland, people
tended to pick and choose their views according to party lines and
whose side they were on at home. If we rose above such squabbles, we
found that people in the Anti-Apartheid Movement, who were
inspirational themselves, were inspired by Nelson Mandela and by the
many people who were leading the struggle for democracy in South
Africa, whether they were in jail or body-swerving the system, avoiding
jail and organising in many different
ways<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:41:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120931000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120931000038">All
sorts of arguments and debates were raging here in the 1980s. I worked
for my predecessor, John Hume, as a researcher in Westminster, and I
also spent time working in Teddy Kennedy’s office in the States.
I know exactly what all the arguments were about why sanctions would
not work or should not be put in place, and the argument that the
geopolitical order required us to tolerate the apartheid regime. Even
while the Government here were officially condemning it, they were not
interfering with it in any
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:42:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120931000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120931000039">I
also recall that there was a threatened split in the Anti-Apartheid
Movement in Ireland in the mid-’80s. Sinn Fein had started
contesting elections and so on, and it joined the Anti-Apartheid
Movement on a corporate basis. Several significant people then left,
such as Garret FitzGerald. John Hume addressed a rally in Dublin, and
it was one of the few times he publicly disagreed with Garret
FitzGerald. He said that no differences to do with Irish politics
should in any way detract from combined and united solidarity in
repudiating the iniquity that was apartheid.
Both<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:43:20"></hs_TimeCode> at that
rally and in debates in the House, John Hume made the point that we
needed sanctions not just as a badge of moral indignation, and not just
to put an economic bite on a regime that needed its collar felt, but in
solidarity with the struggle for democracy in South Africa. After John
Hume made that speech, Kader Asmal, who subsequently told Nelson
Mandela that I helped to write it, made a point of getting it sent to
South Africa and taken to Nelson Mandela in prison. Kader Asmal said
that he thought it was the first time that a parliamentarian
had put it that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120931000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120931000040">As
a member of the Anti-Apartheid Movement—I represented the Union
of Students in Ireland and then my party—I found myself in the
unusual position of importing something into pre-democratic South
Africa in the early 1990s. It was two collapsible aluminium polling
booths that were made in my constituency, to be used as part of a
training exercise by the National 
<?notus-xml column=76?>Democratic Institute for International Affairs. I was one of an
international faculty helping in that exercise, in which regional and
local ANC activists
were<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:49:42"></hs_TimeCode> being
prepared for what may be involved in elections, so that they could
organise themselves. They were obviously seething during the
transition, because there were talks about talks, and there was a
question of whether there would be all-party talks or a constituent
assembly, and other difficulties of process followed. Nelson Mandela
and his fellow leaders had to keep people together through all those
troubles, difficulties and frustrations, and that was one exercise to
help achieve that. As well as the polling booths, which were used when
we split into two groups and toured the country, at the request of the
Americans I also brought unused books of ballot papers from Ireland,
north and south.</hs_Para>

met Nelson Mandela and, as I said, Kader Asmal, who became the Minister
of Water Affairs and Forestry in the Government of national unity and
then Minister of Education in the first ANC Government. Nelson Mandela
came to speak to all the political parties from Northern Ireland, which
were in South Africa to learn lessons and get an insight from the South
African process. It was not the first time we had done
that—there had been previous trips—but it was the first
time that all the parties were on one trip. We could not all share the
same transport, because at that stage Unionist parties still said that
they would not be in the same room or on the same transport as Sinn
Fein. Even when we were taken on a visit to a local beach, at
Africa’s most southerly point, apartheid South Africa’s
laws unfortunately had to be reinstated and there was
separation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:46:56"></hs_TimeCode>. I
was at the event with Kader Asmal, who was seething at the idea that we
were separated and imposing limits on ourselves, but he told me that
Nelson Mandela had said to him, “It is not up to us to impose
our standards on them. We can give them our example, and they will find
their way.” I thought that was particularly rich.</hs_Para>

initial idea was that Nelson Mandela would speak to certain parties in
one room, or one session, and then to other parties including Sinn
Fein, or to Sinn Fein on its own, in another room or another session. A
splendid solution was reached when people realised the architecture of
the centre meant that they could remove two glass sliding walls so that
some of us were under the roof while Nelson Mandela addressed us and
others were outside—not under the same roof. That is how
Unionist blushes were spared, but at least Nelson Mandela, as the
elected President of South Africa, was allowed the dignity of saying
the same thing to all of us at the same time.</hs_Para>

Mandela gave us many key messages and lessons at that event. There were

our enemies, not our friends, but there were also points about not only
needing to be sure about the integrity of our choice but needing to
allow space for the integrity 
<?notus-xml column=77?>of other choices. He said that it was not enough
just to get into talks—mutual engagement was not the target;
mutual adjustment was the real, hard
test<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:48:43"></hs_TimeCode>. He also

The fact that the House of Commons has spent the whole day paying
tribute to Nelson Mandela is, of course, a tribute to the man himself,
but it is also a tribute to the thousands of Africans who struggled for
their freedom. It is a tribute to activists such as Steve Biko, it is a
tribute to the ANC and to the ANC in exile, but it is also a tribute to
the thousands of ordinary people in, I believe, all our constituencies
who stood on street corners and campaigned over the decades to make the
release of Nelson Mandela

will always remember where I was when I saw Nelson Mandela being
released from prison, hand in hand with Winnie Mandela. I also remember
the BBC newscaster who was doing the bulletin. It was a friend of mine
and one of the most loved newscasters, Moira Stuart. I shall never
forget that, because the struggle against apartheid and the struggle to
free Nelson Mandela 
<?notus-xml column=79?>were part of the warp and weft of my life as a young
activist in the late 1970s and 1980s. There were the meetings, there
were the pickets, there was the examination of the oranges to make sure
they were—<I>[Laughter]</I>—I think that a lot of us have
been there—and there were the donations. For a certain
generation, that was the iconic international
struggle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:57:42"></hs_TimeCode>. There
were times when we thought that it was no more than a struggle and
Nelson Mandela could not be released, so seeing those television

experience for me.</hs_Para>

me say a little about Winnie Mandela. She did terrible things and
terrible things were done in her name, but no one who was active in the
anti-apartheid movement in the 1980s will forget her courage and beauty
when she was at the height of her powers. She endured long
years in internal exile; she endured 18 months of solitary
confinement, parted from her children; she endured beatings, and the
blowing up and killing of her friends and comrades around her. As I
have said, she did terrible things, but we cannot take away the fact
that at the height of the anti-apartheid struggle, she was a
transcendent
figure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120936000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120936000005">We
have heard about Nelson Mandela and his achievements today. I remember
seeing him on his first visit to the United Kingdom. The extraordinary
thing about him was not just his presence and charisma, but the fact
that there was no sense of the bitterness that he was entitled to feel
after spending 28 years in prison and seeing what had happened to his
friends and
family.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:50:49"></hs_TimeCode> As we
have heard, it was that nobility of purpose that enabled him—it
was his signal contribution—to drive through a peaceful
transition to majority rule without the bloodshed that so many people
prophesied. He also stood down after one term. If only more leaders in
countries around the world were prepared to do as he did and let go of
power.</hs_Para>

era that despises politicians, in which the word
“political” is practically a term of abuse. We live in an
era when too many young people believe that voting changes nothing, but
I was privileged to be an election observer for those very first
elections in which black people could vote. I remember leaving the
centre of Johannesburg and driving all the way up to Soweto, on the
edge of the city. We got there for 6 o’clock, but people had
been queuing for hours. When the polling station opened, I saw figure
after figure go into the polling station, mark the very long and
complicated 
<?notus-xml column=80?>ballot paper and then step to the ballot box. Many
of them looked around as they did so, as if even then someone would
say, “Not you, you’re not allowed to vote.” It was
being an observer at those elections that taught me the value of the
ballot—that people can struggle and die for the right to
vote.</hs_Para>

Mandela and anti-apartheid resonated with me as a young black woman
just getting active in politics. The anti-apartheid struggle taught me
that I was part of something international, and that politics was in
the end about moral purpose. It taught me that if you believe in
something, you should push on, because evil cannot stand. There is no
more respected politician among young people in the UK than Nelson
Mandela. It is a privilege to be allowed to speak today, and if people
would only believe what Nelson Mandela and the anti-apartheid struggle
believed—that you can alter your reality and it is worth getting
involved in the struggle and understanding the issues—our
politics would be enriched so
much.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13120936000073" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120936000073">8.2

Tom Clarke</B> (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) (Lab):</Member> One
of the joys and privileges of being a Member of this House—apart
from speaking for constituents, which I hope to do this
evening—is that we have a front seat as history unfolds. I shall
respond to your request for brevity, Mr Speaker, not least because one
of my recollections of Nelson Mandela was of the day he was released
from prison. Like most people, I was overjoyed. Then I suddenly
remembered that I had the first question for Mrs Thatcher at Prime
Minister’s questions that Tuesday. I thought a lot about that
question and I delivered it as best I could. At one point, the
formidable Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman, sitting on the second row of
Benches on the Government side, called out, “Too long.”
The then Speaker, Mr Bernard Weatherill, was forced to intervene,
saying, “I remind the hon. Gentleman that this is a question,
not a speech.”</hs_Para>

spirit, I hope to be brief in giving my recollections of a great life
that will be remembered for a very long time—that of Nelson
Mandela. Shortly after his release, he came to Glasgow. As hon. Members
have said, he had been given the freedom of the city of
Glasgow—the first city to do so—after the work of people
such as Janey Buchan, the Rev. Ian White, who was a minister in a
church in my constituency in Coatbridge, and my hon. Friend the
Member for Glasgow South West (Mr Davidson), who was a member of the
Glasgow city council that agreed the bestowing of the freedom of the
city, to the chagrin of the Glasgow<I> Herald</I>, which said that it
could not see any link between that man and Glasgow except perhaps in
the minds of a few Labour councillors. Now we know better.</hs_Para>

Mandela charmed the people of Glasgow and reminded us that he was a
person of principle and a man with deep values and a great vision for
the future. When he was elected President in 1994, I had the privilege
of being one of the observers at that election. I was in the
company of David Steel, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon
Valley (Ann Clwyd) and Bob Hughes—I am delighted that my hon.
Friend the Member for Aberdeen North (Mr Doran) recognised Bob Hughes
and his role in the campaign to end apartheid and bring freedom in
South Africa and elsewhere. The president was duly elected and the
world waited to see what would follow. He had defeated what most people

<?notus-xml column=81?>thought could not be defeated, and I remember his slogan in that
election, “Jobs, Freedom, Peace”. Even today in this
Parliament that remains our call for Britain and the rest of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120936000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120936000011">On
that election day, I recall the remarkable reaction to the fact that
people had the right to vote. I remember speaking with people—I
am delighted to have photographs of some of them on the wall of my
bedroom—including one woman who walked for seven hours and
waited three hours in the hot sunshine to exercise that right to vote.
One man—a small business person—said to me, “I am
58. If I die today, I will die a happy man because I have cast
a vote.”</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Cynon Valley and I recall that one of the things
we were asked to do was to visit a prison. I do not wish to be
controversial, but prisoners there had votes. Ironically, after they
had voted they came to us and said, “We’re free,
we’re free.” Perhaps there is a message there for all of
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120936000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120936000013">Time
went on and in due course, as right hon. and hon. Members have said,
the President of South Africa came to this Parliament. That was a
wonderful event, with—rightly—much pomp and circumstance,
as we would have expected and which the President of South Africa
deserved. One thing stands out in my mind, and it coincides with the
references that have been made throughout today to Nelson
Mandela’s humility. After he had delivered a wonderful speech in
the Palace of Westminster, he made his way down the aisle accompanied
by the then Speaker, Baroness Boothroyd. He stopped at the fourth or
fifth row where a frail, elderly little man was sitting and embraced
him, expressing his gratitude. It was Jeremy Thorpe. Mandela was
non-judgmental, a man of vision, compassion, forgiveness and
understanding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120936000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120936000014">On

international community could not stand by and watch while innocent
men, women and children were gunned down in Soweto or Sharpeville for
opposing that brutal regime. The boycott and sanctions were right; it
was not a question of sticks and carrots, but, as Archbishop Tutu said
at the time of the boycott, people were suffering anyway and the
boycott could not hurt them more. Music, prose, demonstrations and
speeches— all those forms of action—set the spark

progressive cause, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:16:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) said. I
remember my mum coming back from the greengrocers in our very
conservative part of suburban London having had a big argument about
why she would not buy the Outspan oranges, which were from apartheid
South Africa. It was the great

period in which I was most involved was when I was a student and when I
was in the National Union of Students. Student politics often has a
very bad name and can even be a term of abuse, but Nelson Mandela said
education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world,
and the United Kingdom student movement played a central role in the
campaign to release Nelson Mandela and to bring an end to apartheid.
Archbishop Trevor Huddleston said the student movement was the backbone
of anti-apartheid, and Nelson Mandela served as honorary president of
the NUS from 1969 until his death last week. Students were absolutely
central to the success of the boycott Barclays campaign to get the bank
out of South Africa, to putting pressure on universities and colleges
to disinvest and to the boycott of South African goods. It was very
striking that the various parts of the student movement, which
disagreed with each other about just about everything else, could come
together in unity and determination in the common cause to fight
apartheid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:17:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120936000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120936000027">A
number of Members on both sides of the House have mentioned Mike Terry.
He was the first NUS executive member to have responsibility, more
than 40 years ago, for work on southern Africa. He went on to
be secretary of the Anti-Apartheid Movement and only once apartheid was
brought down did he follow the career for which he had trained and
become a physics teacher. It was my pleasure to get to know him when he
was a physics teacher at Alexandra park school in Haringey in north
London and I was an education
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:18:27"></hs_TimeCode>. As
others have said, there is enormous cynicism about politics in this

the struggle to release Nelson Mandela are surely politics at its very,
very best.</hs_Para>

me mention briefly two other issues. Several Members have spoken about
what Nelson Mandela did and said about HIV and AIDS. I think it is fair
to say that while he was in office, tackling HIV and AIDS was not a
priority and, of course, his successor, President Mbeki, questioned the
link between HIV and AIDS. It was only after he left office that
Mandela’s role changed and was absolutely crucial. In 2000 he
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13120936000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0002.htm#13120936000069">“Our

sought to break the taboo, and lives were undoubtedly saved as a direct
consequence. As the Prime Minister said earlier, Nelson Mandela
announced that his own 
<?notus-xml column=84?>son, Makgatho, had died of AIDS. At that time, about
600 South Africans were dying every day of AIDS-related illnesses, but
often there was denial that AIDS was the cause of the deaths. Out of
office, Nelson Mandela confronted that culture of denial.</hs_Para>

there has been a focus today on the commitment in the South African
constitution to tackle racism and other forms of
discrimination. The South African constitution was the first in the
world to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. I wish to
finish with the following story, which I found when preparing for what
I would say today. It is a beautiful story about a black lesbian couple
who got married—this was before marriage had been legalised, but
a church was prepared to marry them. One of the families was not very
happy, so they went round and started to beat the other family up. The
fight ended up being taken to the police station in Soweto. The
police station commander sat the two families down and pointed to a
poster on the wall—a poster of Nelson Mandela. She said,
“Listen. That man, the father of our freedom, says it’s
okay for these women to be together. And if he says that, who are you
to argue?” That sorted things out. That little story says it
all: Nelson Mandela was a force for good, for decent values,
for justice and, as all contributors today have said, someone
from whom we can all learn.</hs_Para>

was born in Kilburn, of Irish immigrant parents. Twenty-five years
later, the Jamaicans arrived. Both groups met waves of prejudice. My
father, seeking lodgings, was told, “No Irish. No dogs.”
Twenty-five years later, the Jamaicans were told, “No blacks. No
dogs.” Both communities became the bedrock in north-west London
of a vibrant, diverse, thriving multicultural society. People from both
communities were present in 1962 at Nelson Mandela’s final
meeting in this country before he went back to South Africa and
ultimately stood trial for his life. He addressed the Willesden
Friendship League in Kilburn high road, but hundreds of yards from
where I was born. He enraptured the audience that night, and I will
never forget old Tom Durkin, the president of Brent Trades Council,
saying, “I have never met a man so optimistic in all my
life.”</hs_Para>

communities then became the bedrock of the anti-apartheid movement. We
look back now at that era and see that it was tough. It was tough for
black people, including in the world of work, above all in South
Africa, but also in this country. All too often, workplaces were
scarred by racism, which was compounded and encouraged by the naked
oppression of black people in South Africa. I recall one black
Transport and General Workers Union shop steward, George, in an Irish
pub in Kilburn high road, telling me the story of how grievously he
felt having been racially abused in his workplace. But, he said,
“I will stand up against it.” Who was his hero? It was

those bitter years of the anti-apartheid movement, many of us often
stood on freezing pavements outside South Africa house or outside
supermarkets trying to encourage people not to buy South African

fought against colonialism and racism in the Portuguese colonial
empire—Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde
Islands. I was deeply involved in that campaign. When Franco died and
then Salazar the year after, after 20 years of a liberation struggle
the Portuguese colonial empire collapsed. There was a process of rapid
decolonisation. In Angola, oil and diamond-rich, the South Africans
invaded from the south and the Zairians invaded from the north, and it
was only the Cubans coming in to fight with the MPLA that prevented
South Africa from taking over Angola.</hs_Para>

one night walking with Stephen and some of the other commission members
down the bay of Luanda. On the beach, the black soldiers from FAPLA,
the armed wing of the MPLA, and the black Cuban soldiers were boogying
around a camp fire. We got to talk, and one Cuban, who spoke very good
English, said, “For us, it is back to Africa. For us, it is
about the memory of Lumumba, Mondlane and the great figures of the

third, more recent story is from two months ago. I opened the new North
Birmingham academy in Kingstanding. That community was once scarred by
racism. I spoke to two young black pupils, one from a West Indian
background and one from an African background, who were discussing the
experiences that one of them and some members of their family had had.
They called those who had abused them on one occasion “little
people”. One of the guys said, “I am proud to be
black.” We then got into a discussion, and I found out that his
hero was Nelson Mandela.

what is so remarkable about Nelson Mandela is the sheer triumph of the

of his comrades taken out and hung. This is a man who was oppressed but

jailed for three decades and then came out and forgave his jailers, in
the most remarkable act of national reconciliation, avoiding what could
otherwise have been the most immense conflagration in southern Africa.

that would follow if he were to allow things to descend into any kind

the ripples of Nelson Mandela’s influence when I went to Hull
university in 1975. I knew nothing of him before then, but to meet

who had come to the city with a message against South African
oppression and about the work of Nelson Mandela in prison, calling on
people on the other side of the world to join them in their struggle to
help to relieve the pressure on lives in South Africa, was an immense
privilege. Like many speakers today, I did not buy Cape apples or
Stellenbosch wine, and I did not support the purchase of such goods
from supermarkets. I, too, did not allow my university to profit from
companies such as Barclays and Reckitt and Colman that invested in
South Africa at that time.</hs_Para>

big challenges, but to people who ask whether it was worth it and
whether anything changed, I believe that the ripples of Nelson Mandela
came to us, and we put one pebble on the roof of the apartheid
regime, and pebbles across the world were put on that roof until it
fell in and Nelson Mandela was free. Those were difficult times. Steve
Biko was murdered in a police cell. People routinely fell out of
windows, or fell downstairs; they drowned in the bath; they were shot
with a shotgun in the back of a vehicle for demanding the right to
vote. We meet today to celebrate that life and to say to the people we
represent, “Thank you for your small pebble on the roof of the

thousands of anti-apartheid campaigners across the world and in the UK,

reason for speaking is not least to talk about the contribution of a
constituent of mine from Heswall. He happens to have been my history
teacher at Wirral grammar school many years ago. He was my teacher from
my first year at school, and he also taught my sister. Bill
McCaig’s hallmark as a teacher was his friendliness and
enthusiasm. We all knew that about him, but what we never knew at the

ANC in its fight against the vicious apartheid regime.</hs_Para>

we are rightly telling Nelson Mandela’s story, and that of the
whole movement. Bill was politically involved and, like many from
Liverpool, he was also a seaman. It was through those political and
professional links that he became part of a secret network of people
linked to the ANC who, during some of the darkest years, when ANC
leaders were all locked away, chose to keep the struggle alive. The ANC
needed people who would not be suspected to go to South Africa to
distribute leaflets and give hope that the ANC would not be
crushed.</hs_Para>

Africa, for people he barely knew and in a continent far from home, he
answered the call. He used his position as a seaman to get to South
Africa to distribute materials, pass information from the ANC in
London, and take part in other operations. Along with many, many
others, he put his freedom in jeopardy for the greater good. When I
asked him why he did this, he said, “Well, I wouldn’t
have done it if I didn’t think that in the end we would
win.” The idea that history was on their side sustained him and
his comrades. To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>

talking to my old history teacher in recent days, Bill also said to me
that attempts to deify Mandela should be resisted. Mandela was an
acutely aware politician, and he knew that a successful country must be

the capacity to show love and care for one another. White

Edinburgh was one of the

offering him the freedom of the city, which he gave us the honour of
accepting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:59:57"></hs_TimeCode>. That
award from Edinburgh came fairly late in the day—much later, I
am afraid, than that from our friends in Glasgow—because
Edinburgh city council required a two-thirds majority to grant someone
freedom of the city and at the time the award was first suggested in
the 1980s, as an act of solidarity, the council chamber did not, to put
it tactfully, share the same political consensus on Nelson
Mandela’s virtues as that shared by this Chamber

am glad to say that when the freedom of the city was proposed some
years later, shortly before the 1997 Commonwealth Heads of Government
meeting in Edinburgh, the council agreed unanimously that it should be
offered to Nelson Mandela, and President Mandela, as he then was, found
the time to accept the award in person when he attended that
Commonwealth
meeting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T21:00:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120940000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/debtext/131209-0003.htm#13120940000033">Although
that freedom of the city came late, I can say with pride that we did
not have to wait as long for the support given by many of the people of
Edinburgh to the Anti-Apartheid Movement. Like many communities up and

also became home to many exiles from South Africa during the apartheid
years, no doubt because of those historic links and solidarity. In many
cases, they were political activists who would, of course, have faced
heavy penalties if they had conducted that activity in South Africa.
They took part in, and inspired others to join, anti-apartheid
campaigns in Edinburgh and elsewhere. Some of those South African
exiles still live in Edinburgh. Although they will no doubt be in
mourning, they will also be immensely proud of what Nelson Mandela did
in his life for the country and for the world. As one of

physical and emotional trauma that he was put through, he embraced that
without bitterness or recrimination. It would have been so easy and
understandable to have responded to that in a different way. I have no

his strengths and values, but words ring hollow if they are not
followed up by action. I urge all hon. Members to consider that. It is
unacceptable in this country in this day and age that one in
four young black men are unemployed, and one in 14 young white men are
unemployed. We must do something about such inequalities. They persist
even across groups with the same educational attainment levels. We must
redouble our efforts to build a fairer, more just society. It would be

know how many from Chesterfield were involved in their own way in the
British arm of the struggle against apartheid. I remember my mother
moving her bank account from Barclays, as many opponents of apartheid
did, and the numerous tiny gestures made by so many people, which all

concert at Wembley, and we know how important the sporting boycotts,
from the D’Oliveira affair to the bans for cricketers who played

It was therefore so uplifting that Mandela should have recognised the
huge role of the Springboks in the psyche of white South Africa. By
extending the arm of friendship to, and supporting, the 1995 Springbok
team that famously won the rugby world cup, he showed the tremendous
gift of forgiveness, which will be his enduring legacy. Long after all

Nelson Mandela showed time and again that victory and success are found
not just in how people battle their oppressors, but in how they seek
the peace and rebuilding of a nation. After 27 years of captivity and
isolation, after his release and his subsequent electoral success, and
at every moment at which he might understandably have sought vengeance,
he sought only truth and reconciliation. In place of hubris, there was
humility. In the early days after apartheid, when he and the ANC could
have turned against their former oppressors, he urged them to turn
towards them and to work together for a better collective future. The
magnitude of that magnanimity is incredible, even today. It is

had the most grotesque and extreme of life’s Kafkaesque

hold a memorial service. It was banned from doing so in South Africa. I
am proud that, even though we should not have had to do it, the

Ralph Gayton, who are three former presidents of my union, Unison, and
its predecessor, the National and Local Government Officers
Association, and Jan Stockwell, who was an international
officer of the same union. They spent weeks in 1984
going to Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town. They took
travellers cheques to that country, cashed them and put the money in

provided a network that he could build on. That is where he got his
strength from when he came out of jail. It was on that group of people
that he built the democratic society that we know today. The TUC in
this country gave Nelson Mandela a gold medal in absentia and launched
a major campaign, working with the boycott campaign. Rodney
Bickerstaffe, who was the general secretary of Unison and the National
Union of Public Employees, visited Mandela in jail and brought back a
smuggled tape, which was played at the TUC conference. When millions of
people do the right thing, it is the epitome of what trade unions and
ordinary working people can do when they come together. Nelson Mandela

way in which Nelson Mandela went on to lead his country, and then to
change attitudes towards HIV and AIDS and work on the world stage, was
amazing. He was able to come from oppression to lead constructive
reconciliation. The most important way in which we can pay tribute to
him is to continue to challenge injustice wherever we see it, both in
our own country and across the world, particularly, as many Members

speak to those on both sides of conflict, even if that seems an
impossible task.

Mandela’s. Other global events were taking place at the time.
John F. Kennedy was born in the preceding year, and in 1960, when he
stood for the presidency, he did so largely on a platform of racial
integration. That was the year in which I was born, and it was the
tragic year in which 67 people were massacred in Sharpeville.
They were innocent black protesters, and many were shot in the back.
That was the point at which Mandela moved away from protest that
involved no direct action and towards violent protest and sabotage, and
the point at which the ANC was criminalised. Mandela took that action
to focus the world’s attention on South Africa and the need for
democracy and human rights, and some 200 acts took place during that

Member for Derby South (Margaret Beckett) and the shadow Leader of the
House said, it is sometimes said that he somehow transcended politics,
but that is wrong as he used political means to achieve political
objectives and in doing so was the epitome of a politician. He
recognised that it is the nature of politics for there to be a conflict
of interest, but the very best politician is somebody who enables those
competing interests not to lead to conflict but to be
reconciled. His pursuit of forgiveness and reconciliation is an
inspiration for us all.</hs_Para>

public order; the stabilisation of the country; the restoration of
state authority over the whole country; and the creation of conditions
to enable the provision of humanitarian assistance. It also authorises

de-mining work in Sri Lanka. On 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister
announced a new £2.1 million UK Government funded programme to
clear landmines and explosive remnants of war from areas of Northern
Sri Lanka devastated by conflict. This programme will allow heavily

Commissioner for Human Rights that there have been no credible efforts

numbers of company liquidations. The increase between the first and
second quarters of 2013 is not unusual. Historically figures have
fluctuated quarter on quarter due to a range of factors such as holiday
periods and creditor activity. The second quarter figures for 2013 are
broadly in line with the last two quarters of 2012, and are down on the
same period in 2012. Importantly, liquidations have been steadily
falling since 2011 and the most recent figures for the third quarter

of Parliament recently considered the legal framework which governs

not circumvented or attempted to circumvent UK law. However, the
Intelligence and Security Committee did announce its intention to
review whether the current statutory framework, which governs security
and intelligence agencies' access to the content of private
communications, remains adequate. The Interception of Communications

Barker:</Member></B> On Wednesday 4 December, DECC published a number
of Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) documents, including an update on the
budget management of the Domestic RHI. In that document we state that,
at the tariff levels in place when the scheme launches, we believe that
the scheme could see an increase from current levels of renewable heat
deployment to approximately 35,000 installations in 2014-15 and 57,000
installations in 2015-16. This is a significant increase on current
levels of deployment, but it is important to note that this is the sort
of scale of deployment that the budget can support rather than a
specific target for deployment. The actual number of installations
supported will depend significantly on the balance between technologies
and the size of
installations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120935000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/text/131209w0001.htm#13120935000174">If
tariff levels reduce as a result of deployment meeting a degression
trigger (demand for the scheme was very high or technology costs were
lower than we anticipated), we would be able to support an even larger
number of
installations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120935000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/text/131209w0001.htm#13120935000175">The
total cost of the domestic scheme is estimated to be £44.8
million in 2014-15 and £80.1 million the following year. This
includes funding for payments to those who have already acted in line

Protection Centre (CEOP), now a Command of the National Crime Agency

Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse” on 2 July 2013. The

threat and that use of it by UK offenders as a method of sharing
illegal images of children had most likely
increased.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120937000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/text/131209w0001.htm#13120937000151">The

Transparency Agenda considerations: Median gross pay has been
calculated using annualised, full-time equivalent basic salary plus
London living allowance. This is consistent with the methodology used
in the Home Office annual report and accounts 2012-13, previous PQ
responses and the Employment Monitoring Report
2012-13.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6.
Calculations: The median is the numerical value or quantity found at
the mid-point of an ordered list of values or quantities (in this case
salary). The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by
arranging them from lowest to highest value and picking the middle one.
If there is an even number of observations, and no single middle value;
the median is then taken to be the mean of the two middle
values.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">7.

Vaizey:</Member></B> Ofcom is responsible for telecommunications market
regulation, including price regulation where appropriate. Openreach,
the part of the BT Group which owns the network infrastructure, is
required by Ofcom to offer access to infrastructure to BT and other
communications providers on non-discriminatory terms. Where price
regulation is in place, the price that BT is allowed to charge for
access is either set by Ofcom or required to be cost-oriented. Ofcom
regularly reviews markets and prices to ensure competition.
Communications providers also have the option of rolling out their own
networks to provide services. The Government has taken steps to make
rollout of networks easier and more cost-effective including
streamlining planning rules and allowing the deployment of new overhead
lines.</hs_Para>

Grant:</Member></B> Sport England's 2013-17 Whole Sport Plan investment
in the national governing bodies of sport (NGBs) is focused on
increasing overall participation with an emphasis on young people and
disabled people. Sport England rigorously reviews the performance of
each NGB every six months. Each NGB is subject to a robust performance
management regime. This includes a ‘payment for results’
approach that focuses on delivering the participation increases agreed
in their Whole Sport Plans. NGBs receiving Sport England investment

Vaizey:</Member></B> No such assessment has been made. Section 5 of the
BCAP Code (the UK code of broadcast advertising) focuses specifically
on advertising to children, and complements the general code provisions
that advertisements must not mislead, harm, or cause serious or
widespread offence. The Government recognises the importance of
maintaining an effective, proportionate regulatory framework to protect
children; as such, advertisements for alcohol, or foods high in fat,
salt and sugar, for example, are banned in advertisements around
programmes aimed at (or likely to appeal to)
children.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_09_PT_1/9BB221193514A789FA1906C8AB63DFC78964D5B3" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="9 December 2013">Monday

directive (2000/29/EC) permits fresh potato imports from countries
which comply with the relevant EU import requirements. These exist to
protect all sectors of the EU potato industry, including companies
producing crisps. Studies have demonstrated the benefits of retaining
freedom from plant diseases, such as ring rot. In most years, the UK
produces sufficient potatoes to meet the needs of the crisp

Government understands the seriousness of the UK’s request for
Mr Aamer’s release. It is necessary for the UK
Government to keep the details of diplomatic discussions with the
United States Administration confidential. Any breach of the United

Wright:</Member></B> The home detention curfew (HDC) scheme enables a
managed transition to the community in suitable cases, using
electronically monitored curfew to provide some structure for lower
risk offenders as they leave prison and reintegrate into society. In
2012 the overall HDC release rate was 25% of those in the eligible
group. For men it was 24% while for women it was 40%. There are a
number of factors which may contribute to female prisoners being more
likely to be released on HDC but overall it is because they are more
likely to pass the required risk and suitability assessment. A smaller
proportion of female offenders are serving sentences for sexual and
violent offences and women have lower reconviction rates compared to
men and are, therefore, more likely to be assessed as likely to comply
if
released.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120943000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/text/131209w0002.htm#13120943000314">The

on all interventions aimed at tackling offending behaviour. From
2012-13, the targeting of accredited offending behaviour programmes was
towards higher risk offenders as the evidence suggested that these
offenders were the most likely to respond to this type of intervention.
This meant that there were fewer accredited programmes delivered
overall but those that were delivered were the more intensive
programmes aimed at higher risk offenders. For those offenders who were
no longer targeted for accredited programmes, probation trusts have
developed a wider range of activity requirements which incentivised the
development of innovative approaches to reducing reoffending and which
were targeted at lower risk
offenders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120943000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131209/text/131209w0002.htm#13120943000332">Equivalent

increasing access to modern family planning methods, improving coverage

Timpson:</Member></B> Our statutory safeguarding guidance "Working
Together to Safeguard Children 2013" states that every assessment of a
child who has been referred to children's social care should draw
together information gathered from the child and their family and from
relevant professionals including teachers, early years workers, health
professionals, the police and adult social care. Where a child and
family does not need support from children's social care, but would
benefit from co-ordinated early help from more than one agency, the
guidance states that there should be an inter-agency assessment.
However, we believe decisions about which tools are used to support
those assessments are best taken locally and we do not therefore
prescribe the use of any particular model.</hs_Para>

changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity

experience of services is assessed regularly in a number of ways;

of these methods generate data on satisfaction with NHS services.
Overall, these show that patient satisfaction with NHS services is
relatively high. Data from the Ipsos Mori Public Perceptions of the NHS
and Social Care Tracker (see table 1) and in the Care Quality
Commission (CQC) Adult Inpatient Survey (see table 2a and 2b) show that
there has been a slow shift respectively towards more satisfaction and
more positive rating of care over time.</hs_Para>

patients how likely they would be to recommend the care they just
received to a friend or family member if they needed similar care or
treatment. The test enables patients to provide virtual real-time
feedback on services with results published down to ward level and it
is being rolled out across the wider NHS. Already there is evidence
that providers are using this feedback to celebrate what is good but
tackle areas where improvements are
