intimidation towards our staff very seriously. There is a robust
process in place for the thorough investigation and assessment of
intimidation claims. Depending on the threat severity, different
mitigating actions can be taken, including relocation within
Afghanistan or, in exceptional cases, to the United Kingdom. It is not

to risk their lives for us but not trust them enough to rely on their

the redundancy scheme and the intimidation policy and instead offer all
the interpreters the same targeted assistance package that was
available to the Iraqi interpreters? Will the Minister also agree to
arrange a meeting with all relevant departments and a cross-party group

the security of our locally engaged staff during and beyond the term of
their employment with Her Majesty’s Government. The threat
environment is different from Iraq. We have a very thorough
anti-intimidation policy which applies to all staff employed since 2001

The IIU investigates claims of intimidation, and an in-theatre decision
panel assesses the claim and appropriate response level, depending on
the risk to the LEC. The MoD’s labour support unit can confirm

However, 76 NHS walk-in centres have been closed over the past three
years and the Monitor report makes clear that this is often without
proper consultation locally on alternative provision, leading to
increased pressure on A&amp;E and urgent care services. In
Monitor’s survey, one in five patients using the centres said
that they would have visited the nearest A&amp;E department had the
centre not been there. Monitor also finds in a number of cases that the
closure decision has been made by CCGs, with member GP practices
themselves having a financial interest in whether or not the service
continues. What action will the Government take to ensure that, if
future closures of walk-in centres are considered, the public will be
properly consulted and patients will have access to an equivalent level

One of the findings of the Monitor review was that, when responsibility
for walk-in centres was handed down to local commissioners in 2007,
many of them were decommissioned because they were duplicating services
locally and GPs felt that they were paying twice for the same thing. I
am sure that the ideas the noble Baroness has put forward will have a
resonance in many

Wall of New Barnet (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Earl
suggested in his response earlier that part of the problem might be
that the commissioners felt that they were paying twice. Obviously, GPs
are paid for the people on their lists; those same people could use the
call centre and they would have to be paid again. How does this fit
with the view—certainly the view on the policy—that you
can belong to any GP throughout the country, which is exactly what
should happen and, if it did, we would not have this dilemma? Walk-in
centres are hugely important. I assure the House that, from the point
of view of the provider trust, they are absolutely vital to stop people
coming into A&amp;E and possibly being

Young of Hornsey (CB):</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness for her
reply. She will be aware, as will other noble Lords, that 1,130 people
died in the Rana Plaza tragedy earlier this year. Seven months on,
there are still employees in garment factories in Bangladesh who lose
their lives, their health or their employment. Fatal building collapses
and fires are not the only problem that the fashion industry has to
face, and in spite of companies signing up to accords and agreements on
factory safety, there is still a long way to go. Does the noble
Baroness agree that the objective to maximise good rather than minimise
harm is the right one, and that the Government should support and
encourage fashion retailers to take full responsibility for monitoring
what happens throughout the supply chain and to change their business
models so as to move away from their dependency on cheap, throwaway
fashion? Also—I know that this is not her
department—while BIS’s aim to produce a framework for
action on corporate responsibility is welcome, is she able to tell the
House the extent to which DfID will be co-operating with BIS, as
clearly the fashion trade operates

the fact that the United Kingdom is doing a lot in Bangladesh, not
least through the accord, which is legally binding and to which a
number of UK and European companies have signed up. In the United
Kingdom, we are working with British companies for the very reasons
that the noble Baroness outlines. In September, the United Kingdom
launched its action plan on business and human rights to give effect to
the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.

general, have reacted very well in embargoing factories that employ
children. This was relatively easy for them, because they sent their
inspectors to the factory and the position was clear. In the case of
possible structural damage to buildings, the ability to appraise this
is beyond the expertise of most commercial enterprises. After
all—to take, for example, one of Britain’s leading
retailers—Sir Philip Green is many things but he is not a
structural engineer. Is it not the responsibility of Governments in
those countries to ensure that building regulations are complied with
and that safety certificates are issued which will assure importers
that the manufacture of their goods in those factories is done in a
correct and proper fashion? Will the Minister send a strong message to
those countries, warning them that if those certificates are not

there is a legally binding accord that includes the unions representing

Kiev on the night that the demonstrators were attacked. I confirm to my
noble friend that the demonstrators, who had been democratically
calling for closer trade links with the European Union, had been both
peaceful and good humoured and that the violence came entirely from the
Government’s security police. I am not sure what will be served
by an investigation to further establish that. Is it not a political
fact that the Ukrainian Government have caved in to the financial
blackmail of Russia while the demonstrators have rejected the bribes,
are acting out of principle and very much deserve our

country is going in. I was at the Vilnius summit at the end of the
November, where it was anticipated that Ukraine would sign the
association agreement, which it had initialled in 2012. We were

Falkner of Margravine (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, does my noble friend
accept that while Russia’s intervention just before the
association agreement was mostly unhelpful—clearly, pressure was
applied—the European Union was also at some fault for pressing
Ukraine so firmly to be ready to sign in Vilnius, rather than giving
Ukraine more time to prepare itself in terms of its economic
engagements when it signs up to the association agreement? In
light of the specific question about what the UK Government might do,
have we contemplated working with the opposition groups? The opposition
in Ukraine is still fairly divided and, looking forward to the 2015
elections—or any change of Government before then—it is
vital that we get a united opposition to Mr Yanukovych’s

the other House, one thing that influenced us a lot was what happened
with tax credits, which was why we took the decision to move in early
and do this reset. Tax credits were announced in 2001 and rolled out
from 2003. In the first three years of operations, £6 billion
was overpaid and 400,000 claimants received their payments late, a
third of cases monitored by Citizens Advice had their payments reduced
below the poverty line, and IT systems were deemed unstable and not fit
for purpose by the PAC. We have not done that. We have moved in early

of the IT system that will handle universal credit, the more I would
urge the Minister to ensure that there is a paper system as back-up for

stage, a judgment has had to be made about whether the public sector
comparator alone would generate sufficient competitive tension to
ensure an effective outcome for the Armed Forces and value for money

entity will be at arm’s length from the rest of the MoD, with a
separate governance and oversight structure—a strong board under
an independent chairman, and a chief executive who will be an
accounting officer, accountable to Parliament for the performance
of the organisation. This will deliver another of the
recommendations from the noble Lord, Lord Levene. Crucially, we will
permit the new organisation significant freedoms and flexibilities,
agreed with the Treasury, 
<?notus-xml column=729?>around how it recruits, rewards, retains and manages
staff along more commercial lines to reflect its role in managing some
of the most complex procurement activity in the

changes will reinforce the relationship between the military command
customers and DE&amp;S, leading to a more business-like approach,
allowing us to move earlier to a hard-charging regime and thus further

They will allow DE&amp;S to procure crucial private sector support
through a series of contracts to deliver key changes to systems and
processes and to support programme management while organic
capabilities are built. They will permit the recruitment into DE&amp;S
of key commercial and technical staff at market rates and with minimum
bureaucracy. Bernard Gray has agreed to become the first chief
executive of the new trading entity, thus providing a vital thread of
continuity to the continuing DE&amp;S reform agenda from the original
Gray report. Alongside the changes to DE&amp;S, we will also continue
with the reform of our wider acquisition system, which is focusing on
making us a more intelligent customer—a key role for our

2 of the Bill sets out a statutory framework for defence contracts

defence acquisition published in June this year included important
changes to our single-source procurement regime. These changes follow
the independent report on single-source procurement that was carried
out by the noble Lord, Lord Currie of Marylebone, in 2011.
Although competition is our preferred approach, the need to maintain
critical national industrial capabilities or sovereign control of the
intellectual property in equipment programmes sometimes requires us to
place contracts without a competitive process. Single-source
procurement typically accounts for about 45% of the total the MoD
spends on defence equipment and support, or about £6 billion per
year, and is likely to remain at those levels for the next decade or
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000092">Without
competition, suppliers can price and perform without being constrained
by the disciplines of the marketplace, putting value for money at risk.
The absence of an alternative supplier also undermines our contractual
negotiations because we have a duty to provide our Armed Forces with
the equipment they need, and our suppliers know we cannot go elsewhere.
These are serious shortcomings, and we need to address them with an
approach to single-source procurement that ensures we get value for
money, while still allowing our suppliers a fair and reasonable price,
and where the safeguards we need are not regarded as voluntary and a
matter for negotiation.</hs_para>

framework for single-source procurement which has remained largely
unchanged for the past 45 years. Under this system, which is voluntary,
the profit contractors can earn is fixed and there are few incentives
for them to reduce costs. The noble Lord, Lord Currie, recommended a
new framework: one that is based on transparency, with much stronger
supplier efficiency incentives, and which is underpinned by stronger
governance arrangements. Based on his recommendations, and following
extensive consultations with our major single-source suppliers, we have
developed the framework provided for in Part

Forces make an essential contribution to delivering the nation’s
security at home and overseas. They are an invaluable part of our Armed
Forces, working alongside their regular counterparts to deliver
military capability. On 3 July this year, we published a
White Paper that set out a range of measures for revitalising the
Reserve Forces, reversing the decline of the recent past, growing their
numbers and investing an additional £1.8 billion over 10 years
in their training and support. These measures include improved training
and more opportunities for reservists to train overseas, enabling them
to undertake the same range of military tasks as regulars, including
overseas capacity building and responding to crises at home. The
tax-free annual training bounty will be developed to recognise
commitment, encourage retention and reward the appropriate level of
capability. Reservists will also have improved access to healthcare and
better access to welfare support. This will provide reservists with a
challenging and rewarding experience. The Bill before us today includes

of the Bill makes changes to the Reserve Forces. First, it extends the

allow reservists to be called out for any purpose for which regular

by regulations, to provide for the making of payments to employers to
incentivise the recruitment and retention of reservists. Thirdly, it
provides improved employment protection for reservists by allowing a
right of access, without a qualifying employment period, to the
employment tribunal for unfair dismissal where dismissal relates to
their reserve service. In addition, the Territorial Army will be

this by making liability for call-up more predictable, making it easier

available and introducing a new employer recognition scheme building on
the corporate covenant to ensure that reservist employers receive the
recognition that they deserve. We acknowledge that reserve service can
have a particular impact on SMEs. We understand these challenges and
believe that our measures, particularly those around providing
employers with greater predictability, greater transparency and
financial support,

in a remarkable situation today, in that we have the Second
Reading of a Bill that provides, among other things, for major changes
in procurement and support of defence equipment, yet just over two
hours or so before this debate started the Secretary of State was
making a Statement in the other place on defence procurement that
significantly altered the Government’s position. That is a sign
not of bad luck but of bad judgment, and an indication of the extent to
which procurement policy now appears to be being made on the hoof.
However, despite the Statement by the Secretary of State earlier this
afternoon, much of which the Minister has reiterated, this Bill still
has three main parts, including Part 1 on defence
procurement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000105">Part
1 sets out the arrangements for changing Defence Equipment and
Support and making it into a government-owned, contractor-operated
organisation. Part 2 establishes a statutory framework for the
governance of Ministry of Defence single-source contracts—that
is, contracts that are not subject to a legal obligation to be
advertised and competed for. Part 3 makes several amendments to the
regulations governing the Reserve Forces in the light of the enhanced
role our reserves will play in
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000106">The
Government have been considering two options for the future operating
model for Defence Equipment and Support; namely, the GOCO entity or the
public sector comparator under which DE&amp;S would remain entirely
within the public sector. Legislation is required to pursue the former
option and, even though it had 
<?notus-xml column=732?>not been the Government’s intention to make a
final decision on whether to pursue the GOCO option until next summer,
the relevant enabling legislation was included as part of this Bill.
The Secretary of State has now announced that he has decided not to
continue the present commercial competition, which was no longer a
competition because there was only one bidder. Instead, the Government
have decided to do what the Secretary of State describes as building on
the DE&amp;S-plus proposal. But his last-minute proposal is, as yet,
only in
outline.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000107">In
respect of our Reserve Forces, the Bill contains four key measures.
These are renaming the Territorial Army, expanding the powers to call
out the Reserve Forces, introducing new financial incentives for the
employers of reservists, and exempting reservists from the statutory
two-year qualifying period required to bring an unfair dismissal case
to an employment tribunal. These measures, which require legislation,
are part of the Government’s policy for reconfiguration of the
Army into two distinct elements, a high readiness reaction force and an
adaptable force. This change is associated with the reduction in the
size of the Regular Army by 20,000 personnel by 2020, and also involves
a greater integration of the Territorial Army into the Army structure
with an expansion in the roles that the reserves will undertake
and an increase, by 2018, in the number of trained reservists to
30,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000108">Single-source
contracting accounts for approximately 45% of all Ministry of Defence
contracts and equates to £6 billion per annum. At present, such
contracts are placed under a non-legally binding framework, which can
be amended only on the basis of consensus. A review of the current
arrangements has been undertaken, which has led to the proposals in
Part 2 of this Bill for a new statutory framework for single-source
contracts. There is also provision for a civil penalty regime to ensure
compliance, and the creation of a Single Source Regulations Office,
which is intended to ensure the regime is kept up to date, monitor the
application of the regulations, and provide binding determinations in
the event of disputes between the Ministry of Defence and single-source

the face of it, one would not now expect this Bill to be the subject of
great controversy, and particularly so in the light of the Secretary of
State’s announcement earlier today. We also hold the view that
defence procurement and support is in need of reform. Any difference of
view will come over how that reform should now be achieved
in the light of recent developments. We share the view, recently
expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Levene of Portsoken, that the review
of materiel strategy, which has been going on for some time, needs to
be brought to a conclusion in view of the uncertainty for the future it
creates and the amount of time and effort that is being expended on it,
and that the quickest and most straightforward solution is via
DE&amp;S-plus, subject to that embracing appropriate employment and pay
freedoms.</hs_para>

solution is also not as far removed as the GOCO option from the
proposal we made for reform of defence procurement. However, it appears
that the Government intend to leave Part 1 in the Bill, which, as it
stands, would provide the necessary legislative 
<?notus-xml column=733?>powers to set up a GOCO, with little further ado,
at a later date. Doing that will simply perpetuate the
uncertainty over the future arrangements for reform of defence
procurement, which will be of benefit to nobody, least of all our Armed
Forces. It means that the change could be made to a GOCO without proper
scrutiny, and leaves the suspicion that the announcement today by the
Secretary of State represents little more, as far as the Government are
concerned, than a stop-gap

Levene, referred in his recent report. Perhaps the Minister could make
the situation worse, or, alternatively, improve the situation in
relation to future uncertainty for the proposed new DE&amp;S

was the day before Report stage in the House of Commons last month that
the Government announced that one of the two remaining consortia
bidding for the government-owned, contractor-operated organisation had
withdrawn from the competition, and that work was under way to
determine whether it was in the public interest for the Ministry of
Defence to proceed with only one commercial bidder and the public
sector comparator, DE&amp;S-plus. It had already been made clear before
then that the Government’s strong preference was for the GOCO,
and that they would be testing this proposition through a
commercial competition and against that public sector comparator. The
impression was certainly given, and remains after today’s
announcement, that the DE&amp;S option was in essence being undertaken
to provide a benchmark to justify the GOCO rather than it ever being
the option the Government would take if they could avoid

concerns have been raised in a number of quarters about the proposal to
transfer the whole of defence acquisition and support to a private

transfer to the GOCO, how a GOCO would make money while also saving the
Ministry of Defence money, what the implications would be for our

further key question, though, is why it has taken three weeks from the
day before Report stage in the House of Commons to today for the
Government to decide that their declared key objective for
ensuring a rigorous evaluation process of the GOCO
option—namely, a commercial competition—was no longer
valid or achievable when the competition was somewhat diminished in
rigour once the number of competitors had been reduced to one. The
suspicion must be that the Government were in reality so wedded to the
GOCO option as their vehicle for achieving the reform of defence
procurement—a reform that we also agree 
<?notus-xml column=734?>is needed—that they were prepared to contemplate proceeding
without a commercial competition; in other words, a form of
single-source contract. That is a further reason why there are question
marks over why Part 1 remains in the Bill despite today’s
announcement, and a feeling that if the Government were prepared to
contemplate proceeding with the GOCO option without any commercial
competition, that is what they may be tempted to do at a later
date if Part 1 remains in the

position should be that if a Government decide that they want to
achieve reform of defence procurement at some stage in the future
through the GOCO route, they should be required to do so through means
of a parliamentary Bill at the time to justify their stance and their
new proposal, and not be able to do so without proper scrutiny using a
parliamentary Bill that had been passed some time previously and during
the course of which, before it had even been discussed in this House,
the Government announced they no longer intended to proceed with the
now non-existent competition and its single proposal or bid. We will
certainly be pursuing the question of why Part 1 remains in this Bill,
since no satisfactory explanation has been given as to why it should
remain, rather than be brought back for full scrutiny in a further Bill
if a Government decided to go down the GOCO route at a future date. I
should like to ask the Minister
how<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:49:50"></hs_TimeCode> much public
money has been spent on this competition exercise so far, and whether
it is anticipated that there will be claims from any of the
consortia—not least the one that was still left standing, which
must also have invested a considerable amount of time and effort in
preparing and submitting a proposal that the Government have said ran
to more than 1,200
pages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000116">The
other area where the Government have run up against problems is in

crucial. Employers in the fields of, for example, cybersecurity and the
medical world may well be more enthusiastic than others in seeing their
staff join the reserves as the knowledge and experience they will gain
in those fields as members of the Reserve Forces may well be of direct
benefit to their employers. On the other side of the coin, if such

Palmer of Childs Hill (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, from these Benches
we wish to associate ourselves with the tributes to our Armed Forces.
The problem with this debate is that it is rolled up with a Statement
from the other House. If we had had the Statement and a debate
on it, we would have been able to concentrate on the GOCO arrangements,
but we have a Bill with three definite parts, and I am delighted to see
that both my noble friend the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Rosser,
have covered the whole Bill, not just the most contentious part of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:56:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000123">My
noble friend said that procurement was not good enough. In fact, I am
afraid that procurement in the Ministry of Defence is not fit for
purpose. There is a failure in the procurement process. The noble Lord,
Lord Rosser, said that it should be brought to a speedy conclusion.
Well, the Labour Government ignored it for 13 years, and they
ignored it because it was a problem. It still is a problem. It was a
problem then and it is a problem now. The coalition Government
attempted to tackle it with innovative solutions that have not in fact
worked out. Attempts were made to construct a system that worked, and
we have concluded that the main thrust of that system will not
work.</hs_para>

Bernard Gray told us that, as director, he would solve the problem. I
wonder whether the House is assured of the future when the Minister
talks about continuity by having Mr Bernard Gray as the chief
accounting official and chief executive of the DE&amp;S-plus. Forgive
me, but this is the man who told us that he would sort it all out and
get it right. I just wonder, with due deference, whether we would not
do better to have a completely fresh look at this and let Mr Bernard
Gray reorganise something else. I hope that our Government will look at
that again, because I certainly do not think that that would instil a
feeling of confidence in the DE&amp;S-plus system so ably enumerated by
the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:58:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000125">The
problem in this area of the MoD is dealing with the major contractors.
Our staff in the MoD are being outclassed by the major contractors, and
by their lawyers, engineers and the like. My noble friend has indicated
the efforts that will be made to bring our team up to a better
standard, but the history of this has not been good. The other problem
is making the wrong decisions about what is required, which was the
problem for the 13 years of the previous Government and, sadly, to some
degree the problem for this coalition
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:58:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000126">The
noble Lord, Lord Rosser, rightly spoke about costs to the bidders.
Judging by the numerous pages of its bid, Bechtel clearly spent a lot
of time on it, as did the other two unsuccessful bidders. I understand
from the Minister’s comments that they will be involved in some
way in the new DE&amp;S-plus, but there must be some worries about
that. The noble Lord talked about Part 1 not remaining in the Bill, but
my plea is that it should stay in the Bill, with the proviso that we
are not implementing part of the provisions that were made available on
the GOCO arrangements in the Bill. 
<?notus-xml column=737?>When the Minister replies, I hope that he will explain what provisions
there are to make sure that this will not go through on the nod at some

shall concentrate in the rest of my comments on the most unexciting
part of the Bill—Part 2, on single-source contracts—but
we need to ensure that the Bill does not produce unintended
consequences for the UK’s attractiveness as a place
to invest. The Bill appears to allow the MoD to challenge the price of
a contract at any point up to two years after the end of the contract.
It will reduce predictability over contract price, with possible
adverse consequences for boardroom confidence to invest, and the
international perception of the UK as a good place to do business. Is
the unintended end point of the proposed reform to be that suppliers
refer their own contracts to the Single Source Regulations Office at
the start of the contract to gain greater confidence over the price and
the profit? At the moment, the whole contract can be changed at any
point up to two
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:01:04"></hs_TimeCode> after it
has

Bill states that the SSRO may make provisions that limit the number of
times and the period after a contract ends when the MoD may challenge
the price. It may also specify the grounds for a challenge. This is a
first step, but the industry will need to have greater confidence in a
firmer commitment. As we debate the Bill during its passage through the
House, we need in this section a provision that the contractor should
not be able to increase its price, and that the MoD should not be able
to decrease the price: they will make a contract and, provided the
product is up to standard, that is what it should
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:01:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:01:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000129">On
the universal application of the regulations in Part 2, which allows
the Secretary of State to exempt any contract from the new regulations,
there are times when exemptions will be necessary, but defining the
criteria for awarding exemptions would improve certainty for
suppliers—and they will need that certainty. The possible
exemption of contracts placed with overseas suppliers may place the UK
suppliers at a competitive disadvantage globally. The stringent
compliance and monitoring regime will place an additional cost burden
on UK suppliers and their supply chains. Will the Minister address the
issue of the possible creation of complex contracting arrangements, in
which contracts are placed offshore in order to avoid the compliance
and monitoring
regime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:02:53"></hs_TimeCode>? The MoD
agrees that there will be circumstances in which an exemption will be

impartiality, the Bill appears to allow the customer—the
MoD—a significant degree of control over the regulator, the
SSRO. The Secretary of State appoints the chairman and board and has a
broad power to repeal the regulations and even to abolish the SSRO.
Lack of industry confidence in the SSRO as an independent arbiter
between the MoD and the industry is a risk. The industry would like to
see further steps taken to bolster the independence of the SSRO, as it
will fund 50% of the costs of that organisation and yet has no control

turn briefly to the question of reserves, in the hope that my noble
friends Lady Garden and Lady Doocey will take it up in more detail. I
will talk about the deployment and appeals processes, and what the Bill
will do. Its provisions will place a greater burden on the employers of
reservists by extending the circumstances in which reservists may be
deployed. This will clearly have a business impact, particularly on
SMEs employing reservists with unique skill sets. It is unclear to
me—and it is not laid out in the Bill—how SMEs will be
helped to replace such specifically talented employees.</hs_para>

expand its cyber reserve. This may transfer expertise from the private
sector to the public sector, as opposed to expanding overall expertise.
Greater clarity is required on what steps will be taken to support the
employers of reservists in these circumstances. The Ministry of
Defence’s position appears to be what is set out in Section 78
of the Reserve Forces Act 1996, which allows the Secretary of State to
enable a person liable to be called up to apply for a deferral or
exemption. Again, when we deal in detail with the question of the
reserves, we will need to make sure that employers feel confident that
this is something that they can live with and that will not harm their
businesses.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_10_PT_1/436B6E28401C20AAE1543DFEA9016B555F9ACCF3" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 December 2013">Tuesday,

Levene of Portsoken (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this
opportunity to comment on the progress of defence reform in the
Ministry of Defence. When the former defence Secretary, Dr Liam Fox,
took office, he asked me to chair a steering group to monitor the
progress of that reform. Your Lordships may recall that at the time a
very large shortfall had been revealed in the funding of the forward
programme of the MoD, and so drastic action had to be taken. That group
produced a report, which was published in June 2011, containing a large
number of recommendations, several of which required substantial change
in the working practices of both the department and the military. After
the report was published and the present defence Secretary, Philip
Hammond, took office, he asked me to continue to monitor progress on
those recommendations. The first such report was published in December
2012 and I undertook to produce a further update before the end of this
year.</hs_para>

Lordships will be able to see from that second annual report, which was
published last month, the detail of what had been concluded, which was
that further significant progress had been made on putting into effect
the earlier recommendations. These changes, which were welcomed within
the department at all levels, both military and civilian, have become
the norm for behaviour in the department and, in my opinion, are being
carried out with real enthusiasm.

procurement, however, is not an industrial operation. When procurement

implications of a procurement decision, and the need to take into

bidder from the private sector that they will be just that, and

experienced in that domain. I can reference numerous instances where
both civil servants and military officers have transferred into the

commercial experience. However, in order to acquire this, I do not

pleased to follow the noble Lord, Lord Levene, in this debate. I think
your Lordships will recognise that nobody in the country can speak with
more authority on the subjects that are part of the Bill than the noble
Lord. He has had quite exceptional experience in this field, having
headed up the procurement executive and having been recalled by
successive Secretaries of State to overhaul and review the programme of
reform for the Ministry of Defence. I particularly echo 
<?notus-xml column=741?>one point that he made very forcibly. It has been a feature of opening
speeches from the Front Benches to pay tribute to our Armed Forces. I
readily endorse that of course but also pay tribute to the civilian
members in the MoD who back them up. I exempt the current Secretary of
State and Defence Ministers from this, but there is a tendency in other

considerable concern whether it will be possible to reach the numbers

time with drill nights, a few training weekends and a few fortnight
camps but am all too conscious of the different demands that are now
made of people serving in the reserves. I used to spend a lot of my
time as Secretary of State going round an organisation called
TAVRA—the Territorial, Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve

of course I was trying to sell an entirely different sort of menu from

been very impressed by the effort that the Army has put into doing
that, the way it has thought of things laterally and what has been
done. That reduction calls for an Army in 2020 of 82,500 regulars. It
is quite clear that the money to pay for more than those numbers will
not be there post-2016 so things have to be done. It is quite right

them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000170">Any talk
of reversing this reduction and restructuring the Army is extremely
foolhardy. For example, with the 8,500 men made redundant over the past
15 months, it would take about 15 years to grow those numbers again.
Once you change the course of something like the Army, you cannot
change it back again quickly. We must proceed with the next tranche of
redundancies—I think it is about 1,500 but do not
know—because we have to keep the course and momentum going.
Recruiting of reservists is, strangely, a different issue. The Army
apparently always knew that it would take five to six years to recruit
up to the numbers required, so there is not a direct link to regular
numbers by time. We need to be aware of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000171">What is
clear is that the removal of the serving soldiers from the recruiting

There are real problems in recruiting, to which I am sure the
Government and the Secretary of State will apply themselves. We need to
get this right, even allowing for the time-lag to do it. There are also
problems with SMEs, for example, in allowing people to join. That has

we need to put down a marker that we cannot allow SDSR 2015 to be the

the general election, to knock off track such complex plans as, for
example, Army 2020—just to pick on the Army one. It could do

reputation for poor management of equipment programmes, in which delays
and overspends are not infrequent. The MoD is not alone among
departments where budgets overrun initial estimates of time and cost
but it does have to take into account factors which may not be present
in other parts of government. For instance, the
equipment 
<?notus-xml column=746?>that our Armed Forces need is at the cutting edge of technology. This

complex enough without another factor outside the control of the MoD,

not first and foremost military. I concur with the noble Lord, Lord
Levene, and my noble friend Lord King that those who serve
in the MoD—military and civilian—are not only committed
to public service but have a wealth of experience, expertise and
knowledge which deserves to be given credit. There will be service men
and women with first-hand experience of what does and does not work in
conflict zones, working alongside military analysts, strategists and
engineers. They may even be the same people. Why is it, then, that
Governments have a tendency to look first to the private sector for

ensure that at least some of the business, financial, project
management and HR skills might be met from within existing staff? After
all, I remind your Lordships that it was highly paid private sector
skills, brought in to address the undoubted problems of procurement,
which led to a GOCO solution. There were reservations about the
implication of such outsourcing, as noble Lords have already set
out—and, as we now know, the model held little appeal for
industry and has been put on hold. But neither GOCO nor DE&amp;S-plus
is proof against decisions taken at ministerial level for the broader
good of the country. It is unreasonable to chastise the MoD when
equipment is commissioned or adapted for non-operational reasons and to
lay blame for mismanagement solely at its door.</hs_parafo>

the reserves. Two weeks ago this Chamber was filled with cadets in
uniform from all around the UK who, along with veterans, were debating
the legacy of the First World War. Their debating skills were immensely
impressive; speaking thoughtfully and clearly, and keeping to time,
they were a credit to your Lordships’ House. The contributions
from the veterans were moving in demonstrating their personal struggles
and achievements. We also heard of the inspiring work of military
charities and volunteers. It was equally impressive in conversation to
hear of these young people’s commitment to the Armed Forces,
whether they were intending to join up or not. Among
them are the service men and women, and the
reserves, of the future. These are the people who can demonstrate 
<?notus-xml column=747?>to employers that they have personal and
professional skills which are enhanced by military service, and which
can be of immense benefit in civilian life,

Navy and the Royal Air Force face changes to their Reserve Forces but
the main focus of the Bill is the effect on the Army, where, as we have
heard, the reduction in the Regular Army from 102,000 to 82,000 is set
to be balanced by an increase in the Army Reserve from 19,000 to
30,000. In managing this increase, a civilian contract company can do
only so much. For these numbers to be achieved, champions are needed
from within the services. Ex-regulars should be actively encouraged to
engage. Cadets and veterans provide great role models for those
considering joining the reserves. Their own enthusiasm encourages
others to meet the challenges of service to their country. What support
is being given to ensure that career advice and guidance sets out the
very wide range of opportunities within regulars and reserves? I
recognise there are sensitivities in this that must be observed with
regard to recruitment, but we must face up to them if we are to achieve
this timely change.</hs_para>

commitments increase to 40 days a year, so they will be paired with
regulars for training and deployment purposes. This must be managed and

little convincing of the benefits that those with military training can

leadership. For large employers and, even more importantly, for small
and medium-sized enterprises, it is important that the Government make
clear the support on offer to ensure that business needs continue to be

Stirrup (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, as other noble Lords have
remarked, the uncertainty surrounding the Government’s
intentions for defence acquisition and support have made it rather
difficult to prepare for this debate. The first part
of the Bill is designed to pave the way for a government-owned,
contractor-operated solution and, as we have heard, that is no longer
in prospect, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, there
will be substantial changes to the way in which defence equipment is
procured and supported, and it is important that we take the
opportunity to reflect on the challenges involved, so my remarks will
focus on this part of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:43:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000186">Over
the past two decades we have seen major reviews and reforms of defence
procurement every four or five years on average. Each one has aimed to
resolve serious problems and each has achieved some improvement, but
each has failed to address the central issue of cost and time overruns.
Before proceeding with the latest of these reorganisations, it is
perhaps worth asking why the problem has proved so
intractable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:44:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000187">Some
years ago, a major management consultancy firm conducted an independent
assessment of defence procurement in nations with substantial armed
forces. It concluded that the UK’s performance in this area was
about average—not that it was good, but because the
problems of time and cost overruns were fairly common across comparator
nations. We should not be surprised by this. Some people might have the
impression that the United States does better than we do, but the facts
do not bear out that contention. The track record of complex projects,
such as the F22 fighter, the F35 Lightning 2 Joint Strike Fighter, and
the ill starred future combat system for the US Army, is
unenviable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000188">One
of our most successful acquisitions, in terms of cost and time, was the
C17 transport aircraft, which has proved such a godsend in recent
operations. We bought it, unmodified, off the shelf once it had been
designed, developed and proved in service. It is worth noting that the
C17’s development programme was so troubled that the United
States Air Force would have cancelled it had there been any
alternative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000189">These
problems are not confined to defence. The London Olympics were rightly
hailed as a great success story, but the final cost of the Games will
be somewhere between four and 10 times the original
estimate, depending on which figures one uses—and I probably
need only mention the name “HS2”.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=749?><hs_para UID="13121057000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000190">That
is a description of the water, but, of course, the problem is how to
avoid drowning in it. With this in mind, it is important to recognise
that, in the case of defence acquisition, failure is not, unusually, an
orphan, but has many parents. The first is the nature of the
defence business itself. The efficacy and true value of defence
equipment can be assessed accurately only once it has been
employed tactically on operations, usually in competition with enemy
systems and tactics. This problem becomes even more complex
when we consider that the equipment being developed today will be
tested in combat not tomorrow, but 10, 20 or even 30 years in the
future. Judging the likely competition that far ahead, and
thus the capabilities required, is no easy
task.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000191">The task
is even more difficult when one considers the rate of change of some of
the technologies involved. A great deal of military capability today
relies on extensive computing power and information management systems.
Our main attack aircraft, the Tornado, came into service some 30 years
ago. Noble Lords may recall that in the early 1980s, the cutting-edge
technocrats among us were playing around with the Commodore 64
computer, with its massive 64 kilobytes of memory, and not with
iPads.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000192">The
second source of difficulty in defence acquisition is the wider
political and industrial picture. If we bought everything off the
shelf, as we did with the C17, we would have much greater
predictability in our defence programme, but we would have no
significant defence industry. Employment and order-book pressures may
have no bearing on short-term military considerations, but they
undoubtedly complicate the procurement of military
capability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000193">The
third problem is the annuality of the defence budget and the way this
has been handled. In-year cost pressures have to be dealt with in-year,
and the traditional way of approaching this has been to delay projects.
This saves money in the short term but, of course, drives up the
whole-life cost of the project considerably. The MoD’s
institution of a contingency fund within the budget to help deal with
such pressures is a sensible step, but the danger is that this will
lead to persistent underspends, and the loss of funds
back to the Treasury. A more sensible approach would surely be
a long-term budget that had to be balanced over a period but not in
each individual
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000194">The
final problem I will touch on is the ability of defence acquisition
personnel to negotiate and contract effectively with defence companies.
I do not want to imply any criticism of the staff within defence
equipment procurement and support. There seems to be a growing sense in
the public sector that the way to improve the performance of personnel
is to denigrate them. I do not consider this a wise policy, and I agree
with the words of the noble Lord, Lord Levene of Portsoken, in this
regard. However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that in some
cases we are putting the wrong kind of people up to deal with defence
companies. They find themselves overmatched, not by the intrinsic worth
of their industry counterparts, but by their training and experience.
The numbers may be small, but the malign effects can be very
large.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000195">This
is not, in most cases, the fault of the people involved. It is the
fault of the organisation that is exposing them in such a way. Defence
equipment and 
<?notus-xml column=750?>support need negotiators and lawyers who can match those in industry,
but to get them they will have to pay the going rate, which has not
been possible under the present system. We certainly need to fix this,
and I welcome the moves that the Minister has announced. However, I
cannot believe that the GOCO route, which clearly remains an
aspiration, is the only—or even the best—long-term way of
going about this. Nor do I think that any solution will be a magic
bullet, and I fear that there has been some sense of that in
this afternoon’s debate. Staff skills levels and experience are
a problem but, as I have tried to explain, there are many other
challenges. The fundamental difficulty, to my mind, is how to combine
cutting-edge technology with financial predictability.</hs_para>

have suggested that so-called “requirement creep” is the
issue, and that if we define the requirement and leave it alone, we
will solve many problems. This is probably true, but I doubt that it
would represent value for money for the taxpayer in the long run.
Equipment that from conception to out-of-service will be around for
upwards of half a century must be kept up to date. The one thing worse
than overspending on defence equipment is surely spending less on
equipment that cannot do the job required of
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000197">I am
reminded of the US defence company which, some years ago, tried to
persuade us that it was better value to buy a fighter with 75% of the
required capability but only 60% of the predicted cost. This
demonstrated a total misunderstanding of the nature of value. The
proposition might look attractive, but, when one understands that
having 75% of the capability would mean losing 100% of the air combats,
the picture changes. It is hard to think of a proposition that could
offer worse value for
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is that changing the requirement does drive up the cost. To some
extent, this is unavoidable, but I have long believed that we need a
multitrack approach to our procurement processes. We can have the slow,
majestic, leviathan process when it comes to large platforms. After
all, the fundamental elements of an airframe or a ship do not change
much or rapidly over its lifetime. However, we need capability spaces
within those platforms. In these, we need to be able to plug in and
play sensors, information systems and weapons to deliver cutting-edge
capability. The acquisition of such systems needs to be much faster and
more agile than the acquisition of the platforms themselves. This is
one way in which we can square the circle of performance and financial
predictability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

other possible approaches. What is important is that this latest
attempt to reform defence acquisition and support should address the
full range of underlying problems, not just one of them. If it does
not, it will follow in the path of its many predecessor reforms; it
will bring some improvement but make no substantial difference to the
underlying issue—and in four or five years, we will be here
again, discussing yet another set of proposals for
reform.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_10_PT_1/2C282EBAB84641F051FB274B88F973D6D4ED090F" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 December 2013">Tuesday,

seem to have suffered in the past three years from myopia in their full
concentration on GOCO as the answer. Even when the number of bidders
dropped 
<?notus-xml column=752?>from three to two and then to one, the Government did not change their

move on to Part 2. It is generally agreed that the single-source

Single Source Regulations Office as a non-departmental public body with
effect from October 2014. Schedule 4 provides for the appointment of
the membership of the SSRO by the Secretary of State. Some
would question whether that guarantees the underlying independence.

on Part 1—the procurement aspects of the Bill. I could almost
second the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Levene, on this subject. Let
us be quite clear what has happened here. The GOCO horse, carrying the
colours of Bernard Gray, has been pulled up. There was, frankly, little
backing for this nag within either the civilian or the service sides of
the MoD. Unfortunately, the Secretary of State decided to place
his bet on GOCO and, frankly, faces some embarrassment today. I refer
the House—this was mentioned earlier—to the ministerial
Statement of 17 July 2012, which
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13121057000338" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000338">In the

The noble Lord, Lord Levene, and others referred to the
contractorisation of the dockyards. I was involved in that process, and
supported it, when I was a Minister at the MoD. However, no other
country and, to my knowledge, no other major plc, has effectively
thrown in the towel and said, “We cannot handle our buying
ourselves”. Huge amounts of civilian, ministerial and service
time and at least £12 million have been wasted on this GOCO
option. However, in my judgment it is the Treasury that
historically carries the prime responsibility for this procurement
fiasco through its bone-headed, penny-wise, pound-foolish approach,
which over the years has prevented DE&amp;S recruiting top talent from
the private sector. It has effectively been emasculated and has proved
no match for hard-nosed defence contractors, as was referred to
earlier. We were told this afternoon that at present DE&amp;S has
800—I repeat, 800—vacancies. In recent years, it has had
to employ very expensive consultants. Perhaps when my noble friend sums
up he can indicate just how much the MoD is spending on
consultants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:04:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Treasury, under pressure, has now got real and has given certain new
freedoms to DE&amp;S-plus. I am sure that we all wish it well.
Excellent personnel are already there, as a number of noble Lords
mentioned 
<?notus-xml column=754?>—in fact, all noble Lords who have spoken
referred to that aspect. It will be strengthened and augmented, we
hope, by top-drawer recruitment from the private sector. However, I
must ask, first, whether we are giving DE&amp;S-plus a chance. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Dean, said, is it sensible or fair to retain the
GOCO option in the Bill, almost as a sword of Damocles hanging over the
future DE&amp;S-plus? Is it going to encourage top personnel to give up
their careers in the private sector and join this organisation if some
future Government in a few years’ time are going to go back to
the GOCO option and argument? Secondly, does it really make sense for
the morale of this new organisation to have its new chief executive in
Bernard Gray, the person who drove the alternative option that clearly
has failed and

noble friend three or four specific questions to which I should like
him to refer in his wind-up speech, or, if not, perhaps he can write to
me. First, can we have more details of the freedoms that the Treasury
is going to give DE&amp;S-plus? Will there be an additional block of
money available to it or is there going to be some sort of limitation
on the numbers employed? Is there going to be any maximum salary level?
Secondly, what is the duration, if any, of Bernard Gray’s
contract with the new organisation? What is his salary going to be?
Will it increase or, bluntly, will it be a reward for failure? Thirdly,
is the new chairman being brought in going to be an executive or
non-executive chairman? Finally, on the question of the GOCO
competition, what is the position regarding compensation for the
remaining Bechtel-led consortium? Is there any likelihood of
significant compensation having to be paid

who have been involved with defence issues over the past 50 years and
more will recall that this is but the latest of numerous attempts to
solve difficulties in defence procurement. When the Ministry of Supply
was abolished in 1959, defence procurement passed initially to the
three single-service ministries until the Ministry of Defence took
overall responsibility in 1964. Before that there had been some serious
overspends on
equipment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:09:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Gibb-Zuckerman report recommended a common, improved process of
milestones past which every major project would have to proceed. By the
mid-1960s further spectacular cost overruns triggered the establishment
of a development cost steering group, chaired by a Mr Downey. The group
made further changes but few of these efforts were any more successful.
At a time when the Warsaw Pact seemed at its most dangerous, the MoD
was inevitably ambitious in its requirements. The three
services, the research establishments and industry erroneously felt
that technical 
<?notus-xml column=755?>and integration problems, only revealed during full
development, could be resolved—maybe so, but at much increased
cost and timescales; and occasionally never, leading to cancellation of
a major programme after much time, effort and money had been spent.

the two sides. He also invited Peter Levene, now the noble Lord, Lord
Levene, from private industry to fill a new appointment of Chief of
Defence Procurement in 1985, as we know. Improvements came: cost-plus
was out, competition was in, but initial better outcomes were not
sustained after about 1991. More recently, we have seen and forgotten
the smart procurement of 1998, which collapsed due to inadequate
funding of defence, and was later renamed smart acquisition, but I fear

overambitious, rushed and disruptive reorganisation of procurement and
logistics responsibilities and downsizing caused distortion, much
frustration and dismay among staff involved. Mr Bernard Gray’s
2009 study of this generic problem recommended that 10-year rolling
defence budgets and 20-year equipment budgets published to Parliament
should be adopted—no signs of that. The nearest—and
minimalist—has been the Prime Minister’s assurance that
the equipment budget would increase by 1% after the next election. This
is the basis for the affordable equipment programme announced last year
for the period 2015-16 through to 2020-21 but, as the NAO has
commented, this does not and will not offer a definitive view of the
affordability of the equipment plan, as more time and experience will
be required to assess its worth. Moreover, it is far from clear whether
this raise for equipment is additional to the whole defence budget or
will have to be offset by reductions elsewhere in MoD spending, as the
Chancellor proposed only last week. Of course, there is a general
election in 18 months so nothing can be definitive.</hs_para>

it is right to try to do better, but sometimes the MoD seems to be the
whipping boy of Whitehall over poor procurement, and cost and timescale
overruns. Other departments with much less challenging requirements
seem to suffer major cost and timescale overruns without being subject
to such excoriating criticism—for example, the NHS’s
repeated nationwide computing failures; the National Offender
Management Service’s information system 400% over budget; the
tenfold rise in the cost of the Scottish Parliament; Transport for
London modernisation, with billions of pounds underestimated; the
numerous PFI schemes that have left the taxpayer billions of pounds

successful Olympics bid, which has already been mentioned, started off

<?notus-xml column=756?>breath—Governments of the day, with opposition support, are

further and often overlooked issue is the political, and sometimes

to concerns expressed in your Lordships’ House and elsewhere
about the legal erosion of our national fighting power, I fear that
this may extend further than the battlefield and into the field of
procurement and technical support. When I was flying Vulcan and Victor
bombers, only the two pilots had ejection seats. The rear crew members
had to rely on parachutes if their aircraft had to be abandoned in
flight. Fitting ejection seats for all at the design stage was deemed
technically very complex, with unacceptable time delays into service,
and costly. At various times, following tragic fatal air accidents of
these aircraft on training flights, the possibility of fitting ejection
seats for all crew members was re-examined. Once again, cost,
complexity and the loss of airframes from the front line while
modifications were installed were deemed excessive in any attempt to
reduce the relatively low-frequency risk of a similar future air
disaster. Indeed, I am not aware that any claims by relatives were made
in those days—probably Crown immunity then would have ruled them
out—although the additional life insurance premium to cover
flying risk was largely met by the
ministry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000227">Today,
when coroners and courts are keen to investigate the background to
individual service deaths, there is a growing tendency to question why
particular modifications or kit which could have been made available

available. Such an approach cannot take full and proper informed
account of the complexities of the design or later modification, the
downtime to carry out the necessary work and the remaining in-service
life of the aircraft fleet or other equipment involved. Additional
cost, too, of course arises. Is it better to pay that much to 
<?notus-xml column=757?>ameliorate one risk of catastrophe over, say, a few
years of remaining in-service life, and not be able

turn to the reserves. There is nothing in the Bill that would expedite
the call-out of individual or small cadres of reservists, whose
earliest possible availability is essential to the preparation and
mounting of an intended operation. With greater reliance on ready
Reserve Forces, the current statutory requirement that ministerial
approval has to be obtained before the call-out of any
reservists needs to be reviewed. Delegated ministerial authority to
service chiefs for small and key critical reserve elements would ensure
that those individuals who are already at high readiness would be
immediately on task when required. What assurance can the Minister give
that such delegation is covered by current legislation, and
perhaps by Clause 45, or should it be a matter for amendment?
With a policy to rely more than ever on the employment of reservists
alongside regular forces, their early availability is a key requirement
and must be assured in all
circumstances.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_10_PT_1/88C10507B7F7EF6258C144230D75D5C740F0574B" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 December 2013">Tuesday,

Cohen of Pimlico (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak on Part 1
of the Bill since that is where my experience of the MoD rests. I also
speak as what seems to be a highly unpopular advocate of continuing to
seek out a GOCO option. My qualifications for speaking on procurement
rest on part-time involvement with the MoD in general and with the then
newly formed Defence Logistics Organisation, in particular from 1998 to
2005. I was drafted in by the then Secretary of State for Defence,
George Robertson, now my noble friend Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, to
be one of the group of 12 wise men and only three wise women to
critique the emerging conclusions of the strategic defence review. I
went straight for the logistics and procurement end, using my
experience of advising Unipart for many years, and having worked with
Alan Rudge at BT and Richard Lapthorne of BAE. When we concluded our
review, it was decided to put together the logistics for all three
services under one newly formed organisation, the Defence Logistics
Organisation, but not to try to put the new organisation together with
the major procurement organisation on the grounds that it was a bridge
too far<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:22:04"></hs_TimeCode>. At all
events, I ended up the following year as the only non-executive
director of the Defence Logistics Organisation under General Sir Sam
Cowan. I stayed in the same role at the request of his
successor, Air Chief Marshal  
<?notus-xml column=758?>Sir Malcolm Pledger, and refused to stay with his
successor only because I felt, after six years, that I had shot my
bolt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:22:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<I>Better Defence Acquisition</I>, of June 2013—which, after
all, is terribly recent—with real pleasure. The writing is clear
and elegant, and it makes an absolutely uncompromising analysis of the
root causes of underperformance in defence acquisition. I know that it
had the admirable report by Bernard Gray in 2009, and the equally
admirable report published in June 2011 from the committee chaired by
the noble Lord, Lord Levene, to draw on. Those reports brought back
painful memories of what I and my fellow non-executive directors had
failed to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:23:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

failure identified was a not quite steady and overly ambitious
equipment programme. Back in 1999, I encountered a forward programme
which contained, at the end of it all, all sorts of projects and kits
labelled “at risk”. I asked what “at risk”
meant, and found out that they turned out to be projects for which
there was no money and would not be any in the foreseeable future.
Feeling rather like the customer in the famous dead parrot sketch, I
pointed out that a project for which there were no funds was not at
risk: it was dead, it was an ex-project. All agreed courteously that I
was right, but the “at risk” list stayed on the books and
in the planning. Military personnel are, in the main, intelligent and
practical men, so I decided that they must know something that I did
not. Indeed, as it turned out, they know as they have known since
before Waterloo that if you have a favoured project and can keep it on
the books, you might get it in the end—usually because a war
comes along. Of course, the Treasury pays for war; the defence budget
gets us a standing army but it does not, on the whole pay for a
war.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121057000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000233">Worse,
you can go on spending a bit of cash on this project and committing
yourself to more so that, in the end, it becomes cheaper to go on than
to stop. I need hardly say that the energy and politics devoted to all
this took up a lot of valuable time. I know that the MoD and the
current Secretary of State, to whom I give great credit, have tried to
stamp out unrealistic budgeting, but the White Paper describes the
present position as a “balanced, if taut” MoD budget.
Experience suggests that “taut” is probably code for
there being at least two projects for which there are not enough funds,
but which are being held in there on the basis of
hope<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:25:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

identified by the White Paper is an unstable interface
between the requester and the deliverer. In three paragraphs, it says
concisely and very graciously that the MoD is a
terrible customer and cannot do anything without wanting
extras or wanting to do it differently half way through the contract.
Anyone who has done any contracting, even for home improvement, knows
that that costs money and causes delay. It is difficult to know how to
change
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:25:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000235">The
third root cause is that there are insufficient skills and management
freedom within DE&amp;S. That is indisputably true. There are many
excellent people in the MoD, but the project management stars needed
are in the private sector, being paid twice as much as anyone in the
MoD and, above all, being given freedom to do their jobs without
interference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:26:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

White Paper’s conclusions. That is why I am so disappointed that
the GOCO proposal has fallen. Indeed, I am prepared to put the White
Paper’s conclusions more bluntly. The causes of underperformance
are endemic and deeply rooted in MoD culture, which resists outside
reform, and has done since Waterloo. The MoD has real strengths. It is
manned by many excellent people, who feel that they know best. It has
gracefully seen off many an outsider. I am sorry to find myself on the
other side from my noble friend Lord Levene and the noble Lord, Lord
King, since one of them ran defence procurement and the other was
Secretary of State. However, radical reform involving giving cash and
authority to a GOCO is the only thing that will work. I urge this
Government, and I shall be urging a Labour Government when we have one
again—soon I hope—to look again at the analysis in this
White
Paper<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:27:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000237">Since
I have already probably blown my chances of being appointed Chief of
the Defence Staff, I shall go further and suggest that in continuing
our search for a GOCO we may have to go about our contracting in a
different way. To paraphrase Lady Bracknell, to lose two out of three
of the essential private sector candidates suggests not carelessness,
but that contract conditions—drawn up by the MoD—may have
been too restrictive, and/or may have allowed for unfeasible and
expensive interference by the department, or may have been unrealistic
in their cost expectations. Indeed I remember that one of the bidders
dropped out on the basis that they could not make a living on the
contract. We might need to get an outside expert view on how the
contract is
drafted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:28:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000238" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000238">I
am reminded of a story—no doubt apocryphal—about a
meeting between Louis XIV, the Sun King, and a rebel peasant in the
Fronde uprising. Louis XIV condemned the peasant to death but the man
successfully pleaded for a year’s stay of execution on the
promise that his life would be spared if by then he had taught the
king’s horse to talk. His friends, and probably the horse,
inquired of him what had possessed him to make so rash a promise.
“Ah,” the peasant said, “In a year’s time,
the horse may be dead, or I may be dead, or the king may be dead, or
the horse may talk”. This of course is a parable about towing a
problem along. That is what we are doing if we attempt to solve these
deeply rooted problems within the same structure and with the same
people that have perpetuated them. It is not the right use of scarce
public resources now; nor is it the best future for the armed
services.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_10_PT_1/BF33BE9A7F2DEF9ED2FC09CF5739AB151E587D26" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 December 2013">Tuesday,

Doocey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak to Part 3 of the Bill
to highlight concerns about forces welfare, and in particular the
welfare of those serving in the Army Reserve. The Bill includes
important provisions to protect the employment rights of reservists,
which is clearly right. However, we must consider how we can improve
reservists’ welfare in other ways. After all, the real task is
to attract large numbers of new recruits if the targets for reservists
are to be met. In doing so, we should learn lessons from important
welfare issues affecting the whole service.</hs_para>

most important of those welfare issues, not only for personnel
currently serving but for those leaving the service. The Army Families
Federation reports that the poor standard of maintenance and repair is
the biggest problem for Army families. Although the current standard of
accommodation is undoubtedly the result of decades of underinvestment,
the fact that it persists to such a degree is, I am told, largely due
to the way that prime contractors are incentivised. Service families
whom I have met describe the situation as woeful, and maintenance and
repair problems are the subject of endless
complaints.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000242" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0001.htm#13121057000242">Last
year, the Defence Select Committee investigated accommodation provided
by the MoD. It reported that less than 50% of the single living
accommodation units in the UK are in the top two grades of quality,
even though the target set by the MoD is 90%. Indeed, more than a third
of this accommodation is in the bottom grade. I welcome the substantial
investment in accommodation for service families in recent years, which
has seen more than 90% of the homes for service families brought into
the top two quality grades, but the same approach is needed for the
rest of the accommodation
estate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000243">Forces

which shows that the problem of ex-forces personnel sleeping rough, in
hostels or in supported accommodation, is widespread. It reports that
half the day centres in England say that they work with ex-service

patterns of rough sleeping. We must acknowledge our responsibilities to

Bill before us tackles job security for our reserves, opens the door to
longer periods of deployment and promises to improve the incentives and
compensation arrangements for employers. These are very good steps
forward. However, if we are to attract the broad range of skills and
people to greatly expand our Reserve Forces, we must have an answer for
them on welfare issues such as their healthcare, their mental state and
their family-life balance. Ensuring decent accommodation which is
properly and regularly maintained for our regular forces should be seen
as part and parcel of this

anything can be said about the Government and
defence—quite modestly and unexceptionably, because the points
are so blatantly obvious—it is that this Government do not care
much about defence and that their judgment in defence matters
is pretty poor. In the course of three and a half years, they are well
on their way to running the Army down from 100,000 to 82,000, they have
abolished our carrier strike capability, they have abolished entirely
our long-range maritime surveillance capability and they have reduced
our capability in helicopters, in naval escorts—

are told all the time that that is due to a shortage of funds, but in
fact the Government had a surplus in 2011-12, which was then
entirely lost to the Treasury. There was then an extraordinary surplus

in April 2013, some of which has been lost to the Treasury. The
Government complacently say that a lot of it has been rolled over, but
even this Government must realise that if you do that, at the very best
you are delivering equipment a year later than it should have been
delivered, and because of the time value of money, your money does not
buy as much as it otherwise would do. That has been a disaster for

they are introducing an important Bill at Second Reading, make a
Statement a couple of hours beforehand saying that the first part of
the Bill is inoperable and that they do not intend to take it forward

keeping both their feet on both sides of the fence. They are not taking

the event that, a few years down the line, the
Government switch to the GOCO course and Bechtel or Boeing or Serco or
someone comes in and puts its own staff in these senior decision-making

course, the Government have run into a lot of problems with industry
over the GOCO proposal, mostly about conflicts of interest and
treatment of intellectual property. However, there are two much more
fundamental reasons why the whole idea was completely misconceived from
the beginning. The first is that defence procurement is and ought to be
and ought always to be core business for the Ministry of Defence. It is
exactly like recruitment or training; what we are talking about is
producing the essential inputs into defence capability. The MoD must be
in charge of that and must understand
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000252">What is
more, if the Government give up that capability and that knowledge,
they will not get it back. There are all sorts of people now in the MoD

<?notus-xml column=762?>and DE&amp;S—I know them well—who can
negotiate a contract with a GOCO partner if you want one. But if you
actually sign that contract and give up your role running defence
procurement to some private sector partner, in five years’ time
or whenever you renew the contract, you will be at a very considerable
disadvantage, and in 10 years’ time you will not be able at all
to have an intelligent or effective negotiation or to monitor
intelligently what is going on. It is very important that this should
remain a core function and a core expertise of any Ministry of Defence
worthy of the name. That is true in this country and elsewhere; it
always has been and I believe it always should
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000253" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000253">The second
fundamental reason why the GOCO proposal was misconceived and a mistake
in principle from the beginning is that an essential part of defence
procurement is flexibility. The enemy has a vote in this. You have to
take the enemy into account. The enemy may change; the enemy may change
his tactics and you have to change your procurement policy
accordingly.</hs_para>

procurement Minister, I held a meeting in my office every month on
counter-IED policy. I had the experts there from DE&amp;S and of course
our own capability people and people from PJHQ, and the absolute
experts from the various research institutes that we have at Fort
Halstead and so forth. They are brilliant; I want to pay tribute to
them now. I am full of admiration, and always will be for the rest of
my life, for their expertise and dedication. They get no public
recognition at all for their role.</hs_para>

Americans there. I had negotiated an open-eyes agreement with my
American counterpart, Ash Carter, on counter-IED. We had an American
colonel and she always contributed very usefully to our meetings. In
those meetings we quite frequently decided then and there, that
afternoon, to change our procurement of some particular technology or
item of equipment and switch it to something else, usually in the UOR
programme but it sometimes involved adjusting a core programme as well.
You needed to do that because the enemy was changing and the
enemy’s tactics were changing, and we wanted to save lives and
win operations. Those are the fundamental obligations of any Defence
Minister, which must override any other
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000256">It
is quite wrong to give up that flexibility. You need flexibility for
other reasons. I made it a principle—I have no idea whether the
Government continue with it, but I hope that they do—that before
I authorised any major programme, I always investigated whether we
could do it in collaboration with an ally. If you do that, not only do
you share the research and development costs and the risks but you get
longer production runs, and the very considerable fixed overheads then
spread over a greater production run, which is highly desirable. I had
a lot of successes in that, particularly with the French, where we did
a lot of things. One example was in underwater programmes. I invited
them into the Mantis UAV programme. We did the new turret for the
Warrior and the Scout vehicle together. These were successful examples
of international collaboration requiring great flexibility.</hs_para>

Money is what motivates the private sector—quite rightly and
understandably so—and it knows perfectly well that the way in
which it makes the real money out of government is when the Government
change their mind, change their specification and want to do something

DE&amp;S. The DE&amp;S contains wonderful people of enormous ability
and enormous dedication, enthusiasm and commitment. When I was putting
together the Scout programme, I remember there being a big time
factor there. We succeeded in getting the whole process, which would
normally take about two years, done in about 13 weeks.
People were working through the night and through the weekends. They
are superb people. Of course, they do not have quite enough of certain
types of expertise—some in the financial area and some in the
project engineering area—and that must be remedied, as Kevin
O’Donoghue and I were trying to do. We did so often by
secondments from the private sector. You cannot bring in people to deal
with contracts of their own companies, of course, but you can put them
in other parts of the DE&amp;S and they will learn a lot about
government procurement and you will learn a lot from their particular
expertise during those
secondments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:42:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

something which I did not have the occasion to do but thought of doing
on several occasions. Where you have a particularly complicated and
difficult project, you could perhaps bring in a private sector partner
to be alongside you in the negotiations. I would have done
that on the future tanker programme, which had gone on for eight or
nine years when I took over. Luckily, the people concerned came to a
conclusion rather rapidly after I came on board and
avoided that particular fate. That is something that we should

all, I do not believe that the DE&amp;S needs a new corporate
structure. That creates barriers, inflexibilities and some of the
problems to which I have already referred. I totally agree with the
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup. He was quite right in what he
just said about the international position. Of course, we have had big
problems with cost and time overruns—you always have those in
defence procurement if you are at the cutting edge of technology. By
definition, nobody 
<?notus-xml column=764?>can predict exactly the time and costs involved in
solving technical problems at the cutting edge—at the coal face.
That is absolutely inevitable. If you look at how the French and the
Americans do it—those are the only comparisons really worth
making because other people are not normally at the cutting edge of
technology—you will see that the position is very similar there.
The Americans have far worse cost overruns. Their time overruns are not
quite so bad because they throw enormous amounts of money at something
when they run into a problem.</hs_para>

that is not a reason for complacency. There is enormous
scope for improving the DE&amp;S, and it should be steadily improved in
the way that I have described, but we should in no circumstances
destroy any of its enormous qualities. We should in no
circumstances throw over this particular institution lightly and set up
something else which we would live to

I want to ask some specific questions of the Minister. If he does not
have answers for me now, I ask him to write to me and place a copy of
the letter in the House. First, was it by accident or design that the
approximately £2 billion surplus was accumulated in the MoD in
the last financial year? Secondly, are the Government providing for or
expecting to make compensation to Bechtel for withdrawing the
competition in which it was engaged and on which it would have spent a
lot of money? Thirdly, what is the total cost of this GOCO exercise,
including any compensation to contractors if that arises? Fourthly,
what is the pay or total remuneration package for Bernard Gray in his
new role? Fifthly—the matter has been raised this afternoon but
nobody seems to have any clue to the answer—why was it that,
extraordinarily in this case, the normal processes for open, public
recruitment were overridden and a special deal was done with one
particular nominated

Tunnicliffe (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a very
interesting debate. One realised as one listened the extent of the
knowledge of, and involvement in, defence over many years represented
in the Chamber today. My credentials are somewhat modest. My noble
friend Lady Cohen set out hers, but did not mention the role she handed
on to me. I spent two very interesting years as a non-executive
director of DLO, the defence procurement agency, and was involved in
the merger that created
DE&amp;S.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000264">I
expected to be in the somewhat minority view, arguing for some respect
and admiration for the quality of the people in DE&amp;S, but I find
that I follow the noble Lords, Lord Levene, Lord King and Lord Lee, the
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, and my noble friend Lord Davies
in saying that these are good people doing a good job. As the noble
Baroness, Lady Garden, pointed out, it is tremendously complex—a
very big procurement job and one, as my noble friend Lord Davies said,
in a constantly changing field. They are much underrated and I would
certainly like to set down my name as one who admires them, as I admire
the Armed Forces in
general.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000265">There
has obviously been an ongoing challenge in defence procurement. We on
this side accepted that general challenge and much of the direction the

<?notus-xml column=765?>Government were going in. We were willing to see a
GOCO option if, through a process of competition, it could be refined
into something credible that would do substantially more than DE&amp;S
being developed in a favourable environment. However, that competition
went away. Only one bidder was left. Reluctantly, I welcome the
decision—someone has to welcome the Government at some
point—to abandon the competition and concentrate on DE&amp;S.
DE&amp;S has the fundamental talent, provided it is supplemented. The
noble Lord, Lord Levene, made the point that it would take a relatively
modest number of additional people in focused roles to rise to the
DE&amp;S-plus challenge and meet the objectives that we all have in
mind, and the needs of the taxpayer and front-line
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121057000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000266">We
have a little bit of a mix-up today, with a debate on a Statement and a
debate on a Bill. I have a few questions about the Statement. I will
repeat some of the questions put by my noble friend Lord Davies because
I informed the Minister about mine and expect him to answer them today.
First, does the new entity require any legislation? As far as I can
see, it does not. This can be done administratively within the present
law. There is mention in the Statement about the accounting
officer’s budget. Will that budget be merely for the operation
of DE&amp;S, or is this the procurement budget of £8 billion or
£10 billion, depending on how you look at it? That is very
important because if the accounting officer holds the budget he can, in
a sense, insist on that firmer line between the front-line commands and
the DE&amp;S providers. Could the Minister also set out in more detail
the new freedoms when it comes to pay? In other appointments over the
past months, there has been talk that no appointment should be made at
a rate that exceeds the Prime Minister’s salary. That will
clearly be too limiting in this case. Are the freedoms such that that
sort of arbitrary limit is not there?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121057000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000267">We also have the very
important issue of how appointments to these roles will be made. I
think that the Secretary of State referred in the Commons to something
like an accelerated system. We have spent a lot of time in this country
worrying about public appointments. We have a Commissioner for Public
Appointments, so at least some regard has to be taken for the work of
that commission and how the new appointment process may give us better,
faster results yet still meet the tests of fairness and opportunity
that the public appointments commission represents.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121057000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000268">To be very specific:
how was Bernard Gray appointed? The Government have to be responsible
for that appointment, but can we at least know how the decision was
made and what public appointments criteria were checked off before it
was made? We should know what Bernard Gray is to be paid because that
will illustrate whether the Government are serious about
breaking free from constraints in payments. It was perfectly
reasonable at the time of the appointment of the Governor of the Bank
of England that his salary and conditions were openly presented, and it
should happen now.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121057000269" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000269">Finally, in the
Statement, which I will come back to, there is the concept that we
might go for a GOCO at some time. Can the Minister offer some clarity
on that? Are we talking about it being before the next election,
immediately after it or further in the future?</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=766?><hs_para UID="13121057000270" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000270">Turning
to the Bill, first, I join with other noble Lords in asking the
Government most sincerely to withdraw Part 1. The intention of
legislation must be to deliver a tangible outcome. You have to have a
concept when you are working on creating it: what is it going to
deliver? The legislation to create the GOCO is quite
complicated—I will come to that—but at least there was
something there. We had a White Paper about it and there had been some
description and discussion of it. There was some background about the
tangible thing that we were debating. We will not now be debating
something that is going to happen in a near timescale. It will be a
debate in a vacuum. It will almost be a philosophy seminar, as we will
have to carry notions of “What if this?” and “What
if that?”, and of how it fits together.</hs_para>

the most undesirable effects on DE&amp;S because it will be like a
sword of Damocles. At the whim of a Minister, with no scrutiny from
this House or the House of Commons, the whole issue relating to defence
procurement can be transferred to a GOCO if we pass Part 1 of the Bill.
I implore the Government to withdraw Part 1 and to let us spend our
time concentrating on Parts 2 and 3. In the mean time, let us encourage
DE&amp;S to continue with its improvement programme, using its new
freedoms. If the new freedoms need any legislation, of course that can
be wound into it, but we should not have to contemplate or discuss a
theoretical concept of such magnitude that it will have no impact
within a near timescale.</hs_para>

will perhaps not listen to me and we will have to discuss the GOCO. As
the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, said, superficially it is not
a magic bullet. We will have to work through a lot of questions. There
are issues of conflicts of interest, the retention of sovereignty and
the protection and supply of intellectual property. How will Chinese
walls work within the various parts of the consortium that are also
parts of larger firms? How will the civil and criminal penalties work
in order to make these protections credible to the outside world? The
concept was that it might go for nine years and then end. What will be
done to require the GOCO company to protect skills, so that if those
things are taken back into the public sector, the skills base will be
retained?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121057000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000273">We
will need to look at the essence of why a GOCO is a good idea. When
talking about GOCOs, the Government are tangentially talking about risk
transfer; I believe that the Minister actually referred to it in the
remarks that he made in opening the debate. Among my credentials is
that I have been a client of Bechtel. I have to tell noble Lords that
Riley Bechtel has never transferred one iota of risk. He is brilliant
at running a firm that adds value—let us not get too upset about
that—but the only thing that Riley Bechtel puts at risk is the
size of his profit. He does not put Bechtel’s basic assets at
risk. There will be no risk transfer if the Government’s target
is someone like
Bechtel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:55:17"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
willing to be proved wrong on that, but if we must discuss Part 1 then
we will be testing the Government on risk
transfer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:55:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question of added value. Sometimes when the Government talk about this,
the added value seems to be solely about the ability to 
<?notus-xml column=767?>employ people. Suddenly, at a stroke, the Government seem to have solved
the problem of employing people by getting new freedoms. But discussing
the issue is very complicated without a tangible action in
front of
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:55:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Bill. Superficially, single-source contracting is going to be pretty
boring. However, anyone who has been involved in this area—not
just the military but any area where de facto single-sourcing comes
about—will know the value of getting this right. I will be
interested in probing this and perhaps trying to get the Government to
go somewhat further. At the moment the Bill seems to be written around
a price mechanism, which will be a cost, an overhead and a profit. The
mechanisms that are being brought forward to improve this are,
principally—I think that this was in the Minister’s
speech—transparency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:56:40"></hs_TimeCode>.
The objective is to improve the balance between value for money for the
taxpayer and reasonable profits for the supplier. We entirely accept
that; we are not against suppliers making profits, as suppliers that do
not do so do not continue to exist. There has to be that
balance.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121057000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-0002.htm#13121057000276">The
process is to have the force of law in many areas. This is good.
Indeed, the gains claimed for it are modest; they could be
significantly higher. However, there will be questions about what
transparency means and how confidentiality and IP are going to be
protected. There is a real issue about information that flows about
between groups, where one group is deemed to be a single-source
supplier while another is perhaps trading in the international civil
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:57:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

carefully at the SSRO, and particularly at its independence. Creating
independent bodies is a very difficult thing to do, as is actually
creating some way of being sure that government influence is not there
all the time. We will have to look at its independence, its balance and
the reward structure for its directors—and, more importantly, at
how we bring in the right talent. What is the appointment process going
to be? What will be the quality of the people? What will its powers
boil down to? I know that they are in the Bill, but they need to be
picked over. Is it effectively an available arbitrator?</hs_para>

In my experience, people who have not been involved have a very silly
idea about competition: they think that if you have real competition
leading to a contract award, somehow you have solved the problem.
Usually, 80% of the problem comes after the contract award. Things go
wrong. Circumstances happen and change things. I have dealt with
contracts for multiple hundreds of millions, and we have had so-called
competition at the beginning; sometimes you are pushed to get two
suppliers that are vaguely compliant in your bidding process, but you
have your competition. However, you are then locked into a
single-supplier situation. Can we think about how defence contracts
that run on with a single-supplier situation can be brought into this
area? What we need in this difficult
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:59:07"></hs_TimeCode> is more
innovation so that we can go for more cost savings and can incentivise

be changed. We accept it, but bringing up the total number of Reserve
Forces to 30,000 does not appear, initially at least, to be going well.
We need regular reports. We look forward to the amendment that the
Minister will be bringing forward in this area, but these reports have
to go quite a long way further. We need to know not just about gross
numbers but about where the skills are, how the training is going and
what reduction in planning assumptions will result if we fail to
recruit. What is the realistic capability of the Army if this

have put in place a more robust baseline from which to contract with a
GOCO partner. It would therefore be prudent to have Part 1 in place

much hope that the new DE&amp;S-plus organisation will be robust and
successful. We should not be afraid of the competition that potentially

leaving regular service can enjoy a number of incentives and benefits,
such as reduced Army Reserve commitment and training

represented the United Kingdom at the 20th Ministerial Council Meeting
of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) held
in Kiev on 5-6 December 2013, hosted by Ukrainian Foreign Minister

Ministerial Decisions in the Human Dimension, after two years without
agreement. The decision on Freedom of Thought, Conscience, Religion or
Belief is particularly welcome as a human rights priority for the
United Kingdom and the first ever self-standing OSCE decision on a
fundamental freedom. We also joined consensus on a decision to update
the OSCE’s existing Roma and Sinti Action Plan. It was, however,
disappointing that a decision on the safety of journalists was not able
to gain consensus, despite our and like-minded partners’ strong
support. The events unfolding in Ukraine serve as a vivid reminder that
journalists’ safety and freedom to do their job remains a
concern in a number of OSCE countries. It is also disappointing that
some states remain unwilling to acknowledge that freedom of expression
and media freedom protections should apply equally online as they do
offline.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121061000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-wms0001.htm#13121061000146">I
also strongly welcome the adoption at Kyiv of the first internationally
recognised confidence-building measures on cyber security, a
longstanding UK priority. Further agreements were reached across the
OSCE’s three dimensions, including on combating the
proliferation of illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons, and on Combating
Trafficking in Human Beings. I regret it was not possible to reach
consensus on a Ministerial declaration on Afghanistan and we will
continue to look for ways to underscore the OSCE’s capacity to
act on issues such as border security in the Central Asian region. A
further declaration was agreed on the Helsinki +40 process, continuing
the initiative launched last year in Dublin to reinvigorate the OSCE as
we approach the 40th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act in 2015. I

our region. The notion of security goes far beyond the absence of war,
but extends to creating a framework 
<?notus-xml column=72?>for peace and stability with democracy and human rights at its core. To
ensure that all its participating States live up to and fully implement
the commitments they have all agreed to, they must demonstrate the
political will to make this happen. No country is perfect, but some

commitments, but to allow narrow national interest to undermine and

them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121061000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131210-wms0001.htm#13121061000148">The

break up a peaceful demonstration and I underlined this again at the
