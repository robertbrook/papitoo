significantly by 2015. We are on track to meet those targets, not just
in the obvious oil and gas and extractive sectors but across a whole

It should not be about exporting child benefit, for instance. The Prime

However, it is possible to contemplate, as the Prime Minister has also
set out, having new arrangements on free movement for countries that
join the EU to slow the access to each other’s labour markets

is an overwhelming moral argument for dealing with the issue, there are
also important considerations of conflict resolution. Conflicts are not
resolved unless sexual violence is tackled, because it perpetuates

very much, Mr Speaker, for your words about the tragedy in Glasgow. Of

condolence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120350000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0001.htm#13120350000006">With
your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
PISA—programme for international student
assessment—league tables of educational performance published
today by the OECD. Before I go into the detail of what the league
tables show about the common features of high-performing school
systems, may I take a moment, as I try to in every public statement I
make, to thank our teachers for their hard work, dedication and
idealism. Whatever conclusions we draw about what needs to change, I
hope that we in this House can agree that we are fortunate to have the
best generation of young teachers ever in our schools. The data show
that the new recruits now entering the classroom are better qualified
than ever before. I would like in particular to thank those head
teachers who are, through the new school direct programme of teacher
training, recruiting more superb new graduates to teach in our state
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120350000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0001.htm#13120350000007">Although
the quality of our teachers is improving, today’s league tables
sadly show that that is not enough. When people ask why—if
teachers are better than ever— we need to press ahead with
further reform to the system, today’s results make the case more
eloquently than any number of speeches. Since the 1990s, our
performance in these league tables has been, at best, stagnant, and, at
worst, declining. In the latest results, we are 21st in the world for
science, 23rd for reading and 26th for mathematics. For all the
well-intentioned efforts of past Governments, we are still falling
further behind the best-performing school systems in the world. In
Shanghai and Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong—indeed even in
Taiwan and Vietnam—children are learning more and performing
better with every year that passes, leaving our children behind in the
global race. That matters because business is more mobile than ever,
and employers are more determined than ever to seek out the
best-qualified workers. Global economic pressures, far from leading to
a race to the bottom, are driving all nations to pursue educational
excellence more energetically than ever before. Today’s league
tables show that nations that have had the courage radically to reform
their education systems, such as Germany and Poland, have significantly
improved their performance and their children’s
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120350000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0001.htm#13120350000008">No
single intervention, or indeed single nation, has all the answers to
our education challenges. But if we look at all the high-performing and
fast-improving education systems, we find that certain common features
recur: there is an emphasis on social justice and helping every child
to succeed; there is a commitment to an aspirational academic
curriculum for all students; there is a high level of autonomy from
bureaucracy for head teachers; there is a rigorous system of
accountability for performance; and head teachers have the critical
power to hire whom they want, remove underperformers and reward the
best with the recognition they deserve. Those principles have driven
this coalition’s education reforms since 2010.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=783?><hs_Para UID="13120350000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0001.htm#13120350000009">The first
reform imperative, of course, is securing greater social justice. It is
notable that all the high-performing jurisdictions set demanding
standards for every child, whatever their
background. Germany, in particular, has improved
its standing in these league tables by doing more to promote greater
equity to ensure that more children from poorer backgrounds catch up
with their peers. The good news from the PISA research is that in
England we have one of the most progressive and socially just systems
of education funding in the world, but we in the coalition Government
believe that we must go further to help the most disadvantaged
children. That is why we have made funding even more progressive with
the pupil premium. We have extended free pre-school education to the
most disadvantaged two-year-olds and changed how we hold schools
accountable so they have to give even greater attention to the
performance of poor children. I hope that today the Opposition will
acknowledge those steps forward and give their support to our
accountability
reforms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120350000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0001.htm#13120350000010">The
second imperative is a more aspirational curriculum. In successful
Asian nations, all students are introduced to more stretching maths
content at an earlier age than has been the case here. In the
fastest-improving European nation, Poland, every child now follows a
core academic curriculum to the age of 16. Our new national curriculum
is explicitly more demanding, especially in maths, and it is modelled
on the approach of high-performing Asian nations such as Singapore. The
mathematical content is matched by a new level of ambition in
technology, with the introduction of programming and coding on the
national curriculum for the first
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120350000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0001.htm#13120350000011">In
our drive to eliminate illiteracy, we have introduced a screening check
at age six to make sure that every child is reading fluently. Our
introduction of the English baccalaureate, which is awarded to students
who secure GCSE passes in English, maths, the sciences, languages and
history or geography, matches Poland’s ambition by embedding an
expectation of academic excellence for every 16-year-old. I hope today
that those on the Labour Front Bench will confirm their support for our
new curriculum, the phonics screening check and the English
baccalaureate. Our children deserve to have those higher standards
adopted
universally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120350000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0001.htm#13120350000012">The
third reform imperative is greater autonomy for head teachers. There is
a direct correlation in the league tables between freedom for heads and
improved results. That is why we have dramatically increased the number
of academies and free schools, and given heads more control over
teacher training, continuous professional development and the
improvement of underperforming schools. The school direct programme, by
giving heads control of teacher recruitment, has improved the quality
of new teachers. The creation of more than 300 teaching schools has put
our most outstanding heads in charge of helping existing teachers to do
even better. The academies programme has allowed great heads, such as
those in the Harris and Ark chains, to take over underperforming
schools such as the Downhills primary in Tottenham. I hope today that
those on the Opposition Front Bench will signal their support for these
reforms and show that they, like us, trust our outstanding heads to
drive
improvement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120350000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0001.htm#13120350000013">The
fourth pillar of reform is accountability. Those systems that have
autonomy without accountability often underperform. Accountability has
to be intelligent, which is why we have sharpened Ofsted inspections, 
<?notus-xml column=784?>recruited more outstanding serving teachers to inspect schools and
demanded that underperforming schools improve far faster. The old
league table system relied too much on a narrow measurement of C passes
at GCSE, which generated the wrong incentives and wrote off too many
children. We have changed league tables to ensure that every
child’s progress is rewarded. We have also ensured that children
are not entered early, or multiple times, for GCSEs simply to influence
league tables. I hope today that those on the Opposition Front Bench
will endorse those changes and join us in demanding greater rigour and
higher standards from all schools.</hs_Para>

pillar of reform is freedom for heads to recruit and reward the best.
Shanghai, the world’s best-performing education system, has a
rigorous system of performance-related pay. We have given head teachers
the same freedoms here. I hope today that we can have a clear
commitment from all parts of the House to support those brave and
principled heads who want to pay the best teachers
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120350000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0001.htm#13120350000015">The
programme of reform that we have set out draws on what happens in the
best school systems—identified today by the OECD—because
we want nothing but the best for our children. Unless we can provide
them with a school system that is one of the best in the world, we will
not give them the opportunities that they need to flourish and succeed.
That is why it is so important that we have a unified national
commitment to excellence in all our schools and for all our pupils. I
commend this statement to the House.</hs_Para>

PISA data reveal the continuing strength of east Asian countries and

programme of unqualified teachers and unregulated free schools as

turn to the whole question of qualified teachers. It is the case that
there are now fewer unqualified teachers in our schools than under
Labour. In 2009, there were 17,400 unqualified teachers, in 2010, just
before Labour left office, there were 17,800 and there are now only
14,800, a significant reduction. Indeed, those teachers who are now
joining the profession are better qualified than ever before. In 2009,
just before  the Labour party lost office, only 61% of teachers
had a 2:1 or better as their undergraduate degree. Under the coalition
Government, the figure is 74%, which is a clear improvement that has
been driven by the changes that we have introduced. It has been
reinforced by the introduction of the school direct system, which I
invited the hon. Gentleman to applaud and welcome—he declined to
do so—and which has secured even more top graduates with a 2:1
or better, including a first, in our schools.</hs_Para>

Sweden results have slid, but as I said earlier, not only do we need to

terrible truth about the situation that we face in our schools is that

Today’s figures are extremely sobering. They are indictment of
the previous Government’s education policy. There was a massive
investment in education, a huge effort was put into education, and we
went nowhere. We need to hear from the Secretary of State how his
reforms will ensure that in future years—probably not so early

which the Secretary of State has praised. Andreas Schleicher has talked

is the case that the London Challenge was a success. Other systems of
sub-regional collaboration introduced under the previous Government
were less conspicuously successful. If we look at the ingredients of
the London Challenge, we find that they were primarily growth in the
number of academies, greater autonomy for head teachers and a rigorous
approach—<I>[</I><I>Interruption</I><I>] —</I>and
a greater and more rigorous approach to underperformance in schools
that needed new leadership. Through the academies programme, we have
ensured that schools across the country that have underperformed are
under new leadership. It has been called the “forced academies
programme”, and there has been no support for it from those on
the Labour Front Bench. I hope that now they will show their support
for this rigorous

It is therefore clearly the case that our children are significantly

under the previous Government, but, as the hon. Member for Liverpool,
West Derby (Stephen Twigg) pointed out, there was also grade inflation.
That grade inflation has been laid bare by international studies

the reduction under this Government in the number of teachers without
teaching qualifications reflects the fact that teachers are now better
qualified than ever before. Critically, the decision over who to hire

any education system that we respect the autonomy of great head

rise to speak on the motion in my name and those of my right hon. and

likely, I trust, that in the general thrust of a debate on
cyber-bullying, party political differences will, for the most part, be
set to one side. I say that not out of any sense of presumption, but it
is borne of my experiences as a Member of this House and of the united
opposition of all parties to the growing phenomena of cyber-bullying

trolling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120351000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120351000065">Let
us remind ourselves that cyber-bullying is the use of electronic
communication to bully a person, typically by sending intimidating or
threatening messages. Most hon. Members in the Chamber have access to a
mobile phone, an iPad and other electronic devices, which we rely on in
carrying out our responsibilities as elected representatives. Our
phones and mobile devices are all equipped with software that allows
even the most novice of users to browse the internet, and if we so
wish, to communicate via social
media.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120351000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120351000066">I
engage with my constituents via social media daily. Today, technology
allows me to reach out and express my views to thousands of people at
the click of a button. That is a very useful tool, but the fact that a
person can reach out to thousands of people by the click of a button is
a harrowing one for approximately 65% of teenagers. We will be blinded
by facts and figures in this debate, but they must all be aired to hit
home what a problem cyber-bullying is and what a lasting effect it has.
We hear more and more reports of young people who take their own lives
as a result of bullying, and cyber-bullying in
particular.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120351000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120351000067">I
arranged to meet Dr Arthur Cassidy, who heads up an organisation in my
constituency called the Yellow Ribbon. Dr Cassidy is involved in
UK-wide research into cyber-bullying and internet trolling. He has
carried out comprehensive research on the effects of bullying on young
people, including the long-term effects on the development of its
victims. Recent reports have found that approximately 65% of teenagers
say that they have experienced online bullying or trolling, with the
most common form being cruel posts that comment on the way that someone
is dressed or on what they look like. Some 48% of those teenagers said
that it had made them feel very upset. More than half of that 65% said
that it was happening to them at least once a
week.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120351000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120351000068">The
anonymity permitted by certain forms of online social interaction can
give bullies the false impression that they can say anything they wish,
no matter how hurtful, with little consequence for themselves or for
the person they might have harmed. Children have the right to feel safe
and secure, particularly when they are at 
<?notus-xml column=805?>school. Schoolchildren are still developing and do not always have the

October, I contacted every post-primary school in my constituency and
asked each school to identify two student representatives to sit on a
forum to discuss cyber-bullying. The meeting was attended by Dr Arthur
Cassidy, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the community safety
partnership and some parents. I thank them all for their help. I felt
that it was essential to engage with young people and to hear their
views on how social media affect them both positively and
negatively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120351000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120351000070">Many
of the children emphasised how difficult it can be to find help when
they have been bullied and to get adults to listen to them. They said
that many adults do not understand social media and that more should be
done to educate parents and teachers about cyber-bullying. I was very
impressed by the openness of the young people at the forum. I was
hesitant when it was brought together, because I did not think that
they would open up in such a forum, but they did. On that day, I made a
commitment to those young people that I would do whatever I could as
their Member of Parliament to urge the Government to take whatever
steps were needed to tackle this growing
phenomenon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120351000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120351000071">I
am pleased to say that steps have been taken in my constituency to
address the problem. A workshop is scheduled to take place tomorrow
evening to offer advice to parents who are concerned about keeping up

cyber-bullying is a dramatically growing trend, not just a passing

future prospects and having a negative impact on their performance at
school and their health. It will continue to grow if we do not act
fast. Work needs to be done to make ways of reporting such hate crimes
more accessible. Children, young people and the vulnerable need to know

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr

(David Simpson) for tabling this important motion and for his measured
and serious speech. It was good to hear about the work that he is doing
in his constituency to encourage the education of parents about
technology. Although it might be true that adults are not as
technologically savvy as their teenage children, the debate shows that
adults, particularly him, take a strong interest in children’s
welfare, especially given the new and venomous trend of
cyber-bullying.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120351000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120351000096">It
goes without saying that we must take bullying in general, and

is good to see the House debating the subject, and it goes without
saying that bullying is high on parents’ lists of concerns about
their children when they are at school. We know that the impact of
bullying can be devastating for those who are bullied, sometimes with
the most tragic of consequences. Cyber-bullying is often an extension
of bullying that takes place at school, and the fact that it can follow
those being bullied to their home, giving them no respite or refuge,
makes it all the more insidious and harmful. I completely agree with
the hon. Gentleman that the anonymity and distance provided online
provoke an almost unintelligible venom. I am not an apologist for
physical bullying, but we almost cannot imagine such venom were the
bully and the bullied face to face. That takes cyber-bullying to
another level of
insidiousness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120351000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120351000098">As
the hon. Gentleman said, our children now have great access to the
internet. There is internet access in virtually every
household—91%—in which children live, and more teenagers
than adults own smartphones as a proportion of their population.
Developing children’s skills in this digital age is therefore
incredibly important. It is also worth reminding the House of how
quickly the phenomenon has come upon us. I fought my first election in
2005, when I became a relatively young and junior Member,
without YouTube and Twitter and virtually 
<?notus-xml column=809?>without Facebook. Facebook came into being in 2004, YouTube in 2005 and
Twitter in 2006. Now those and a plethora of other sites are integral
to the lives not just of Members but of the children who use them.
Ensuring that children can use those technologies safely is incredibly
important and will become increasingly
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120351000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120351000099">The

consult extensively on the issue, and to make a considered decision.
The risk of almost limitless potential prosecutions must be balanced
against the need for a credible policy and credible prosecutions. I am
sure the debate on that will continue, but I think the process was
carefully considered and not rushed into. Neither was there any wish to
underestimate the impact of some of the

thoughtful debate about something on which Members are united, which is
to see this venomous trend—to use his powerful
adjective—curtailed in the best way we can. On the criminal
element, as I understand, the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing
Bill will include a new offence of causing nuisance and annoyance and
there will be the opportunity for someone to get an antisocial
behaviour order against people who cause nuisance and annoyance. That
can also be used in cases of cyber-bullying.</hs_Para>

House. As I said a few minutes ago, my understanding is that there were
2,000 prosecutions last year. I do not have a breakdown of those
figures, but I will write to him if he requires that. The fundamental

but I cannot say, from my eyrie in the Department for Culture, Media

fingertips on its effectiveness. The Department is proud of reducing
481 pages of bullying advice down to 11 pages. Common sense
tells us that bullying advice is now being read by schools. The hon.
Gentleman alluded to search powers, but the 2011 Act also introduced
the new simplified Ofsted inspection regime. Since January 2012, Ofsted
has four core criteria only, one of which includes freedom from
bullying. Schools can therefore be held to account for their
policies.</hs_Para>

vacuum. Sometimes the rhetoric is such that we almost pass on to
schools the responsibility for sorting out all society’s ills.
Schools have to work with parents, and parents have to be participants
and allies in the work to combat cyber-bullying. Schools need to work

many within our society must carry responsibility—we have heard
some of them named already—for the protection of our children. I
believe that we must first start in the home, because parental
responsibility is so important. Parents cannot shun their
responsibility to provide a safe environment for their own children.
Quite often, they provide availability to the technology, and then some
walk away from any further responsibility. By so doing, many
parents inadvertently expose their children to cyber-bullying and
inappropriate online behaviour because they do not exercise parental
control. Many parents might set up a social network account without any
understanding of the need for online safety. Many have little or no
knowledge of how they should or could protect their children online.
Parents, however, do not stand alone in carrying the burden of
responsibility. Society must bear its portion of responsibility. We
have heard about the responsibility of teachers, for example, and of
this Parliament having responsibilities that we must all
shoulder.</hs_Para>

likely to be targeted. Cyber-bullying is now an everyday problem for
today’s children—one that I believe is of epidemic
proportions. The suggestion that people should simply boycott websites

historically, bullying went on in the classroom—a point on which
the Minister touched. Today’s bullying, however, does not stop
there. Bullying in the classroom was repugnant and must be utterly
condemned, but it stopped when the child arrived home. For many

The reality is that, as I said, many young people will say things

often the tool of today’s modern bullying at a time when a young
person is most vulnerable to the feeling of worthlessness. As 
<?notus-xml column=816?>the bullying continues on the social media site, even in the young
person’s own bedroom, a feeling of loneliness will follow. Then,
following on from that loneliness comes a sense of hopelessness, and
the social media might then kick on a step further. After it has
carried that person to the point of hopelessness, worthlessness and
loneliness, it then also provides them with information and techniques
that increase the chance of suicide attempts being successful and
decrease the chance of these young people receiving help. At that
moment of their vulnerability, when they are at the lowest point of
their life, they are shown how they could end it all and are told by
the person communicating with them why they should end it all because
they are worthless—because they are nothing, because they mean

material on the internet—violent pornography and violence
generally—and its hugely insidious effect on our young people

normalise hardcore and often violent behaviour for our kids so they
take this stuff granted—stuff that we are aghast at and would
have been absolutely aghast at if we had had access to it in our
impressionable teenage years? The internet is a fantastic tool that we
cannot, and would not wish to, uninvent; it is one of the great
fashioning things of the late 20th and 21st centuries. Why do some

must have a multi-faceted approach, which is why that body, which
brings together academia, business, the internet service providers, the
child protection people, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection
Centre, Government and everybody else, is so important. In my time on
the UKCCIS we focused on access to harmful content—violent and
adult content—for young people in particular, and I think the
focus is still the same. I regret, however that we did not latch on
earlier, as we needed to do, to the malign effects that the misuse of
social media to abuse and bully is having on our children, some of them

though it is, rather than just concentrating on access to harmful
material, we need to take much more seriously the use of social media

course, by older people masquerading as young people who are seeking to
groom and abuse them sexually. It is extraordinary to note the number
of young people who will still communicate with strangers—they
know not where they come from or what their intentions are, yet they
have conversations with them over the internet and even meet up with
them, as if they were best friends.</hs_Para>

will expand, and more social media opportunities will of course come
the way of our children. Some are supposed to be age-barred, but in
practice we know that it is almost impossible to do that. Having spoken
to young people, including during my time as chairman of the UKCCIS, I
know that what really worries them is a malign posting on social media
sites, which undermines their integrity. Such a posting can go viral,
and in a matter minutes a huge audience may be privy to some deeply
offensive and abusive, personal, private sexual information that is now
out there. In the past, such information would have been in hard copy
form—a piece of paper available to just one or two people, so it
had limited effect. Now, it is out there for ever,
potentially.</hs_Para>

“sexting” is just one of the more alarming manifestations
of social media having become part of our everyday lives. This can turn
into bullying when threats to send increasingly explicit photos over
social media are used as a form of blackmail. Of course, we have had
the recent tragic cases of young people, including a 14-year-old girl,
being driven to suicide by the fear of what is out there—by the
threat of its being publicised and used against them on social

Cyber-bullying is an even more cowardly form of what we might have

done by people in the comfort of their own bedroom. However, the
psychological effects can be every bit as damaging as physical,
face-to-face bullying, and such bullying has the capacity to be spread
cancer-like among a much wider body of peers, at the press of a button.
It can undermine a young person’s confidence and self-esteem, at
a time when they are still finding their own identity. It can lead to
depression, truancy, self-harm and even suicide; to a fear of returning
to school to face one’s friends, who may be the authors of some
of this cyber-bullying; and to a feeling of being permanently

“know the net” research suggests that socially and
economically disadvantaged children and young people are at greater
risk of experiencing cyber-bullying and suffering its adverse effects.
It is more likely to affect disabled children, young carers, children
with learning disabilities and recipients of free school meals.
Cyber-bullies are picking on the most vulnerable children—an
even more shameful act. Facebook is the most common place for it, as we
have heard. Facebook has made great strides, but there is an awful lot
more it can do. Such bullying happens on Twitter, and it happens with
Instagram. There are now various new modes of communicating, whereby an
image is sent and it self-destructs within 10 seconds, so the evidence
is gone. Those are all clever ways that can be used by malign people to
bully even more
effectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000042">What
is really worrying is that only 37% of teenagers who experience online
bullying report it to a social network, so two thirds do not. Some 36%
of those who do not report it said that they choose not to because it
is not taken seriously and doing so would be a waste of time. Very few
even report it to their parents, yet a third of all parents fear that
their child is actually causing bullying on the internet, according to
research by the National Children’s Bureau and McAfee. Some 45%
of parents have set up Facebook accounts themselves for their own
children who are under the age of 13. The recommended minimum age for
having a Facebook account is 13, yet some parents are clearly ignoring
that. Indeed, Facebook itself has discussed removing that age
threshold. However, that is one of the few safeguards that provides
guidance to parents on the age at which it is appropriate for their
children to be exposed to these very powerful forms of social media.
Only one in 10 parents believe that their own children are safe online,
yet over a third have never had a conversation with their children
about the dangers of the internet, and only one in five bothers to set
up controls on their internet devices.</hs_Para>

extraordinary situation, a perfect storm. Schools are not doing enough
to teach the hazards of the internet effectively. We need better sex
and relationship education as armour to deal with some of the sexual
abuse on the internet. Parents are afraid of appearing ignorant and do
not communicate with their children about the hazards, and the social
media companies are still spending too much time on maximising the
number of people attracted to their sites, the revenues earned by the
sites and the stock market capitalisation as the sites are launched on
the American stock market. The Home Affairs Select Committee reported
earlier this year that too many of our social media companies remain

problem is that abuse of the internet lacks consequences. That was
behind my earlier question to the Minister when I asked him how many
people were being prosecuted and actually feeling the force of the law.

Margaret Ritchie</B> (South Down) (SDLP):</Member> It is a pleasure to
follow the thoughtful, reflective contribution of the hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), and I commend the hon.
Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) and his party for tabling this
motion on the very important topic of cyber-bullying. As the Minister
said, there is no doubt that cyber-bullying is perpetrated with a large
degree of anonymity and distance, which makes it particularly insidious
and frightening for children. In many instances it has led to truancy
from school, self-harm, suicide and many other issues. We all know that
cyber-bullying can be done in many situations, and people who commit it
say things on the internet, Twitter and Facebook that they would not
say to someone face to face. When someone reads such a comment about
themselves on the internet, Facebook or Twitter, it can be particularly
intimidating. In fact, people have even been purged as a result, so it
is important to reflect on that.</hs_Para>

legislative difficulties arise in defining the difference between
cyber-bullying and cyber-stalking, and in defining each of those
concepts. That brings us into the arena of cyber-defamation law.
Cyber-bullying has proved difficult to legislate on because of freedom
of speech issues. Absurdly, many people argue that such legislation
violates the bully’s freedom of speech. I find it unacceptable
that a bully should feel that he is being prevented from saying
something. However, this all comes back to the fact that such bullying
is anonymous and from a distance, and that it can cause people to take
certain actions, in a mistaken belief, to try to protect themselves.
The hon. Member for Upper Bann is right to
say that serious consideration has to be given to the
legislative consequences or cyber-bullying, because at the moment, as
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, cyber-bullying has
had little consequences. In Northern Ireland, a review of sentencing is
taking place and reference must be made to cyber-bullying in
that. We must also have the primary legislation here and in the
devolved institutions to deal with this
issue.</hs_Para>

victims at any time and in any place—at home, at school, on a

different platforms, including text, social networks, video, photo
messaging, internet chatrooms, in-game messages, e-mail and more.
Nearly half of five to 15-year-olds own a mobile phone, and the use of
tablet computers has trebled over the same age group since last year,
and almost all have regular internet access at home or at school. The
channels through which cyber-bullying is perpetuated are never far away

Shannon</B> (Strangford) (DUP):</Member> I am pleased to have the
opportunity to speak in this important debate. Cyber-technology should
not be a threat to people; it should be a bonus and one of the good
things in life. On cyber Monday, sales worth some £600 million
were achieved. Of course, for those with Ulster bank accounts whose
cards did not work last night when they went to pay their bill in the
restaurant, the petrol station or the shop, the card was not worth the
plastic it was made of—but that is a different issue. None the
less it highlights the advances that cyber-technology has
brought—the good things—and the menaces.</hs_Para>

focus on cyber-bullying among children and young people and the impact
it can have on their well-being. Although I recognise that
cyber-bullying is a problem among adults as well, internet use is
increasing all the time among children and young people. It seems that
each day the internet is becoming more mobile and more
accessible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000085">Earlier
this year, a report by the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children found that 91% of all five to
15-year-olds and 100% of 12 to 15-year-olds used the internet in 2012,
which gives us some indication of the importance of it. The internet is
one of the most profound inventions in human history, and, of course,
it brings huge benefits for children and young people in that they are
better informed and better connected to the world around them. That is
what it is supposed to be about. But the internet can also be a tool
for harm and abuse. As Members from all parts of the House will
know—they have spoken about this matter very passionately and
knowledgably—children and young people can often suffer as a
result of cyber-bullying, which has significant detrimental effects on
them, damaging their sense of worth and wrecking their self-esteem. As
an MP from Northern Ireland, I am particularly concerned that
cyber-bullying is a significant and growing problem in our schools, as
my hon. Friends the Members for South Antrim (Dr McCrea) and for Upper
Bann (David Simpson) indicated in their contributions. According to
research conducted by the Northern Ireland Department of Education in
2011, 15.5% of year 6 pupils and 17% of year 9 pupils indicated that
they had experienced cyber-bullying in the past couple of months. That
gives us an idea of the size of the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000086">In

11-16 year olds have been deliberately targeted, threatened or
humiliated by an individual or group through the use of mobile phones

some cases, cyber-bullying has been found to contribute to children and
young people self-harming or even taking their own lives. Other Members

Ofcom report shows that 68% of 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK have a
profile on a social networking site. Among nine to 12-year-olds, who
are too young officially to have their own Facebook account,
36% report having a Facebook profile, with 13% saying that
they use it regularly. How aware are parents of their children’s
access to social networking sites and what goes on through those sites?

is changing fast and parents are clearly concerned about the rapid
proliferation of harmful online content and what their children might
be viewing. Ofcom highlights the fact that 79% of parents of children
aged five to 15 who use the internet at home say that they have put in
place rules about internet use. They have done it, but is it working?
According to a report driven by Dr Sonia Livingstone at the London
School of Economics, 81% of parents feel the need to talk to their
children about what they do and view online and more than half stay
nearby when their child is on the internet. If only that was possible
in every case.</hs_Para>

two statistics are encouraging, demonstrating a real desire on the part
of many parents to be actively involved in their children’s
online experience. In that context we need to empower them to help
their children to address issues such as cyber-bullying. This will
inform those parents who are interested and concerned and also, we
hope, prompt those who are not taking an active interest in the safety
of their children online to do so. In that regard, I draw the attention
of the House to the excellent Online Safety Bill, which will have its
Second Reading in the other place on Friday. The Bill has two key
provisions, one of which is designed to engage with the challenge of
cyber-bullying.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000099">In
the first instance, the Bill places a statutory duty on internet
service providers and mobile phone operators to exclude all adult
content, while providing the user with the option of accessing such
material subject to robust age verification to demonstrate that they
are 18 or over. The provision is designed to help parents
protect their children from stumbling, either accidentally or on
purpose, on inappropriate material.</hs_Para>

instance, the Bill places a duty on internet service providers and
mobile phone operators to provide prominent, easily accessible and
clear information about online safety to subscribers. It also places a
duty on the Secretary of State to educate parents of children under 18
on online safety. That key educational provision has been made

about it. He hid it successfully and sadly, the outcome was
catastrophic as he took his life. I also mentioned cyber-bullying. In
my day, people could go home and get away from it. That is not the case
today; there is simply no let up. In the family home, the PC might be
sat in the corner of the living room, representing the constant menace
of what is going on at school or in the workplace. It might be in the

there is no escape whatsoever. Other hon. Members gave
examples of that and we just heard about Hannah Smith and her terrible
experience. Over the past couple of days I have looked at other such
experiences. Shannon Gallagher took her own life less than two months
after her 13-year-old sister had killed herself. At the

a terrible phenomenon. Just this week we saw the example of a
20-year-old man in Canada who tried to commit suicide online. He set
his bedroom on fire, having taken drugs and alcohol. Some of the people
who were watching—I do not understand that
phenomenon—complained that they could not see what was happening

result of such bullying. It is important to promote clear policies on
tackling bullying of all sorts, and to specify the need to tackle

be equally bad for young people’s mental health, and it can
result in their confidence being attacked. In some cases, it can mean
complete social exclusion, which needs to be addressed.</hs_Para>

change in social attitudes. As technology has changed and improved
significantly so, I fear, has our tendency to accept the bad aspects
that come with it. Too often we accept that harassment or intimidating
comments are part of being on Twitter or Facebook, and too often we
hear people stating, “Well, it’s what happens.”
Why should we accept that? I am not talking about free speech or robust
debate—we all accept that, and we all get those
messages—as there is a difference between robust debate and
intimidating language that makes people fearful. If we do not deal with
this, we will dissuade victims from coming forward, stripping them of
the confidence that there is help available to deal with it.</hs_Para>

refer to—how can I put it?—the local difficulty that I
had in Strangers bar a few months ago. After that incident I received
all sorts of e-mails, some positive and some rather negative, including
one that was incredibly threatening. Someone said that they thought I
had not been attacked enough, and they looked forward to the day the
IRA re-formed and bombed my party. That sort of behaviour is completely
unacceptable. The people who work in my office should not be subjected
to such comments. They were frightened 
<?notus-xml column=832?>when opening the post, because that message had set such an awful
example. As a responsible employer, I felt that it was right for me to
report it to the police, but I was quite surprised by the criticism I
received from some members of the public who basically said,
“You have to grow up, because that is just what happens on
Twitter and
Facebook.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000115">The
point I am trying to make is that if we as individuals do not stand up
to such comments, how can we expect people who are being victimised in
their schools and workplaces to do so? We need to change attitudes so
that we can then change the culture. We need to say that it is frankly
not on for people to be subjected to that, for the sake of those
victims who have made the ultimate sacrifice and taken their lives as a
result of bullying. Let us use the laws we have so that we enjoy the
benefits and opportunities that technology can
provide.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_03_PT_1/F5D79E6D498980C746F2DA1373A078A6A7591783" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="3 December 2013">Tuesday

Goodman</B> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
follow the hon. Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew), who made a heartfelt
speech. I congratulate the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)
on initiating this important and timely debate. We need to pay more
attention to this problem, so I am grateful to
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000117">Members
have spoken about the exaggerated behaviour seen on the internet, and
we need to pay more attention to that. Bullying on the net and on
social media is clearly not like bullying in the playground, and for a
number of reasons. The Minister might want to do some research into the
factors that change people’s behaviour and into how their
behaviour
changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000118">Anonymity
is clearly a big problem in this regard. When talking about crime on
the net more generally, we have considered whether it might
be possible—I believe that it is—to make a clearer
connection between a person’s identity on the net and their
identity in the real world. Tackling that problem is central to
tackling many of the problems we have on the net. The behaviour of
young people, in particular, on the net can become exaggerated partly
because there is no feedback, so they do not need to face
the person they are bullying or to see the consequences. That is
clearly part of the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000119">I
do not wish to suggest that there is a problem with young people only,
because I think that people’s behaviour in general shifts with
technology. If I was to say quietly to the Minister in a private place
that I was going to tell him something that I did not want him to
repeat, I am sure that he would respect that. If I was to write him a
personal letter, it might be put in a box in his office and would not
be published all over the media. However, if I was to send something by
e-mail, it could immediately be broadcast nationally and
internationally. We had such an incident in my constituency, when
someone took a memory stick containing mental health records out of an
office and managed to lose it. That is because people’s
attitudes to other people are distanced by the technology, and we need
to understand that more. We need to look at the work that has been done
by Professor Susan Greenfield on changes that take place in the brain
when people use technology, because there is clearly a profound
change.</hs_Para>

for a strategy that cuts across different Departments and arenas. There
has been a lot of discussion about the role of schools, which clearly
is important. I would like the Minister to clarify whether the learning
that the Government are putting into the curriculum will be in the IT
part or in the personal, social, health and economic education part.
The Opposition think that it really needs to part of PSHE, because this
is about responsibility and
relationships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000121">I
commend to the Minister work that I saw a couple of months ago in
Denmark, where people have made curriculum materials to be used by
parents and children, who are already doing so in after-school classes.
Virtually every Member has said how important it is to involve families
in this, because parents need support and help. Again, we can learn
from the experience of other countries.</hs_Para>

aspect that has emerged is the disappointment that people have
experienced when they have complained to the industry or to public
sector professionals and the police. Another strand of any intelligence
strategy must surely involve proper training for the
professionals—the police, the courts and the social workers, as
well as school teachers.</hs_Para>

said that 900 schools will be reached through the charitable work that
is being supported. I very much hope that this is not going to be, as
it sounded, slightly London-centric. Although 900 schools sounds like
quite a lot, there are 23,000 schools in this country. As the hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) said, we do not
want a postcode

hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr McCrea) spoke about the
responsibilities of parents and pointed out that many parents are
irresponsible. Unfortunately, adults—parents—are using
the net to abuse their own children. This just shows the depths that
people can plumb and the complexity of dealing with these
problems.</hs_Para>

Member for East Worthing and Shoreham spoke about the inadequate
response—that is the politest thing one could say about
it—that he received from Google after he had contacted it.
Indeed, when Google directed me to what it thought was its excellent
advice about young people meeting in the real world people they had met
online, I was quite surprised to see that it was a cartoon advising
them that if they did so, it should be in a public place. As a piece of
advice to young people, that is worse than pitiful. It is very
important to get the industry up to speed on all this, as the Minister
said, and to take an international, as well as a national,
approach.</hs_Para>

have noted that the majority of young people now accept cyber-bullying
as part of everyday life, as do their parents. According to the
Anti-Bullying Alliance, 40% of parents and 44% of teachers said in a
survey that they do not know how to deal with cyber-bullying. I hope
that the Government are going to tell us that they do know how to deal
with it and that they will engage more energetically with our European
colleagues.</hs_Para>

2013, Hannah Smith killed herself following a series of abusive
messages on the social media site, Ask.fm, which is hosted in Latvia
and has been linked to four suicides in this country and Ireland since
2010. When this happened in Ireland, the Irish Government 
<?notus-xml column=834?>got in touch with Ask.fm. Unfortunately, the Government in London did
not do so. I went to a meeting with the Latvian ambassador. Given
international hosting and the international movement of messages, it is
vital that the Government up their game in tackling this with our
European
colleagues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000128">As
hon. Members have pointed out, the internet has great potential for
learning and exploration, but if it is to be safe, it cannot be
lawless. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children believes that one in five children is bullied online.
Everybody has a responsibility to put an end to this, so I
still do not understand why the Prime Minister’s
summer announcements about child online safety contained nothing about
safeguarding children on social media, or why the Secretary of State
for Culture, Media and Sport did not include it in her action list
following her conference with the industry. I am grateful to the
Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the hon. Member
for Wantage (Mr Vaizey) for offering to arrange a meeting with the
industry and I want to take him up on it, because I think we can do
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000129">I
would be grateful if Ministers could look into a couple of legal
points. First, is the existing legal framework adequate? Are the
Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the Malicious
Communications Act 1988 and the Telecommunications Act 1984 specific
enough to deal properly with cyber-bullying? It is clear that the
activity is growing, so if there is a loophole, it needs to be filled.
A systematic look at the legal provisions is
essential.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000130">Secondly,
it would be helpful to look at what obligations social media have to
respond quickly and substantively to complaints about cyber-bullying.
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made a lot of
intelligent points about this. He said that there need to be
consequences for the individual. I think we also need to consider
consequences for the industry if it has not set up proper systems on
its websites so that people can press panic buttons and the
perpetrators can be found and dealt with. It is clear, as the hon.
Gentleman has said, that the industry is completely happy to devote a
lot of time, energy and money to gaining customers and increasing its
profits, but the tempo is much slower when it comes to protecting
vulnerable young people. That is simply not
acceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000131">For
example, Facebook has an age limit of 13, but it wishes to expose those
young people to everything that is available to adults on the internet.
That is completely irresponsible. The age limit of 13 was set up
because it fits with Californian law. It does not fit with English law.
This country has no system for telling whether somebody is 12, 13 or
14. Either Facebook must change its model and treat 13-year-olds as
minors, or it must raise the age level at which people can access it.
It cannot have it both ways. It cannot encourage children and young
people into its site and then treat it as an adult
space.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000132">I

tackle social media sites and the problems of abuse and bullying. Like
the shadow Minister, I think that the response that he received from
Google to his complaint about an horrific set of circumstances was
inadequate. Such a response is entirely illustrative of the problems
that we are up against if we leave the matter wholly to the industry.
That is why the motion refers, as several hon. Members have done, to
the need to look carefully at what more can be done through legislation
to force companies to respond adequately. There should be consequences
for the companies if they do not take adequate action to deal with
complaints and problems that are not only minor, but can be very

Purdy states that cyber-bullying is a 24/7 activity. That point has
been brought out in this debate. With the old kind of bullying in the

Purdy’s report cites primary school teachers who say that
parents give iPads, tablets and mobile phones to children as young as
four or five as Christmas and birthday presents and then leave them to
it. As we all know, children pick up things from other children and
from older children in particular. We therefore need to be conscious of
this extremely worrying phenomenon. Parents urgently need to be
educated about the dangers of internet technology. Buying such
technology for their children and leaving them to it is the highest
form of irresponsibility. However, it is too easily done. I am not
lecturing others, because we are all guilty to some extent of not
keeping a close enough watch on our children. In today’s
society, it is not always possible to have a close family unit in which
close attention is given to what young people are up to. That is a
massive issue that needs to be
addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000150">We
want the Government to consider legislation on greater reporting
obligations on social media companies and service providers, and on a
specific offence of cyber-bullying. In his opening remarks, the
Minister helpfully referred to the various pieces of legislation that
are in place. He referred to the number of cases that have
been brought under the Malicious Communications Act 1988. He also
mentioned the Communications Act 2003, the
Telecommunications Act 1984 and the Protection from Harassment
Act 1997. However, I think that what has come out of this

moving the default position from information being open to friends of
friends to its being open to friends only. The Child

made a thought-provoking and well informed speech, and he reminded us
of the danger that cyber-bullying brings and the fact that in many ways
it is no more than a cowardly form of playground bullying. There is
also a danger that it is becoming an everyday fact of modern life, and
that too many young people and adults are becoming sanitised to the
world in which they communicate. My hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey

contribution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000157">My
hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham also asked the
crucial question why so many people turn to the internet to bully,
harass and abuse. I was struck by the contribution of the hon. Member
for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) and her thoughtful analysis of
attitudinal changes in people’s behaviour that are connected
with their use of different forms of social media, and how they have
manifested themselves in such widespread form. It was a powerful point,
and we should examine that matter carefully using the research that she
pointed to and through the work of the UKCCIS board and across
Government more widely. I am happy to discuss that research with her
and where she thinks we could channel our energies to use it more
effectively, because none of us would in any way, shape or form endorse
the changes to social attitudes that we have

my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, the
UKCCIS is part of the solution. He called for greater focus on social
media as part of the board’s work, and I agree completely. The
board currently has a strand of work on social networking, and we will
pursue the matter more vigorously as the board moves forward. I commend
him for his efforts to pool best practice through the Nominet survey of

so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0002.htm#13120365000159">My
hon. Friend raised the important matter of vulnerable children in
particular being unfairly targeted by people seeking to abuse them via
the internet. The £1.5 million that we have given to the
National Children’s Bureau will directly help to reduce the
bullying encountered by children who have special educational needs or
disabilities. As he rightly pointed out, we also need to improve
reporting mechanisms so that the two-thirds of children who do not
report a worry or concern about an interaction they have experienced
over the internet feel able to do so. That is another piece of work the
UKCCIS is taking forward, and I welcome my hon. Friend’s support
for many of our other actions.</hs_Para>

Cyber-bullying attacks people’s confidence, and it can go even

computing part of the curriculum, but there is of course freedom for
schools, within personal, social, health and economic education, to
envelop it into other aspects of the curriculum. The hon. Lady

There will be instances where cyber-bullying forms part of a wider

the conviction. It is sometimes hard to determine exactly whether
cyber-bullying has played a role in someone’s successful

significantly in 2012 and 2013, most notably in Mali, Tanzania,
Ethiopia and Niger. Sharia family courts have been introduced, which
ignore Christians and their beliefs. The north of Mali is similar to
Saudi Arabia in that Christians are simply no longer allowed to be
there or to practise their beliefs. In the Maldives, one cannot read
one’s Bible; indeed, people are not allowed to have one. If
people are caught reading their Bibles on holiday in that beautiful

multiple forms. We are all familiar with the horrifying fatalities
resulting from the Boko Haram attacks. First, I would like to highlight
the all-pervading pressure placed on Christians in the 12 northern
sharia states, where they are effectively second-class citizens and
converting to Christianity is a dangerous act not only for the convert,
but for anyone who tries to help them. In the northern states, great
pressure is exerted on the Christian community. They cannot bury their
dead in public cemeteries. In public primary schools, Christian
children are forced to attend Islamic studies and are beaten and/or
expelled if they refuse. Teenage Christians 
<?notus-xml column=846?>struggle to gain access to secondary schools or higher education
institutions. Christian girls were under serious threat of abduction,
forced conversion and marriage. Access for Christians to development
projects in these states is also severely restricted. What are the

the militant group that targets Government and Church activities.
Church leaders are often specifically targeted by this group. Many have

Chad and Niger. There are further examples of attacks upon Christians.
A Catholic minister and his two sons were murdered in the northern
state of Yobe. Their home and church were then set ablaze. The town of
Gamboru was attacked twice. Six people were killed in the first attack,
and a further 21 in the second. Militant cross-border terrorist groups
are also fomenting religious strife in other African countries.
Christians in Somalia and Kenya are being targeted by the group
al-Shabaab. In the Central African Republic, the Seleka

Christians are suffering persecution. I am sure that he would be the
first to admit, however, that in the Central African Republic, Nigeria,
Syria and elsewhere, it is not just Christians but people of other
religions who are suffering such persecution. That should be a matter
of deep concern to all of us, whether we have a religious faith or 
<?notus-xml column=847?>not, because freedom of religion and belief is a gateway to other human
rights and a litmus test of other fundamental freedoms. When people are
persecuted because of the faith that they profess, the freedoms of
expression and assembly and other human rights will often also
suffer.</hs_Para>

Field:</Member></B> I accept that view, but would the Minister
acknowledge the depressing paradox that some of the worst persecution
is taking place in notional democracies? In some cases, the Christian
population would be better looked after under a
dictatorship—such as in Syria under President Assad—than
in a country that is notionally democratic. This is not simply a matter
of saying that a whole load of democratic rights will follow on from
religious freedoms. We must ensure that religious and individual
freedoms go hand in hand and that they do not find themselves in

other.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000214"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Simmonds" PimsId="697" UID="13120365000546" xid="537" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000546">Mark

although he will be aware that we believe that President Assad’s
regime in Syria has engaged in a deliberate attempt to stir up tensions
between religious groups in order to hold on to power. My hon. Friend
is right to suggest that these issues are extremely complex, but there

Given the fact that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is in China

Simmonds:</Member></B> I understand the point that my hon. Friend is
making, but I re-emphasise the fact that we strongly support freedom of
religion for all, including in China—the example he
gave—in accordance with international frameworks to which the
United Kingdom and China are both party. We regularly raise the issue
of religious freedom with the Chinese Government, and we have a
UK-China human rights dialogue for detailed expert engagement, which

little progress, because I want to put on the record what the
Government are doing about the persecution of those trying to practise
their religion. We strongly believe that the freedom to practise,
change or share one’s faith or belief without discrimination or
violent opposition is a fundamental human right that all people should
enjoy. We believe that societies that aim to guarantee freedom of
religion or belief are stronger, fairer and more confident. The
situation facing Christians in the 21st century is alarming. Research
by the Pew Research Centre acknowledges that Christians are the most
persecuted religious group in the world—a point made powerfully
by the hon. Member for Strangford. The Government recognise that, and
the persecution of Christians worldwide was the central focus of
Baroness Warsi’s keynote speech at Georgetown university on
15 November. In that speech, we called for unity in 
<?notus-xml column=848?>confronting the intolerance and sectarianism that leads to minority
communities being persecuted around the world and to a mass exodus of
Christians from places where they have co-existed with the majority
faith for generations. In the speech, she presented her vision for a
cross-faith, cross-continent response to the problem, with a positive,
practical focus on promoting the benefits of religious plurality to
societies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000218">A
key element of that speech was that our response to the persecution of
Christians should not be sectarian. We should not be standing up for
our co-religionists or Christians in particular; we should be
supporting the right to freedom of religion or belief for all, as set
out in article 18 of the universal declaration of human rights. History
points out that intolerance is defeated only when we come together.
People of all faiths and none should be appalled when a bomb goes off
outside a church. Indeed, both Muslims and Christians have come
together to protect each other’s place of worship, and, as in
the case of the terrible suicide bomb attacks on All Saints’
church in Peshawar, to donate blood for the victims. That needs to be
the response that we all take to the global crisis affecting
Christians.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000219">We
should speak out on behalf of Christians. That is what we have done,
for example, when we condemned the recent attacks that took place in
Pakistan, which killed and injured so many innocent people. We should
lobby for changes in discriminatory laws and practices that affect
religious minorities, including Christians. We will continue to do that
when, for example, an Iranian pastor is arrested for setting up a
church in a house or for sharing his faith. We meet Christian leaders
from around the world to gain a better understanding of their concerns
and the issues affecting them. Foreign and Commonwealth Office
Ministers met Patriarch Gregorios III on 16 October to discuss the
plight of Christians in Syria—the hon. Member for Strangford
made a powerful point about that.</hs_Para>

in supporting local Christian communities. That is why for a number of
years we have supported the work of Canon Andrew White in Iraq,
bringing together religious leaders across sectarian divides to
denounce violence that occurs in the name of religion. Similarly, when
I went to Kaduna in northern Nigeria—another example cited by
the hon. Gentleman—I met religious leaders across the religious
divide to see the valuable inter-faith work that was taking place
there. I wish to discuss Nigeria in my closing remarks, if the House
will allow me.</hs_Para>

not believe that making it our policy to defend Christians in
particular is going to help them in the longer term. There is a risk of
isolating them from the wider populations, identifying them as
something of a fifth column and even exacerbating the persecution that
they may be suffering. Instead, we should be supporting the building of
societies that respect human rights, the rule of law and the equality
and opportunity of all citizens, and spelling out that all freedoms of
religion or belief are a universal
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000222">We
are also making the case that countries that protect minority rights
are stronger, fairer and more confident. If people are free to believe
and to worship, they can make a bigger contribution to society, boost
the economy and guard against violence, extremism and social strife.
Other countries should protect Christians not just because it is the
right thing to do, which it is, but because it is in their interests to
do so. The freedom 
<?notus-xml column=849?>of religion is a fundamental human rights priority for this Government,

Another example that the hon. Member for Strangford gave was the
appalling atrocities that are taking place in the Central African
Republic, where Muslims are persecuting Christians and Christians are
persecuting and murdering Muslims. The actions of both groups are

sectarian attacks on 14 August, when the security forces dispersed

as businesses owned by Coptic Christians were destroyed. The excellent
report by Amnesty—I recommend it to people who have not read
it—reported that 43 Orthodox churches were completely destroyed,
and 207 churches were attacked. Not only were the symbols of
Christianity attacked but Christians themselves, and four people were
killed that day. That is part of a rise in sectarian tension in Egypt,

impunity for the perpetrators. Egyptian law also means that it is

introduced a Bill that has been discussed for the past few years. It is
a private Member’s Bill, but it has support from senior figures,
and it would introduce the death penalty for homosexuality. People have
asked me whether we should give aid to a country that is considering
such a measure. Should we give aid to other countries where, for
example, abortion is denied to rape victims? It is a tricky situation,
because if we deny aid to countries where people are persecuted, we run
the risk of penalising the most vulnerable people we are trying to
help. We need to send a strong message not about the conditions that we
impose on aid but about our expectations of human rights in the
countries to which we give aid. I shall come to that when I discuss the

friends from the Democratic Unionist party for introducing this debate.

I say, on behalf of the Back Benchers, that it would have been helpful
if both Front Benchers had listened to the debate and then responded to
it, rather than taken up the majority of their time in setting out the
line they want to take? That very act says to the House that neither
they nor their Front-Bench colleagues have really got the point that
what we are trying to tell them is that there is a serious issue with
the global persecution of Christians, which is being seriously
under-reported and not being properly understood or effectively
answered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000277">It
is no good the hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) talking
about the equivalence of human rights. Everyone in the House supports
the equivalence of human rights, but that is not what this debate is

there is now practically no country—from Morocco to
Pakistan—in which Christians can freely practise their religion.

something different is required in response to the fact that 200

was interviewed about this debate on BBC Radio Ulster this morning. The
thrust of the four questions put to me was, “Why on earth are

that from the BBC, but I have found in my constituency and across

the fantastic responses to natural catastrophes, such as the

in other parts of the world is typical of the liberal media in this

persecution of Christians is not new—we know from historical
records that there have been persecutions since biblical
times—but the staggering fact is that Christianity is the most
persecuted faith in the world today, with more than 100,000 Christians

it is particularly painful that in Afghanistan, where there has been so

all, elements of the Islamic world demonstrate that problem. In some
cases, the persecution comes from states—China and other states
have been mentioned—that are aggressively secular. It is right
for us to say that it is not good enough for a nation’s
constitution to say that people have freedom of religion as long as it
is through a state-approved Church. It is not acceptable for one part

another part to undermine that by saying that a particular form of

Egypt to ensure that the new draft constitution not only reflects a
genuine right to religious freedom for all, particularly the Coptic
community, but entrenches it in practice. For example, it should remove
discriminatory provisions regarding the building of Christian churches,
which evoke laws that go back to the Ottoman era and have been a

give beleaguered Christian communities in Iraq and Syria, which are
some of the oldest in the Christian world, through the Geneva II

Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the right hon. Member for East Devon

<?notus-xml column=862?>that many will also have visited Malaysia as tourists—as I did
many years ago—and appreciated a tolerant, respectful, gentle
and hospitable people, and a society with the reputation for being a

an important Commonwealth partner for the UK, and has had a significant
trading and strategic relationship with this country over many years.
Because of that background, it is right to be concerned about recent
worrying signs in Malaysia, and to draw them to the attention of the
Government through this debate. Some Christian communities in Malaysia
are now very much in fear of being able to practise their faith without
interference, or with limits on their ability to observe their faith in
peace.</hs_Para>

Malaysia fear persecution because they have been banned from using the
word “Allah”, which has been used as terminology for God
in Malay for centuries. That has effectively meant that in some parts
of Malaysia the Bible has been outlawed. When a concern was
raised—or an attempt was made to raise it—in the state
legislative assembly in Sarawak, it was ruled out of order and sub
judice, so the legitimate concerns of Sarawak Christians about the
Malaysia agreement that governs the relationship stretching back 50
years between the peninsula and other parts of Malaysia, have
effectively been censured.</hs_Para>

freedom of religion is supposedly guaranteed by article 11 of the
Malaysian constitution, the reality for many is quite different. In his
introduction to the debate, the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim
Shannon) referred—I think in the context of Nigeria—to
Christian children being whipped. It has come to my attention that
there are significant reports of Christian children being whipped for
eating pork, and of Christian children who have to board in state
schools because of where they live being forced to convert to Islam.
Last month the Malaysian Government’s religious affairs
department, which is part of the Prime Minister’s office,
reportedly issued a sermon to be read in every mosque in Malaysia,
condemning supposedly liberal forces undermining Islam. The implication
taken by many people in Malaysia was that it was aimed at those who
practise the Christian
faith.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000322" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000322">With
Portuguese, Spanish and indeed British colonial influences, it is not
surprising that there is a significant Christian community in Malaysia.
They have co-existed with others, perfectly happily, for many years
since independence more than 50 years ago, but Christians in Malaysia
now fear that the country may be embarking on a dangerous path. The
Minister for Islamic Affairs in Sarawak, Daud Abdul Rahman, has called
for members of the Sarawak Islamic religious department to be upgraded
to become a sharia prosecution department, and to be supplied with
firearms. According to “Free Malaysia Today”, he
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13120365000459" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000459">“With

Sarawak.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13120365000323" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000323">There
is real concern that such behaviour has relatively little to do with
religion or the tolerance and understanding that religion can often
promote, but that it is about seeking to create supporters who identify
with one 
<?notus-xml column=863?>political party as pro-Islam, and brand their political opponents as
anti-Islam. That is a dangerous road to take, because it unleashes
mindless aggression, prejudice and fear. The non-Muslims of east
Malaysia are right to be fearful of where that might lead next.
Shocking situations can arise when countries of mixed religions and
races allow and encourage the development of extremism and prejudice,
even in our modern world.</hs_Para>

it is concerning that a region such as the middle east, once so widely

concerns I raised when the Pew Research Centre recently briefed our
group on its latest figures on religious persecution across the world,
either by Government or by local populations, was that sometimes it is
surely neither Government nor local populations that start the problem,
but insidious third-party forces that operate across national
boundaries in a global fashion in pursuit of their own, often extreme,
religious ideologies. We have to think about how we deal with this
growing phenomenon—fed, in this modern age, by the internet, as
well as by determined preachers on the
ground.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000341" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000341">Today’s
debate asks us to focus on the plight of Christian communities across
the world, but I think this leads us to considering a much wider
picture of persecution of all kinds of faith and, indeed, of those who
wish to live without faith. Homing in on one kind of persecution might
help us to consider what could be done for other faiths, too. As the
Archbishop of Canterbury said recently after the tragic bombings of
Christian churches in
Peshawar:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13120365000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000462">“We

we are discovering as the all-party group continues its work, almost
every faith is persecuted somewhere in the world, and we must all stand

everyone to choose their faith or none—and, indeed, to change
their mind if they

the problem has been outlined very well by previous speakers. Some 200
million Christians are under severe risk of persecution, with many
thousands killed every year and ethnically cleansed from their towns
and homeland. Some 50,000 Christians have been cleared from the city of
Homs in Syria during the civil war. In Eritrea people are being
imprisoned on a regular basis. In Sudan before it was partitioned, over
a 30-year period 2 million Christians were killed by the regime. That
is the scale of the problem.</hs_Para>

even today. Within the last month, hundreds of people, from Nigeria to
Eritrea to Kazakhstan to China, have been arrested and put in prison
simply because of their faith, and when they go into prison they are
denied due process. They are denied access to lawyers. They are
sometimes even denied knowledge of the charges facing them. They can

can go beyond the Islamic countries to Korea, where 70,000 Christians
languish in prison, some of them in the most horrible conditions. I do
not want to start telling lots of individual stories, but one struck me
in particular. We found in Northern Ireland during the troubles that
people can get numbed by numbers—they come to be seen as just
statistics, rather than as highlighting the real suffering behind
them—but 6,000 Christians are languishing in prison No. 15 in
North Korea. They are regularly brought out on a Sunday, and two people
are selected and paraded in front of the rest of their fellow
Christians, stabbed with pointed bamboos and called on to renounce
their faith because then the torture will then stop. Many of them, of
course, finish up being murdered because they will not renounce their
faith. Leaving aside the huge numbers, that is the kind of horror and
individual human suffering we are talking
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000351" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000351">As
the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) said, when the
Nazis carried out such acts in concentration camps we pursued the
prison guards and those responsible to the ends of the earth, to
prosecute them and to make sure they were brought to justice, yet it
seems there is not the same response when it comes to the persecution
of Christians. That is not just to do with the Government, of course.
It is to do with the media, too. I thought it was striking that when 80
Christians were blown up at the beginning of November as they worshiped
in Pakistan, the BBC found it so important that it came below the Emmy
awards in the news agenda. That seems to be the level of seriousness
that is attached to such issues.</hs_Para>

reasons for that sort of response is that, in many instances, such
persecution is actually sponsored, sanctioned and encouraged by the
Governments of the 
<?notus-xml column=867?>countries concerned. We have already heard the Grand Mufti of Saudi
Arabia calling for the destruction of all Christian churches on the
peninsula. Human Rights Watch has said that the most dangerous place
for a person to be a Christian today is Pakistan, and that much of that
persecution is sanctioned by the Government there. A lot of the
persecution of Christians in Nigeria is fomented by official
sources—and so it goes on around the world. When we point to and
specify the persecution of Christians, perhaps we are actually pointing
the finger at Governments who, possibly for political reasons, we
sometimes need as allies, and at Governments who, for commercial
reasons, we need as trade partners. If that is the reason we are not
prepared to be specific about this persecution, it is a great shame on
the Government of our
country.</hs_Para>

MacNeil:</Member></B> Although we have our concerns about persecution,
perhaps we should be highlighting good practice where it occurs. There
are indeed Islamic countries that are tolerant, and perhaps we should
hold up the examples of Senegal, Bangladesh and Turkey, where there is
a lot more tolerance compared with the societies we are concentrating
on. We should make it clear that there are examples of Islamic states
in which we would all be quite happy to

can and should be done? I know this is a debate about what the
Government should do, but the media have a responsibility. Where such
unpleasant things are happening, they should be given proper coverage
that is communicated to the wider world. Baroness Warsi said in
Georgetown last month that it is important that we get an international
coalition against such abuses, and that includes not just Governments
but journalists, judges and all the people who can bring to the notice
of the world the abuses taking place, do something about them, and deal
with those engaged in them.</hs_Para>

mentioned, we give aid to many of these countries. I do not accept the
argument that, by denying aid to them, we in some way disadvantage the
people who live there. If that were the case, we would not impose
sanctions anywhere, because there will always be people who are
disadvantaged by sanctions. If the aid is going to a Government who are
engaged in and supporting these practices, it is particularly easy to
make it clear that no further aid will be given. As has been said,
sometimes this is not a question of physical persecution but of
economic or educational discrimination. When we think about how we
spend our aid money, perhaps it should be targeted at persecuted
groups.</hs_Para>

talked about the ability of the Commonwealth to put pressure on the
Governments of countries across the world over which we have some
influence, where these abuses take place. This requires a concerted

Chishti</B> (Gillingham and Rainham) (Con):</Member> It is a real
pleasure and a privilege to follow the hon. Member for East Antrim
(Sammy Wilson). I pay tribute to the Democratic Unionist party for
choosing this important topic for debate. I come from a Muslim
background, and my father was an imam. When I saw that the topic was
“Persecution of Christians in the 21st
century”, I knew that it was absolutely right and proper to have
a debate on that subject. It is important for the world to realise that
persecution goes on. I was speaking to a good friend of mine, the
former Bishop of Rochester, Michael Nazir-Ali, about this, and he told
me that the persecution of Christians was taking place in more than 130
of the 190 countries in the world at the moment. That is completely and
utterly unacceptable; it is a very sad state of affairs.</hs_Para>

thinking about which area to focus on in the debate, it was difficult
for me to decide because the persecution is so widespread. When it is
taking place in more than 130 countries, which country should I pick? I
narrowed it down and chose a country that I know well. I was born in
Pakistan and had the great privilege, pleasure and honour of serving as
an adviser to the former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto. She wanted
reform, but she lost her life. She wanted a progressive Pakistan, but
the radicalisation elements and certain others did not
agree.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000361">That
is why, when I saw the topic for the debate, I had to choose Pakistan
as the subject of my speech. The persecution of Christians is a major
problem there, and I want to focus on the blasphemy laws. I recently

experience in his own country. Does he accept that when Muslims stand

Chishti:</Member></B> I know more than many others about that issue. I
lost my good friend Benazir Bhutto to radicalisation. She was two weeks
away from winning an election, after which things could have changed.
We had discussed reforming the blasphemy laws, but she was never able
to do that. That is the problem in Pakistan, and the hon. Gentleman has
highlighted it very well. The governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, had
raised the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian. She is a 46-year-old mother
of six children, and she is still in prison in Pakistan. She was
supposed to be pardoned by the President in 2010, but owing to pressure
from the radical right, she was never freed. That was totally
unacceptable. Pope Benedict said that what was happening to her was
unacceptable and called for her release. However, she is still in
prison in Pakistan and facing the death penalty. People in Pakistan
stand up for her, but they know what the dangers are.</hs_Para>

does not mean that the Government of Pakistan cannot stand up and do
the right thing by repealing a bad law. That bad law is the blasphemy
law, and the abuse of that law must be dealt with. It is used to settle
disputes between one neighbour and another, under sections that were
brought in between 1980 and 1986 by General Zia, who was himself a
radical. He was an extremist, and he introduced a section that stated
that anyone who defamed the Prophet had to be killed. That is totally
unacceptable. Those sections of the blasphemy law that were brought in
during the Zia era are bad law and they have to go. The Pakistan
Government could and should do that, but, as has been mentioned,
Governments themselves face certain pressures. They can stand up, as
the Minister with responsibility for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, a
Christian, did. He said that this law was wrong, but what happened to
him? He was killed. What happened to Salman Taseer, the Governor of
Punjab? He said it was wrong and he was killed. So we have to
understand the difficulties for Governments in changing these laws, but
they have to change them.</hs_Para>

criticism. What my hon. Friend is touching on is important, in that it
is about the pressure of culture on governance? That is present in not
only Pakistan, but in a number of Arab countries. It makes it difficult
for Governments who would like to respond in the manner that we would
all wish, but they cannot because they are frightened, sometimes to

Pakistan that it led to the death of his friend Benazir Bhutto. In some

repealing the blasphemy laws in Pakistan, because that may take time,
what can we do now to push the Government of Pakistan to deal with
those laws? Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States has made
comments that are similar to my view, as has Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali.
He says, and I say, that, first, these laws should not be dealt with by
the lower courts in Pakistan, because they are more susceptible to
corruption and intimidation by religious groups in the communities;
secondly, that specialised prosecutors should deal with blasphemy laws
in that country; and, thirdly, that specific judges have to deal with
blasphemy laws. When I was on a flight from Karachi to Islamabad last
year, I met 12 high court judges and a supreme court judge
there. I asked them whether I could raise certain points with them and
they said that I could. I then asked whether I could raise the point
about the blasphemy laws in Pakistan and they said of course I could.
However, when I asked why the blasphemy laws were abused in Pakistan,
the high court judges said to me, “No blasphemy law is abused in
Pakistan.” If that is the mentality of judges at the high court
in Pakistan, what hope does anyone have of justice in that country?
That is why I say that specific judges trained to deal with blasphemy
issues should deal with these cases.</hs_Para>

thing that should happen is that there should be a body in the Ministry
of Interior and Narcotics Control that authorises prosecutions, because
in that way the process would not be subject to intimidation at any
local level. If allegations are made, cases would have to go to a
specific cell in that Ministry that deals with blasphemy laws and if it
gives authorisation, a charge should follow. In that way, we could deal
with some abuses that are going on at the moment. That would
go some way to dealing with such cases, but other people may have other
suggestions for dealing with them.</hs_Para>

another way of addressing this issue. President Zardari could have done
it in 2010. I know that well because I raised it with him, but he was
not able to pardon Asia Bibi. We are all entitled to have our own
separate faiths and beliefs but let us think about Asia Bibi. She is 46
and has five children and has been languishing in prison for four
years. She was condemned to death by a lower court, not knowing whether
her appeal would come through. Is that a civilised world? Is that right
and proper if it happened to one of us or someone we loved? Absolutely
not. The Government of Pakistan under a new President and Prime
Minister have a moral obligation to do the right thing and ensure that
Asia Bibi is released and
pardoned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000373" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000373">Finally,
when those who are persecuted for their faith seek asylum in another
country, they should be given priority. Someone being persecuted in
that way could be taken outside and shot under the blasphemy laws, so
giving priority to those who are seeking asylum and who have been
persecuted on grounds of their faith is the right way
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13120365000491" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000491">6

are here to discuss a situation that is beyond doubt. There is no
question that Christians are the most persecuted single group in the
world today on grounds of religion. It is one thing to talk about
persecution and to list the horrors, but when one thinks of Christians
in this century, in this very year, being crucified in Iraq, we realise
the depth of sheer horror that we are looking at. Dedolence is not an
emotion that usually informs this House. The emotion that most of us

sort.</hs_Para>

to focus my remarks on one small area, and that is the area of Iraq. My
hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown) and I, with
our good friend Emmanuel Yacoub from the Assyrian Democratic Movement,
visited Iraq quite recently. It was an extraordinary and overwhelming
emotion to be standing in the desert that nurtured the Desert Fathers,
to be in the plains of Nineveh, to see the tomb of the Prophet Nahum,
and to be in the area where Christianity first found its feet and grew.
If Armenia was the first ever Christian country in the year 301, the
Christian history in the middle east is so deep that it goes back to
the birth and the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hs_Para>

the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) visited the area
immediately before us. He has spoken on the matter far more eloquently
and powerfully than ever I could. One does not have to be a genius to
areolate the future of Iraq. A country that once had a Christian
population the size of Northern Ireland now has a Christian population
less than that of the borough of Ealing. Many of the people who have
left, particularly those who served the British as the Iraqi
levies—I think of the great families in my own constituency of
the Khorshabas, the Michaels and the Jasos and the family of my good
friends Jenie and Isaac Asia—gave an enormous amount to the
British. Talking about targeting assistance and help at Christian
communities simply identifies them and makes them a target in the other
sense of the word, and many of the Christian communities in Iraq are
already
targeted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000378">It
was a tradition of the British during imperial times to work with a
particular group of people. One might think of the Tamils in Sri Lanka,
and particularly of the Christian communities such as the Chaldean
Assyrians in Iraq. They worked loyally and faithfully with the British
and we promised them at that time that they would be free to practise
their religion. Sadly, that is not the case.</hs_Para>

of us are overwhelmed by the immensity and the horror and we wonder
what best we can do. The hon. Member for Strangford probably said the
most important thing, and I make this point extremely seriously. There
is one thing we must do. We must assist wherever we can financially and
materially and we must raise the profile, but we must never, ever
forget to pray for our 
<?notus-xml column=872?>fellow co-religionists. The power of prayer is immense and it has an
incredible force. Let us never forget suffering Christians in our

question of Iraq, I would like seriously to suggest to the Minister
that we consider supporting the idea of an autonomous Christian
district in northern Iraq on the Nineveh plains, particularly in the
Tel Kaif and Al-Hamdaniya area. That has been suggested for many
years—they are ancient Christian Assyrian Chaldean
lands—but they would not be exclusively for Christians. It has
been said over and over again that this will be for the local community
and would allow a breathing space for Christians. It would allow that
simple, basic right to worship our shared God in the place of God. Why
can we not support that?</hs_Para>

attacked with a suicide bomb outside his house. That did not happen in

that a strange argument is emerging that Christian communities were
safer during what is still called “Saddam time” in Iraq.
That is a false argument. There might not have been slaughter on the
streets, but when the dictator runs a dictatorship no one is free and
the Christians who were tolerated one day could be slaughtered the
next, so please let no one make the case that, under Assad or Saddam
Hussein, it was somehow a golden period for Christians. It might have

Galloway and I have and felt the chill fear that abounds in those hot,
burning desert sands will know that we cannot stand by and do nothing.
We must support these people. This is the land where Christ’s

all that my good friend the hon. Member for Ealing North (Stephen
Pound) has said and support the comments on Assyria. I do not know
whether you managed to get some rest on Sunday, Mr Speaker, and watch
once again on BBC4 the excellent French film entitled “Of Gods
and Men”. It is a very beautiful film about the appalling murder
of six Benedictine monks in the Atlas mountains. It is such a moving
film because there is one scene in which Father Christian confronts one
of the terrorists—the same terrorist who ultimately decapitates
him and his fellow monks. Father Christian starts reading from the
Koran in Arabic and quotes directly the passages that exhort all
Muslims to be peaceful to other religions. The terrorist completes the 
<?notus-xml column=873?>verse. That makes most powerfully the point that we should make in this
debate: in practising our own religion, in no way do we diminish the
practice of other religions or people’s ability to practise
their religion in any way they
wish.</hs_Para>

part in every one of these debates, and I have heard this Foreign
Office speech many times before. Dare I say that I do not detect a
sense of burning anger about what is happening to Christians? This is
something that has increased, and it is one of the most terrible things
happening in the world today. Of course we should regret, attack and be
angry about any persecution of any religion. The hon. Member for
Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) mentioned that Christians were persecuted
in 105 countries, or their human rights were somehow limited, but she
immediately tried to be relative—I think that there is a danger
of relativism in this debate—and said that there were 101
countries where Muslims had their rights affected. That may be strictly
true, but the fact of the matter is that the overwhelming number of
really violent and dangerous persecutions, killings and denials of
human rights are directed at Christians, which is why we should
congratulate the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon), who
continues, year on year, to raise the issue. It is down to the DUP, not
the Conservative Government or the Labour Opposition, that this debate

persecution of Christians. My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury,
speaking with all the authority of his office, and everyone who has
taken part in this debate demand that the Government take this more
seriously and speak out more powerfully. 
<?notus-xml column=874?>There was an appalling case in All Saints church in Peshawar in which

because tens of thousands have fled. When I was in Mosul, in ancient
Nineveh, Christians were being murdered and dozens of families were
fleeing. Where did they flee to? They fled to Syria. What did we have a

claim that they have in no way armed them—they are not also
leeching support and armaments to the bad rebels? There have been
appalling examples of persecution in Syria. Mass graves have been found
in the village of Sadad, where 46 Christians were murdered and where a
family of six—this is just one family—were blindfolded
and shot in the head. A 26-year-old, Ninar Odisho, was shot in the

Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) for introducing this motion, along
with his party, the DUP, on the persecution of Christians in the 21st
century. This afternoon’s debate has been reflective and
instructive. Many Members have spoken with a great deal of knowledge
about the persecution of Christians, and not only in the middle east,
but further afield. My hon. Friends the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)

opposed to the persecution not only of Christians but of all religious
groups; this debate should not reflect sectarian or sectional attitudes
or principles. However, we must recognise that Christians have been
persecuted in the middle east and in other parts of the world. As the
former Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister, the right hon. Member
for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt), said, this has a lot to do
with cultures and Governments. There is a need to change the opinions
of cultures and Governments to persuade people that it is not right to
burn Coptic churches in Egypt, to massacre Christians in Sudan and in
Pakistan, or to burn people out of their homes because of their
religion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120365000402" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120365000402">It
is particularly significant and poignant that we are discussing this
issue at the time of Advent as we approach Christmas—the birth

Christianity was born but where the number of Christians is dwindling
as they are being forced out.</hs_Para>

and regrettably, none of us needs to apologise for focusing on the
issue of Christian persecution or to qualify why we are doing so,
because the scale and nature of that persecution throughout the world
this century is appalling. Some years ago we might have been able to

of their status as a minority and argued that their human rights needed
to be respected and that we needed to do much more to protect them.

should be a litmus test of other human rights. It should not be picked
off as simply one among many human rights that we need to debate, as
the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy),
suggested. We need to hold the Minister and the Government to account
every time they attend trade delegations and visit other countries, and

the short time that I have left, I want to welcome the speech by
Baroness Warsi on 16 November in Washington, which has been referred
to, in which she said that persecution is the biggest challenge we face
in the 21st century. She called it a “global crisis”. If,
as we hear, Christianity is the most persecuted religion on earth, 80%
of religious persecution is suffered by Christians, Christianity is at
risk of eradication in countries across the globe and the situation is
worsening, the persecution of Christianity and Christians is a global
crisis. That 
<?notus-xml column=880?>crisis needs a co-ordinated international response and the British
Government should take a much stronger lead in that. Having sat through
the whole debate, I believe that that view is shared by many
colleagues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0003.htm#13120374000010">We

am disappointed that no Minister from the Department for International
Development has been here throughout the debate. I was also
disappointed that no DFID Minister attended the recent Westminster Hall
debate on the persecution of Christians in the middle east. If, as this
Minister says, we should be providing resources to address this issue,
that ought to be something that DFID Ministers are considering. DFID
should be prioritising this in its aid provision. It has recognised
that girls, women and whole communities can benefit from education, and
it needs to wake up to the fact that if we defend and strengthen
people’s right to practise their faith and live in a more
peaceful society, it will produce a more productive and flourishing
society for all, whatever faith is being defended and supported. I
therefore ask DFID to consider seriously how it will respond to the
motion.</hs_Para>

why there has not yet been adequate involvement on the part of those
involved in development work. Perhaps it is due to a misplaced fear of
that involvement being confused with proselytising, or being seen as
being biased or as promoting western colonialism. That is political
correctness of the worst kind, because people’s lives and
livelihoods are at stake. I challenge DFID to review its policies. In
the Westminster Hall debate I asked the Minister of State, Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr
Swire), to do that, and he said that we had the “Faith
Partnership Principles” document. But that does not address the
issue. Will DFID please do

other religious groups but aided by Governments and authorities in
various parts of the world. The hon. Member for Gillingham and Rainham

him for his helpful and thoughtful contribution. I also agree
wholeheartedly with the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)
that right hon. and hon. Members who have taken part in the debate
believe that civil and religious liberties are not for some but for

18 of the universal declaration of human rights emphasises the right to
have certain freedoms, and I was just thinking what an amazing thing
freedom is. It was what our fathers and forefathers fought and died

that my right hon. and hon. Friends tabled this motion for debate

apology whatsoever that the motion focuses directly on a group of
people worldwide who are increasingly becoming isolated and are
constantly under attack for their simple faith in Jesus Christ. The sad
reality is that one Christian is killed for their faith every 11
minutes somewhere on earth, and many Governments remain totally silent
about that situation. It is our desire to highlight the persecution of
Christians not only in far off regions of the world, but in Europe and
our own land. The list from Open Doors was helpful and gives the top 50
countries where the persecution of Christians happens for religious
reasons. That certainly helps our understanding and points to the
number of places where such persecution is going on.</hs_Para>

influence of Islamic extremists, and we are now witnessing an increase
in the persecution of Christians, which is shown in many different
ways. For some it is a violent attack from Islamic groups, such as the
looting and burning to the ground of a Pentecostal church in Algeria.
There are kidnappings of Christians for ransom in Egypt, public
lashings for those practising Christianity in Saudi Arabia, and
crucifixions in Iraq—we could go on, as that is only the tip of
the iceberg of what we know. Sadly, the persecution of Christians is
not debated often on the Floor of the House.</hs_Para>

countries where Christians are a minority, persecutions are perpetrated
at both state and community level. Indeed, through the intensity of
that persecution, the existence of a small Christian community is often
threatened, with many feeling they have no choice but to flee to safety
somewhere else. For many, however, there is nowhere they can safely
go—they cannot afford to go anywhere else.</hs_Para>

Minister winds up, we must recognise that the persecution of Christians
is going on in countries that receive financial aid from many Christian
taxpayers in the United Kingdom. When we think of
£1.325 billion to Ethiopia between 2010 and 2015,
£1.392 billion to Pakistan for that period, £1 billion to
Bangladesh, £1 billion to Nigeria, £710
million to Afghanistan, and £643 million to Tanzania,

there is persecution of Christians.</hs_Para>

always remember that persecution does not only happen somewhere else,
because charity starts at home. Many Christians in the United Kingdom
feel isolated at this time, and for many in this House, if they 
<?notus-xml column=883?>openly profess their faith in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour,
they witness the rolling of eyes, or disbelief that somehow today we
really believe the Bible is the word of God, and we are scorned and
ridiculed for that. As a believer, I unashamedly say that I do believe
that the Bible is God’s precious word. I am guided in my public
life, as well as in my private life, by the word of God. In our
country, there are many sad instances of persecution of street
preachers—even carol singers are under attack because of certain
legislation that is, or has been, proposed.</hs_Para>

this has been an impassioned debate outlining many of the horrors and
persecutions suffered by Christians around the world. The situations in
numerous countries have been raised, and the simple fact is that
Christians are persecuted more than any other faith group in the world.
The nature of this persecution can take many different forms and the
perpetrators vary from Governments to militant groups to even a
person’s own family. Faith is often used as a proxy for other
divisions, as religious fault lines are exploited.</hs_Para>

absolutely clear to the House: the Government are not silent and the
Government are not quiet. When Christians are persecuted, we, as
Government Ministers, speak out clearly and forcefully. I cannot stress
enough how seriously the Foreign and Commonwealth Office takes this
issue, as part of our commitment to freedom of religion around the
world. Promoting respect for human rights is at the very heart of the
Government’s foreign policy. Where Christians or any religious
believers are victims of persecution, we will condemn the violence and
ask the relevant authorities to ensure that justice is served. There
can be and should be no impunity for those who persecute individuals on
the basis of religion or belief.</hs_Para>

East. That point was made powerfully in the wonderful speech by my hon.

private, and to share it with others. It also includes the right to
change one’s religion and to have no religion at

right to freedom of religion or belief should be a priority for all
countries. We, along with EU partners, sponsor a resolution at the UN
twice every year on this subject. We have also agreed guidelines on the
promotion of the right to freedom of religion or belief with EU
partners. These guidelines are already helping the embassies of all EU
member states to promote and protect the freedom of religion or belief

countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000044">A

Members have raised the issue of Nigeria, with particular reference to
Boko Haram. By far the highest numbers killed by Boko Haram are
Muslims, not Christians, and this includes senior Muslim clerics and
anyone who stands up against its extremist ideology. We have
consistently encouraged, and will continue to do so, the Government of
Nigeria to protect all their citizens and to promote a dialogue between
communities at different levels, as indeed I saw and participated in
myself in Kaduna, earlier this year. It is important to distinguish
between the age-old competition for land and resources between farmers
and nomadic herders and the terrorism occurring in the north-east.
Nigeria is a traditionally tolerant country.</hs_Para>

recognises and prioritises this matter not just as a problem, but as an
issue on which we must work to find solutions. Other ministerial

wherever and whenever it occurs, as do our ambassadors and high

their families. It represents a real blow to working people and

being hit hard by the financial crisis since 2008, Newry and the
surrounding area has great economic potential to harness north-south
business development. Significant steps taken under the “Newry
Vision” programme have bolstered the private sector, and
consideration has been given to where public-private partnerships can
be effective. The Newry area, given its strategic location on the
Belfast-Dublin corridor, has been identified as a vital economic hub
within the Northern Ireland regional development strategy. As has been

it is critical for the balance and sustainability of the local economy
that these public sector jobs be maintained. Indeed, with 12 public

under-represented in public sector jobs in Northern Ireland, and
removing them would put severe pressure on the whole local economy,
including the private sector. Only last week, I was told that staff

of voluntary exits for staff cannot be euphemistically explained away
by the normal rhetoric of “modernisation and
streamlining”. It represents the wholesale removal of vital
face-to-face and personal tax services, and a distinct refashioning of
the link between people and revenue collection. My hon. Friend the

are under discussion. Recent immigrants, the poor, the elderly and the

Treasury has claimed, through statements to the media and in written
answers here, that it is not closing down these centres, but the
voluntary exits that are being offered surely amount to a de facto
closure. These exit offers are a clear statement of intent, and the
closure of the sites, which the Treasury has seemingly made inevitable,
will almost certainly increase the pressure on staff to accept the
terms on offer. I am deeply concerned about this tactic of offering
exit packages before proper, full consultations and impact assessments
have been carried out on the closures. It is deeply cynical to hang
this uncertainty over the heads of the staff at the same time as
offering a redundancy package.</hs_Para>

therefore like the Minister to clarify the terms on which these exits
are being carried out. I would also like clarification on the future of
the Newry centre, which dealt with 500,000 queries and cases over the
past year. Such clarification will include a time scale for the future
strategy for staffing and operations in Northern Ireland. The Minister
needs to address why there has been no equality impact assessment, as
required under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and as
produced for the initial proposal in 1998. Why has there been no
consultation with staff, unions or, apparently, the Northern Ireland
Executive? Did the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern
Ireland make any representations as far back as March or April, when
there were some intimations that this might happen? Have they received

circumstances in the past, the Treasury has sought ministerial approval
from the Northern Ireland Executive, as well as a full equality impact
assessment and stakeholder consultation. This new approach of offering
voluntary exits before this process has begun is deeply worrying,
particularly given the devastating impact this closure could have on
the local community and economy. There are very real equality issues
relating to the closure of this centre, as it is mostly the lower paid,
disabled and part-time staff and women who will be most vulnerable and
will find it the hardest to get new work; a higher proportion of women
will be affected. I also have to point out that the three centres being
closed are all in predominantly nationalist constituencies, which could
bring its own equality
implications.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000086">Before
following through with these measures in Northern Ireland, I would also
be grateful if the Minister could include more information on the pilot
study carried out in the north of England on the introduction 
<?notus-xml column=891?>of the reformed service. Critical questions are outstanding on the
capacity of non-face-to-face and reduced personal tax services to deal
with the range of queries that these centres deal with daily. How long
will people have to wait on hold to have their inquiry heard? How many
cases took more than one call to resolve? How many required a
subsequent face-to-face meeting? What was the experience of people and
businesses using the new system, and how much will it cost them? There
is a clear onus on the Treasury to provide this information before
coming to any decision on removing the existing centres. Instead we get
the impression of a Department that has made its decision and will find
the appropriate reasons from
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000087">More
broadly, we know that tax evasion and avoidance cost the public purse
an astronomical amount every year, and that is surely only likely to
rise with the closure of local compliance centres. With tax evasion and
avoidance costing our economy more than £100 billion
a year, HMRC should be expanding rather than cutting offices and staff.
Surely the Treasury should be looking at how local tax centres can be
adequately resourced and given the scope to take on some of these
functions. Indeed, initially we were led to believe the Newry centre
would be retained and would assume further responsibility for some
cross-border issues, including compliance and tax co-operation with
Irish authorities—where better to locate a cross-border taxation
co-operation centre than Newry in the context of the development of
north-south business links? I am disappointed that that no longer seems
to be the case. I would like the Minster to explain what consideration
he has given to this. Will he take a more constructive
approach?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000088">This
Government never tire of telling us of their desire to rebuild and
rebalance the economy in Northern Ireland. The message sent out by the
decision to remove jobs from the Newry HMRC centre sharply contradicts
that, as there are simply not jobs available for these people to move
into. Instead, this decision will remove money from the local economy,
hitting not just those families directly involved, but businesses
across the whole area. I ask the Minister, who has been generous with
his time on previous occasions, to hold further meetings with local
politicians, the Public and Commercial Services Union and
representatives in Newry to look at a constructive solution. I am sure
that my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle would join us at such a

absolutely certain that a viable, economically sound centre can be
retained that protects local jobs, perhaps through a centre that also

people in 21 locations to apply for a voluntary exit. That included
more than 130 people in Custom House in Newry. The invitation gives
people the option to leave HMRC if that fits with their life choices,

I go into detail on the voluntary exits and what it means for staff in
Newry and other offices, it is important to explain the context. HMRC
is reshaping itself to become a more modern, flexible and
cost-effective organisation that can deliver better, more personalised
services for customers at the same time as increasing tax revenues from
compliance. Like other Departments, it has to deliver that within
ever-tighter fiscal
constraints.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000093">HMRC
has been steadily reducing in size since it was formed in 2005. Over
the past eight years, it has cut its staff from around 97,000 full-time
equivalent people to just under 63,000 FTEs at the end of October 2013.
It has reduced its estate by more than 200 offices, and is now more
concentrated in urban centres. It has done that while improving service
and increasing yield. Since HMRC was created, it has more than doubled
its compliance yield and delivered major projects, including Real Time
Information. During 2012-13, it brought pay-as-you-earn up to date for
the first time, answered 75.2% of the calls made to its contact
centres—hitting 90% during the last six months of the
year—and, for the first time since HMRC was formed, cleared more
than 80% of customer post within 15
days.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000094">HMRC
has committed to reducing its work force from 63,000 FTEs today to
54,000 by the end of 2014-15 and then to 52,000 by the end of 2015-16.
Although retirements, resignations and people reducing their working
hours will deliver some of those work force reductions, they will not
be sufficient if HMRC is to achieve its work force target. HMRC has
always made it clear to its staff that it was likely that voluntary
exits would be needed and that is what it announced last month.
Targeted groups of staff will be asked to consider whether a voluntary
exit is right for them. People in those groups might be in roles that
are needed less and less because of new ways of working, including
increased automation and the fact that some administrative work has
dried up. Others are in locations where, according to all the
indications, one, some or all lines of business in HMRC are unlikely to
be based in the medium to long term.</hs_Para>

specifics of the announcement will, I appreciate, come as a shock or
surprise to many people, the reality is that HMRC will continue to
contract its work force. That has long been known by staff and many
have been waiting to find out where that contraction will take place.
Indeed, the hon. Member for South Down acknowledged that there has been
uncertainty in Newry for some time.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120374000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000096">The
background to the news is that in June 2011 HMRC announced that it
would be located in 16 key centres until at least 2020. Those centres
include Belfast. Newry was one of most of the other offices in which
HMRC said that it would be located until at least 2015. As HMRC reduces
in size, it will need to continue to bring together its people in
larger sites where they can 
<?notus-xml column=893?>work more flexibly and to reduce its footprint to be more
cost-effective. Smaller offices will not be viable as overall numbers
reduce and the skills pool in smaller local communities will not
necessarily provide all the skills that HMRC needs when it needs them.
HMRC has therefore started to identify locations that do not fit
business needs in the medium to long term. In seven of the 21 locations
where people have been invited to apply for voluntary exit, one or more
lines of business intend to withdraw from the office in time. In the
other 14 offices, all of the lines of business wish to
withdraw. Newry is one of those
offices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000097">There
is not at present a proposal to close those offices, since HMRC is
honouring the commitment it made to staff in 2011 that they would stay
open until at least 2015. However, HMRC’s executive committee
took the view that staff should know that there might not be a
long-term future for those offices well in advance of any decision on
office closures, so that they can think about their options and start
planning their
futures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000098">The
voluntary exit scheme—I stress that it is entirely
voluntary—gives those staff who want to leave HMRC the
opportunity to do so on favourable financial terms. Some people will

compulsion on them to apply for a voluntary exit if they wish to stay,
but they have been given notice of the likely longer term picture for
their offices and will ultimately need to consider their future after
2015. HMRC will not be closing Newry or any of the offices where it
invited people to consider applying for a voluntary exit before April
2015, in line with the picture it gave in 2012 about how long it would
be based in current
locations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120374000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/debtext/131203-0004.htm#13120374000101">I

not feature in HMRC’s long-term plans, but as long as there are
people in the office, HMRC will not break its previous commitment that
no occupied office will close before April 2015. HMRC follows a tried
and tested process in these circumstances. If and when there is a
proposal to close the office, consultation will be undertaken with

made earlier in this Parliament that Newry will be open at least until
2015. A final decision will be made only after consultation, as I have
outlined. I do not wish in any way to hide from the
point—indeed, HMRC has been very clear about this—that
HMRC does not see Newry having a future in the long term. The final
decision as to when any closure would take place will be made, as I
have said, after consultation. The choice for HMRC in the circumstances
is to try to conceal that and leave things to the last minute or to try
to be as open as possible, engage with staff and provide opportunities
at an early stage for those who might want to leave voluntarily with a
severance package.</hs_Para>

is going in the direction of concentration on larger urban offices that
have the flexibility to operate. Included in those larger urban offices
is Belfast. He tempts me to speculate on future policy matters in the
devolution of tax, but I want to make it clear that this is not a

quickly with the issue of the equality impact assessment, which is an
important matter raised by the hon. Member for South Down? The equality
position has been considered, and it has been concluded that there is
unlikely to be a disproportionate impact on any of the protected
equality groups as a result of the voluntary exit schemes.
Consequently, completion of an equality impact assessment is
unnecessary. A people impact assessment has been completed, however,

appropriate mitigating action will be taken to eliminate those

inquiry centre, which is only a small part of what is currently
undertaken in Newry. With regard to the inquiry centre pilot in the
north-east of England, HMRC will decide in January 2014 whether to roll
out that service and move away from inquiry centres and face-to-face
services and towards a telephone service with additional enhanced
support for vulnerable people. HMRC remains committed to providing
face-to-face support for those who need it in future, including in
Newry and across Northern Ireland. If we decide to roll out the new
service next year, HMRC believes that it will provide that face-to-face
support in a way that is more flexible and accessible to

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T09:30:17"></hs_TimeCode>I am delighted
to have secured a debate on future ships for the Royal Navy. That may
seem an odd subject, considering that the Queen Elizabeth-class
carriers will not be operational until 2020 and that the Type 26 global
combat ship, for which advance plans are in place, is not expected to
enter service until June 2022.</hs_Para>

development times for such vessels are long, and although the plans to
replace the Invincible-class carriers with the QE-class carriers were
made in 1997—16 years ago—and the green light to replace
the Type 23s with the global combat ship was given 15 years ago, the
first sheet of metal has yet to be cut.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T09:30:59"></hs_TimeCode>If we combine
that lengthy development period with, first, Britain’s
ever-evolving place and role in the world; secondly, the changing
threats and challenges that we face away from traditional
deep-blue-water engagements; and, finally, the seismic changes in
war-fighting technology, it makes perfect sense to ask what role the
Royal Navy should play in the future and how it should be equipped to
perform that role.</hs_Para>

me take each of those points in turn. The previous strategic defence
and security review made it clear that, as a maritime nation, we will
retain significant global interests, with our prosperity, stability and
security largely dependent on access to the sea and the maintenance of
uninterrupted free trade. Having served in the armed forces, I would be
the first to support a large permanent military capability, but history
shows that that is a luxury that the nation cannot always afford. For
hundreds of years, the size of our armed forces has concertinaed, and
this decade will be no different. With defence spending falling from
about 4% of GDP in the cold war to 2% today, it is right that we
consider what the default size of our armed forces should be to allow
us to meet our national and international security obligations and to
respond, with or without our allies, to sizeable short-term
commitments.</hs_Para>

we cannot predict the future, we can say with some certainty that our
forces will be deployed. Thanks to modern, 24-hour news coverage, which
allows the nation to take a more proactive and vocal interest in the
type of interventionist engagements that we participate in—as
reflected in the recent vote on punitive intervention in
Syria—and to the fact that there is no appetite for repeating
the intervention challenges of Iraq and Afghanistan, we are likely to
be more selective about the engagements that our forces are committed
to. Future operations are likely to be multinational, light-footprint,
manageable and easy to extract—essentially, low-risk
entanglements—especially when mass is not 
<?notus-xml column=188?>immediately available or politically desirable.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T09:33:36"></hs_TimeCode>That bodes well

we will find the poorly governed or the ungoverned space that leads to
future conflicts—whether prompted by natural or man-made

the platforms that are about to come online, it could be argued that
almost all the kinetic operations that we have carried out recently

Afghanistan were conducted from carriers based in the Indian ocean,
while 40% of all allied sorties in the Libya campaign came from a

will not comment too much on those carriers, because I made my views
clear in my Royal United Services Institute report, but they will be

us to develop not only carrier strike, but a permanent expeditionary

leads me to the advances in war-fighting technology. The current
revolution in technology is changing the conduct of
warfare—arguably, to a far greater extent than the arrival of
the longbow at Agincourt, the Gatling gun in the US civil war or the
tank at the battle of Cambrai. Such so-called force multipliers give
the user greater war-fighting effect at an ever greater distance from
the target. Each new development moves the conduct of war into a new
chapter.</hs_Para>

growing British trade routes and
interests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T09:38:11"></hs_TimeCode>. We

but larger guns. In the last century, we saw the introduction of
submarines, aircraft carriers and torpedoes. With the technology coming
online today, tomorrow’s battles—wherever they
are—will be fought not just by those in the theatre of war, but,
arguably, by a similar number of operators hundreds of miles from the
battlefield, as unmanned warfare becomes the
norm<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T09:38:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000019">The
advanced systems coming online will transform the ability of all three
services to collect intelligence; to deter, or efficiently and
clinically to defeat, the enemy at range; and to blur the lines of
responsibility between the services. Operationally, we are only
beginning to appreciate that, as reflected in the Libya campaign, where
HMS Ocean, with a combat range of 8,000 miles, carried Apache
helicopters, with a combat range of 300 miles and armed with
Hellfire missiles, which have a range of 8 km. A stand-alone system was
temporarily placed on a platform, crossing service boundaries no less,
to assist with an objective.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T09:30:00"></hs_TimeCode> question I
therefore pose today is: could there be more of that ability to
modularise systems to meet the variety of tasks that we now require of
our fleet? That means challenging the Royal Navy’s desire for
all its ships to be permanently capable of high-end warfare
tasks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000020">The
Type 45 destroyer, for example, is a formidable ship, arguably the top
of its class in defending the skies at sea and attacking other ships.
It is, however, so high-spec that it cannot hit things on land, as
traditionally that has been the domain of the RAF and, latterly, the
sub-surface fleet. It is built for high-end and deep-blue warfare, yet
it spends 50% of its time conducting SDSR taskings, such as
counter-piracy and counter-drugs operations, and humanitarian
operations, such as those that we have recently seen in the
Philippines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000021">I
have no doubt that we need high-end capability, but that kinetic
capability must be able to harness the full spectrum of complex weapons
technology and take on future technologies by being more modular and
systems-based. I therefore very much welcome the fact that the lines
between the frigate and the destroyer are being blurred in the design
of the Type 26 global combat ship. I understand that it should be able
to fire Tomahawk missiles from the Sylver vertical launch system
A70 pods and that there is space on board for two Wildcat
helicopters and a number of rigid inflatables, as well as 40 Royal
Marine commandos. One does not need to be an able sea dog to recognise
how much more versatile the design will be. It will certainly be more
proficient in expeditionary warfare in the littoral
environment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000022">With
the detailed ship design yet to be agreed, will the Minister consider
increasing the size of the mission bay and deck to offer greater space
beyond that for the planned two helicopters? I stress the point:
whether manned or unmanned, the airborne capability extends 
<?notus-xml column=190?>the versatility of a vessel, from the high-end to the  soft
power influence, giving the ship vastly increased expeditionary
capability. We are now seeing unmanned aerial systems, or drones, to
use common language: the ScanEagle, the Fire Scout and Boeing’s
Hummingbird. They will be the norm in the skies; they will be a
permanent part of
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000023">I
will not go into the details about selected precision effects at range,
but I would encourage increased synergies in the complex weapons
systems employed by all three services. Is there any reason why Storm
Shadow cannot be fired from a ship or, indeed, Brimstone from a
Wildcat? Another example is the Mistral MBDA surface-to-air launch
system, which can be fired from helicopters or ships and is also
man-portable. That is a bit of kit that is versatile across all three
services—a great example of one system being shared across the
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000024">I
ask the Minister to recognise the convergence of interest in the battle
space and the challenges of the continued siloed approach to
procurement. I will cite one British example. The Fire Shadow, procured
by the British Army, is a surface-launched precision loitering missile
with a range of around 100 km. It is transported by trailer behind the
back of a 4-tonne lorry. There is no reason why such a cheap but
accurate bit of kit could not be modularised and placed, when required,
on board a ship. Heaven forbid, it could even be run by the Royal
Artillery, although perhaps that is a step too far. I believe that that
is the mindset that should dominate future joint effect—modular
systems covering all four phases of war that can be brought
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000025">As
the design for the Type 26 is consolidated, I offer two options: option
1, do we need all 13 of them to be of such high specifications, or
could, say, five of the eight have a more simplified design, where
tailored assets are assigned depending on the task at hand? On option
2, if we commissioned just eight Type 26s, we could use the additional
funds to procure 10 cheaper, larger modular ships with the deck and
mission space for a minimum of four rotor systems to effectively
conduct counter-piracy and counter-narcotics operations and defend home
waters and to excel at upstream engagement, stabilisation and
humanitarian
tasks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000026"><Member ContinuationText="Oliver Colvile" PimsId="5610" UID="13120347000188" xid="1110" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000188"><B>Oliver

Ellwood:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I commend him
for his work in supporting what goes on in Devonport. He is absolutely
right that ships can and often do work individually, but they might be
required to part of a larger flotilla or part of a taskforce, which
might include defending an aircraft carrier. Clearly, with a limited
number of platforms, that would be harder to do, so an increased number
of ships would make the job
easier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000028">The
types of role that the Type 26s could be engaged in—upstream
engagement, stabilisation and humanitarian tasks—are the very
things the SDSR is saying that we should be doing more of, to promote
Britain’s interests. I believe that such a design might even
allow the provision for an Army company strength to be based on board. 
<?notus-xml column=191?>Essentially, the ship could be a small moving location—a
sea-based platform for operations to be conducted
on land. In essence, it could act as a safe lily pad from which land
and sea-based assets could be safely deployed without the need for any
boots to be permanently on the ground. Such a ship would then free the
high-end ships for NATO, middle east, south Atlantic and nuclear
deterrent duties. Indeed, as my hon. Friend has just said, they would
be free to form part of a flotilla to protect our aircraft
carriers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000029">The
Minister will be aware that the surface fleet is coping—but only
just—with meeting its maritime obligations with 19 destroyers
and frigates, when 23 ships is the defence strategic direction mandated
standard. We are therefore taking an operational risk, and that is
managed, but option 2 would mitigate that risk. I urge the Minister to
gain some inspiration by looking at the United States littoral combat
ship, or the USS Freedom, a catamaran-style ship. The US is exploring
exactly the same more modular-based approach. The MOD wrote a joint
concept report colourfully entitled “Future ‘Black
Swan’ Class Sloop-of-War”, published in May last year,
which talks exactly about the concept of a far cheaper ship, with the
money invested instead in the systems that go on
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000030">As
we slowly approach the next SDSR, will the Minister look at one further
system that I believe would be game changing in the maritime
environment? The V-22 Osprey is a US multi-mission military tiltrotor
aircraft. It is an example of the large utility helicopters of the
future. It already operates on the US Wasp-class carrier and can fly
higher, faster and further, and it can of course land on the deck of
any frigate or destroyer. It would be able refuel our F-35s. Such a
system would have an enormous impact in the maritime environment. I
believe that leasing six from the United States, similarly to what we
did with the C-17s, would make logical
sense.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000031">In
conclusion, it has been said time and again that, no matter how
advanced, ships can only be in one place at a time. We have impressive
naval ships, but they remain very specific in their remit and too
siloed in harnessing systems from all services—and, of course,
there are only 19 of them. Our ships are conducting a number
international duties that they were not built to achieve. Looking
ahead, Britain must excel at influencing activities in the littoral
environment. I believe that that aim is best served by simpler and
cheaper platforms, where the sophistication and investment is focused
on the modular systems on board, rather than on the ship. I hope that I
speak for both sides of the House in paying tribute to all those who
serve in the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines. I offer my thoughts
today in the spirit of ensuring that the House considers how we can
best equip the Royal Navy in future in the lead-up to the next

considering future and current vessels, one must consider future and
current maritime roles and taskings as an important starting point. I
think that Members from across the House agree that naval forces are
there to protect and patrol, to secure freedom of movement, to enforce
the boundaries of territorial waters, to control exclusive economic
zones, and to secure the environment—a significant
consideration—renewables and critical infrastructure. That is
particularly important when one bears in mind what is likely to happen
in the decades ahead with offshore wind, tidal and wave power and the
development of super-grid systems, which are likely to connect Iceland,
the Faroe islands, Scotland, Norway and the rest of Europe. Other

better place to start than with an incident that happened two years ago
and has close connection to my part of the world. The 65,000-tonne
Admiral Kuznetsov anchored on the edge of UK waters off my
constituency. Other Russian ships that also sought shelter in the Moray
firth included the anti-submarine warfare ship Admiral Chabanenko, and
the escort ship Yaroslav Mudryy. The vessels did not warn domestic
authorities that they were going to come so close to the coast, and are
believed to have blamed bad weather for making that approach. It was
the first time the Kuznetsov, or a vessel of its size, had deployed
near UK waters, and it was the closest in 20 years that a Russian naval
task group had deployed to Scotland or anywhere else in  the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000039">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T09:53:36"></hs_TimeCode>
previous years, Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft would have been
loitering and would have been aware of the presence of a Russian
deployment of that size.  Of course, by 2011, the UK had no
such aircraft; it is the only northern European military without them.
Nevertheless, the Russians were there without any UK escort. At that
stage, the Ministry of Defence was relying on Scottish fishing vessels
to report developments, 
<?notus-xml column=193?>including fly-tipping by the visitors. When the MOD became aware of the
Russians’ presence, a 30-year-old Type 42 frigate, the HMS York,
was scrambled from Portsmouth, around 1,000 miles away. That distance,
at 20 to 24 knots, takes more than 24 hours to travel. The
responsibility that the HMS York was fulfilling was that of fleet ready
escort, which means being the deployable and capable vessel in UK
waters ready to perform emergency response tasks. The Kuznetsov case
raises serious questions relating to current and future naval vessels,
and I would be grateful if the Minister could address them. I know that
he is well advised today, so I am sure that he will have time to

vessels, the fleet ready escort provision has been repeatedly gapped?

last five years and for how long the fleet ready escort has been
gapped? Will he confirm that offshore patrol and mine countermeasures

is all especially relevant to Scotland when it comes to current and
future conventional vessels. Scotland is a maritime nation with a sea
area five times larger than its land area. Our coastline is over 11,000

hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth East made some compelling
arguments about the technical specifications of warships but I am not
in a position to do that. I want to talk about the human impact of
decisions about future naval ships—their construction and where
they are based—and the effect on local communities. I should
declare an interest: members of my family work and have worked for
generations in the business of building, maintaining and taking care of
Royal Navy ships. After all, I was born in Portsmouth and represent
Gosport, and people would be hard pressed to find a single person in
that region who is not affected in some way by the Royal Navy or the
care, maintenance and construction of its ships. That is why the
community was devastated by the recent news that shipbuilding in
Portsmouth is to
cease<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:06:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=196?><hs_Para UID="13120347000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000057">In Portsmouth,
we do not have a sentimental view  of shipbuilding. We
understand that it is something  that has always fluctuated. My
grandfather worked in the dockyard for 45 years, including on the
building of HMS Andromeda, which in the late 1960s—around
1967—was the last Royal Navy ship to be built entirely in
Portsmouth dockyard. There was a huge gap in shipbuilding at the
dockyard after that, so we understand that naval shipbuilding
fluctuates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:06:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
Furthermore, we always understood that the Queen Elizabeth class, which
has been partly constructed in Portsmouth, would come to an end
eventually. It is a once-in-a-generation shipbuilding project, which
created many jobs, but they were never going to last for ever, because
of the scale of the ship—only one 20th of it filled an enormous
BAE hangar in Portsmouth
dockyard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:07:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000058">We
used to feel a little better about the lack of shipbuilding jobs when
other jobs could be taken on the maintenance and care of the
fleet—the ship support services. In recent years, however, that
work has deteriorated as well. I remember as a little girl, we had the
Queen’s jubilee fleet review of 1977—the Spithead
review—which was a glorious spectacle. The ships went as far as
the eye could see; we had a magnificent fleet. There was a fleet review
in 2005, to commemorate the battle of Trafalgar, and I also went to
that. We managed to collect a bunch of different naval ships from
various international navies. Her Majesty did inspect them, but she was
probably still home in time to watch “EastEnders”,
because there was nothing like the level of ships that we used to
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:08:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000059">That
is important. I suppose the problem started with the construction of
the Type 45, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:08:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bournemouth East pointed out. By anyone’s
standards, it is a super-impressive piece of kit. Naval folklore, which
is particularly prevalent in my part of the world, has the ships taking
part in an international military exercise in the Atlantic, but being
asked to leave by other navies, because the Type 45 ships were so
technically brilliant that they were beating everyone else before they
could start. Apparently, they have the radar shadow of a small fishing
boat—they are whizzy pieces of
kit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:08:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The trouble
with the Type 45 ships, however, is the cost—they were £1
billion a pop, which is very pricey—and we got six of them and
not 12. I am not normally keen on quoting Joseph Stalin, but he said
that quantity has a quality of its
own.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000060">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:04:24"></hs_TimeCode>
other Members have pointed out, our Navy is different from other wings
of the armed forces: even when we are not involved in any combat
operations, the Navy is almost fully deployed protecting our trade
routes, on anti-piracy missions, deploying mine counter-measures, on
fishery protection, in the Falklands, taking part in drugs operations
in the Caribbean and on disaster and humanitarian relief, as we have
seen recently. We therefore need a quantity of ships. No matter how
incredibly advanced our warships are, one has not yet been invented
with the ability to be in more than one place at the same time; that is
the
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000061">My
first question to the Minister is, will he guarantee that for the
future global combat ship we will learn the lessons of the Type 45, and
have a ship that is flexible and adaptable but affordable and
exportable, so that we have something that other countries want to buy?
They do not want the £1-billion-a-pop Type 45s because they
cannot afford them.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=197?><hs_Para UID="13120347000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000062">Another
important matter is the basing of the future fleet. It
is no secret that people in Portsmouth were
devastated by the news that the Type 23s will now be maintained and
repaired in Plymouth. Where shipbuilding jobs are disappearing, the
hope is that those jobs would be back-filled by ship support work and
fleet maintenance. But there is a massive strategic gap: when work
finishes for the last Type 23 that will be repaired in Portsmouth, the
HMS Westminster, there will be a gap of around a year before the first
Type 45, HMS Daring, comes back for its first refit. We had hoped that
some of the shipbuilding jobs would go into ship support, but we are
not even 100% sure that all the ship support jobs will be in Portsmouth
because of that year-long strategic gap. Will the Minister tell us what
he is doing to mitigate that? The area cannot support any further job
losses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000063">I
welcome the news that the QE class will be based in Portsmouth harbour
and that the Government are going to spend £100 million on
improving the dockyard. That news is welcome, but Portsmouth is holding
its breath to see what happens to the second QE-class carrier. We would
like to know what the future holds for that ship, because it would be
fantastic if it could be used in some way rather than
mothballed.</hs_Para>

underestimate the importance of this issue to the local economy.
Gosport, my constituency, is on the other side of Portsmouth harbour to
Portsmouth itself. Around 35% of the people who work in the Portsmouth
naval base and dockyard come from my constituency: it is an area whose
fortunes have been completely wrapped up in those of the Navy and that
has supported the Royal Navy for hundreds and hundreds of years. Its
economic fortunes have dived in line with Navy cuts. We now have a
victualling yard that no longer supplies victuals to the Royal Navy, an
oil fuel depot that currently does not deliver oil, a submarine escape
tank with no submariners in it and a royal naval hospital—the
last in the UK, which was shut down by the previous
Government—with no patients. Twenty-one per cent of
Gosport’s surface area is still in the hands of the Defence
Infrastructure Organisation, so the land is not even being released to
commercial companies that could do something with it. That is
incredibly painful, because commercial companies would like to come in
and do something to restore the fortunes of our great town, and are
being prevented from doing so not because the DIO is saying no, but
because the DIO is simply not engaging in the conversation. Will the
Minister help out with that
situation?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000065">Gosport
has less than half a job per working adult, and we do not have a
culture of entrepreneurship, because generation after generation has
been employed by the Royal Navy. The Minister will say that the
Ministry of Defence is not an employment agency or in the business of
creating work, but I read a small statistic recently: Cardiff
university did a poll on the national competitiveness of UK towns, and
Gosport is second from bottom of the English towns in that poll, having
dropped a staggering 94 places in the past three years. That is how
much the fortunes of our town are tied to the fortunes of the military
and the Navy.</hs_Para>

the basis of affordability and practicality, but we also have to bear
in mind the huge

for hundreds of years. Those communities have built up around serving

hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood) on
securing the debate. As he knows, he and I have been talking about the
future of the Royal Navy for the past three years, since I was elected.

however, that the Government have had a difficult time. They have found
themselves with enormously problematic public finances and have
therefore had to make significant cuts in the delivery of public
services. I am sorry that they should find themselves in that position.
We should most certainly control the public expenditure envelope, but
my view is that politics is about delivering priorities as well, and I
believe that our chief priority should be the defence of our
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000069">This
is an opportune time to have this debate, as the Government will not
only consider the next round of the strategic defence and security
review in a couple  of years’ time but decide the amount
of money that will be spent. As others have said, when the
“Options for Change” review took place in the 1990s,
about 4% or 5% of the country’s GDP was being spent on defence;
that is now down to around 2%. It is important that, over the next few
years, we look at the amount of money that we are investing in defence.
I hope that this debate will send out that message. If the Minister
would be willing to work with me, I am very willing to work with him on
trying to argue our case to the Government and to the
Treasury.</hs_Para>

Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport as I do, I pay tribute to the Government
for deciding that they will continue to make sure that Plymouth has the
licence for refuelling and refitting of nuclear submarines. I recognise
that the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) would prefer not to
end up with nuclear submarines in Scotland. Bluntly, we are quite
willing to end up with them in Plymouth if we possibly can. We would
welcome it. We recognise that it is the stake in the ground, as far as
Devonport is concerned. There has to be work going into Devonport.
About 38% of people working in the city depend on the public sector.
Another incredibly important point is that we have a low skills base.
The one thing that Devonport and Plymouth have going for them is their
global reputation for marine science and engineering research. The
Royal Navy is a significant player in that sector, along with Plymouth
university, and I hope that we can continue to build  on
that.</hs_Para>

so important because we are an island—a maritime nation that
depends upon using sea routes to bring our food and imports into the
country. The Ministry of Defence should have two priorities: it should
make sure that we have not only a strong Royal Navy but a 
<?notus-xml column=199?>strong RAF as well. We must protect our sea routes and air routes so
that we can get bits of kit and imports into the country. Could we
imagine Christmas without oranges or the kinds of fruits that we depend
upon being able to import? Looking at the events of the first and
second world wars, we can see how close we came to finding ourselves
starved to death by our aggressors.</hs_Para>

carriers are important: they provide a launch pad for aircraft to cover
and dominate the air when we are landing troops—I hope, our
Royal Marines—on beaches. We should not forget that. However,
this matter is not simply about having aircraft carriers. Nelson, who
is the great hero of the Royal Navy and, I would argue, Britain, said
that we must ensure that we have plenty of ships, including frigates
and other vessels that can protect our other activities on the sea.
They are utterly vital, and investment in them is
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000073">Plymouth
has the licence for refitting and refurbishing our nuclear submarines,
and it is key that we retain our nuclear deterrent. I have been very
supportive of ensuring that we have four submarines, so that we have a
continuous sea deterrent. I would like confirmation that the
Conservative party will remain committed to that and that it will not
be subject to any discussions with other political parties after the
general election if we unfortunately find ourselves in a coalition

of occasionally having a drink on board. I assure the Chamber that we
have done much work in that regard. I understand that people in Sierra
Leone are still talking about a Royal Navy frigate or aircraft carrier
being just over the horizon and about how, if they do not behave
themselves, the Royal Navy will be turning up immediately on their

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:22:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood) has long been an
articulate commentator on Army issues; more recently he has taken up
the cudgels on behalf of the Royal Navy. If I were in charge of the
Royal Air Force, I would look to my laurels, because I am sure that it
is next on his agenda. To give the Minister maximum time to consider my
questions, I will ask them at the beginning of my contribution rather
than at the end, so he will be at liberty to ignore anything I say
afterwards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000077">First,
when the main gate contracts are signed some time next year after the
Scottish referendum, will a minimum of 13 frigates be ordered?
Secondly, does  the Minister accept that the unit cost of new
frigates will be much cheaper if all 13 are ordered at the outset?
Thirdly, eight of the 13 frigates will specialise in anti-submarine
warfare. Was that figure derived from doctrinal consideration, and if
so, what is it? My concern is that  
<?notus-xml column=200?>if we are to have seven frigates available for that purpose, we would
need 10, not eight. I think doctrine requires at least seven to be
available. Fourthly, how many of the new frigates would be necessary to
escort a taskforce, whether that is an amphibious or carrier taskforce?
Finally, what consideration will be given to adoption of the
plug-and-play method of warship development that my hon. Friend the
Member for Bournemouth
East<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:24:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:24:24"></hs_TimeCode>

the time available, I hope to speak about strategy, numbers and design

Queen’s Speech debate in 1997, you spoke after me, and were kind
enough to predict that the House would be hearing a lot more from me on
defence in the years to come. You were absolutely right, and I have
been banging on about it ever since, although I had not expected to be
making the same sort of repetitious points and representations to a
Conservative-led Government as I did to the Labour Government during
the more than six years in which I was my party’s spokesman on

I took the day off and had the great pleasure of travelling to
Southampton university at the invitation of Commander Chris Ling,
commanding officer of Thunderer Squadron, which is the defence
technical undergraduate scheme at the university, and Lieutenant Amie
Jackson. She—I emphasise “she”—is the
commanding officer of the warship HMS Blazer, which is attached to the
university’s Royal Navy unit. It was wonderful to celebrate with
them the opening of their new joint headquarters at the National
Oceanography Centre. Looking at the fine young people who are coming
through the system and having a first-class maritime education there, I
could not help wondering how many opportunities they would have, and
how many naval vessels would be available for them to serve in, in the
years ahead, when they go on, as so many of them do, to professional
careers in the Royal
Navy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000082">I
said that I would talk a bit about strategy. I have always acknowledged
on a cross-party basis that the concepts of Labour’s 1998
strategic defence review were very sound. They recognised that we were
no longer facing as our primary concern the cold war threat on the
continent, and that if our forces were engaged, it would be in more
far-flung theatres. As we were no longer an empire and no longer had a
string of bases all over the world, it would be necessary to have a
portable, movable sea base that we could use to take our joint forces
to the theatre in which they were engaged. That seemed sound then, and
it is sound today. That concept required two sorts of taskforce: one to
allow air power 
<?notus-xml column=201?>to be projected from the sea, hence the aircraft carriers; and the other
to enable military power to be landed from the sea, hence the
amphibious taskforce. Broadly speaking, we have the central elements of
those taskforces.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120347000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000083">We know that
the aircraft carriers are moving  steadily forward, whatever
financial peaks and troughs they have had in their chequered history,
and that  they will come to fruition. I would like to predict
that the Government will bring both carriers into service, because it
would be sheer madness to build one of the largest ships that the Royal
Navy has ever seen and not deploy it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120347000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000084"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:30:08"></hs_TimeCode>The
Albion, the Bulwark, and our Bay-class ships of the Royal Fleet
Auxiliary Service form the core of the amphibious taskforce, and again,
it would be interesting to know—although I do not expect an
answer today—what plans there are to think about the next
generation of assault ships to follow the Albion and the Bulwark.
However, the point about the two taskforces, and the relevance to
today’s debate, is that they will have to be protected against
air threats, surface threats and submarine threats. As I said before,
if we need a certain number of frigates—let us say as many as
four to protect a taskforce, if it were in a serious regional
conflict—given the roles that the frigates will have to perform
in other areas, including ongoing and standing tasks, I find myself
querying how the idea that we will generate a minimum of seven
available anti-submarine warfare frigates from only eight out of the 13
will work.</hs_Para>

shall say a brief word about numbers. I start from the standpoint that
we are simply not spending enough on defence. I know all the economic
arguments about that, but the fact is that as a proportion of gross
domestic product, defence spending has declined too far down our list
of priorities. Spending was between 4% and 5% during the cold war
years. When Labour came into office in 1997, it went from 2.9% to 2.6%,
then to 2.8%. Then, in successive years, it was 2.7%, 2.7% again, 2.5%,
2.5% again, and so on. That looked fairly consistent, but the problem
was that during that period, we were engaged in fighting two large
regional conflicts, and the Treasury was not prepared to stump up the
extra money to fund those conflicts in full. As a result, we found the
core military budget being eaten away by the financing of current
conflicts, and since then, under the present Government, the situation
has not improved. I believe that we are down to something like 2.1% of
GDP at present, and I feel that that is the root of the
problem.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120347000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000086">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:33:12"></hs_TimeCode>
the time of the strategic defence review that set out those concepts,
the Labour Government proposed reducing the combined number of frigates
and destroyers from 35 to 32. The admirals gritted their teeth and
accepted that, but it quickly emerged that 32 had actually gone down to
31, and the then Secretary of State, Geoff Hoon, formulated what I
later dubbed the “Hoon excuse”, which was, “It
doesn’t really matter that we have lost an extra frigate,
because they are more powerful than they used to be, so 31 ships can do
what 32 used to do.”
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:35:34"></hs_TimeCode>, I am
afraid, was the start of a very slippery
slope.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000087">The
next bite taken out of the total by the Labour Government took the
number down from 31 to 25. I remember standing up in the House of
Commons at the beginning of 2007 waxing eloquent about persistent 
<?notus-xml column=202?>rumours that the Government intended to mothball, if not permanently
dispose of, another half a dozen frigates to take the total down to 19.
In the end, that gradually slipped away, but a couple of Type 23
frigates were paid off, and effectively the total went down to 23 from
25. It took the Conservative-led coalition coming in before we went
down to 19 in the 2010 SDSR, yet the concept set out in 1998 remained
basically sound: we needed to be able to fulfil certain standing tasks,
to protect a mobile base, and to escort an amphibious taskforce or an
aircraft carrier taskforce. I do not see what doctrinal developments
since then justify such a radical reduction in the numbers.</hs_Para>

Member for Bournemouth East mentioned. It is
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:36:51"></hs_TimeCode> whether it
might be worth looking at the other five more general-purpose hulls
that are proposed to bring the total number of frigates up to 13, and
whether it might be worth considering doing something simpler to get
more hulls in the water from which we can regenerate the surface fleet.
Back in February 2005, in putting forward that concept, I was unwise
enough to say that, really, the replacement general-purpose frigates
ought to be “as cheap as chips”, which is not the sort of
phrase that a proud Navy wants to hear. However, the point is based on
an important development that I referred to in my opening
questions—the idea of plug and play.</hs_Para>

the Type 45s were designed and put into service, they had a very large
gymnasium. Why? Because they were designed in such a way that at a
future stage in their life cycle, when we could afford it, we would be
able to plug into that large space a module of land attack cruise
missiles, which would hugely increase the ships’ power, even
though we felt that we could not afford to do so at the beginning. It
is perfectly possible to design ships that are relatively simple, but
that have that capacity; I am extremely glad to see
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:37:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Moray (Angus Robertson) nodding in agreement. We are very capable
of upgrading those ships in their lifetime, and adding to their
capacity. Perhaps it is too late now—I do not know—but we
could at least try to keep the number of hulls a bit larger and lessen
the complexity a bit; we would then have the basis for upgrading the
quality of the vessels during their
lifetime.</hs_Para>

when he gave a very robust defence of the Navy’s future
configuration, with the QE class sitting at its centre. He was very
careful, as we would expect, not to specify the number of carriers with
which his successors will be working. Given that we are approaching a
further SDSR, I feel that he was correct not to make assumptions. We
need to understand what our defence and foreign policies need to
deliver and what we want them to deliver, and clearly we also need to
ensure within that that our shores are fully and properly
protected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000103">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:45:12"></hs_TimeCode>,

surface and subsea vessels, towed sonar arrays and inflatables, as well
as to have the capacity to take something as large potentially as a
Chinook and to be used with unmanned aerial vehicles doing airborne

of some of the problems that we had under the last Government, on this.
We need to be clearer through the SDSR about our future
needs—the type of wars we need and want to fight, as well as how
those demands play into our industrial strategy and industrial base.
That said, we also have to have a vehicle that can deliver our new
ships on time and on budget. Two weeks ago, we saw the collapse of one
of the two remaining consortiums bidding for the GoCo model for future
procurement, which was bad news for the Government. It is difficult to
see how the Government can continue to pursue that option when their
own report stated that the competition would still be possible

latest-capability fleet. Aircraft carriers will be the next vessels to
form part of that fleet. It is not appropriate to indicate at this
point what will happen to the second carrier, so I am unable to give an

important to emphasise that we see the carrier strike capability as
offering a step change in power projection, giving the UK the ability
to project decisive political intent and military will at reach. The
carrier has been designed as a multi-role platform in addition to
carrier strike. In its littoral manoeuvre role, it will be able to land
Royal Marines or special forces, evacuate non-combatants and deliver
humanitarian aid, disaster relief or international defence diplomacy
and engagement. The programme is on track to deliver an operational
capability for carrier strike in 2020.</hs_Para>

platform upgrade—the Type 26 global combat ship—I have to
be a little cautious in what I say, because the main gate investment
decision will not be taken until the end of next year. I have been
pressed by colleagues to advance investment decisions before the design
is fully mature, but the Government have been clear that that was one
of the reasons why we believe the previous Government got into some
difficulty in major platform procurements. I was grateful to hear the
hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View acknowledge for, I 
<?notus-xml column=207?>believe, the first time in the Chamber that the previous Administration
encountered some problems with procurement. I do not intend to place us
in a similar situation by pre-announcing decisions before the designs
are mature. We are making good progress with the design. Some 70% of
the equipment systems have been selected or are being selected by the
design authority, BAE Systems, and we have increasing confidence in the
maturity of the design. It is being designed with modularity in mind,

would like to tackle head-on the claim that we heard yet again today
about the impact on shipyards in Scotland of a yes vote in the Scottish
referendum. Last week, the Scottish Government claimed in their White
Paper that they would support the procurement of defence equipment and
services in an independent Scotland, as we heard again today, claiming
that to do so would protect the future of Scotland’s shipyards.
However, the White Paper completely failed to acknowledge that, as part
of the UK, companies in Scotland already benefit greatly from the
billions of pounds of work that is placed with them to equip and
support the UK armed forces. Thousands of people are employed in the
defence sector in Scotland. The defence industry offers some of the
best high-tech engineering jobs and opportunities in Scotland, and it
contributes substantially to local economies across Scotland.</hs_Para>

complex warships such as destroyers and the Queen Elizabeth-class
aircraft carriers, on which some 4,000 people are currently employed in
Scottish yards, were won only on the basis that the UK can choose to
place or hold competition for such contracts domestically for national
security reasons under an exemption from EU law. The UK has not placed
an order for a complex warship outside its own borders in modern times.
If Scotland were not part of the UK, it would not benefit from that
national security exemption. The question of how defence jobs in
Scotland would be sustained in an independent Scottish state remains
wholly unanswered. The thousands of skilled defence jobs in Scotland
are safer and more secure if the country remains part of the
UK.</hs_Para>

Bournemouth East, who made a thoughtful speech. He asked about
modularity of systems and whether we can construct vessels that are

systems that we seek to introduce in our vessels will be portable.
Perhaps the most obvious recent example is the Sea Ceptor air defence
missile, which we have recently contracted to introduce to the Type 23,
with a view to transitioning it to the Type 26. As he mentioned, the
system has many features in common with a version that is capable of
being launched on land. That is the approach that we are taking to a
number of defence assets. We are rationalising our helicopter fleets to
allow greater interoperability between services. The Wildcat, which
will be capable of being carried on our frigates and destroyers, will
also be used by the Army Air Corps. Modularity and interoperability are
features of the systems that we seek to
introduce.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000122">The
flexibility of the Type 26 is provided by the mission bay, which is a
much larger hangar space than that of the Type 23. It can carry a
payload of 10 20-foot containers, a medical centre or a command and
control centre. It can contain four landing craft for rapid response by
Royal Marines. The vessel has been designed to have a smaller crew than
that of the Type 23, but it can accommodate some 100 Royal Marines or
other personnel for protracted engagements, or a much larger number of
individuals for a short time, when the vessel performs an evacuation
role. It will be the most flexible vessel of its kind and the most
modern frigate design available in the world, so we believe that it

time to my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:00:44"></hs_TimeCode> right
hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert). I
called for the debate to raise an issue of the greatest concern to our
constituents—namely, the proposal by Mayfield Market Towns Ltd
to build up to 10,000 houses on open countryside between Henfield and
Sayers Common in West Sussex. That new town would stretch across the
border of Horsham and Mid Sussex district councils and our
constituencies and is thus of profound concern to us both. The proposal
is totally and wholly inappropriate and is causing the greatest
possible local concern and
anxiety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000126">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:01:25"></hs_TimeCode>
want to say at the outset that my right hon. Friend and I acknowledge
of course the need for new houses. We accept that they are required to
meet the demands of a growing population and to meet the worthy
aspirations of our young people to live in their own houses. It is our
strong view that schemes such as the Mayfields project are not helping
to achieve that aim, but are seriously hindering it, and in the
process, gravely undermining support for the Government’s
flagship commitment to localism.</hs_Para>

is Mayfields such a thoroughly bad scheme? Its proponents call the
putative new settlement a “market town”. That is arrant
nonsense, since there would be minimal local employment. It would, as
the excellent Sussex branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England
observed, be a commuter town, since almost all its residents would in
fact travel to other areas for work. The glossy brochure produced by
Mayfield Market Towns absurdly suggests that its new residents would,
“work where they live”, or walk, cycle or take the bus to
their employment, “leaving the car at home”. Even the
most zealous supporter of the scheme—there are not
many—would be hard pressed to describe it as sustainable. Apart
from the destruction of beautiful countryside and good, valuable,
productive agricultural land, the development is not on a railway line,
nor is it close to a major road, and there are already serious flood
issues in the area.
With<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:02:56"></hs_TimeCode> 25,000
people living in the new town, there would clearly be huge pressure on
already inadequate local

the Mid Sussex plan aims to deliver more housing than the objectively

530 homes. During the first five years of the plan, 3,000 new homes

planning for growth, with a 3% year-on-year increase in economic
activity envisaged throughout the plan period. It includes significant
new employment space, including a new science park, which is part of
the Brighton city deal bid. Let us remember that is all in an area

thoroughly unhelpful and disruptive, because the longer the plan is
delayed, the longer Mid Sussex will remain susceptible to speculative
development and planning by appeal, serving the interests of developers

undermining localism, certainly delaying necessary new housing and

Friend the Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames). As he explained, we

constituencies. I endorse every word that he said and share his deep
concern about the proposal. I shall amplify a number of the points that

there is considerable local concern about the proposal. I have attended
packed meetings in village halls in my constituency. People have been
unable to get into meetings, because there is so much concern about the
proposed new town. I have never known anything like it. That concern is
having a practical effect on people’s economic well-being,
because a planning blight is already being cast over the local area.
Numerous constituents have written to me to express their concern
about, for instance, their ability to sell their houses at the normal
market rate due to the belief that a new town is
threatened.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000139">Secondly,
I underline what my right hon. Friend said about the importance of
sustainability, which is, after all, written into the
Government’s new planning policy. The principle was sustainable
development, not development at any price. The new planning policy
framework clearly set out three dimensions to that sustainability:
environmental, social and economic.</hs_Para>

therefore highly significant that a report commissioned earlier by
Horsham, Crawley and Mid Sussex councils, as my right hon. Friend said,
ruled out a new town in the area precisely on the grounds that it would
not be sustainable, for all the reasons set out. It seems to me that
the report is significant for an additional reason: it shows that the
local authorities considered a development in the area. They are not
ruling out the notion of new housing out of hand, but they consider
that it is not appropriate or sustainable. Whose view will carry the
day when we promise localism in such matters? I will return to that
issue.</hs_Para>

issue is the behaviour of the developer in promoting the scheme.
Mayfield Market Towns has not just set out a proposal for a new town;
it has gone much further. For instance, it has distributed 8,000
leaflets in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for
Horsham (Mr Maude), north of Horsham, telling people that they need not
have development in that area because they can have a new town outside
their area instead. The developers are setting out to undermine the
normal local planning process and interfere with the sensitive
consultations that local authorities are holding with our electorate.
That is entirely reprehensible behaviour; it is deeply unhelpful to the
development of new plans; and it should be roundly
condemned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000142">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:12:21"></hs_TimeCode>

Friend the Member for Mid Sussex and I expressed concern previously, in
a letter to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
on 24 June, 
<?notus-xml column=212?>about the position of one of the directors of Mayfield Market Towns,
Lord Taylor of Goss Moor. Lord Taylor—though I emphasise that he
has properly declared the interest—is one of the
Government’s advisers on planning and has been drawing up the
very guidance on the national policy planning framework on which local
authorities are being asked to rely, as they consider their local
plans. How can one of the directors of a developer that is actively
seeking to subvert localism and produce a new town in a local area also
advise the Government on how localism will work? That is clearly a
conflict of interest. It is deeply resented by local people, and it is
damaging to the perception of the Government’s independence in
such matters. We do not believe that it can stand.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick Boles), who
unfortunately could not be with us today. I am absolutely delighted to
respond on the Government’s behalf on this issue. I wish to make
it clear that my ministerial role means that
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:19:32"></hs_TimeCode> am not able to
comment on the specific issues about the Mayfields

proposal. However, I recognise that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T10:37:16"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friends the Members for Mid Sussex, and for Arundel and South Downs,
are very much local champions, giving a local voice to those people who
are very concerned about the proposal. I am absolutely sure that they
will insist that the correct process is undertaken regarding the
receipt of any application, and that they will ensure that a local plan
is developed and is appropriate. I am also absolutely sure that they
will be robust in any challenge they make to Government if they feel
that Government action is inappropriate.</hs_Para>

I want to reassure my right hon. Friends

with local government, through local plans, and that it is up to local
communities to shape the response to their housing needs—the two
points that they have both made. To provide that reassurance,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:19:55"></hs_TimeCode>I want to start
by reiterating some of the key aspects of national planning policy. A
core principle in the national planning policy framework is that
planning should</hs_Para>

drive and support sustainable economic development to deliver the
homes, business and industrial units, infrastructure and thriving local
places that the country
needs.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13120347000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000154">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:21:29"></hs_TimeCode>
framework also sets out that local planning authorities should prepare
a strategic housing market assessment of their full housing needs,
working with neighbouring authorities where housing market areas cross
administrative boundaries. The SHMA should identify the scale and mix
of housing, and the range of tenures, that the local population is
likely to need over the plan period. Authorities should use their local
plan process to set out how they will meet that need, and they should
identify a five-year supply of specific deliverable sites to provide
for that need, with a buffer to ensure choice and competition. Where
they have not done so, a presumption in favour of sustainable
development will apply, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:21:54"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Mid Sussex
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:21:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The NPPF
is clear that authorities should plan to meet their
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:22:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000155">Despite
the concerns raised today, as both my right hon. Friends have said and
as I have heard myself, there is widespread support across the country
for more housing to meet the needs of local communities. However, my
right hon. Friends will recognise, as I do, that when a development is
potentially to be located on a greenfield site or in the green belt
there is often an outcry from communities. That is understandable, and
I do not want to see any more green fields being used than is
necessary. Indeed, the NPPF maintains strong protections for the green
belt, areas of outstanding natural beauty and other environmental
designations. It also allows councils to introduce a new local green
space designation to provide additional planning protection for green
areas that are demonstrably special to a local community and that hold
a particular local significance. Also, the framework continues to
encourage the reuse of brownfield
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:23:16"></hs_TimeCode>sites.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000156">Most
importantly, however, the changes that we have made to the planning
system put local plans at the heart of the system. Unlike the previous
Government’s approach of having top-down regional strategies,
which imposed housing numbers and forced green-belt reviews on
communities, local authorities should now be assessing their own need
and working with their communities to decide how and where to put the
homes to meet that
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:23:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000158">Not
every community can meet its needs. That is why local authorities
should work together constructively, actively and on an ongoing basis
to maximise the effectiveness of their local plans, in line with the
duty to co-operate that was introduced by the Localism Act 2011. Good
plans are now being made across the country. When this Government came
to power, only 33% of local authorities had published a plan; now, more
than 76% of them have published
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:24:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:24:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000159"><B><Member ContinuationText="Nicholas Soames" PimsId="752" UID="13120347000215" xid="552" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000215">Nicholas

plans are at the centre of this new system. Whereas regional strategies
and central targets built nothing but resentment, setting people
against development that was imposed on them, communities have firmly
grasped the opportunity to engage with neighbourhood plans. I know that
that is true in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:25:23"></hs_TimeCode>
Mid Sussex, which is a hotbed of neighbourhood plan activity; local
people there are taking control of shaping their
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:25:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000162">I
will touch on large-scale housing development. The Government have
recognised that there is a need for new homes, and sometimes that need
can be met through planning for larger-scale developments, such as new
settlements or extensions to existing villages or towns, following the
principles of the garden cities. The previous Government also liked the
idea of large-scale development, but there is a contrast between their
approach and ours. Their top-down eco-towns programme was an expensive
failure, plagued, I have to say, by community opposition to bureaucrats
in Whitehall who drew lines on maps. That top-down approach is very
different to our approach.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120347000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000163">Our focus is
on supporting the development of long-term new communities that local
authorities and local communities want, helping to ensure that key
infrastructure and community facilities are built alongside new homes,
and not later, as an
afterthought<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:26:55"></hs_TimeCode>. We
are doing that by supporting local authorities and development partners
to bring forward a pipeline of ambitious new communities through
brokerage, capacity and capital investment. So far, we have invested
some £80 million for 69,000 new homes, including those in a
scheme in Cranbrook in Devon, where our investment is supporting the
development of a new sustainable community of 6,000 new homes. We hope
that a further 14 sites across the country will eventually deliver some
38,000 homes. Importantly, local communities are driving this process,
which is not about the Government adopting a top-down approach, but
about local communities making choices about where these large-scale
developments should
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120347000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120347000164">To
conclude, the planning system is changing for the better. It asks
communities to meet their need for housing—I recognise that both
my right hon. Friends have expressed their commitment to new housing
and have spoken of their areas’ need for it—while
maintaining strong protections for the environment. It asks communities
to do so through local and neighbourhood plans, which allow them to
decide where development should take place. Where authorities have
failed to plan, the presumption in favour of sustainable development
will apply. While we continue to support the principle of large-scale
developments as a way of meeting the overwhelming housing need that we
face, Government funding and expert advice is clearly predicated on
local community support. As I have said, I am sure that the enthusiasm,
engagement and leadership of my right hon. Friends will help to shape
community opinion in the areas that they
represent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T11:28:50"></hs_TimeCode>. I
thank them for their questions.</hs_Para>

like to come up with complex formulas for giving money to councils that
tend to benefit wealthier authorities, but when it comes to cutting
money, Ministers are increasingly turning to crude holdbacks and
top-slicing from the central revenue budget. It is possible that not
everyone here is familiar with holdbacks. Indeed, I confess that, prior
to entering Parliament, I did not follow the intricacies of local
government financing with as much attention as I possibly should have.

holdback is when Ministers or civil servants decide that money
allocated to councils will literally be held back by Whitehall for a
specific purpose or on a certain condition, which, again,
disproportionally affects the most deprived councils. Money is being
cut from the central pot, the revenue support grant, which
automatically 
<?notus-xml column=219?>means that councils with the highest need lose out the most. If the
Minister decides that he wants to hold back £500 million, for
example, it comes from the central budget, which means that all
councils lose a slice. The councils that would have received a bigger
slice, because they have greater need, lose out more. A holdback of
£500 million would mean that Newcastle loses £4 million,
whereas Wokingham loses only £400,000. That is a £32 cut
per household in Newcastle and a £6 cut per household in
Wokingham. Authorities such as Hackney and Birmingham are even worse
off, at £50 and £37 per household
respectively<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T14:45:10"></hs_TimeCode>.

skewed to favour wealthy authorities, as it so often is under this

safety net—again, this a technical description of a complex
area—provides funding for any council for which business rate
receipts fall more than 7.5% below its baseline funding level. The

holdback of £25 million was originally created to fund the
difference between levy funds and safety net payments so that all

but what is crucial is that, because the estimated levy amount has
proved inadequate, the top-slice holdback has been increased to
£120 million next year. That is a staggering increase, and
SIGOMA says that, because of the system’s design, Westminster
city council will claim more than two thirds of the national £79
million safety net pot next year. That is two thirds for one of the
richest councils in the country. Again, funding is disproportionately

autumn statement on Thursday is used to announce any further support
for business rates or for local authorities, I am sure that the

constituents’ lives. The independent living fund and the social
care issues, with a particular focus on children, are affected, but so
are adult carers. People’s lives are being detrimentally
affected, but it does not seem a priority for the

I said at the beginning, the subject appears dry, but my post box and
surgeries reveal the daily impact of cuts to the funding of services
and the progressive and cumulative impact on the lives of often
vulnerable people, who find not only an impact on housing and social
care, but that their streets are not as clean, that their environment
is more depressing and that schools do not have the same resources.
That impact is partly a consequence of holdbacks. These dry financial
mechanisms 
<?notus-xml column=222?>are holding back the services that my constituents and so many others
need. We need to focus on that. It is important that the Minister
identifies and explains why this is happening and what he can do to
stop the impacts that we are talking

have one overarching point for the Minister. The mechanism is
regressive and effectively moves money to better-off areas, but it is
also opaque and severely limits councils’ ability to plan in
advance. Will he work to ensure that future rounds of local government
finance settlements are conducted more transparently? Ministers have
found ways to give varying protection to some more visible services,
but that increases the pressure on other funds. When the Minister
chooses to protect London transport funding by 6%, money for
children’s social care and libraries is squeezed in

better, so that the libraries could stay open. I explained that the
council was losing a third of its budget, or more than £100

congratulate my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:02:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) on
her choice of topic. In the overall context of the Department’s
budget, the sum of money involved is relatively small, and the subject
that we are discussing may seem rather technical, but as she has
pointed out, the devil is in the detail. Furthermore, at the heart of
what we ought to be considering is
fairness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:02:36"></hs_TimeCode>. I have
had the honour and privilege of representing the great city of
Newcastle 
<?notus-xml column=223?>upon Tyne for 30 years in this place, and I have to say to the Minister
that what the Government are doing to inner-city local authorities such
as Newcastle—although we are not unique—is simply not
fair<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:03:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120364000053">At
the heart of the argument is the fact that the statutory burdens on the
authorities—in particular, people have to be cared for, whether
the elderly, those in social care or in need of even more intensive
care, or children taken into care—are driven by factors over
which the local authority has no control. The separation of
the need from the money, which is what in essence the Government are
doing, is a wicked thing. What ought to be the case is that a child who
needs to be cared for in Newcastle should be cared for with exactly the
same energy, enthusiasm and compassion as a child anywhere else in the
United Kingdom. The money should follow the need. That is not the
Government’s direction of travel. What they are doing is
fundamentally wrong—their broader journey is wrong, and what we
are discussing today is a small signpost on the wrong
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:04:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120364000054">The
Government’s new mechanism for funding local authorities, the
business rate retention scheme, makes provision for a safety net, which
is used to top up the funds of those authorities that have encountered
a reduction of more than 7.5% in business rate income. It is funded,
rather illogically, by a levy on those authorities that see an increase
in their business rate income beyond a set
threshold<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:04:45"></hs_TimeCode>.
Personally, I do not agree with any of that—a minority view, I
know—and I will explain why later. For now, I will focus on the
seemingly technical subject of today’s
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:05:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120364000055">The
Department for Communities and Local Government put aside £25
million to fund the safety net for the current 2013-14 financial year,
but the Government have now revealed that this is not enough and that
they are seeking to increase it by an additional £95 million,
making a total of £120 million, which is a substantially larger
sum. The Government propose, in effect, to top-slice or hold back that
money from the 2014-15 local government finance allocation, even though
councils have begun to draw up their budgets for 2014-15, with some
already out to
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120364000056">If
we consider the practicalities of consulting on a budget that is being
squeezed year on year and the context that the needs that that budget
has to meet are not heading in the same direction, we realise how
unjust what the Government are doing is. Councils are not only faced
with revised settlements, but have the prospect of additional cuts so
that the Department can meet what it believes to be its internal
budgetary needs. However, as my hon. Friend pointed out, it is not
entirely clear that those needs are as the Department states them to
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:06:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120364000057">The
impact of taking money from the revenue support grant is that the
Government are reducing the proportion of money subject to funding
formulas that account for need and deprivation. By reducing the revenue
support grant to top up the business rate redistribution mechanism, in
effect, the total amount of local authority funding that has been
subjected to adjustments for deprivation, need and other factors is
being lowered. That is fundamentally unfair. The need is there, and the
money should follow the
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:07:25"></hs_TimeCode>.
Consequently, deprivation factors are weakened within the totality of
the local government finance settlement. With many local authorities
facing increased costs and demand for statutory services, factors 
<?notus-xml column=224?>linked to deprivation—the parts of the finance settlement that
take such elements into account—are reduced, increasing the
pressures on councils.
Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:09:41"></hs_TimeCode> it is an
unfortunate coincidence, but the councils most affected tend to be the
poorer ones, representing communities that are poorer—inner-city
local authorities, which are predominantly Labour controlled. The
effect of the redistribution is towards more affluent parts of the
country that are not Labour controlled—they are controlled by
parties in the governing
coalition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:08:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120364000058">When
the previous Conservative Government nationalised what was then the
local business rate, I thought that they made a reasonably sound case
for doing so: from each according to his abilities, to each according
to his needs, as I am sure I remember Mrs Thatcher and Sir
John Major saying when making this point, although memory plays tricks
as we grow older. The assumption is of course that the rateable values
for business, which are the foundation of the business rate, are
regularly revalued. No more money is raised by revaluation, but the
distribution of the burden is fairer throughout the whole of what is a
United Kingdom. It would be wrong to defer a revaluation for political
reasons, because doing so disadvantages the relatively less wealthy
parts of England—it is more accurate to say England in this
context, rather than the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0001.htm#13120364000059">The

Earlier today, I met 25 members of the University of the Third Age,
from Thrapston, a small town in my constituency, and the topic of
conversation was the impact of various funding cuts on their lives.
They talked about having to pay £6 a week for the Lifeline
service in sheltered accommodation, which was previously paid for out
of the Supporting People funds. They also talked about the impact on
their communities of further cuts to bus services. My county council
has reduced the subsidy for local authority bus services by more than
any other county council. My constituents said, “What is the
point of a bus to a nearby town if I can’t get back from
it?”</hs_Para>

constituents also spoke about the isolation that they experience as
elderly people. They talked of their concerns about their
grandchildren’s school transport costs. They highlighted the
impact of cuts to police community support officer funding in their
small market town, which have happened partly because local authorities
can no longer fund partnerships. My constituents are also
concerned—my hon. Friend mentioned this—about potholes
and cuts to funding for other things that they see every day, such as
street lights. This is therefore an incredibly important

hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central drew on comments
from the Conservative leader of the Local Government Association, so it
is not just Opposition politicians who are raising concerns. Sir
Merrick Cockell said that the cuts were having a disproportionate
impact on some areas of the community. Recently in the House,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:14:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

were Robin Hood in reverse.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:15:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East simply suggested that
their impact was wicked. It is not just that funding is being cut. As
we all recognise, this is a time of rising pressures. In particular,
Members have talked about the costs of dealing with looked-after
children. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:15:20"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central highlighted the
11% growth in the number of looked-after children across the country, 
<?notus-xml column=226?>and the rate is higher in her area, as we might expect because of the
nature of her community. Clearly, it compounds the problem when such a
significant cut is meted out to her local authority.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth spoke
passionately, as she always does, about social care. She talked about
how the cut in the independent living fund is impacting people in her
community. Not only are local authorities meeting only severe needs,
but they are being forced to reassess elderly and vulnerable
constituents who were previously considered to have severe needs, and
are beginning to withdraw the services that those people had come to
rely on, leaving them incredibly worried.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:16:19"></hs_TimeCode> some cases,
that has perverse consequences. Local authority social care cuts are

considerable expertise in these matters, and I have heard her speak
frequently about them in the main Chamber. In my area, the A and E
crisis, which means that many people have to wait more than four hours,
is happening because the hospital is running “hot”. I do
not know whether you have heard that term in relation to your local
hospital, Mr Streeter, but it means that the beds are full, and that is
partly because there are no social care beds. The services that should
help people to return home are not being put in place properly or
quickly enough to do that. These things are very much linked, and I
hope the Minister will acknowledge that in a way that other
Conservative Members have failed to do in some of our debates on health
care, and on the impact of local authority funding cuts on a much
broader range of public services.</hs_Para>

Is he aware that when the Secretary of State acceded to his post, he is

localism and localities. Is it not therefore ironic that, by cutting

Sawford:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right that the sense of
regional awareness in places around the country is derived from all
sorts of things. Sometimes it is economic or cultural connectedness
going back over time, or derives from the links between industry across
an area. However, in some areas of the country, over time, some of that
sense of regional awareness has come from regions feeling that the
further away from London they are, the less the Government are
concerned about the people there, and the more unfairly they have been
treated. I am a strong supporter of the Better Together campaign. I
hope that Scotland and England remain together, as do many of my
Scottish constituents. However, it was not a huge surprise to me to see
only the other day a newspaper article saying, “If Scotland
goes, can you take the north with you?” People in the north feel
that the Government simply do not understand the impact of the
cuts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000083">Communities
are told to become more independent; the rationale that the Government
present to us is that they are over-reliant on central Government
funding. Communities are seeking to become more independent by
promoting their economies. What do the Government think is happening to
the economic development function of local authorities around the
country? What do the Government think has happened in the absence of
the strong role that One North East previously played in promoting
economic development in the north-east? That strong economic
development role, that drive that local authorities can provide, is no
longer there as it once was. I pay tribute to people such as the leader
of Newcastle city council, Nick Forbes, for trying to ensure 
<?notus-xml column=229?>that his city has a bright and economically prosperous future, but the

impact of the cuts falls on both statutory and non-statutory services.
Too often it is assumed that statutory services will be safe, as it is
by the permanent secretary to the Department, who says that because it
is written in law that councils have to balance the books, it will
happen. Too often it is also assumed—by campaigning
organisations and commentators on local authority finance—that
statutory services will continue to be provided and will be safe
because they are a legal requirement. However, the truth is that
councils are already having to look at the eligibility criteria. For
example, the duty placed on local authorities in the 1960s to provided
for an efficient library service will have to be interpreted in new
ways by local authorities in future. Frankly, it will have to be
interpreted in ways that do not meet local communities’ real
aspirations for those
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000085">We

upon Tyne Central, in Gateshead, there are iconic cultural attractions,
as indeed there are in Newcastle upon Tyne. As a student at Durham
university, I enjoyed the cultural offer in Newcastle many times. These
things are vital to local economies and to the health and vibrancy of
the community. They are part of what a prosperous community in the
21st century should be all about. Local authorities have a
vital role in enabling such things and ensuring that they are present
in a community, but we know that around the country they will be the

must be honest about what would have happened were a Labour Government

through the future jobs fund—to keep our vital industries going,
and to keep people in their homes to avoid the scandal of home
repossessions that we saw in Conservative recessions in previous
decades. The Government rightly tried to maintain jobs and the economy.
A Labour Government would have come into a period, in this Parliament,
in which we would need to look at how to balance the books. Our
proposals differ very much from the Government’s. The
Government’s proposals have gone far too far and go about things
in the wrong way. Front-loading has had a particular impact, resulting
in, for example, the perverse problems we have described in our health
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000087">Above
all, however, we know that the effect of the Government’s
proposals over three years was to grind the economy to a halt. We are
told that there has been a huge increase in private sector employment.
Many of those private sector jobs are transfers from the public sector,
because of the cuts in recent years. Where they are genuine private
sector jobs—indeed, where they are public sector
transfers—we often find that people are on zero-hours contracts,
employed through agencies in insecure jobs on low wages. The Government
have 
<?notus-xml column=230?>removed any enforcement of the protections afforded to those people.
They have less money in their pockets and are less able to contribute
to the local community, thereby compounding the problems that local
authorities face in their community leadership role around the country.
That has been the impact of the Government’s proposals. We
simply would not have done things in the same way, and we would not
have done things in such a fundamentally unfair
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000088">It

Corby in the midlands, but when we look at the map of the impact of
these measures across the country, it is clear that money is going from
north to south, and from poorer to more affluent areas. The Prime

least deprived in the country, ranking 316th out of 325 in the indices
of multiple deprivation. It is getting an increase in spending power of
3.1%; that is extraordinary. We know that this is not an accident, but
a deliberate strategy by the Government to shift funding. The problem

genuinely integrate services to make the public pound go further. We
will back local authorities in taking on new roles—in
back-to-work schemes, for example—that could be both financially
beneficial to the local authority, if the incentives are right, and
beneficial to our communities. There are opportunities for much better
dialogue. We need to review the new homes bonus, which is a mechanism
to shift resources around the country in an unfair way. I hope that
today the Minister will accept the scale of the crisis that his
Government have created, and will give us assurances that they will
listen to us on holdbacks and will accept the real need to review the
funding formula across the country, so that when the provisional
settlement is announced in just a few weeks’ time, it is
fairer.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_03_PT_1/5DF55A252500ECDFD3D420041EC858100DD223B7" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="3 December 2013">Tuesday

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Brandon Lewis):</Member></B> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr
Streeter. I congratulate the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne
Central (Chi Onwurah) on securing a debate on a matter that is clearly
important for her. It gives us the chance to air some important issues
about local government more generally.</hs_Para>

directly to the subject of the debate, I want to put it in context. The
shadow Minister commented on the size of local government, its funding
and the changes in funding. He made a comment about going too far and
too fast, which we have not heard for some time from the Opposition.
That comment seems incredible in the light of the current economic
situation, as the Government’s economic policy is clearly
working for the benefit of the country.</hs_Para>

to remember exactly how we got to where we are. The previous Government
left us with an unprecedented deficit, something this Government are
having to deal with. Local government accounts for 25% of public
expenditure, and so has a big part to play in those efforts.
Unfortunately, that is a part of the legacy that we took on from the
previous Government. Even today, we are still all wondering about the
£52 million—and growing—cuts that
Labour has stated that it would make to local government; despite what
the shadow Minister said, Labour has not yet outlined where those cuts
would come from, and the figure has continued to go up in some of its
recent pledges. We have to put the situation in some
context.</hs_Para>

Nicholas Brown:</Member></B> I do not accept the Minister’s
analysis, but for the purposes of debate, I will give him the benefit
of the doubt. If what he says is right, why is the burden of
expenditure reduction not being shared fairly across England? If
special measures to protect anyone should be taken, why are they not
being taken to protect the very poorest and most vulnerable—the
people whom local authorities have a statutory duty to look after? Why
is the burden not being shared fairly?</hs_Para>

Lewis:</Member></B> I will come to the issue outlined by the right hon.
Gentleman, but I remind him that the independent report, which is in
the Library, outlined that this year’s settlement was fair to
areas in the north and south, rural and urban. It is important to
remember the legacy that we inherited. My area—Great
Yarmouth—is in the east and, thanks to the previous
Government’s policy decisions, was left with a £3 million
black hole, which this Government have had to fix. When we talk about
spending power, we must remember that a Labour Government left my local
authority with what would have been a 20% cut in spending power in one
year— something this Government have had to deal
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000105">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:40:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T15:40:39"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Corby (Andy Sawford) mentioned councils such as West
Somerset. He might like to do a bit more research and homework on what
is going on in West Somerset and look at the work it is doing with its
neighbours, on which I congratulate it. More and more small district
authorities are moving to ensure that money on the front line is not
spent on bureaucracy and red-tape administration. Many small district
authorities particularly have budgets of under £20 million and
should be looking to share management and chief executives to ensure
that their taxpayers’ hard-earned money is spent on the services
that we all want and not on bureaucracy and red tape. It is logical for
authorities to do that. Instead of using childish language such as
“takeover”, Labour Members should realise that this is
about working in partnership and with efficiency for the benefit of
local
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000106">It
is important to understand that there has been a landmark change for
local government this year. After years of doffing their caps to
Whitehall, all councils now have the ability to control their own
destiny. In the midst of the clamour of deficit denial and
doom-mongering from some people, that message is in danger of not being
heard. The size of the deficit and the debt must be dealt with, and
local government is one of the biggest players in the public
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000107">I

Lewis:</Member></B> The hon. Lady’s point highlights where we
are. The current structure for local government is that councils will
benefit and see their income rise as a reward for the good work that
they do for their communities. I will touch on that
directly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000110">Manchester,
Liverpool and Newcastle all have higher spending power per dwelling
than the national average. When talking about what local areas have, it
is important to put that in the context of the starting point. The
average reduction in spending power is only 1.3% this 
<?notus-xml column=234?>year and we are protecting individual council tax payers by offering a
council tax freeze. We are protecting councils through the rates
retention scheme’s safety net, which generates a minimum level
for their baseline funding, which Newcastle will benefit from, although
it was unable to do so
previously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000111">The
settlement is fair because even for councils like mine, which now
benefits from the efficiency support grant, we have provided protection
for those who were hit worst by the policy decisions of the previous
Government, and that brings me to the important point of how the system
now works in a council’s favour. Following the Localism Act 2011
and financial reforms to the settlement, 70% of an authority’s
income is raised locally and, most importantly, the growth incentive
ensures that local government will keep up to 50% of all the growth
that it generates. Councils have more power than ever before, but they
must understand the implications. They must act in their
residents’ best interests and work hard on their behalf.
Redesigning council tax benefit to cut fraud, which costs around
£2 billion, promoting local enterprise and getting people back
into work, or redesigning services to make them more efficient and
sustainable, especially as there are still savings to be had across the
sector, all make a
difference.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000112">Some
cutting-edge councils understand that and lead by example in developing
good practice for the rest of the country to follow. Getting the ball
rolling can be the hardest part of radically overhauling local
services. The Government established the transformation challenge award
to help councils, particularly small ones, to demonstrate innovation,
to protect services and to reduce costs to the taxpayer. Just a few
months ago, I was pleased to announce 18 successful schemes, including
projects to accelerate the integration of local health and care
services, which hon. Members have outlined this afternoon, and to
create shared finance and human resources for emergency
services.</hs_Para>

Lewis:</Member></B> The whole point of the change in the structure of
local government finance is that council finance is partly in
councils’ control. That is why 40 authorities have
had an increase in their income this year alone. Today, a Labour
authority has predicted a £500,000 increase in its income over
the next couple of years, thanks to the business rate retention scheme.
Hon. Members should focus on their councils’ decisions on what
services they provide locally. Some £3.8 billion 
<?notus-xml column=235?>is going to local councils to ensure that they can deal with adult
social care in a joined-up way, without creating further
bureaucracy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000116">Local
government has shown great skill in moving forward. The Audit
Commission and a recent survey noted that residents believe that
services have improved. Our community and neighbourhood budgets show

to the future, I recognise that councils are facing pressures. That is
why the spending review set out a package of measures to support them
in 2015-16, including the £3.8 billion pool of funding for
integrated health and social care, which will help to ensure that
services in the care and support system can be protected and will
enable authorities to invest in prevention and early
intervention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000118">We

Friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams)
about the impact of the funding changes on different councils in the

councils have to direct their own funding. Will he specifically say
whether he supports the principle of holding back funding, as has been

Lewis:</Member></B> I tell the hon. Lady again that what a local
council does with its funding is a matter that she must put to her
local authority. Councils must make the decisions about how they spend
the money that they have. There is no point continuing to look at silo
pots of money. The point of spending power is that it shows exactly
what a local council has in total to spend on its local community. In
Newcastle, the amount is one of the highest in the country. It is also
why it is important that we offer support to people individually as
well. We are pleased to be able to offer further support for council
tax freezes in 2014-15 and 2015-16. We have been clear that if an
authority wants to raise its council tax, it should do so with the
assent of the public in a referendum locally. It needs to be able to
explain to residents what it wants that money for and to convince
residents of its case.</hs_Para>

is worth adding that in many cases, councils have more in reserves than
they are losing through cutbacks. Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds all
have reserves that are twice that of their spending power reductions.
Indeed, this year, Newcastle has had substantial reserves. It is also
important to note that local authorities will be spending about
£4 billion extra this year across the country—well over
the £100 billion of last year. It is 
<?notus-xml column=236?>also worth noting that local authorities have managed to increase
reserves to a record level, going up by almost £3 billion to
£19 billion. With that and the £2 billion in fraud and
error, and with a further £2 billion in uncollected council tax,
there is still a long way for local authorities to go before they can
claim that they have done everything to drive out waste and
bureaucracy.</hs_Para>

are in a new world for local government. The funding settlement used to
be the endgame; now, it is just the starting point, with councils no
longer tied to the settlement figures. They can get to earn their keep
and retain £11 billion of business rates. That could deliver an
extra £10 billion to our wider economy. It is worth noting that
areas such as Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle all saw business
rates rise above the national average of 4.8% in recent years. However,
thanks to the old begging bowl system, they missed out on the
opportunity of making the most of that money—but no longer. From
now on, it will be what councils make and not what they take that
counts. If they bring in more businesses, more jobs and more homes,
they will be rewarded. If they build those new homes through the new
homes bonus, they will see a share of that money, which is worth
£650 million this year and is growing. If they increase their
business rates, they will retain some of the benefit of that
increase.</hs_Para>

the message to councils is clear: if they are ambitious, become
self-reliant and work hard on behalf of their local people, they will
succeed and see the benefits. We want authorities to go further and
faster, so that residents feel those benefits. We want to help and
reward those who do the right thing and are innovative. Our funding
approaches, as has been outlined independently, are fair for north and
south, urban and rural, and rich and poor. I gently say to hon. Members

ever, it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Streeter.
Before I start, I need to declare an interest: my husband is a
non-executive director of a social enterprise that runs some Government
contracts. However, the focus of my concern is small and medium-sized
enterprises, and I am delighted to have secured this debate on their
behalf.</hs_Para>

interest in the issue stems from my work as a member of the Public
Accounts Committee and from my many conversations with businesses in my
constituency and elsewhere. The Minister will be aware of the

want to focus mostly on how Government contracts work for small and

large companies that have a grip on the delivery of public sector
contracts. Whether they run prisons, maintenance, security or hospital

business that both recent Governments have embraced, worth billions of
pounds a year. Government talk the talk about supporting small
businesses, but unless they are willing to lead from the front, the

those innovative businesses face different hurdles when it comes to
Government contracts. The hurdles set by civil servants, most of whom,
as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge, have never run a business,
big or small—that is not intended as a criticism; it is just a
fact—are so cumbersome that most small businesses cannot comply
with them. The automatic setting in Government is to be as risk averse
as possible, and that sets in train in contracting a vicious and
uncompetitive circle that is well-nigh impossible for new businesses to
break into. Of course, I share a desire, as I am sure the Government
do, to make sure that the taxpayer is not taking on undue risk, but
balance is needed.</hs_Para>

spin-off benefits, too, for the wider economy that the Government
should be aware of. Research shows that every £1 of business
with an SME generates 63p to the local economy, whereas with large
businesses—those employing more than 250 people—only 40p
is generated in the local economy. Both are worth aiming for, but for a
Government who say they support business, the question is whether they
only support big business.</hs_Para>

need to see a step change in how Government work with smaller
businesses. Specifically, we need shorter procurement
processes—again, that is the risk aversion coming in to
play—and a serious step change in how contracts are drawn up.
When a contract includes 150 key performance indicators, as we heard at
the PAC the other week, it suggests a serious lack of critical focus.
There also needs to be a sensible approach to how Government
Departments and businesses can meet outside formal contract
negotiations and learn what each has to offer. I think the Minister
would have some very exciting meetings in Shoreditch if he were able to
visit.</hs_Para>

contract management has become unnecessarily complicated. The advent of
G-Cloud is a help—I was pleased to welcome an official from
G-Cloud to Shoreditch not that long ago—although local
businesses in Shoreditch tell me that it is still cumbersome. For
many—this is about the language sometimes spoken between
Government and businesses—the very word
“Government” in front of a contract suggests a minefield
that is hard to navigate compared with other sectors, and indeed, other
countries with which they do business. That is the challenge.
Sometimes, it is just a different language that is being spoken, but
the Cabinet Office and the Minister are now supposed to be capturing
and sharing knowledge and best practice within projects, across
projects in a Department and across Departments.</hs_Para>

Hillier:</Member></B> My hon. Friend raises an important point.
Contract monitoring is often more of a box-ticking exercise. When there
are 150 key performance indicators, it is difficult to know whether
someone is watching the overall performance of the contract, and
sometimes the contracts are drawn up in such a complicated way that it
is very difficult to shift meaningfully. In the building world, for
example, there are attempts by housing associations and contractors to
partner, so that they work together to acknowledge where there might
need to be a change for more improvement. I hope that the Minister
would acknowledge that there needs to be great improvement. The Major
Projects Authority is doing some good work in that area, but it deals
with the major projects. Many Government contracts are much smaller
than that, which is one of the big challenges. Building a warship is
one thing; letting a small IT contract is
another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:04:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000155">Crucially,
all of this—what my hon. Friend talked about and what I have
talked about—cannot just be left to Departments. We know that
procurement managers come in various forms. Some are not very expert. I
remember as a Minister saying to one official who had led two projects
that came in ahead of time and under budget and that delivered very

that councils often join forces to procure for longer

case that small businesses do not meet the requirement that the value
of the contract be not more than 25% of their annual 
<?notus-xml column=242?>income. That is an example of a hidden barrier that could be avoided if
the threshold were for the annual value of the contract, rather than
the whole contract over the longer period. I am not sure whether the
Cabinet Office is aware of that. I hope that the Minister is. Does it

is fair to say that there has been some progress by both recent
Governments in paying contractors much faster, but late payment can be
a big issue for smaller companies if they are a subcontractor down the

contractors to pay their subcontractors within 30 days of receipt of
payment from Government? If the Government are paying on time, there
should be no excuse for that payment not being sent down the line to
the smaller contractors on time as well. I hope that the Minister can

of that and what they are planning to do to ensure that it does not
happen in future. It had a big impact on local supply chains and,
crucially, on small and medium-sized businesses’ confidence.
There is such cynicism out there. If the Minister were able to come to

heard about repeatedly from solvent and successful businesses. When
smaller businesses join forces to bid for a contract—often in a

accounts, which they cannot provide because they have never worked
together before. Even when they are able to get around that by
providing projected accounts, they need to spend up to £6,000 on
accountancy fees to do that. It is right that due diligence takes
place, but could that hurdle be introduced later in the bidding, when a
consortium knows that it is in the running? The up-front costs can

extremely important, not least given the state of the public finances
and the situation that we inherited. It is important to recognise where
we started. As I think the hon. Lady recognised, what we might call the
outsourced public service market was entirely dominated by large
private sector organisations, and small companies had little room to
come in and improve the situation. I recognise a lot of her analysis
about how off-putting and complex the whole concept of bidding for
Government contracts is for those running a small business, which I

not know how much they spent with major suppliers. I am glad that the
hon. Lady referred to the fact that the Minister for the Cabinet Office

Maude), has been in post since the start of the process, because that
has made a great deal of difference. We are trying to drive a culture
change across the system, and he has been extraordinarily persistent in
trying to achieve that. The results of the work of the Efficiency and
Reform Group, which we created, have been dramatic. We saved the
taxpayer £10 billion last year alone compared with 2010, of
which £3.8 billion came from commercial areas and £800
million from better engaging with strategic suppliers. There was no
rocket science involved; the Government simply woke up to the fact that
we sit on top of a powerful buying machine, which makes it possible to
secure much better terms. We can leverage our scale to get better value

quickly.</hs_Para>

we are trying to improve that—to touch on a point alluded to by
the hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch—not least by
instilling much greater commercial capability and confidence in the
system. A saving of £10 billion in one year is an important
improvement, which is equivalent to about £600 per UK household.
That is real money, which has real-world impact. Within that, we have

enterprises feel they have more space and a level playing field on

times, and we have cut the length of the average procurement by 40%,
which makes the UK faster, we think, than any of our European

heart of the civil service, so 1,800 officials have already been

have said, and get smarter at managing performance. For the first time,
the Government have allowed past performance to be taken into account
when bids for new work are evaluated. It is astonishing that that has
not happened before. Suppliers can now be rated high risk when there
are material performance concerns, and we have introduced a new
approach for managing gross misconduct. Our long-term goal remains the
creation of a vibrant, competitive marketplace. Where bad practice is

taxpayers’ money more choice and more access to the innovation
that we desperately need. She talked about procurement time, and, as I
have said, we have reduced the average turnaround time from advert to
contract award by more than 40% to 100 working days. That is better
than France and better than Germany. Within that, small procurements
can be much quicker, and we are keen to continue to improve. Some

an undertaking to feed it into the system as we look at the model

passionately about the need to open up more opportunities for SMEs, and
I assure her that we are committed to doing so. She challenged me to
get beyond mere words, and those are 
<?notus-xml column=246?>not just words; we can now talk about numbers. Since 2010, overall spend
from Government with SMEs has increased by £1.5 billion, which
is serious money. We are not concerned simply about the relentless
pursuit of value for money for the taxpayer. Given the recent economic
circumstances and the search for growth, it is in the interests of the
taxpayer and the country that we support growth where it can be
generated. As we all know, SMEs are the engine of growth in the
economy, so the agenda is extremely important.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:19:44"></hs_TimeCode>As she knows,
the Government set out an aspiration that 25% of Government spending
should go to SMEs. Although the data are not perfect—I would not

hon. Lady talked about IT in particular. I know she has a specific
constituency interest there. We are keen to break down Government
contracts in IT into smaller sizes, which is essential if we are to
capture the value that the SME community can bring. The massive
differences in prices between the old suppliers producing old
technology the old way and what can be done now through new technology
are absolutely extraordinary. We are determined to break such contracts
open. New presumptions are set against information and
communications technology contracts worth more than £100 million
and we have published an ICT strategy that explicitly supports smaller,
more disaggregated approaches. We have also launched CloudStore. Some
58% of the first £54.5 million spent on CloudStore went to SMEs,
which benefited from 66% of sales by number. Interestingly, the Foreign
Office is a good example of success; rather than have a single ICT
provider, it has split a single contract into three. G-Cloud has around
1,000 SMEs on it, which have won 66% of contract awards by number.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:21:12"></hs_TimeCode> have also

84% of suppliers. I hope I can assure her that, in that space, there

authorities, so they can improve their procurement practice and, in
particular, make it easier for SMEs to participate. We shall
relentlessly bear down on the need for pre-qualification questionnaires
below a certain threshold of contract. Contracts Finder has been
enormously popular. It contains all opportunities worth more than
£10,000. More that 19,000 contracts have been published online

Government pay all undisputed invoices within five days. We have
mandated prime contractors to pay subcontractors within 30 days,
through the inclusion of a contract condition in the contracts we
write. The new model contract I mentioned will reinforce that, because
it is enormously important. We recently consulted on Lord

building commercial capability and contract management in Whitehall.
Too much of the capability, resource, process and thinking has been
directed at the procurement process, and not at the broader
commissioning process and the need to monitor and work with the supply

Streeter, to have the opportunity to debate this topic this afternoon.
I have been aware of the issue for a long time. Roaccutane raises a lot
of understandable passion among those who are directly affected. It is
a form of the drug isotretinoin, used to treat severe acne and
manufactured by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche. It was licensed for
use in the UK 30 years ago, in 1983. Since then, in the UK alone, it
has been implicated in reports of 878 psychiatric disorders, including
44 suspected
suicides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000195">Next
month, in January, it will be 10 years since my constituents’
son, Jon Medland, tragically took his own life while studying for a
medical degree in Manchester. Having heard of its
“miraculous” effects, Jon began taking Roaccutane to
clear a relatively mild case of acne. Just three and a half weeks
later, he died, having transformed from a successful, outgoing, happy
young man to a withdrawn and depressed individual. Jon had never
suffered from depression. Everything in his case points to an adverse
reaction to the medicine. As the coroner

to Mr Derek Jones after reading an article in <I>The Mail on Sunday</I>

my limited medical expertise, but the logic of what he is describing
sounds convincing. The other point to be made about the delay in some
cases is that the numbers on the incidence of suicide and psychotic
disorder that I quoted a few minutes ago are highly likely to be gross
underestimates. For example, just this morning, I had a telephone call
from someone in Cornwall who had heard a morning bulletin on his local
BBC radio station referring to this debate. He said that for the first
time, the penny dropped with him. He had attempted suicide and been
forced out of the Royal Navy, but he had never before put the two
things together. With the benefit of many years’ hindsight, he
realised that it happened just months after he had used Roaccutane to
deal with acne. I therefore think that it is fair to say that we are
looking at numbers far greater than we first
thought.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000202"><Member ContinuationText="Caroline Nokes" PimsId="5614" UID="13120364000328" xid="1135" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000328"><B>Caroline

deal more research is needed. My point in raising the matter with
Government through my hon. Friend the Minister is that I cannot see who
other than a public authority could initiate or, indeed, fund such
research. It is certainly not in the manufacturer’s interest;
Roche clings to the notion that millions of people have been treated
with the drug without side effects or mishap. That may be perfectly
true, but it does not alter the fact that, for those who have suffered
a serious side effect, the impact has been devastating. I ask again:

principle?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000204"><Member ContinuationText="Mike Thornton" PimsId="6006" UID="13120364000330" xid="1245" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000330"><B>Mike

States is interesting. As we know, the United States has a much more
litigious culture than we do in the UK, and the manufacturer there has
paid out to a patient on quite a large scale. That patient suffered
different side effects, but the manufacturer nevertheless had to pay
out. That, combined with the fact that generic versions 
<?notus-xml column=250?>of the drug are now available on the US market, has caused the
manufacturer to withdraw altogether from the US
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000206">While
we are discussing the attitude of Roche, it is worth noting that the
information in the drug’s packaging includes explicit warnings
about the possible psychological side effects, including incidences of
suicide. If Roche acknowledges that to the extent of being willing to
put it on the information, it seems to be recognising that for all the
millions who may have used it successfully, a cohort of the population
has nevertheless suffered as a result of using the drug.</hs_Para>

continuum of that is the ultimate withdrawal of the drug altogether.
Rationally, I do not think that we can ask the Government to move
straight to that in one go, much as I would like them to. Were they to
attempt to go down that path, in no time at all they would find
themselves locked in some sort of litigation with Roche, which would
certainly not stand by and watch a major market like the UK ban its
product. The court would expect the Government to demonstrate
overwhelming scientific evidence, which I do not believe is available
as yet. That is why, as a first step, I am calling for such scientific
research to take

that they may not be as effective, but they include antibiotics and a
variety of other treatments. Unless and until we have some way to
predict which people are most likely to suffer catastrophic side
effects, I would prefer on the precautionary principle that no one at
all took the drug. If we could predict with some
certainty—whether by means of genetics or whatever—who
might be predisposed to such side effects, then and only then might it
be safe to argue that anyone without such a predisposition could safely
use the drug, but we are nowhere near that yet. I suffered from acne
and was prescribed antibiotics for 11 years or so to deal with it. It
is a miserable business—no one would make any bones about
that—but there are other treatments, and the catastrophic
consequences for some people of using the drug suggest that we would be
better off without it.</hs_Para>

at the available scientific and anecdotal evidence that establishes a
link between the drug and the effects that I have described.
Roa<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:39:42"></hs_TimeCode>ccutane is a
vitamin A-related compound that has long been known to cause
psychiatric side effects. Reports of users experiencing depression have
continually surfaced, so much so that in the USA the Food and Drug
Administration forced Roche to produce safety warnings about Roaccutane
as long ago as 1998. The following year, an Irish study found that
users of the drug were 900 times more likely to suffer from depressive
symptoms than patients being treated for acne with
antibiotics.</hs_Para>

many studies since that time have provided limited evidence, they have
often been too small to be viewed as conclusive. However, I want to
mention two that stand out. First, in 2005, Dr Doug Bremner from
Atlanta university published a study using brain imaging before and
after four months of treatment with Roaccutane. The images clearly
showed an impact on brain function, associating the drug with a
decrease in function of the frontal lobe—a part of the brain
that regulates emotion. Secondly, Dr Sarah Bailey from Bath university
undertook studies on young adult mice and rats. When the animals were
put through a “forced swim” test, where they were placed
in water, those on Roaccutane spent longer being immobile, without
attempting to escape, than those on antibiotics—a change in
behaviour consistent with depression-related behaviour in the
animals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:41:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, humans and mice are very different and therefore much more
research is necessary. However, at the very least Dr Bailey’s
findings should be seen as a caution to doctors prescribing the
drug<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:41:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120364000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/halltext/131203h0002.htm#13120364000215">These
studies simply are not enough. It is evident that not everyone who
takes Roaccutane develops depression, but there is clearly a vulnerable
population of patients who do. Investigations just have not gone far
enough to find out why that group is vulnerable, but such research is
vital. Surely, before we lose more young lives to the psychological
impact of the drug, there is a clear case for further study on a larger
scale.</hs_Para>

consistently says that it does not know the mechanism by which the drug
actually works. Therefore, one might conclude that it is none the wiser
about, or perhaps is not interested in, how these side effects work.
However, one cannot ignore the fact that isotretinoin—I cannot
pronounce it properly—is the only drug not designed to affect
mental state that features in the USA’s top 10 list of drugs
associated with
depression<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-03T16:42:32"></hs_TimeCode>. In
response to the idea of a link between Roaccutane and depression, many
people have suggested that the victims were already depressed because
of their acne. While acne may indeed reduce self-esteem—many
acne sufferers will know what I mean by that—it is an
exaggeration to generally describe people who suffer from acne as being
in the grip of depression.</hs_Para>

Medland, my constituent, had no history of depression. Similarly, the
heartbreaking suicide note of James Sillcock, who died last year, told
how he had “loved” his life, but it also said that
Roaccutane had “changed his world completely”.
Worryingly, a European Medicines Agency report in 2003 confirmed that
discontinuing the drug may not be enough to alleviate adverse
reactions. That was certainly true in a number of suicide cases, where
young people realised they were “not themselves” and
stopped the course of treatment, only to find themselves falling deeper
and deeper into depression afterwards, which comes back to the point I
was making earlier.</hs_Para>

Ultimately, we may never know how many people have been affected.
Roaccutane was linked to nine suicide cases between September 2010 and
September 2011, but with suicide such a sensitive topic, we can imagine
that some victims’ families have not come forward. Indeed,
others may not have realised the full picture—that the container
of insignificant-looking pills, kept in the bathroom, for a few spots
could have led someone to take their life in a state of

is also worth mentioning again that Roche has pulled Roaccutane from
the US market. The drug first came on to the market for chemotherapy
and then was marketed to a wider audience when its acne-curing
properties became apparent. A number of doctors have been keen to argue
that it is being overprescribed as a first-line treatment; it is only
supposed to be used after at least two other medicines have been tried.

1998, there has been increasing awareness that Roaccutane may be
associated with psychiatric adverse reactions, particularly depression
and suicidal behaviour. The assessment of this issue has been
complicated by the fact that young people with acne are already at an
increased risk of depression, regardless of treatment. All psychiatric
adverse reactions were assessed by the working group on isotretinoin in
2005. This working group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines
consisted of independent experts, including psychiatrists and
dermatologists, who considered the available data from published
literature and case reports. All new information on psychiatric adverse
reactions has remained under close and regular review since that

history of depression, and that all patients should be monitored for
signs of depression and referred for appropriate treatment if

Association of Dermatologists has published guidelines for its members
on when to prescribe Roaccutane and how best to monitor patients for
adverse effects during treatment. The guidelines recommend that
patients be asked about any previous psychiatric illness, and the
patient and their family should be made aware that the medicine may

October 2011 the Department also issued traffic sign authorisations to
all local authorities in England that relaxed the design requirements
for 20 mph zones, giving local authorities more flexibility in how they
install them. These authorisations are available from:
http://www.dft.gov.uk/traffic-auths/. DFT Circular 01/13 makes
particular reference to schools, and traffic authorities have powers to
introduce 20 mph speed limits that apply only at certain times of day.
I have also provided a special authorisation for every English traffic
authority to place an advisory part-time 20 mph limit sign, with
flashing school warning lights. This can be a more cost-effective
solution, where appropriate, and reduces the requirement for
signing.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="593"><?date 2013-12-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_03_PT_1/D085DCBB32A5883B7092F2A5A1158F86072D964C" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="3 December 2013">Tuesday

Control in Kashmir. The long-standing position of successive British
Governments on Kashmir has been that it is for India and Pakistan to

Eustice:</Member></B> No specific assessment has been made by
Government on the extent of horse welfare problems in specific parts of
the country. However, the most recent estimates by welfare
organisations suggest that there may be 2,500 horses being fly-grazed
in England. There is a range of existing legislation that can be used
to deal with fly-grazing including the Animals Act 1971 and the Animal
Welfare Act 2006. In addition, because fly grazing is a form of
antisocial behaviour, existing antisocial behaviour legislation and
forthcoming measures in the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing
Bill may be used to tackle it. We consider the practical answer lies in
tackling local issues through effective use of existing and forthcoming
legislation together with sharing best practice and joined-up working
by interested
parties.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13120378000015" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/text/131203w0001.htm#13120378000015">Food:

The figures have been produced by an electronic count of the Ordnance
Survey Address Layer (AL) 2 Postal Points. This is derived from Royal
Mail data based on any property with a postal address. The OS AL2
dataset may not capture all the properties that are partially within
the RSZ boundaries as the point for each property is located at the
centre of each property parcel. The property parcel is the footprint of
the building and any associated land (e.g. garden or farm land) and
this may be within the RSZ boundary, however the centre may be outside.
In this instance, the property would not be counted. The AL2 Postal
Point layer contains all properties with a postal address—this
would exclude plots of land such as roads, allotments, derelict
industrial land etc. All 'PO BOX' entries were removed before
calculations
run.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table></TableWrapper><hs_8Question UID="13120378000019" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/text/131203w0001.htm#13120378000019">M18</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13120378000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/text/131203w0001.htm#13120378000105"><B><Member PimsId="1343" UID="13120378001235" xid="313" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/text/131203w0001.htm#13120378001235">Sir

2013 annual canvass is still being carried out and will be completed
with publication of the revised register by 17 February 2014 in England
and by 10 March 2014 in Scotland and Wales. The Commission required all
EROs to report on their performance prior to the start of the canvass,
to confirm that arrangements were in place for the necessary house to
house enquiries to be carried out, and has intervened where issues were
identified and recommended improvements to be made before the
completion of the canvass. In March 2014, the Commission will make a
final assessment of performance for 2013, including an assessment of
performance against performance standard 3, and will report on its
conclusions.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_03_PT_1/272870DC51D1A8934EE29CC43AAA0BF4C04B8693" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="3 December 2013">Tuesday

Vara:</Member></B> A more diverse judiciary is important in retaining
the public’s confidence and trust in justice, and better
reflecting the society it serves. The Government has made a number of
changes through the Crime and Courts Act 2013 that we believe will
promote judicial diversity. We have introduced part time working in the
senior courts, including the Supreme Court, we have enabled the equal
merit provision for judicial appointments to allow protected
characteristics to be taken into account where two applicants are of
equal merit, and a statutory duty for the Lord Chancellor and Lord
Chief Justice to encourage judicial
diversity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120378000828" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/text/131203w0002.htm#13120378000828">In
order to protect the confidentiality of applicants, the diversity of
applicants is not presented in recruitment exercises with fewer than 10
recommendations. This is consistent with the arrangements for official
statistics published about judicial selection. As a result, results for
Supreme Court, Heads of Division, masters, registrars, cost judges and
district judges (Principal Registry of the Family Division), deputy
masters, deputy registrars, deputy costs judges and deputy district
judges (Principal Registry of the Family Division), will not be
presented. In addition, there were no recruitment exercises for judge
advocates or deputy judge advocates in the time period
covered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120378000829" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/text/131203w0002.htm#13120378000829">There
is no central record of this information for magistrates and to provide
it would be at a disproportionate cost. It would require 47 local JP
advisory committees to check the individual records of at least 6,000
applicants at an estimated cost of £12,500. The departmental
threshold for refusal of a request for information on the

Wright:</Member></B> The Probation Victim Contact Scheme (VCS), which
was established in 2001, provides valuable support to victims of
offenders who receive a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more
or a hospital order for a violent or sexual offence. The VCS enables
victims to be informed of key stages of an offender's sentence, such as
if they are transferred to open conditions or released. Victims also
have the statutory right to make representations about the licence
conditions to which the offender should be subject on
release, to reassure and protect
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120378000911" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/text/131203w0002.htm#13120378000911">In
cases where the offender's case is reviewed by the Parole Board,
victims have a right to submit a victim personal statement to the
Parole Board, setting out the impact of the offence against them, and
what the impact of release will be. If the Parole Board holds an oral
hearing, victims can apply to read their statement to the Parole Board
panel. While the final decision will be for the Chair of the Parole
Board panel, the presumption is that victims will be permitted to
attend. The new Victims' Code, which was published on 20 October 2013,
enshrines the entitlement for victims to make a VPS to the Parole
Board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120378000912" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/text/131203w0002.htm#13120378000912">Eligible
victims will be referred to probation trusts after sentence by the
joint Police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) witness care units,
unless the victim elects not to receive the VCS. Victims who do not
wish to opt in immediately are made aware they can do so at any time
during the offender's sentence. The National Offender Management
Service (NOMS) has worked with the CPS to update guidance to staff
reminding them of the need to offer and explain the VCS to eligible
victims.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120378000913" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131203/text/131203w0002.htm#13120378000913">The

are eligible to receive the services of the VCS are provided with all

staff have been called to attend incidents at less than half of the

has been fairly consistent over the years in question, though there has
been a slight rise in the number of callouts over recent months. This
is mainly due to minor incidents such as prisoners protesting by
climbing onto the netting between landings. NTRG staff have the
specialist skills required to deal with such incidents which accounted
for 69% of all the callouts in the past year, and they are frequently
called to attend as a precautionary measure. Not all callouts result in
engagement by NTRG staff, with a number of situations being resolved
locally. Of the all the incidents NTRG attended up to 31 October 2013,
76% were resolved by surrender. There has been no rise in the number of

majority of Ministry of Justice funding for provision of

Under this model, support for victims in local areas is provided based
on numbers of police and self referrals received, and the number and
types of positive needs identified with victims on an individual basis.

the court based witness

forces is informed by assumptions made within the current Strategic
Defence and Security Review (SDSR). We have been clear that they will
be expected to deploy in a range of roles covering the tasks and

precise regularity, duration or tempo of potential future operations,
it is equally difficult to predict the regularity of reservist

if the Ministry of Defence is engaged on major operations, our
estimate—as set out in the Defence Reform Bill's impact

repaid. the requirement to repay a crisis loan remains until the full
amount has been paid back and, in some cases, the loans take many years
to be recovered fully. Consequently, there are no formal figures for
defaulted crisis loans in each year, only outstanding expenditure yet
to be recovered. Table 1 shows the proportion of crisis loan

We also held many workshops around the country in 2011 and 2012 with
