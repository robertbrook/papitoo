in visits by schools and over 2,000 schools and hundreds of thousands

Government who in 2012 for the first time introduced a
requirement—a duty—in the NHS that mental health issues
should have parity with physical health issues, and that must of course
be reflected in the way that clinical commissioning groups commission
services. There is a structural issue, however, that I experienced when
I was Health Secretary and that I fear continues. Many of the services
that are commissioned and paid for from NHS providers are paid for
under a tariff. Therefore, if somebody requires treatment, the provider
gets paid for that, but as a consequence, the clinical commissioning
group—mental health services are substantially not on
tariff—gets a block grant. After the tariff expenditure has been
calculated by the commissioners, the amount available for the block
grant is often being squeezed. That is why mental health providers
wanted a tariff basis, although they have not yet got it consistently.
I hope the commissioners, NHS England and Monitor will continue to make
progress on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121257000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0001.htm#13121257000046"><Member ContinuationText="Pauline Latham" PimsId="5673" UID="13121257000158" xid="1113" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0001.htm#13121257000158"><B>Pauline

proposal is not a final determination, as the pay element is subject to
a statutory review. We have made progress: in July, there was a package
that would have cost more. IPSA has tried, as he will see in
today’s publication, not to increase the cost of politics. Since
it put the new scheme of costs and expenses in place, the cumulative
reduction in total cost in the past three years is £35.8
million, so the cost of politics is being reduced. The Government are
doing their bit. The Prime Minister and his colleagues reduced
Ministers’ pay by 5%, compared with our predecessors, at the
start of this Government, and that has been frozen for the life of this
Parliament. There is a particular point relating to IPSA’s
judgment on MPs’ pay at a time of continuing pay restraint in
the public sector, on which it has to listen to party
leaders.</hs_Para>

Saturday was a big success in the borough of Kettering last week, when

supporting the campaign by the Federation of Small Businesses to keep

2011 that where free school meals are provided to primary pupils,
educational attainment has improved, particularly among children from
less affluent families. Studies also show that where universal free
school meals have been provided, there are social and behavioural
benefits to the children and they are more likely to eat healthily
during the school day. We also know, of course, the risks associated
with poor diet and childhood obesity, so in addition to the measures
the Deputy Prime Minister has announced and that the Government will
bring in from next September, I was pleased to see the latest figures
on the national child measurement programme showing the overall obesity
level of children coming into reception classes is down on what it was
in the previous year, and lower than in
2006.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121257000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0001.htm#13121257000097"><Member ContinuationText="Fiona Mactaggart" PimsId="1635" UID="13121257000208" xid="400" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0001.htm#13121257000208"><B>Fiona

which gives the Secretary of State for Health a kind of Henry VIII

to make the Select Committee statement, it might be helpful to the
House if I explained briefly the new procedure, to which it agreed only
recently. In essence, the pattern is the same as for a ministerial
statement. Sir Alan will speak to his subject for up to  10
minutes—there is no obligation to take all that
time —during which no interventions may be taken. At the
conclusion of his statement, I will call Members who rise to put
questions to Sir Alan on the subject of his statement and call Sir Alan
to respond to those in  turn. Members can expect to be called
only once. These interventions should be questions and should be brief.
Front Benchers may take part in the questioning. The Backbench Business
Committee does have the power to impose a maximum time limit on a
statement and the exchanges that follow, but on this occasion it has
chosen not to do so. I call the Chair of the Liaison Committee, Sir

effectiveness, resources and powers. This report relates to public

concerns among Select Committees about how contracts are managed by
Government Departments. That was one of the themes of our evidence
session with the Prime Minister in September. We questioned him on a
range of examples of poor Whitehall contract management, from the
electronic monitoring of offenders to rural broadband and the west
coast main line. We pressed the Prime Minister on the significant
evidence that the civil service is not equipped to support consistent
contract management and tends to be driven by short-term pressures

different role that the civil service is now expected to carry out. It
requires different skills and places new demands on the way that
Whitehall works, and it is not just about civil servants. The role of
Ministers needs to be examined. In our view, that requires a

the Haldane doctrine of ministerial accountability. The Haldane model,

carried out by the civil service or contracted out. There has been no
independent examination of the civil service since the Fulton
committee’s report of 1968. That committee was expressly
excluded from consideration of the relationship between Ministers and

Government should ask Parliament to establish a parliamentary
commission into the civil service and that it should be a Joint
Committee of both Houses, on the same lines as the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards. It is right for Parliament to consider
the state of the civil service. The Constitutional Reform and
Governance Act 2010 clearly established the principle that
responsibility now lies with Parliament rather than being a matter for
the royal prerogative. A parliamentary commission could draw on the
extensive experience of Government and the civil service in both Houses
and its conclusions would enjoy cross-party

to be more personalisation of senior appointments in the civil

been given to the size, quantity and value of private contractors

my Justice Committee and himself provides evidence of the valuable work
that can be done in Select Committees. The extent to which services
should be either carried out directly by Government or contracted out
to the private sector is a matter of legitimate political argument,
although Governments of quite different political persuasions have
extended the role of the private sector in that regard. One thing that
united Select Committee Chairs from different political backgrounds was
the point that the civil service must have the necessary

service that is capable of not only telling truth to power, but
carrying out the decisions that democratically elected Governments
make. Getting that balance right exercised the Northcote-Trevelyan

fishing is still extremely important. The industry is responsible for
about 1% of GDP. There are about 6,500 vessels in the fishing fleet
throughout the UK. It still employs 12,500 fishermen, nearly 7,000 in
England and Wales, 5,000 in Scotland, and 700 in Northern Ireland. It
is clearly an industry that benefits the country in a range of ways,
not just economically—for example, the health properties of fish
are well known. It is important that we keep a vibrant and viable
fishing
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000034">Of
the top 10 ports for landings in the UK, three are in England and seven
are in Scotland. That shows the strength of the Scottish fleet.
Peterhead, which on last year’s figures landed over 110,000
tonnes of fish, is way ahead of every other port. Given the volume of
fish landed in Peterhead, it is no surprise that the Grampian region,
where my constituency is, dominates the processing industry, along with
Humberside. My own city of Aberdeen was once the No. 1 port, but that
was many years ago, and most of the harbour where the fishing boats
used to deliver fish is now given over to the oil and gas industry.
That is a very significant
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000035">I

killed in the industry in the performance of their work. The latest
figures I have are for 2012 and they show an improvement. Six deaths
and 44 reportable injuries are slightly below the norm for the
industry, but that is still a serious number of accidents. I know that
efforts are being made, supported by Government, to improve the safety

problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000036">I
want to focus on two issues that are of major concern to the industry.
The first is the serious consequences of the impasse between us, the
European Union and Iceland with regard to the way in which Iceland and,
to a lesser extent, the Faroes have been exploiting the mackerel and
pelagic fish in their area. The Minister will by now be well aware of
the processes that take place during the fishing year: surveys are
conducted and data collected and analysed, and the results are passed
on to scientists, who give us advice on the health of stocks and what
tonnages may be fished. The European Commission then presents us with a
policy statement of intention and approach, and we go through a few
more stages before conducting negotiations with Norway about the common
species we share. The Administrations of Iceland and the Faroes are
also involved in that.</hs_Para>

negotiations with Norway have not taken place this year, so it would be
helpful if the Minister could give an indication of when they are
likely to be held. The industry’s view is that there will be no
opportunity for the Commission to discuss the quotas and decide on the
total allowable catches until the bilateral discussions with Norway and
other countries have taken
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000038">The
likeliest estimate, according to the reports I have read, is that that
will happen towards the end of January. That means that our fishing
fleet is expected to cope and survive through the difficulties they
face for a whole month of the fishing year without knowing what their
TACs are for the year. It is important to know exactly when discussions
will be held with Norway in particular, and when the TACs will be
fixed, so that there can be some certainty. Many of the boats require
refurbishment and maintenance and some fleets even need to acquire new
boats, so those figures are crucial for them to be able to get the
necessary loans and help from the
banks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000039">This
is a major problem for those based onshore. Aberdeen cannot be said to
have a fleet anymore—it is virtually non-existent—but it
is still a big centre for processing and our processors depend on the
stocks that are brought ashore. Given that the fish are among the most
popular in sales terms—including cod, haddock, North sea
herring, North sea mackerel, whiting, plaice and saithe—a chain
of problems and responsibilities needs to be taken into
consideration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000040">The
other major issue I want to focus on is reform of the common fisheries
policy. Over the past few years, as this process wound its way slowly
through all the stages it needed to go through, there was real optimism
that progress would be made towards a new type of fishing and a new
management and regulation regime in the North sea in particular and
right across the waters around the UK and beyond. The industry is,
however, becoming more and more aware of the very difficult
relationship that now exists between the European Commission and the
European Parliament. It is absolutely right to have an element of
democracy and to ensure that the Parliament is aware of the issues and
involved. I am not privy to the detail of that relationship, but its
consequences have been reported to me by fishing organisations and
fishermen, and there are concerns about some of the most important
parts of the policy
reforms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000041">The

Should there not be some sort of quota allocation for by-catch spurdog,

fisheries worldwide? The system is perverse. Some fish are dead

great that the European system is now grinding into place to ban
discards—I wish the Minister well in that—the process

with him. The opinion of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
Committee on this deal was published in February 2012 and the
Government response in July 2012. It has taken three years of difficult
negotiations, and I commend the fisheries Minister and his predecessor
on the lead we took in securing a significant reform of what was deemed

why the reform is so important. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton
and Honiton (Neil Parish) and the hon. Member for Aberdeen North
mentioned discards, and it is key that we do not replace discards at
sea with discards on land. The Committee’s report concluded
robustly that we must be imaginative about bringing fish on to
land—having been born in Scotland, disappeared, and then
returned there, I can say that different fish are eaten in Scotland to
those eaten in England. If we can extend the palate and consumer taste
to different types of fish and create new markets for existing fish,
that would be a great way forward. As the report noted, celebrity chefs
and others have a part to play in that by creating a novelty feature 
<?notus-xml column=383?>for dishes such as pollock, which I am sure would not be so widely eaten
had it not been for chefs and others paving the
way.</hs_Para>

MacNeil:</Member></B> The hon. Lady calls for us to be imaginative in
dealing with some of the problems that fisheries throw up. Twenty years
ago I fished for spurdog as a targeted fish, but things have moved on
and, as I said earlier, it is now a non-targeted fish often caught in
nets. Spurdog comes in on boats, but under the landing obligation it
looks as though it can be neither landed nor discarded. We will
certainly need some imagination in dealing with spurdog that we cannot
land or discard.</hs_Para>

Member for Aberdeen North said, the key points of the next stage of

perfectly edible fish for which there is no current market, a legally

decision making that allows member states to agree measures appropriate
to their fisheries.</hs_Para>

most exciting parts of this reform is that for once we are going to
focus more on the science—I think we have gone wrong with
previous reforms of the commons fisheries policy because we have not
done that. I am an avid watcher of “Borgen”, the Danish
television programme, and I will include in my remarks with one or two
references to Denmark. I am half Danish—I am very proud of
that—and I studied in Denmark. As part of our report the
Committee had the opportunity to visit Denmark and see practices that I
hope will transform the regional control aspects. Science is
particularly important there because Copenhagen is home to the
headquarters of the International Council for the Exploration of the
Sea—ICES—and if we followed more of the scientific base
that it spends a long time producing, I believe we would all
benefit.</hs_Para>

also worked for a number of years in Brussels in legal practice, and we
must understand how we can get round the problem of fisheries still
being an exclusive competence of the EU. If that situation remains, how

<?notus-xml column=384?>shall we achieve regional control in practice? I believe that is a legal
problem and not insurmountable. Again, I will turn to Denmark, because
Denmark and Sweden have established regional control around Danish and
Swedish waters that works extremely well. That is down to the size of
the nets and meshing they use, and how they fish particular
fisheries—I will not go into too much detail because it is well
established. I hope the Minister will confirm that that model will be
used. I understand that the new common fisheries policy brings decision
closer to the fishing grounds, clarifies the roles and obligations of
each of the players, and ends micro-management from Brussels, and that
the Commission will agree with fishing nations in the region about the
general framework, principles and standards, overall targets,
performance indicators and time frames. Crucially, however, member
states within that region will co-operate at regional level to develop
the actual implementing measures. If it can be established, and all
member states in the region agree to the recommendations being
transposed into rules that will apply to all fishermen in the region,
it will be a real game changer.</hs_Para>

tremendous ways that the EU misleads us? The first meeting on the
regionalisation of the north-west waters took place in Dublin on 12
November. The group includes the UK, Ireland, France, Belgium, Spain
and the Netherlands—a pretty big region. We had thought that
regions would be smaller than states, but at EU level they are

Minister will have heard about, and I am interested to know how Spain

reminded of the dangers facing fishermen by a report in today’s
<I>Daily Mail</I> that the remains of 10 people discovered in Russia
may be those of fishermen lost when the Gaul sank off Norway in 1974.
The Gaul was the Ranger Caster when it sailed out of my constituency
from North Shields. In that disaster, which was well documented, 36 men
lost their lives. A number of them were from my constituency. In
government, we were justified in supporting a survey that provided some
of the answers. If this recent news brings further closure for the
families—if there can ever be closure in such a
situation—then I welcome it. They will be celebrating, if that
is the right word, the 40th anniversary of the disaster in February
next year. I pay tribute to the families who have worked so hard, not

home, I thank those who work every day to keep our fishermen as safe as
they can be: the coastguard and, in particular, the volunteers of the
Royal National Lifeboat Institution at the inshore boat at Cullercoats
and the bigger boat in Tynemouth. We should be proud of our RNLI crews.
They are brave and do things that I certainly would not be prepared to
do. They play an important part in supporting our industry. I also want
to pay tribute to the Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen in North Shields,
under the inspired leadership of Peter Dade and Alex Hastie, who do so
much to support the wider fishing community. Fishing is a dangerous job

to have the most important ports in the country in our constituencies,
but North Shields truly is the most important fishing port in the
north-east. Despite that, it only retains one or two larger boats and a
couple of dozen under-10-metre boats. It is a fraction of the size it
was even in the relatively recent past. Fishermen there rely on a mixed
fishery, and at this time of the year they particularly rely on the
prawn fishery, but a few also rely—or did rely—on
licences allowing them to use drift nets to catch salmon. In many
cases, these licences have been handed down from generation to
generation and have been an important part of fishermen’s
incomes, yet over the years there has been a concerted effort to get
rid of them, particularly—this is not a political
point—under the Conservatives. The pressure has come from
landowners in Northumberland and south-east Scotland who know they can
make a great deal of money from fishing rights along the banks of their
rivers, and concerted pressure has been placed on Ministers. Up until
recently, the line was held, but the decision was made earlier this
year—I am sorry to say—to phase out the
licences.</hs_Para>

to put it on the record that although I did get pressure from angling

the impression we were giving at the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation

a decision that, as far as I can understand, was largely one that we
made. We presented this opportunity, his predecessors having withstood
the pressure for a considerable period. Of course, as the right hon.
Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) said, we want anglers to
have access to good stocks, but the former Minister knows as well as I
do that there has always been concerted pressure, not from the anglers
themselves who take their rods to the rivers, but from those who see
this as an opportunity. Let me tell him this: it might be an
opportunity for landowners to make some money, but it is also an
opportunity for fishermen in some cases to survive on the back of these
licences. This fishery is not an extra, but an important part of what
they do.</hs_Para>

on the relative buoyancy of stocks, I understand that the Environment
Agency takes the same view as fishermen in saying, like the right hon.
Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, that there is enough for both. I still
do not understand fully why the decision was made to phase out the
licences and the fishery—and made without a debate in Parliament
using order-making powers. My point is simple: the drift net salmon
fishery in the north-east is a traditional fishery—what some
call a heritage fishery. It is, by all accounts, sustainable. It is
local and organised so that catches are limited, yet somehow vested
interests appear to have won out. If the Minister has some spare time

About 22 years ago, I worked in Gretna, on the border, on the M74.
Working with me were gentlemen from Kirkpatrick Fleming who frequently
went “haaf” netting on summer evenings, as they say in
the ancient fisheries—“haaf” is apparently the Old
Norse word for “ocean”. At a moment when we are looking
for plurality and diversity, it would be sad if we took a step that
would, as he says, ruin and end a centuries-old practice that people
have carried on sustainably in many

Gentleman, but I have always been careful, in the few fisheries debates
I have spoken in, not to take too romantic a view of the past or the
industry now. This is a business, and all I ask is that the Government
apply to this case the same principles they talk about in wider
fisheries policy. If we apply those principles, I cannot see how we
arrive at the position the Government arrived at earlier this year. If
we are not careful, the danger is that the livelihood of local
fishermen will be lost, and without any great gain.</hs_Para>

move to my second, broader point about what has happened in the past
couple of months off my constituency. As I said, local fishermen rely
heavily on the prawn season. Using relatively small boats, they make a
living and keep the fish market going and the port working, but this
year they have faced increased competition, perhaps as never before.
They tell me it comes from larger twin-netted boats. I am told
anecdotally that many of the crew are overseas fishermen—that
should not be a big point, but it is a point they make. The boats
clearly come from elsewhere. At the risk of falling out with my new
hon. Friend—the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr
MacNeil)—I am told that many of them come from Scotland, but
this is not an anti-Scottish thing, I assure him. The fishermen of
North Shields are trying to make a living and stay in business, but the
pressure on them has been intense this year. The word they keep using
is “displacement”. When fishing restrictions are put in
place elsewhere, the pressure goes on those parts of the fishery where
stocks are relatively healthy.</hs_Para>

MacNeil:</Member></B> I understand exactly the hon. Gentleman’s
point about displacement. We have a problem off the west coast of
Scotland with boats whose nets are far too big or that have too much
horsepower using up the kilowatt days allowed in the fishery, and the
resulting payback time and lost days at sea cause great difficulty and
angst on the west coast. I fully understand his point, therefore, but
would make one point about crews from other countries: they are most
welcome. When we see Filipino fishermen, we recognise that we have
great seafarers in our midst. I only wish the immigration department
would recognise that too and allow men from the Philippines to come
here and work and be welcome in our
communities.</hs_Para>

of what my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen North said earlier, I
worry about what delays in setting the quotas might mean. If there is
uncertainty in the system, will it add to displacement and result in
even greater pressure while we await the quotas? That is very
important. I am told that no rules have been broken. The organisations
he referred to, which are normally very officious in applying the
rules, have been ominously slow and silent on this matter. As a result,
fishermen in my constituency feel under pressure. They feel under
pressure when they read about marine conservation zones. They are not
anti-environment—they are some of the greatest environmentalists
hon. Members would ever want to meet—but they read what has been
written and they feel under pressure. When they hear that we are going
to have more offshore, rather than onshore, wind farms, they wonder
what the effect will be on their industry. They feel the cost of

to the Minister is relatively straightforward. I hope he will be able
to say what the reforms to the common fisheries policy that he is
doubtless going to outline to us will mean for fishermen. What will
regional management, reliance on scientific evidence, giving greater
access to the under-10-metre fleet and so forth mean for the fishermen
in my constituency? In the light of the problems raised about the
implementation—and possible delay—of the new policy, what
assurances can the Minister provide for my constituents? They want to
know whether next year will be easier or more difficult for them. If
the Minister cannot confirm that fishermen can look forward to a better
future, I hope he can say that they can look forward to at least a
future.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_12_PT_1/9A5E12587867137B37375434EB63005E112E22CC" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="12 December 2013">Thursday

a significant port in Newlyn, as 
<?notus-xml column=390?>my hon. Friend the Minister, who represents Camborne and Redruth, well
knows. The amount of fish landed in Newlyn every year is of
considerable value, and the fishery, in which the over-10 metre fleet
is unique, is an ultra-mixed one. The by-catch of spurdog and porbeagle

politicians is the pressure that comes from non-governmental
organisations to restrict this type of fishery? It can lead to the
perverse outcomes I mentioned earlier. The supply is reduced but demand
remains the same so that shark fishing starts to happen in another part
of the world. Meanwhile, the by-catch here is returned to the water
dead—a double hit that emanated from probably good intentions,
albeit ignorant
ones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000118"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andrew George" PimsId="3404" UID="13121258000470" xid="222" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000470">Andrew
George:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. That is
exactly the point I raised on previous occasions. Although I have every
sympathy and agree with the sentiments expressed by the NGOs—we
do not want to take action that will have a detrimental impact on, or
undermine the viability of, important species such as
spurdog—the fact is that we need to engage in trying to find a
practical solution to the problem, and simply saying that we are going
to ban the landing of these fish does not necessarily mean that a
single spurdog will be saved. We need to find more effective methods of
achieving the desired outcome. I hope that the NGOs will engage with
the Government and, in our case, with the Cornish fishing fleet, the
Neptune project and so forth to find a practical solution rather than
simply campaigning and saying that what is being done is never good
enough.</hs_Para>

running through the debate—one feels that one is repeating
oneself from the same hymn sheet—is the arbitrary use of the 20%
precautionary element of the quota-setting process, particularly where
the science is insufficient for the setting of an effective quota. I
hope that the Minister will talk to the industry and come to understand
not just the anecdotal evidence, because a lot of work is being
undertaken nowadays with scientists going on board many of the vessels

behind some of the annual quota cuts is unjustifiable and, in many
cases, counter-productive because no fish are saved. I urge the
Minister, rather than to run through the impacts on each fish species
of the proposed quota settlements for next year, to look closely at the
representation he received last week from Paul Trebilcock on behalf of
the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation. I think that a cogently argued
case has been made, which I hope the Minister will use as a brief. I

issue that crops up time and again in the fisheries debate is the
perceived conflict between commercial fishermen and sea
anglers—something that is played out in our debates and in a lot

the Isles of Scilly, where there is a separate IFCA.</hs_Para>

significant pinch point relates to the setting of the bass minimum
landing size. I corresponded about that both with the previous
Minister, the hon. Member for Newbury, who I see is leaving his place,
and the present Minister. At the end of the day, angling contributes
£2 billion to the economy and a total of 23,600 jobs. The
angling fraternity is keen to ensure that the Government recognise its
important role for the UK economy, especially when about 75% of the
fish caught by anglers, including those caught at sea, are returned
alive to the water.</hs_Para>

issues have arisen in Cornwall. For instance, bass do not spawn until
they reach a minimum of 42 cm, but the minimum landing size in
Cornwall—which is higher than those in the rest of the
country—is 37.5 cm, and elsewhere it is 36 cm. We
need a healthy bass minimum landing size. Local sea anglers are arguing
for the minimum to be raised to 48 cm in order to allow the fish to
breed at least twice before there is a chance of their being caught,
and I think that that is a justifiable argument.</hs_Para>

this year’s report from the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea, bass stocks have fallen by 35% in the last five
years. In our area in particular, there has been a significant amount
of pair trawling on a seasonal basis. Scottish pair trawlers sometimes
come down to the channel to take their slice, but no pair trawlers from
our own coasts are involved, and although we see a great many bass
longliners, they are very selective in their fishing methods and their
impact is therefore relatively small. Fixed-gear gill netting takes
place inshore, and I think it important to set an inshore net size that
will prevent the catching of juvenile fish. The minimum landing size
for mullet, for example, is 20 cm, but they do not spawn until they are
48
cm.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000125">Our

knows that in Cornwall we have drawn attention to the potential risks
to our crab fishery, particularly in the over-15-metre sector. One of 
<?notus-xml column=393?>the problems of the way in which the industry is managed is that

to raise the issue of the six and 12-mile limits. I know that my hon.
Friend has a reputation, indeed a pedigree, for being strongly
anti-European, and I hope that I can draw something out of his
anti-European-ness. I am talking about simply batting for Britain. Let
us all join forces, and agree that whether we are engaging with Europe
positively and constructively or negatively, what we want is the best
deal for Britain. It is clear that most of the foreign boats that are
taking advantage of access within the 12-mile zone and up to the
six-mile zone are new, and were not around at the time of their
historic entitlement. I urge my hon. Friend to scrutinise the impact
that they are having very close to our coasts. I also ask him to think
about the point that we have reached in the negotiations on the setting
of marine conservation zones, which lie both within and outside the six
to 12-mile zone. We need to ensure that we apply the same rules to both
foreign and British

been injured at sea. We have to remember that fishing remains an
inherently dangerous occupation, and those who take on the risks of
harvesting our seas deserve our utmost respect. Today’s debate
is also an opportunity to express our gratitude to those who serve in
the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen. The mission does a
tremendous amount of good in our fishing communities, and from speaking
recently to the superintendents in Fraserburgh and Peterhead, it is

these austere times.</hs_Para>

evening off Kinnaird head, but it gave me a fantastic insight into the
commitment and courage of the men and women who train all year round so
that they are prepared for emergencies when they arise. I want to thank
publicly Victor Sutherland and his crew for that opportunity, but above
all for the service they give—and, indeed, the service the
lifeboat crews in Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Macduff give to the
communities I represent and the service provided by all those RNLI
volunteers around our coast who give their time and risk their own
lives to save others.</hs_Para>

a difficult year for the fishing industry in Scotland, particularly in
my part of the world. Last December, shortly after our last fisheries
debate, the east coast was hit by a massive storm which combined 
<?notus-xml column=394?>with high seasonal tides and the direction of the wind to cause
extensive damage to our ports and sea defences. Our largest ports at
Peterhead and Fraserburgh sustained considerable structural damage, as
did many of our smaller harbours. One factory in Peterhead was
completely destroyed. I saw buildings near the shore in Fraserburgh
that had been moved off their foundations. People living near the shore
in Peterhead had to be evacuated from homes that had lost their doors
and windows, and further damage to processing factories was only
averted by swift action to repair sea defences in the immediate
aftermath of the storm. It was a sobering reminder of the power of the
elements, but its aftermath has also been a testament to the resilience
of our fishing communities.</hs_Para>

not yet back to normal by any means, but the repairs are well under
way, with ports seizing the opportunity not just to repair, but to
improve their sea defences and invest in new developments. The further
round of emergency grants announced by the Scottish Government this
week and European fisheries funding is supporting 45 projects around
the Scottish coast and will enable over £11 million of
investment in our fishing communities. Businesses in my own
constituency have been major beneficiaries, most notably Peterhead port
authority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000147">Yet
Scotland only gets £46 million of the UK’s EFF
allocation, which fails to reflect the size of our fishing industry and
compares very poorly with the levels of funding available to other
fishing nations such as Lithuania, and also Denmark which has
£100 million a year in EFF funding although it has a population
of very similar size to ours. Overall, Scotland accounts for 7% of the
EU’s wild fish catches and 12% of EU aquaculture, yet we get
only 1.1% of fisheries funding. By any measure, our fisheries are being
short-changed, and disasters like the one last year expose the
vulnerability that this
creates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000148">However,
the challenges we have faced this year have not just been
weather-related. This has also been a particularly difficult year for
our nephrops fishermen, given the scarcity of prawns during the first
half of the year. That has caused real hardship in parts of the fleet,
including in my constituency, and great anxiety because we do not know
for sure what caused the problem, as it is a well-managed, sustainably
harvested stock. The prawn catches have bounced back more recently, and
those most adversely affected have access to hardship funds, but it
does bring home the need for flexibility in the common fisheries policy
so that parts of the industry are not left high and dry in such
situations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000149">The
other challenge, of course, is that the mackerel dispute with Iceland
and the Faroes rolls on. The Minister should know that I deeved his
predecessor regularly on this issue over the last three years. As the
hon. Member for Aberdeen North suggested, the impasse has big
implications not only for our pelagic sector, but for the white fish
fleet and our fish processors. It is also a factor in the hold-up of
the talks between the EU and Norway, which should have been taking
place this month, but have now been put back until the new year. I am
told there is some new momentum towards reaching a deal on mackerel. I
hope the Minister will take the opportunity to update the House on
that, and can I urge him not to accept a deal at any price, and to
defend our industry?  
<?notus-xml column=395?>Mackerel is our most valuable stock, and we must protect access to EU

acknowledge the work that has been done to reform the CFP. Finally, at
long last, we have a deal. To my mind, the move towards
regionalisation, and the moves to maximum sustainable yield, will pay
dividends in the medium to longer term and set the policy on a very
different course. This represents progress that is long
overdue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000151">The
new landing obligation, or discard ban, has dominated the debate and
has been widely hailed as the centrepiece of the reformed CFP. I think
everyone without exception wants to see discarding come to an end.
Those of us who have campaigned against discards know that it has,
without a doubt, been the worst symptom of the structural problems
within the CFP. I do not want to rain on anyone’s parade, but we
have already heard about some of the contradictions that will be
created by that discards ban, and the House needs to acknowledge that
we still have some way to go to find a way to make that ban workable in
practice.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121258000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000152">There is
inevitably by-catch in a mixed fishery, and our fishermen are going to
need quota to be able to land it. The Scottish Government ran a trial
earlier this year with a pair team of vessels on a “land all you
catch” basis, with a view to informing the implementation of the
discard ban. The trial was supposed to run until December, but it ended
in August because the vessels ran out of quota for hake, which is
currently abundant in our waters. This problem of “choke
species” is not going to go away, and we need to find ways to
deal with it. In this case the choke species was hake, but in other
waters it will be other species, and therefore in future our fishermen
are going to need quota for non-target species and unwanted catches.
There are massive financial implications for vessels that need to lease
in quota for by-catches, and if we are serious about stopping discards,
then we need to secure the extra quota to allow it to happen. I would
be interested to know what the Minister thinks about the prospects of
the Commission providing fishermen with the additional quota to cover
the fish they are currently forced to discard so that we do not end up
in the situation outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Na
h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil), where they have got fish on board that
they cannot land and cannot discard. Are they going to eat it on board?
It is hard to know what fishermen are supposed to do and how they are
going to stay within the
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000153">I
know that the talks that start next week will only be addressing stocks
that are wholly within EU waters, and the important discussions with
Norway on key shared North sea stocks like cod, haddock, whiting and
saithe will not be happening until we are into the new year. However,
once again the big issue will be cod quotas and the flaws in the cod
recovery plan. We know that cod stocks are moving in the right
direction, and in fact cod mortality is now at its lowest level since
1963, when assessments started. Fishermen and scientists alike are
telling us that cod is more abundant than it has been for 50 years.
However, the CRP threatens to derail the progress made in recent years.
Last year, common sense prevailed and there was recognition that rigid
adherence to the plan would be counter-productive. The same applies
this year. If the proposed 9% quota cut goes ahead, it will inevitably
lead to an increase in discards, 
<?notus-xml column=396?>which is exactly what we are trying to prevent. In my view, we need to
continue following the science—in this I agree wholeheartedly
with the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh)—and
the science indicates that a small increase in the allowable catch for
North sea cod will enable the stock to keep growing and keep our
long-term outcome of a sustainable fishery on track. I hope the
Minister will promote that objective in the forthcoming talks, and I
seek his assurance on that today.</hs_Para>

commitment from the Minister that he will not let days at sea be
reduced any further, and that he will support an effort to freeze this
at 2012-13 levels. Automatic reductions in days at sea will not give
the fleet enough time to catch its quota, and that can only increase
risk to our
fishermen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000155">A

looks forward to winding down for Christmas, December is a particularly
tense and anxious time of year for fishing communities and everyone who
works in the fishing industry. I wish the Minister well for the
negotiations, and urge him to defend robustly the interests of our
fishing and processing industries at these

of being virtually ignored by the last Government, the fishing industry
now has a Government who represent its interests. I want to look at a
couple of the things that were achieved during the common fisheries
policy negotiations. The discard ban has been a long time coming. I
remember protesting in Plymouth city centre many years ago, along with
fishermen who were 
<?notus-xml column=397?>discarding their over-quota plaice in the middle of the road to
demonstrate that wasteful practice to the public. The Minister must
ensure that this move is accompanied not only by the available quota,
which many Members have called for, but by all the available technical
measures to allow the small fish to escape before capture. Neil and
other Looe fishermen inserted square mesh panels in their trawls many
years ago to try to ensure that only marketable-sized fish reached
their decks. Looe was a leading port in that initiative.</hs_Para>

must also ensure that in mixed fisheries, particularly in Cornwall, the
correct quota balance is available to allow fishermen to earn a
consistent living. Many fishermen only have small boats, and do not
have the luxury of large modern vessels like the Lunar Bow. I joined
the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan and many others on a visit to that
ship a couple of years ago. It can earn a living by going to sea for
just six to eight weeks a year. Most British fishermen do not have that
luxury.</hs_Para>

turn now to decentralised decision making, and allowing member states
to agree locally the measures appropriate to their fisheries. That is a
first-class proposal. As Bertie Armstrong of the Scottish
Fishermen’s Federation mentioned in his briefing, this has not
been put in place before because of a systemic defect—namely,
the fact that “exclusive competence” for preservation of
marine biological resource rests with the EU. Without a treaty change,
it is not possible to devolve that responsibility, which we all believe
involves control.</hs_Para>

would like to move on to the 6 to 12-mile limit derogation. My fellow
Cornish coalition partner, my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives
(Andrew George), has mentioned the fact that the derogation was due to
end on 1 January 2013. I raised this matter last year, and I am raising
it again today. This matter is still up for negotiation as a result of
the extension put in place by the European Commission. Had there been
no extension, there could have been a repetition of the Kent Kirk

me explain to hon. Members what that incident involved. Kent Kirk is
currently a Danish Member of the European Parliament. Before that, when
he was the Danish fisheries Minister, he shot his nets within the
British 12-mile limit during the 13 days when that limit was not in
place, between 1 January 1983 and the date later in January when the
agreement came into force. He went to the European Court of Justice
because the British authorities excluded him from those waters, and the
Court ruled that the waters within our 12-mile limit were in fact EU
waters.</hs_Para>

Minister—as I did last year—to negotiate the 6 to 12-mile
limits in the spirit of the original London convention agreement of
1969. According to the spirit of the agreement, access to the 12-mile
limit for other nationals with historical rights was always intended to
be temporary. Forty years on, we need to see an end to other
nations’ access, because those vessels are probably no longer
fishing. That 6 to 12-mile limit should now be exclusively for British
fishermen.</hs_Para>

will appreciate that Luton North is not a maritime constituency, and I

Nevertheless, I have spoken many times on fishing policy, and I have
strong views on it that I think some Members share. The CFP was a
terrible mistake, and it has been a disaster for Britain and for
fishing waters around the coasts of the European Union. The reforms
come and go, and we have seen some improvement: the movement towards
regionalisation is a tacit acceptance that we have to have some local
control. The obvious local control should be national local control,
which, in effect, means the abolition of the CFP, in time. I have
suggested that we ought to give notice—perhaps five
years’ notice—that we will withdraw unilaterally from the
CFP if we cannot get agreement within the European Union. That should
be one of the prime negotiating planks when the Prime Minister is
renegotiating our relationship with the EU. The CFP would be my No. 1
policy to dispose of.</hs_Para>

have suffered terribly as a result of overfishing, and that has
occurred because all member states can plunder other nations’
waters without having any responsibility for what happens. We know that
at least one nation has indulged in “black fish” landing
in considerable quantities, and if it cannot be trusted to fish in our
waters, perhaps it should be restricted to fishing in its own waters,
and restoring the 200-mile limit or 50:50 limit would be the sensible
way forward.</hs_Para>

unacceptable that a number of land-locked nations in the EU can vote on
the common fisheries policy. Many of them will vote slavishly for what
the Commission suggests, because that is what they habitually do, so
the Commission can always rely on a block vote of land-locked nations

interests might be.</hs_Para>

first-class example of a nation that manages its fish stocks extremely
well is Norway, because it is not a member of the common fisheries
policy—it is outside the European Union. Norway monitors every
boat and every catch within it waters. I have just seen a quote today
from an article in <I>The Guardian</I> of 14 February in which Fiona
Harvey talks about a Norwegian trawler skipper, Egil Skarbøvik.
She quotes him as
saying:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13121258000378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000378">“In

every nation did that, we would not have a problem with overfishing or
with fish stocks diminishing, and we would not need such nonsense as
discards, because we would all be managing our fish stocks and our
fishing, and we would all
benefit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000175">If
all foreign vessels were excluded from British waters, I feel confident
that there would be plenty of fish for British fisherman—there
would not be a problem. With the existing fishing industry continuing
to fish in our waters, we would see the fish stocks recover, because
other nations’ fishermen would be outside. Over time, if it
became possible, we could do what Norway does, which is to license
individual fishing boats from other nations to fish in its waters. We
have seen the boundaries of the CFP being pushed by Sweden and Denmark,
and we ought to move in that direction, too. They are inching closer
and closer to having real control of their own fishing waters, and I
say hooray for them. I think we should do the same. They are smaller
nations with smaller fishing grounds—nothing like
ours—but we would benefit enormously by adopting such an
approach. That is not just a nationalist policy; it is about saving
fish stocks for everyone. If we had good fish stocks, we would be able
to eat fish comfortably, without having to worry about the long-term
future viability of our fishing
grounds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000176">I

I win the argument. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Newbury

good job, and I have complimented him at a personal level, too.
However, we still have a long way to go. We have regional areas, but a
region that covers Britain and Spain is nonsense. Having Spain as one
region and the UK as another would make more sense. That would be a
step towards the abolition of the CFP and the restoration of the
management of fishing to member states, which is the sensible way
ahead.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_12_PT_1/37DAF8F9FFAF70CE089081FEDD6E541C227C0F2B" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="12 December 2013">Thursday

respects the outlook for the fishing industry in the United Kingdom is
better than it has been for many years. The reforms of the CFP mean
that a regime that made it difficult for fishermen to run their
businesses successfully, led to the overfishing of stocks and
devastated the marine environment is, at last, being cast into the
dustbin of history. It will be replaced, I hope, with a more
sustainable system, where decisions are taken on a regional basis,
rather than in Brussels. There are hurdles to overcome, although
fishing stocks are probably in a better place than they have been for
some time, with cod mortality in the North sea decreasing, biomass
slowly increasing and North sea plaice in a better place than it was 10
years ago. Nevertheless, significant challenges lie ahead. The industry
in Lowestoft, in my constituency, is a pale shadow of its former self
and I fear that the halcyon days will never return.</hs_Para>

three aspects of CFP reform: a move towards decentralised decision
making, which I welcome; the legally binding commitment to fish
sustainably, which, again, is very welcome; and the outlawing of
discarding. Although that is to be welcomed, the implementation of the
ban presents many challenges. This transition will not be
straightforward, and the National Federation of Fishermen’s
Organisations has identified four hurdles, which the hon. Member for
Aberdeen North has outlined. I would welcome the Minister’s

up.</hs_Para>

to be a satisfactory transition to zero discards, fisheries science
will play a vital role, so I urge the Government against any cuts to
this part of the DEFRA budget. The Fisheries Science Partnership,
established in 2003—which includes DEFRA, the Centre for
Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, which is based in my
constituency in Lowestoft, and the NFFO—has played an important
role in bringing a scientific perspective to decision making, and has
brought industry and scientists closer together. It is important that
we build on that partnership, as that will help the move towards zero
discards by 2019.</hs_Para>

necessary to build on the catch quota management trials that have taken
place to improve nets and gears, thereby helping to avoid unwanted
catches. The feedback from the Project 50% trial, on which CEFAS and
the Brixham trawl fleet have worked together, is encouraging; overall
discards were reduced by 52%, and the most successful boat achieved a
70% reduction. There is also a need to convince consumers to eat less
popular types of fish, which would otherwise be thrown away. We need to
build on such initiatives as Fishing for the Markets, which seeks to
convince consumers that the less popular fish are both edible and
tasty. Such a move in consumer demand will not only ensure that the
less popular fish are not simply discarded on land, rather than at sea,
but will take pressure off more popular fish, such as tuna, prawn, cod
and
haddock.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000182">The
small Lowestoft fleet that exists today is predominantly an

fleet and employ 65% of the fleet’s total work force, yet
currently receive only 4% of the total quota available  
<?notus-xml column=401?>to the UK. It is important that that inequity be addressed. Article 17
in the finalised text of the CFP reform document provides the framework
within which justice can be achieved for the under-10-metre fleet. It
is important that the Government have its provisions in mind at all
times as they set about implementing the reforms. The importance of a
strong under-10-metre fleet should not be underestimated. These boats
have the least economic impact on the marine environment, and they
maximise the social and economic returns to many coastal communities

important to recognise that the quota problems for the under-10-metre
fleet are not localised to the south-east, but are more widespread
around the UK coast. I acknowledge the work being done by the NFFO in
identifying and dealing with pinch points—the localised problems
the fleet faces—but to have a long-term future the
under-10-metre fleet cannot rely on handouts from producer
organisations, be they annual swaps, gifts or transfers; it is
important that it has its own quota. There is a concern that those
under-10s whose business model is reliant on access to leased quotas
from producer organisations could experience significant difficulties

who have sold their boats and no longer have any connection with

that view. It is the only way we can ensure that in ports such as
Lowestoft, the industry will have a future. The glory days will not

“Deadliest Catch”, I think of the fishermen from

focus my remarks on Northern Ireland and the issues of nephrops and
prawns. The scientific advice for nephrops was published on 31 October,
but we have no indication of what is happening in relation to it. The
nephrops industry is critical to the fishing sector in Northern
Ireland. If area 7 is cancelled, nephrops will again be our No. 1
priority. I urge the Minister, as we did last week, to underline that
important issue. The fishing stock in Northern Ireland could have 100
vessels specifically targeting that species.</hs_Para>

years, the UK and Ireland have successfully made the case that the
total allowable catches must be uplifted above the “sum of the
science” to account for consistent undershoots in the TAC caused
by some member states not taking up their allocation of nephrops. I
find those undershoots both worrying and annoying; they cause great
concern to me and to the industry. Combined with the less favourable
scientific advice, they will make achieving a roll-over in the TAC very
challenging this year. It must be stressed that the catch landed is
important for the fishermen of Northern Ireland and for the shore-based
industry. Again, let us make no mistake: the issue is critical for the
Northern Ireland fishing sector. Nephrops is Northern Ireland’s
No.1 priority, and giving that stock such priority can be easily
explained. It is practically the only major stock 
<?notus-xml column=403?>we have left. The fact remains that fisheries in the Irish sea have been
managed into practically depending on this single species.</hs_Para>

Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford) outlined the issue of Irish
sea cod. The situation is similar for us in Northern Ireland. Our one
remaining full-time whitefish trawler in the fleet mainly targets
haddock, but a recovery plan is in place. The Northern Ireland
fisheries division, through the Department for Agriculture and Rural
Development, permitted a limited sentinel fishery for cod from 2 to 24
September. It observed the quantity of cod in the sea, and it showed
that cod numbers and size of cod are increasing, which is good

concerned that the European Commission has proposed a cut in the TAC of
20%, in line with the cod recovery plan. It is clear that we must argue
for a simple roll-over in the TAC, but the Fisheries Minister is aware
that that is a difficult argument to win, and a potential compromise
would be to suggest a by-catch only fishery in 2014 if the Commission
would agree to the TAC remaining unchanged. A reduced TAC combined with
improved gear selectivity and the forthcoming discard ban will make it
all the harder to determine what is happening with Irish sea cod. It
should also be noted that any reduction in the TAC will stop the
sentinel fishery, which is important and has been running for the past
two years.</hs_Para>

am proud to represent a fishing constituency where vessels operate all
along the coastline from Bantham round to Torbay. The value of the
catch to Brixham cannot be overestimated. It is the highest-value catch
in England in monetary terms and is worth £27 million. The
fantastic new Brixham market has a turnover this year of £23
million, which has sadly reduced from £25 million in
the previous year. I hope that the Minister will accept an invitation

This year in particular, I am thinking of our maritime rescue
co-ordination centre in Brixham, which is sadly due for closure. I also
pay tribute to the RNLI, to rescue boats such as Hope Cove, to those in
the coast watch and to the Fishermen’s Mission, which does such

with Project 50%. I pay tribute to those who have contributed to that.
In particular, I am thinking of the extraordinary work of net designers

are under extraordinary pressure. In 2011, 22% of our
fishermen’s turnover went on fuel costs. That increased to 27%
in 2012. Alongside that, they are under huge pressure from the impact
of changes to quota. As the Minister goes into the
negotiations—I wish him well—may I ask him to consider
the impact of the 75% reduction in the haddock quota? Can he confirm
what I am hearing from my local fishermen, which, I gather, is also
evidenced on the ICES website—that is, that there has been a
significant increase in haddock stocks that is not yet recognised?
Although fishermen in my constituency are taking part in the i-logs and
completing what they catch while they are on board, they tell me that
there is a significant delay in that information being recorded by the
Marine Management Organisation. The trouble is that, because it is a
mixed fishery, fishermen in my constituency cannot stop catching
haddock. As the discard ban is not coming in this year, they will be
forced to discard healthy fish for the whole of this year and into the
next. I urge the Minister to consider the evidence that the biomass for
haddock has never been higher since we started recording it and to
argue that we should roll over the existing TAC.</hs_Para>

channel Dover sole is iconic to Brixham and we must consider the impact
on fishermen of a 7% reduction in that catch and a 17% reduction in

efforts with the Brixham fleet have been effective in reversing the
decline, but I want to move on now to what we can do to improve the
science of recording catches and, in particular, the use of the EFF.
Will the Minister confirm that the EFF fund will be extended into next
year and will not now finish in December? When he looks at the EFF, I
ask him to recognise that it operates between England and Scotland with
the MMO. I have heard that although in Scotland projects can start
pending a decision, in England that is not the case. That has had a
considerable impact, meaning that the EFF has not been fully spent.
Will the Minister confirm how much underspend there has been and what
he intends to do to make the EFF easier to access? In particular, what
will he do to put more of what the EFF does into supporting the science
so that it can be kept up to date when future decisions are being
made?</hs_Para>

support the use of the EFF for safety equipment, where it has been very
valuable. The installation of tipping bars and conveyors on our
scalloping fleet has had a significant impact on safety, but there is
far more we could do to use the EFF more effectively to support
businesses onshore as well as using it on board our vessels and to

is about a specific issue for the crabbing fleet. Five crabbing vessels
operate in my constituency and they support 30 families. The crabbing
fleet is under significant pressures from the effort restrictions and
there are historic problems, too. The Minister will know that the
French have 2 million kilowatt days whereas the UK has only 545. There
is now an increasing threat that that will have to be shared with those
who have latent licences. I feel that it is not reasonable to expect
the fishermen to negotiate complex swaps with the French. I am grateful
that the MMO took that on at the eleventh hour on this occasion, but
will the Minister consider specifically whether small groups of
families can negotiate such complex agreements? I feel that that is an
important role that the MMO should be taking on on their
behalf.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000214">As

restore marine ecosystems in areas where they have been adversely
affected. Those marine strategies

that there are steps that we might like to take but we do not know

want to talk about what has been referred to as the discard ban, which
of course it is not yet coming in. The National Federation of
Fishermen’s Organisations—many Members have referred to
its briefing document—has highlighted serious concerns about the
ban. It mentions recent research published in green policy and
fisheries research that shows that the ban, in isolation, will generate
little economic incentive to operate more selectively. It has also been
suggested that the additional quota provided to enable the landing of
by-catch could be too large for certain modern vessels and too small
for less technologically advanced vessels. Unfortunately, some people
appear to place more emphasis on the need to enlarge quota to deal with
the landing obligation and  to focus on the measures designed
to eliminate by-catch in the first place. We heard some good examples
from the hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston) about selective gear and
net mesh size, which can do just that. Also, ultimately, that could be
done by trading quota.</hs_Para>

focused on the fish species that in some cases have shown significant
recovery over the past few years—referred to as the “good
news” by some Members. Hake, haddock and herring have all shown
some recovery, which is testimony to the technological capability of
the industry and its efforts to fish more sustainably when required to
do so. I think that it is also a vindication of the role that the quota
system has played. The fact that stocks are recovering should not be
taken as an excuse to say that the quota system should now be

MacNeil:</Member></B> When politicians talk about science, in reality,
as we have just seen with mackerel, the science has followed what is
happening. The ICES advice for the increase in TAC in 2014 is a 65% to
79% increase, which in effect is only a 3% increase in what was caught
in 2013 owing to fishermen in other states having a certain view of
what was happening in the sea. Another issue—this relates to
what the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) said—is that
there are other areas where there is a cod recovery plan in operation
but where there were no cod anyway. However, because of the catch
compositions the cod recovery plan is leading to the dumping of
haddock, and as haddock is being dumped and not landed, consumers will
have to choose anther fish, and they will choose cod, so the plan will
have the opposite effect to the one
intended.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_12_PT_1/D3F1907C0359BA6B90DB74ECB3366DF29869376E" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="12 December 2013">Thursday

a clear goal of delivering a diverse and abundant marine environment

Britain’s fishing community. It is essential that fishers are

quota system can clearly create barriers to more sustainable,

below that level is recognised by scientists as being by far the most
destructive fishing activity. In line with its work on a more
sustainable EU common fisheries policy, this matter has been very much
on the European Parliament’s agenda. The Minister may care to
explain why his Conservative colleagues in the European Parliament
joined forces with other groups to vote down the ban and also voted to
delay progress on the draft legislation, meaning that better
conservation measures for deep-sea species are unlikely to be taken
forward until after the 2014 European elections.</hs_Para>

species that play a regulatory role affecting the entire

round-nosed grenadier, black scabbard and orange ruffy, but
for these three, and up to perhaps another seven,
target species for deep-sea trawlers, some 78 species are
being caught as by-catch. These deep-sea species tend to be longer
lived. The orange ruffy lives for up to 100 years and reaches maturity
only at the age of 30. Catching these species can completely

important points have been raised, and I want to pick up as many of
them as I can. First, I want to put on record the sheer importance of
this industry to the 
<?notus-xml column=411?>UK. We have more than 6,400 vessels and nearly 12,500
fishermen, and we produce 627,000 tonnes of fish per year with a value

UK.</hs_Para>

biggest development this year has been what I regard as a quite radical
reform of the common fisheries policy. I congratulate my predecessor,
my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon), on his tireless
efforts on this front, especially on managing to reform the broken
common fisheries policy—a measure that was voted through and
agreed by the European Parliament on Tuesday. The reformed CFP, which
includes three major UK priorities, has three key elements: first, an
end to the wasteful practice of discarding; secondly, an end to the
one-size-fits-all approach, with regional decision making; and finally,
a commitment to fish at sustainable levels. I want to say a little
about each of those important areas in turn.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121258000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000250">On
discarding, it has been an absolute scandal that we have had these
regulatory discards whereby perfectly healthy fish are thrown, usually
once dead, back into the sea. A number of Members have raised concerns
about the discard ban, but it is important to recognise that to make it
work there will be new flexibilities in the quota system. There will be
inter-year flexibility so that quota for a species can be moved from
one year to the next, and there will be some limited interspecies
flexibility so that if a fisherman finds he is catching far more
haddock than he expected, he can offset some of that haddock against
his cod quota. We also recognise that there is much we can do with
improved net gear. Big progress has already been made on this, and
organisations such as the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and
Aquaculture Science have done a lot of work on it, but there is
certainly further to go.</hs_Para>

thought that regional decision making is important, because I am of the
view that a small number of member states with a shared interest in a
fishery and in seeing it fished sustainably are much more likely to
come up with coherent management measures than any haggling among a
group of 28 countries. The move to regional co-operation is,
therefore, very important. It will make it easier to get agreement and
we will end up with more coherent policy
making.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000252">A
number of Members have raised concerns about how that will work. The
fact is that, technically, it will remain a European Union competence.
We have seen it work. When I attended the Fisheries Council in October,
a similar process took place for the Baltic sea whereby those countries
with a direct interest in that water came up with an agreement; they
got there in the end. I think that that combination—of
individual member states deciding management measures among themselves
and the Commission standing behind that process and providing the
ultimate check to make sure that they are fishing
sustainably—works.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0002.htm#13121258000253">The
third point—this is really important, as the former Minister, my
hon. Friend the Member for Newbury, made clear—is about the
legally binding commitment to fish sustainably. This is the essential
bit that makes everything else stand up. All these things together
represent a radical change in the CFP. This means that we have
flexibility to ensure that a discard ban works, a legally binding
commitment to fish sustainably, and more local decision making. We have
further to go and I am looking forward to the next one to two years,
when we

recommends a 24% reduction in the TAC. As a number of Members have

nephrops. It is against a positive background, because fishing has been
doing well, that we—and particularly the Minister—face
next week’s Fisheries Council, which will decide about catch
opportunities for 2014. It is traditional, but also frustrating, that
those who make a livelihood from fishing expect bad news in respect of
the TAC proposals published by the European Commission before the
negotiations. What has made fishermen in the Irish sea all the more
nervous this time is the failure to communicate the proposed quota for
area 7 nephrops to the industry in advance of the Fisheries Council or
at least at the same time as the other quota proposals. I know that the
new Minister freely acknowledges that. He spoke to me about the issue

of the scientific advice, the industry has, like officials, been able
to make a good stab at the numbers. For prawns or nephrops in the Irish
sea and the wider area 7, it equates to a proposed TAC reduction in
2014 of almost a quarter compared with 2013. A slightly better
comparison shows that the scientific evidence demonstrates an 8%
reduction from a year ago. Nevertheless, any reduction in the prawn TAC
in area 7 would be unjustified. There are variations in the science
year on year, but the same science confirms that the overall picture is
stable, with prawns being harvested within the maximum sustainable
yield principles. Surely that good news, combined with a recognition of
the strides that have been taken by all fishermen in the Irish sea,
provides sufficient reason to secure a roll-over of the 2013 TAC into
2014. I ask the Minister to make a special plea on behalf of those who
are involved in nephrop fishing in the Irish sea. For us, nephrops are
perhaps the only show in

There is an issue with cod in the Irish sea. By value and weight, the
cod that are landed from the Irish sea equate to less than 1.5%.
However, its iconic status pervades every demersal fishery. It is to be
hoped that, come 2014, practical rules will apply that allow haddock
and hake fisheries to be developed, while affording the necessary
protection to cod. To achieve that, a roll-over of the 2013 quota for
haddock in the Irish sea is needed. Against the background of a 17%
increase in the stock, that is surely not too tall an
order.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121258000295">After
14 years of failed fisheries targets and recovery measures, Irish sea
cod present a dilemma, but they should not be seen as a lost cause. It
is regrettable that a huge gulf remains between the science on the
stock and what the fishermen believe to be the state of the stock.
Unfortunately, that is where I and my hon. Friend the Member for Brent
North differ on this issue. I am deeply concerned about our local
economy and local fishery. A further 20% reduction in the TAC in 2014
will 
<?notus-xml column=418?>do nothing to address the unknowns or the data deficiencies. The
fisheries science partnership and sentinel fishery projects will grind
to a standstill with such a
reduction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000296" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121258000296">Fishermen
are at a loss to know how they can prove the negative position with
regard to that stock. In many ways, they have been a victim of their
own success, thanks to the highly selective gears and the much needed
innovation in technology that was pioneered by Anglo-North Irish fish
producers in Kilkeel. How can the fishermen prove that there are cod in
the Irish sea when they use nets that are designed not to catch cod?
More scientific technology is required. The promises to look at ways of
addressing the problems, such as identifying the reason for the high
level of unknown mortality in Irish sea cod, seem to have evaporated as
far as the fishermen can see. However, as part of the new common
fisheries policy, fishermen are further encouraged to develop new mixed
fisheries and multi-annual plans. How can they do that when cod remains
a choke species and so many unknowns remain in respect of that iconic
fish?</hs_Para>

that he could never work out how it was going to succeed, we can draw
the conclusion that it was set up to fail. Someone somewhere must have
known that the cost base was too high, and that Visteon did not have a
bright future when it was spun off in
2000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000320" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121258000320"><Member ContinuationText="Dr Hywel Francis" PimsId="3314" UID="13121258000528" xid="215" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121258000528"><B>Dr

Metcalfe:</Member></B> I have not, but I have confined my research to
this issue. There was a trend back in the late 1990s and early 2000s
for large motor companies to spin off their parts manufacturer and
create separate entities, but Visteon never had a chance, certainly in
the UK, as demonstrated by its profit and loss. It never made a profit,
and no company that never makes a profit can succeed. Inevitably, in
March 2009 Visteon collapsed, shortly before the global corporation
went into chapter 11 in the United States. Following the collapse in
the UK, it emerged fairly quickly that the UK pension fund was
underfunded to the tune of about £350 million. That required the
pension fund to be placed in the Pension Protection Fund for
assessment, which ultimately left former Ford employees with much
reduced pensions. Some suffered cuts of up to 50% to a pension they had
paid into and had earned. Indeed, my constituent Dennis Varney, who has
been leading the campaign so vigorously with me in the past few years,
told me his story and I would like to share it with the
House.</hs_Para>

Ford in 1967 as an apprentice toolmaker. He studied, worked, gained
qualifications and got promoted. In 1973, he became a press toolmaker.
In 1976, he transferred to the Basildon radiator plant and 
<?notus-xml column=422?>became responsible for maintaining press tools and related equipment in
the manufacture of heat exchange components. In 1978, he was promoted
again, with responsibility for the press shop. In 1986, he was promoted
to senior manufacturing engineer and then to a management position in
1990. He went to university to study between September 1998 and 2000,
and completed a degree course in engineering manufacturing. In 2000, he
was transferred to Visteon UK after more than 32 years with Ford. At
Visteon he held a management position in a simultaneous engineering
group, and had 20 engineers reporting to him directly. In 2006, after
38 years of combined service, Dennis retired. He had worked a lifetime
for a company he respected and trusted, and looked forward to a well
deserved and well earned retirement.</hs_Para>

root of the issue does not lie at the door of the Government, but the
Government can do more to protect workers, particularly on how the

argue, agreeing with Ford, that this has nothing to do with Ford,
but I disagree. Yes, Visteon was an independent
company, but as we have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for
Finchley and Golders Green (Mike Freer), it never stood a chance, and
someone somewhere knew it. I submit that Ford recognised it could
source its parts cheaper from other companies around the world and
needed to get rid of its expensive in-house manufacturing plants, so it
spun them off. That is what Tim Leuliette said. He said it did not
stand a chance: the cost base was too high, the overheads were too
high, the labour costs were too high. It was totally out of sync with
the running of a profitable motor business, so it was sent floating off
on its own into the great blue yonder.</hs_Para>

am calling on Ford to meet its moral responsibilities. It knew that
Visteon had no long-term future and that among the casualties when it
inevitably collapsed would be thousands of former employees who had
given loyal service. Those employees have now suffered serious pension
losses. They transferred their pensions from Ford to Visteon in good
faith, on the basis of trust. People trusted Ford, so when it gave them
its assurances, they took them at face value. Why wouldn’t they?
I would like to quote the words of John Hill, a former Ford employer,

they had been around for so long formed part of that trust. I just

is no doubt that Ford UK is a vital cog in the global Ford machine and
Ford family, yet “family” is probably not the word that
Visteon pensioners would associate with their former employers any
longer. Simply put, people trusted Ford, and now they wish they had
not. That is sad. Ford is a great company and has the potential still
to be great in the future, but it is allowing its reputation to be
tarnished by not stepping up to the plate. I am asking, in all good
faith and in recognition of Ford’s contribution to the UK, that
Ford do what is right by its former employees and resolve this issue.
Yes, times are tough for the motor industry, especially in Europe, but
this goes further than just a financial transaction; it is about
restoring trust in what should be a rock-solid brand and removing a

the largest and most modern car component factories in the whole of
Europe. It grew rapidly from 2,000 employees in 1968 to 6,500 just over
a decade later in 1980. Ford was therefore a major contributor to the
Welsh economy, drawing its work force not just from Swansea, but from a

Friend, I find it sad that nothing has moved forward since the last
debate, in which I was unfortunately unable to participate because I
still wore the shackles of ministerial office. It seems that if we are
not careful and if Ford is not prepared to regain its sense of decency,
the matter may have to be resolved in the courts, which I do not think
is in anyone’s interests, especially given the time
scale.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121258000350" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121258000350">It
appears from all the evidence that even if, back at the turn of the
century, Ford was following what other companies were doing and
removing its suppliers from its direct control by creating new
companies, the hands of Visteon, a company created to be independent
from Ford, were tied from the outset. I understand that Ford had a
virtual monopoly over the parts coming out of Visteon, and was thus in
a position to drive down prices unilaterally. There was no proper,
vibrant, functioning market, and that is not in any independent
company’s natural interest. I also understand that Visteon had
to buy its materials from the Ford foundry in Leamington, although they
could have been obtained elsewhere at a more competitive and lower
price. Once again, Ford seems to have kept Visteon’s hand behind
its back and thwarted any opportunity that it might have had to develop
as a vibrant, successful company.</hs_Para>

to remember that this is not some plan to change pension arrangements
in the future. I accept that many private companies over the last
decade—as well as Government, and including Members of this
House—have been changing their pension arrangements because it
has been found that the existing arrangements are too expensive in the
current economic climate. They are moving to salary-average schemes,
but that is always for the future. They do not start tinkering with the
commitments, the payments, the arrangements and the deals that have
been done in the past. These changes are 
<?notus-xml column=427?>for the future. That is not what has happened to the Visteon pensioners,
however. Their pensions—that they took out in good faith, and
that they believed were safe and secure for all their pensionable
life—have now, because of what happened to Visteon in 2009, been
noticeably, and in some cases severely, cut by this cynical operation
to create a new company independent of
Ford.</hs_Para>

making that point because he is absolutely right. There were no weasel
words. There were no cop-out clauses or any excuses that could be made
that people had misunderstood what had been said to them or the
commitments that had been given to them. They were, in so far as
anything in life can be, cast-iron guarantees that those people, who in
most cases had worked so loyally for so long for Ford, would have their
pensions guaranteed. Having met a number of them, including
constituents of mine, I have no doubt that they feel as though they

Russell) says, “If they’ve got one,” and I can
understand why he says that because it does seem that they are without
conscience. Of course companies have a responsibility to their existing
work force and their shareholders to make a profit, but this is even
more important: “You don’t make a profit if you
don’t have a loyal, hard-working and decent work force.”
If the company is prepared to see some of its work force treated like
that, despite the cast-iron guarantees that it gave them, we have to
wonder what kind of conscience it has.</hs_Para>

lobbying by Members on both sides of the House, by the trade unions, by
the action group and by others, and that it will not consider drawing
the matter out even longer, because, sadly, some of those pensioners
will die during that time. I hope that the company will do the decent

with mixed feelings. I feel grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and
to the Speaker for allowing us to have this great debate in the mother
of all Parliaments, from where it will be transmitted across the pond
to the United States, where Ford’s ears will be pricking up, as

grateful to the hon. Member for South Basildon and East Thurrock
(Stephen Metcalfe) and others for the work they have done with me to
keep this show on the road and to keep up the pressure on Ford. Ford
might have thought that, after the early rumbles of protest, the noise
would die down to a whisper. Instead, we are turning up the volume, and
the lion’s roar from Britain will be heard in the United States

well. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr Francis) mentioned the
fact that Ford came to south Wales in 1964. At the time, my father was
heading up economic development in the Welsh Office, and he was
critical in bringing Ford to south Wales. He is no longer with us, but
I remember his story about the chairman of Ford turning up at the Welsh
Office in Cardiff in a green Rolls-Royce—believe it or
not—to talk about the arrangements and inducements to get Ford
to the area. That was more than 30 years ago, and perhaps Ford had a
different outlook and focus on wider communitarian values in those
days.</hs_Para>

the debate with thanks and with sadness, and also with a degree of
frustration and anger that we find ourselves here. We have been
engaging with Ford UK, and it has been forthcoming in engaging in
dialogue, but its hard-nosed American bosses, sitting in their
directors’ boardroom, seem to think that this issue will just go
away and that the workers of the UK can be treated as some kind of
offshore group of people that they can forget about. It has been
mentioned that many of the people who have suffered are now dead, and I
believe that Ford is hoping that the issue will go away. I and other
Members from all parties say this: “Ford, you can run but you
can’t hide away from your responsibilities. We will continue to
fight for our constituents, year after year, until this matter is
resolved.” Madam Deputy Speaker, you mentioned that this matter
was before the courts and that decisions have yet to be made, but we
are talking not about the legalities of the case but about moral
responsibility and the duty of care that should be shown by this
multinational towards its employees, in respect of pensions in
particular.</hs_Para>

know that I introduced the Multinational Motor Manufacturing Companies
(Duty of Care to Former Employees) Bill, which covers this ground, but
the Minister might also wish to comment on the big 
<?notus-xml column=429?>conversation that is taking place between the global multinationals,
sovereign states, workers and consumers. There have been debates in
this House about the responsibility of multinationals, be it Amazon,
Google or Vodaphone, to pay their fair share of tax. Vodaphone had the
biggest share transaction in history, or at least this century,
involving £53 billion, but not a penny was paid in corporation
tax. How are we going to re-orchestrate things with other countries to
ensure that global corporations are not globe-trotting away from their
responsibility?</hs_Para>

bigger conversation, and I know that people are engaged on the tax side
of it, but its other side is the fair treatment of workers. We have
heard reports, for instance on “Panorama”, of what Amazon
is doing, and I am following through on that, as it is a local company
in my constituency, too. As with Ford, we are talking about big
companies that provide big employment and are crucial to all our towns
and cities, but that does not mean they can run away from their
responsibilities on fair tax, fair play and the fair treatment of
consumers and workers, be they current, previous or
future.</hs_Para>

Davies:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes his point with typical
focus and strength. The Belfast workers will be looking at
today’s debate and asking how Ford will respond. The Ford
directors cannot sit around with their hands covering their eyes, ears
and mouths, pretending that this will go away. They may think it can be
kicked into the long grass of the lawyers, where there is an army
supported by a huge ammunition dump of money to keep it there, but
their business ultimately depends on the good will of
consumers.</hs_Para>

just about Ford manufacturing innovative, efficient and modern cars; it
is about the brand being one that people can be proud of. It is about
not hiding behind the brand name a predisposition towards running away
from responsibilities to people who have spent a working lifetime, in
good faith, making quality cars for people to buy, for a business that
is viable. It is simply not acceptable for the people to whom those
workers have expressed such loyalty to walk away and leave them near
destitute. We will not accept it in our House, our community or across
our shores. I believe that the ethics of American consumers and
American workers, both in Ford and beyond, mean that they will share
our sentiments that we are in it together, to use those immortal words,
in terms of our future and how this works. People may increasingly make
consumer choices

going to dwell on the details of the case. I simply say that it
appears, on the face of things, that various undertakings were given to
Ford workers which, as has been pointed out, any lay person would
interpret as cast-iron guarantees, whatever the legal beagles might
construe, with massive expense, could conceivably have been meant.
Almost everybody took those assurances as being cast-iron
guarantees.</hs_Para>

pension fund was initially set up £49 million light and by the
end of the period of Visteon’s existence—the nine or 10
years in which it continued, when, as has been said, it lost nearly $1
billion and did not turn a profit—that pension fund had become
underfunded by some £350 million. The knock-on effect for the
more than 3,000 workers who have been affected is a savage cut in the
future incomes they can expect into their retirement and their
capability to sustain a future of dignity and enjoyment in older age

pointed out that Ford was, in essence, manipulating the profit and loss
account of Visteon. On the input side, it was able to demand a certain
input of raw materials at specific prices that may have been above the
market price, so the input cost was up. On the output side, 90% of
Visteon’s sales were set by Ford, which consistently reduced the
prices that it was given to squeeze the profit of Visteon, so it was no
surprise that it was making a loss and that that loss was manifested in
the pension
fund.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000018">Interestingly
and coincidentally, if we look at figures for 2005-06, Visteon Europe
lost £700 million and Ford Europe made £700 million in
profit. The point I am trying to make is that their accountancy animal
was woven together—that £700 million could have gone
either way. In essence, Ford chose the loss to fall on Visteon and on
the workers who had nobly and loyally served it for so many
years.</hs_Para>

number of Members want to speak so I will not go on. In the evidence we
took in the all-party group, and before that, we heard stories of
representatives from Ford who, after sitting on the board of Visteon
pension fund trustees and then having a vested interest in the closure
of the plant, transferred their own pension out of the Visteon pension
fund into a specially created fund—another Visteon pension fund,
the engineering scheme. Clearly, they had a different and conflicting
interest. We asked Phil Woodward, who was a director of the trustees,
to give evidence to the all-party group, but what do Members think

completely agree with the hon. Gentleman. That point has been made in
the all-party group, and we have been trying to get a Select Committee
to take on 
<?notus-xml column=431?>this matter. Possible options included the Welsh Affairs Committee and
the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee. When
we took it to the Welsh Affairs Committee, there were concerns that the
matter was sub judice. However, Mr Speaker has now ruled that the
matter has been trundling on for far too long. We are four years into
the campaign and there will be another year at least before there is a
court hearing. Clearly, we cannot wait for ever, and there is a role

response to the hon. Gentleman’s excellent question is that we
have thought about that, but as the momentum has been building and we
have now reached this point—we have had questions, discussions,
early-day motions, a Westminster Hall debate and now this major debate
in the Chamber—we should be aiming, given that we have the
implicit sanction of Mr Speaker, to take the matter back to the Select

advanced western democracy—the seventh largest economy in the

such as Ford to come to here and do the right thing, we are setting an
example for less developed countries where global players might go in

bring something to the table and remember that democracies here and

consumers and for workers, as well as good jobs and good cars. Let us
work together for a better world. Come on Ford, do the right thing.

John Whittingdale</B> (Maldon) (Con):</Member> I, too, congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for South Basildon and East Thurrock (Stephen
Metcalfe) not just on securing the debate from the Backbench Business
Committee but on how he has led the campaign, which 
<?notus-xml column=432?>has been supported on both sides of the House, as demonstrated this
afternoon. It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Swansea West
(Geraint Davies), who has also been tireless in pursuing the matter. It
is notable that four parties are represented in the House this
afternoon. Sometimes MPs put aside their party differences and come
together when it is plain that there has been an injustice that needs
to be put right. That is certainly the case with the issue we are
debating this afternoon.</hs_Para>

danger in such a debate that one simply repeats the points that have
been made. We have already heard some powerful speeches from both sides
of the House, such as that from my constituency neighbour, my right
hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns), who
represents many of the Essex Visteon pensioners, as I do. As has been
pointed out, it is particularly sad that it is necessary to have this
debate a second time—I participated in the debate in Westminster
Hall—because we all still have great respect and admiration for
the Ford Motor Company. It has a proud history in this country and a
strong reputation across the world, yet this is a terrible stain on
that reputation.</hs_Para>

because Ford has previously been seen as such a strong company that it
was understandable that its employees, who had given many years of
service, should believe the assurances they were given when they told
that they were being transferred to the Visteon company and that their
pensions could be transferred to a new Visteon pension fund. I will not
repeat the quotations given by many hon. Members about how they were
told that there would be no detriment and that their pensions were
guaranteed under the same terms and conditions. Of course they believed
that, yet today they find that the position is very
different.</hs_Para>

particularly sad when one meets and talks to employees who gave many
years of service to Ford that now seems to be ignored and forgotten
because for a few years—or even, in some cases, for a few
months—they transferred to the Visteon company. In particular, I
mention Mr Steve Sharpe, my constituent from Heybridge, who spent 27
years working for the Ford Motor Company and three months working for
Visteon, yet has lost 50% of his pension. On any grounds, that is
clearly wrong and should be recognised as such by the Ford Motor
Company. What makes it worse is that—we have heard reference to
this—it appears that Ford knew perfectly well that the Visteon
company could not succeed, and indeed took actions after its
establishment which made absolutely certain that it was not viable in
the long
term.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000031">Also,
we know that the Visteon pension fund was underfunded right from the
start. In the discussions that we have had as part of the all-party
group, we have talked to the Pensions Regulator, for instance. It is
perhaps a matter of regret that the Pensions Regulator was not in place
at the time that this happened. It is perhaps worth speculating that
had we had the Pensions Regulator, this situation would not have been
allowed to arise. I am grateful to see on the Front Bench the Minister
of State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for
Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb), who responded to the previous debate
so is familiar with this
injustice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000032">At
that time we talked about the way in which the  cap on the
Pension Protection Fund affected some former employees of Visteon. That
is something that 
<?notus-xml column=433?>the Government have sought to address, but it is still impacting
severely on some pensioners of the Visteon company.
Perhaps the Minister might touch on that in his
response.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000033">As
we know, there is a legal case pending, and I of course hear the
instruction from the Chair. We do not want to prejudice in any way the
legal proceedings that are under way. It should not be necessary
because ultimately it is not a question of whether or not Ford acted
within or outside the law. It is, as Members in all parts of the House
have said, a question of corporate social responsibility. It is a
question of the reputational damage that this is doing to Ford across
this country and beyond, and it is a question of morality and
decency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000034"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Bob Russell" PimsId="502" UID="13121260000172" xid="518" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000172"><B>Sir

I say, we will wait to see what happens in the courts, but I hope we do
not have to, and that the Ford Motor Company will hear the message
being sent from this Chamber this afternoon. My hon. Friend the Member
for Rochford and Southend East (James Duddridge) talked about the
possibility of a Select Committee hearing. Whether or not we could
force the Ford Motor Company to come to this country to a Select
Committee is not entirely clear. I have had some experience of forcing
people to come before Select Committees, and there is a problem if they
are on the other side of the Atlantic. Again, that should not be
necessary.</hs_Para>

be apparent from hearing all the Members who have spoken this afternoon
is the overwhelming moral case of the people who gave years of service

for Ford as a major employer in this country, and I echo those
sentiments. It has a proud history and plays a very significant role in
our industrial base. Notwithstanding that, I do not believe that this

would like to highlight two points. We have talked about the possible
lack of understanding at Ford in the US about the consequences of the
decisions that were taken here in the UK. I have considerable
experience—some might say that I have the scars on my
back—of working in America, having worked with American
businesses and set up my own business there. It is an extremely
different culture, particularly when it comes to employee relations. I
can speak only about my area, and of course the company was not a
substantive corporation like Ford, but I know that the work force
protection schemes in America are nothing like those in this country,
and many say that we have some of the least onerous schemes, compared
with the rest of Europe. In America, an employer can hire and fire
almost at will without recompense. There are a limited set of
protections for redundancy or sacking with or without cause, but it is
a very different culture. We may speak the same language, but we are
not necessarily united by it in our
practices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000045">It
may well be that people in the boardrooms in America do not understand
the implications or the potential harm to their reputation of pressing
ahead and distancing themselves from the issues facing the pensioners
of Visteon. I urge them to listen carefully and to imagine themselves
not in the boardrooms of America looking over here, but over here
looking at it through the eyes of their UK allies and partners. They
might then understand what has driven us to the Chamber today and what

Friend. I cannot give an example off the top off my head, but it is
certainly true that companies are often preoccupied with what is

evidence today that Visteon was, to all intents and purposes, a captive

being a captive supplier or a partner, of course companies in these
business environments seek to be a partner. As a supplier, they have to
strive for a long-term relationship to guarantee the future of their
business and employees. It is interesting that Ford’s supply

develop an aligned business framework with suppliers that recognised

doubts as to whether the demise of Visteon was part of a strategy,

subsequently, to change its supplier base. I carefully say that that is

case has been explored today, and I obviously add my weight to that,

Motor Company globally. Yes, it faced some challenging times.
Certainly, the whole industry faced some challenging times, not least
in the previous three to five years that we know about all too well.
However, its record now is more than satisfactory. While its European
business is still undergoing some financial restructuring, the last
quarter saw a $1.27 billion profit. In fact, its operating basis was
$1.82 billion for the quarter, but the notes to its accounts
say that that was reduced to $1.27 billion because it was restructuring
in Europe, including large pension lump sum payoffs. If my constituents

be a far happier time for them and for Members in this House who

in the US not only to challenge itself on the moral case but to look
itself in the eye and say that this is a relatively small price for an
exceptionally profitable company whose results have been delivered by
employees who not only worked for it but then worked in its supply
chain. Then it can live up to the values that it has until recently had
cause to be proud

Harris</B> (Castle Point) (Con):</Member> I, too, congratulate my
parliamentary neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for South Basildon

chairing the all-party group on Visteon and on securing this important
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000055">It
is very sad that, in the year the Ford family is celebrating the 100th
anniversary of its first moving assembly line, we are having a debate
about how poorly it has treated former proud members of its family and
about how best we can support them and—I think we are all united
in this—persuade Ford to recognise its moral obligation
following its treatment of Visteon
workers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000056">Ford
has a good reputation for looking after its staff, and those
constituents of mine who still work for Ford speak very highly of the
way they are treated by the company. They have a great attachment to
the brand and genuinely feel part of it. I think that makes the
situation rather more heartbreaking for Visteon workers, who used to
wear the familiar Ford logo with pride, but now feel compelled, after
the treatment they have received, to campaign with a blue oval
“Fraud” logo on their hats
instead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000057">When
I first became aware of the closure of Visteon, I, like many others,
may have initially mistaken it for yet another sign of the depressing
state of the economy back in 2009. It was not until I met a substantial
number of residents who had previously been Visteon employees that it
became very apparent to me that its collapse and the subsequent
pensions issue for former employees was down to something more
sinister, some of the details of which have already been well
covered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000058">At
that first meeting in my office, I was struck by what a sensible and
level-headed bunch of men they were. They were definitely not the kind
of men, in my opinion, who would recklessly take any advice from or let
themselves be conned by a flashy sales pitch that other people might
have said sounded too good to be true. Put simply, they are men who had
worked hard all their lives to provide for themselves and their
families, and for what they hoped would be a decent standard of living
in retirement. In political-speak, we would say they are people who
have worked hard and done the right thing, and that is why we are all
in unison in supporting them in their fight with Ford.</hs_Para>

will not be offended if I say that they are not all of an age whereby
someone could glibly suggest that they go and get another skilled
career in order to rebuild their shortfall. As we have heard, some of
the Visteon pensioners have already passed away and missed the
opportunity to be recompensed, and therein lies the
rub.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000060">These
are people who gave many years of loyal service to Ford prior to the
establishment of Visteon. They trusted the advice given by Ford at the
time—that their pensions would be safely protected in the new
arrangements; otherwise, they would never have moved over to Visteon. I
add my own admiration to that voiced by colleagues for the effective
and downright dogged way in which they have run their brilliant
campaign, including demonstrating outside the Ford dealership in
Rayleigh Weir in my constituency every Saturday, come rain, snow,
blistering sun or, on occasion, flood. I commend them for their
determination.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=437?><hs_Para UID="13121260000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000061">Let me get
back to the basics of the matter. Visteon was spun off by Ford in order
to reduce its operating costs. It was never functionally independent
because it relied on Ford for about 90% of its business. Ford was even
in a position to dictate the price at which it could buy back its
product. In fact, I understand that it agreed a pricing pathway with
Visteon management at the establishment of the company, but that
agreement was never stuck to. The staff who transferred from Ford to
Visteon were never even given separate contracts with the new company.
Of course, with the benefit of hindsight one might now say that a
successful multinational such as Ford was hardly likely to create and
spin off a company that would be respectably profitable in the future.
Perhaps that was the only warning sign we
had.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000062">Given
what we have heard over the past three years, the situation seems to
have gone further than that. The House has heard the view that Ford set
up Visteon to fail, and loaded the pension fund with a deficit that was
never going to be sustainable. What is even more unforgiveable for the
former Ford employees is that it would appear that Ford—the
primary customer of Visteon products—had actively anticipated
and planned for the shutdown of UK Visteon operations since way back in
2006.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000063">The
Visteon Pension Action Group has documents compiled by Ford
management—which went to great lengths to keep them away from
Visteon employees—that give details of plans for projects to
allow other companies to seamlessly pick up the supply chain when the
UK plants closed. The high-level project was apparently known as
“Kennedy”, and was directly controlled by Ford Motor
Company personnel who were responsible for agreeing new supplier
sources and the cost and quality of new products, and for releasing
those products into the Ford production system. Visteon UK, as the
incumbent supplier, was responsible for identifying potential new
suppliers and developing them to meet Ford criteria for cost, quality
and supply logistics. I gather that such lower-level projects were
known as Protea, Cummins D3 and Arrow. They do not mean an awful lot to
me, but they do to the pensioners in the action group.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121260000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000064">It should be
noted that, depending on product complexity, normal resourcing action
takes between 12 and 24 months to allow time for the
manufacture of new tooling, initial production runs, quality and
testing checks, and supply filling. It therefore seems quite clear that
Ford Motor Company was directly involved in such resourcing actions.
When Visteon UK stopped supplying Ford very abruptly on going into
administration on 31 March 2009, Ford vehicle operations did not stop
for one second due to any lack of parts. Stockpiling of Visteon parts
had taken place and the new supplier parts were available immediately.
As we have heard, it is of course completely reasonable for companies
to put in place contingencies in case a supplier folds, but that
eventuality was completely within the power and design of Ford Motor
Company.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000065">It
seems to me that Ford was therefore involved in the deconstruction of
Visteon at least three years before the company went into
administration. Ford knew that the pension fund deal it had put in
place, and which it had encouraged its workers to take—allowing
them to trust it in moving on to that deal—would mean that
thousands of employees would be left out of pocket. That is why I 
<?notus-xml column=438?>believe that Ford has a moral obligation to come to the table with MPs
and the Visteon Pension Action Group to agree a fair and just deal for
Visteon
employees.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000066">The
cause of the action group has been greatly frustrated by the fact that
tougher rules on pension regulation came in several years after the
Visteon pension scheme was established. I welcome the
Government’s announcement earlier this year that the cap on
compensation payments from the Pension Protection Fund will rise to
3%  for pensioners with a record of more than 20 years’
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000067">It
is my sincerest hope that executives watching this debate in the
boardroom in the States take note of what has been said today, and of
the damage that the whole situation is doing to their otherwise good
reputation among their own employees and to their brand in general.
Finally, I once more congratulate the members of the Visteon Pension
Action Group on their campaign so far, and I assure them of my and my
colleagues’ continued support in this Chamber for their fight,
because they all deserve
justice.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13121260000158" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000158">3.52

Members will recognise that we normally speak in very temperate
language, so people should bear in mind how strongly we all feel about
this issue. Very rarely is there a debate in which such strong words
are used as we have heard today from both sides of the House. It has
been not so much a debate as a siren call for action. Points have been
made from either side, but they have all pressed Ford in the same
direction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000071">I
must disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield North (Nick de

Swansea, the same lack of duty of care and the same lack of moral
responsibility towards employees would not have been
tolerated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000072">I

the film “Made in Dagenham”, but it clearly brings out

greatly let down? They expected a deal to be made that was good for

only have I watched the film, but one of my constituents, Lesley
Butcher, starred in it in a voiceover role. She is also an excellent

anti-American. He will certainly be distraught that the project that

hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Rebecca Harris) made the very
good point that this was clearly not an independent company. Project
Kennedy allowed the continuity of the supply chain. Effectively, the

between now and the court case for it to do the right thing morally by
our constituents, six of whom have made direct representations to me.
If it does the right thing kicking and screaming, only when forced to

have been struck by the strong sense in the contributions to this
debate that Ford has a moral responsibility to take seriously the
issues that have emerged since Visteon’s collapse. That point
has been put across eloquently by Members from across the House. That
moral responsibility comes from the fact that Ford workers, who had
given many years of service, believed that their pensions were safe.
Some of those workers are with us today. Members from across the House
have made the point that Ford is a blue-chip brand with a long track
record in the UK. For those reasons, this case has continued to arouse
strong feelings on both sides of the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000083">I
ask hon. Members across the House to reflect on how one ensures that
companies engage in and understand their responsibilities beyond the
bottom line. Another way to describe a moral responsibility is to say
that companies, corporations and those that employ people in our
country have obligations beyond just the maximum profit they can make.
That is certainly what the workers at Ford always felt, and they were
assured—and felt assured—that in transferring their
pensions to Visteon, their accrued rights would be protected.</hs_Para>

important to add and iterate—I suspect the Minister will want to
reflect on this—that at play here is the wider issue of what
happens when occupational pension schemes get into trouble and it is
discovered that they are sponsoring an employer that is going under.
The previous Government, reacting to the Visteon case and to other
well-known examples, created the Pensions Regulator and the Pension
Protection Fund. I suspect the Minister will want to say something
about the interaction between those institutions—not just the
pensions landscape as it sits now, but as it relates to Visteon
pensioners. Indeed, he recently proposed an amendment to the Pensions
Bill so that the cap on payments under Pension Protection Fund
regulations can be raised. I understand that there are Visteon
pensioners who will benefit from that—those who might have
retired before Visteon collapsed, but who have long years of service
with Ford and then Visteon—but it is not a solution for all
those pensioners.</hs_Para>

from across the House, including from the right hon. Gentleman, which
is that we must engage seriously with the issue at hand and Ford must
face up to its responsibilities in this matter. As has been
said—again, by Members from across the House—Ford is a
company with a strong imprint in the UK and has been here a long time.
Unless the public are confident that Ford will play by the rules and
treat people fairly, the potential damage to Ford’s brand is
obvious. “Brand” can sound rather advertisement-like, but
the position is very simple.</hs_Para>

Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Steve
Webb):</Member></B> I join in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member
for South Basildon and East Thurrock (Stephen Metcalfe) on his work as
chair of the all-party group and his perseverance over a number years
in raising this issue, along with the officers and members of the
all-party group, which is well represented today. Such unanimity across
the House, across political parties and across parts of the United
Kingdom is rare and is all the more telling for that. The House has
spoken today with a single voice. Those who follow our proceedings,
both in person and by other means, will have heard clearly the single
view of the House of Commons.</hs_Para>

be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, at the beginning of our proceedings
your fellow Deputy Speaker relayed Mr Speaker’s guidance. We
respect that guidance, of course. I am particularly conscious of the
need to avoid saying anything that would in any way undermine or
prejudice the case being brought by Unite the union 
<?notus-xml column=442?>and by individual former Visteon workers. We want to see justice done
through due process. I hope the House will understand that my remarks
are slightly more guarded for that reason.</hs_Para>

this matter almost exactly a year ago in a debate in Westminster Hall
that raised many of the same issues. In the course of that debate, I
said that I was particularly conscious of the Visteon workers ending up
in the Pension Protection Fund and, as hon. Members have said, finding
that the pension they receive is not much more than half the pension
they were expecting. With my hon. Friend the Member for South Basildon
and East Thurrock, I met members of the Visteon Pension Action Group in
summer 2012, and it was their individual case studies that made me
acutely aware of the impact of the PPF cap on their entitlements under
the scheme. As I explained at the time, the thinking behind the cap was
to ensure that what I loosely call the “fat cats” of the
scheme, the people right at the top, could not manipulate matters and
still receive a full pension. That was why the previous Government
introduced the cap. It was my judgment at the time, and it remains so,
that the cap was having an unfair and adverse impact on people who had
relatively large pension entitlements not because they had earned
phenomenal amounts of money, but because they had given very long
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para tab="yes">During the
debate, my hon. Friend the Member for South Basildon and East Thurrock
referred to his constituent Mr Varney, who had about 38 years of
combined service with Visteon and Ford, and my hon. Friend the Member
for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale) referred to his constituent Mr Sharpe, who
had served for 27 years. These are the sorts of workers potentially
caught by the cap, depending—obviously—on their wage. I
said in last year’s debate that we were looking at whether we
could do something about that, and I am pleased to confirm today that
we have acted upon that promise. The Pensions Bill, which is now in
another place, provides that for those who have been members of a
scheme for more than 20 years, the cap should be increased by 3% for
each additional year they are above the cap. Obviously I cannot comment
on individual cases but, in principle, someone who has
served for 38 years would have 18 lots of 3% so a cap 54% higher than
the standard cap. If they were still capped at that point,
as it were, their pension would be 54% higher than it is
currently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000097">Sadly,
these things take time—the Bill has not passed the other place
and when it has we will have to produce detailed secondary
legislation—but I can assure the House that we intend these
higher rates of payment to be in place in the lifetime of this
Parliament and to apply from that date onwards. They will not be
retrospectively applied, but they will apply to schemes already in the
PPF, such as the Visteon scheme. I am aware that probably only 60 or 70
Visteon employees will be affected by this measure, but I hope that for
them, who have suffered the biggest proportionate loss, this will be of
some benefit.</hs_Para>

Duddridge:</Member></B> I fully support the payment protection being
discussed, but if I follow the logic correctly, the Government are, in
effect, paying for Ford’s failure to take moral responsibility.

they have paid out through the PPF?</hs_Para>

Webb:</Member></B> It is not the Government who pay for the PPF, but
the rest of British industry. It is funded partly by the assets of the
schemes in the fund and the investment returns on them and partly by a
levy on schemes with defined benefit pension liabilities. I realise it
does not change the issue my hon. Friend raises, but it is not the
taxpayer who funds the PPF; it is other firms with ongoing defined
benefit pension liabilities. The PPF does not form a judgment of the
rights and wrongs of a firm’s conduct leading up to insolvency.
That is a separate matter that might come up during the court
proceedings.</hs_Para>

the debate, we heard that Visteon was spun off from Ford in 2000,
before the present architecture—the Pensions Regulator and the
PPF—was in place. My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Jackie
Doyle-Price) asked whether these sorts of things could happen again and
whether a hypothetical future firm could structure its affairs with a
view to minimising its pensions liabilities and passing them on to the
PPF. I can reassure her that part of the remit of the Pensions
Regulator is to protect the PPF and hence other levy payers. For
example, firms considering a corporate restructuring that would have
implications for the covenant of their pensions scheme can seek
pre-clearance from the Pensions Regulator, and the latter has powers to
act if a corporate transaction has been undertaken with specific intent
to weaken pension protection. The situation, therefore, is considerably
different from the one pertaining in
2000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000101">The
hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) and my hon. Friend the
Member for Castle Point (Rebecca Harris) described the workers who
accepted the transfer from Ford to Visteon. The hon. Gentleman said
they were not greedy or stupid, which of course they were not, and my
hon. Friend said they were sensible and level-headed. It was the
natural thing to do at the time: someone’s employment is
transferred from one employer to another, they are given assurances
about their pension and it is suggested they transfer it across. There
are different accounts of exactly how the conversation went, but it was
an entirely rational thing for people to do. There is no suggestion
that people who made that decision acted inappropriately; they acted in
good faith on the assurances given.</hs_Para>

Metcalfe:</Member></B> One issue that arose about the point of transfer
was that some were reaching the end of their careers within Ford but
were still left obliged to transfer before—in one case, only
three months before—they retired, only to find out later that
they had been disadvantaged. Could the Government look at providing for
those in the process of reaching retirement a buffer zone, whereby
people do not have to transfer out of the fund into which they have put
most of their earnings over their working
lives?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000103"><B><Member ContinuationText="Steve Webb" PimsId="4546" UID="13121260000196" xid="625" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000196">Steve
Webb:</Member></B> It is worth bearing in mind that, in all these
cases, we are generally dealing with a trust—a pension fund set
up as a trust has trustees—and with private companies, scheme
rules and so forth. It is difficult to see how the Government could
write a law that interacted with all those different aspects in a
rational way. I take my hon. Friend’s point, as I, too, have
heard about folk who worked only a few months for Visteon, yet
transferred across their life’s pension rights with
Ford—with very adverse consequences. 
<?notus-xml column=444?>I appreciate that that happened. It is quite clear that no blame or
criticism could possibly attach to the workers whose pensions were
transferred across; they are clearly the innocent parties in all
this.</hs_Para>

debate, I re-read the transcript of our debate of a year ago. I was
struck by the tone, which was slightly different. I do not know whether
this was co-ordinated because I was not involved in those
conversations, but I was struck that a number of hon. Members said that
they did not want to drag Ford down, as they recognised that Ford was a
key employer for this country and that many people who worked for the
company were proud to do. As I say, I was struck that hon. Members were
not trying to denigrate Ford, but were concerned that, if the matter
remained unresolved, Ford’s reputation would suffer. I think
this striking tone will have been noticed.</hs_Para>

clear during the course of the debate that although Visteon was spun
off as a separate company, there were close links between Visteon and
Ford. My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield North (Nick de Bois)
mentioned the nature of the relationship, drawing on his business
expertise, while some hon. Members pointed out that new contracts were
not signed. Reference was made to the fact that the long service award
that Visteon workers received accumulated their Ford service, and there
was Ford branding and all of that. Leaving aside the legalities, it is
absolutely clear that the two companies were very closely interlinked;
there can be no doubt about that.</hs_Para>

discussions, the potential for Select Committees to look into this
issue was raised. What Select Committees choose to investigate is
obviously not a matter for the Government, but I am happy to repeat the
assurance I gave a year ago that if any Select Committee—perhaps
the Culture, Media and Sport Committee could find an obscure angle to
get going on this—decided to take up this issue, we would be
happy to put at its disposal the expertise of the Pensions Regulator,
the Pension Protection Fund and my own officials to advise or guide in
any such investigation.</hs_Para>

Linda Riordan</B> (Halifax) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am delighted to
have secured this Adjournment debate on such an important issue for my
constituents and for the Halifax and Calderdale area. This goes to the
very heart—the very essence—of what people should be able
to expect from their national health service, what services they should
get from their local hospital, and how they should have confidence that
well-run, popular and accessible services like Calderdale Royal
hospital accident and emergency department will not be cut back or
closed. However, for some time now Calderdale Royal hospital’s
accident and emergency department has been under threat. It is an issue
that has been simmering away in my constituency and recently the
rumours have turned to reality as the Government and local health
bosses, much to the anger of local people, have refused to guarantee
that Calderdale’s A and E department is
safe.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121260000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000128">I shall
briefly set out some of the background to this issue. In 2001
Halifax’s general and royal infirmaries merged with Northowram
hospital to become Calderdale Royal. Over the last decade it has served
the area extremely well. It has excellent, dedicated and well-qualified
staff who provide a first-class health service to people across the
district. It serves many diverse communities in Halifax and Calderdale,
and its reach extends to the Lancashire border and to communities
bordering Bradford. Therefore, a wide geographical area needs, and
relies on, Calderdale Royal, and in particular its A
and E
department.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000129">In
recent months, as speculation has risen that the axe could fall on the
town’s A and E, so has the sense of public
outrage that such a short-sighted, unnecessary and unwanted decision is
even under consideration, let alone that there is the possibility of
its being implemented. United against that are hospital users, health
campaigners, trade unions and Calderdale council. I have yet to find
anyone who would be in favour of such a decision.</hs_Para>

been denied either. Indeed, I have asked in this House if
Calderdale’s A and E is safe and no one
has confirmed that it is.</hs_Para>

Whittaker</B> (Calder Valley) (Con):</Member> I dare say that the hon.
Lady, coming from the Calderdale area, has, like myself, had briefings
both from the chief executive officer of the NHS trust and the chairman
of the Calderdale clinical commissioning group, and I must say that at
no time have either of those two people mentioned to me that Calderdale
Royal is under threat of closure. I just wonder whether she could
elaborate on where this information has come
from.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000132"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Riordan" PimsId="4839" UID="13121260000203" xid="846" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000203">Mrs
Riordan:</Member></B> I have met the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS
Trust CEO and doctors and other clinicians. They say—and they
gave out a document for me to read—that changes are afoot. That
is coming from inside the hospital and the council, and from the
general public. So, again, I ask the Minister to rule out the possible
closure or even any cuts.</hs_Para>

been told is that a strategic document is available on the future of
local services. Frankly, my constituents do not need to read
jargon-filled paragraphs about clinical decisions. They know when
something is right or wrong, and they know that what matters in Halifax
is the continuation of our good local health service, with an accident
and emergency department free at the point of need. They do not want
that service to be in Huddersfield, Dewsbury or Bradford. They want it
where it is, in Halifax, serving the communities that I represent and
those of
Calderdale.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000134">I
have read and heard a lot in recent weeks about how A
and E departments need reforming. I have heard that too many
of the people using them could be seen elsewhere. I am afraid that that
is a weak argument. The whole point of the service is to deal with
accidents as well as emergencies. People cannot be told to use
alternative services if their walk-in centres are closing, or if their
doctor’s surgery has closed for the night or, when it is open,
they cannot get an urgent appointment.</hs_Para>

Whittaker:</Member></B> The hon. Lady will know that we recently had a
campaign to keep the walk-in centre in Todmorden open. The reality is,
however, that the walk-in centres in Halifax and Todmorden are both

review came up with a proposal for a low-level accident and

important role to play in this decision. The buck should not be passed

Government set the policies, and they must also
take responsibility for any decisions that will affect the A

support the retention of the accident and emergency department in
Calderdale? If they do, there is no need for any consultation. If they
do not, they should come clean and set out their position. This lack of
clarity is causing a lot of worry, anguish and anger in my constituency

Calderdale.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000143">Last
week I organised a round-table meeting with interested parties at local
level to discuss a way forward. The town is united in the need to
ensure that Calderdale’s A and E stays
put. Let us imagine what would happen if the department were cut back
or closed. I presume that the services would transfer to Huddersfield.
For many of my constituents that would mean at best a 20-minute
journey, but probably journeys of 25, 30, 35 or even 40
minutes along busy roads, past a motorway interchange, and into
Huddersfield. At the risk of using emotive language, such a move really
could be a matter of life and death. Do health bosses think that people
would stop using the other A and Es if they
closed the one in Calderdale? I do not think they would. I also want to
place on the record that this is not about Halifax versus Huddersfield;
it is not about pitting one A and E against the
other. This is about ensuring that people across west Yorkshire have
access to good quality health care that is rooted in their local
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000144">Let
us just examine for a moment why this position might have come about.
Since 2010, the Government have been systematically dismantling
alternatives to A and E: a quarter of walk-in
centres have been closed since the election; NHS Direct has been
scrapped; the guarantee of a GP appointment within 48 hours has been
scrapped; and fewer and fewer GP practices are open at evenings and
weekends. People in Halifax and Calderdale will have fewer
alternatives, not more, if the A and E closes. If
patients are waiting more than four hours for treatment, is the answer
to close A and Es? I do not think it is. This
crisis is not due to a lack of education or people going to
A and E with minor problems; it is more to do
with cuts to social care budgets, meaning that more older people are
ending up in hospital because there is no one else to take care of
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121260000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121260000145">If
the Government’s answer to an A and E
crisis is to close A and E departments, we really
are in trouble in Halifax. Cutting back on services does not solve the
problem; it just transfers it elsewhere. I am determined to fight for
better services at Calderdale Royal, not to see them cut. I want to see
our A and E department saved, not sacrificed. I
want to see the excellent staff supported, not under-resourced, and to
ensure we have the best possible NHS serving Halifax and its wider
communities.</hs_Para>

of the public in my constituency has been an overwhelming “Hands
off our A and E department.” We need it to
stay open, to continue the excellent service it provides and to ensure
it serves the people of Halifax today and for years to come. Anything

provide my constituents with a local hospital and a national
health service fit for the 21st

reconfiguration of health services is an important issue for all of us

people have anxieties about change and, in particular, about change in
the NHS, because it is such a greatly loved and respected institution,

I address the particulars of this debate, may I touch on the
Government’s policy on changes to services in general? I realise
that the hon. Lady may say that this is what I was going to say, but it
is important to understand the principles behind reconfiguration
policy. This Government are clear that the design of front-line health
services, including A and E, is a matter for the
local NHS. That is for good reason, because those local
leaders, working closely with local democratic representatives, local
government and the public they serve, can come to better conclusions
about the services for their area than a Minister sitting in Whitehall
trying to decide policy for the whole country, which is a very
old-fashioned model of how to do these things.</hs_Para>

responsibility to ensure that people have access to the best and safest
health care possible. That means planning ahead and looking at
sustainability as well as safety in NHS health care provision. No party
can escape the challenge of providing sustainable services, and I do
not think that challenge is any different for  the Labour
Front-Bench team from how it is for the Government. The Labour party
made these points often when it was in government.</hs_Para>

is about modernising delivery of care and ensuring that we have the
facilities to improve patient outcomes, develop services closer to home
and, most importantly, save lives. I listened carefully to the hon.
Lady’s arguments about her own local area, but if we look at an
area in London, as I represent a London seat, we will see that exactly
the same arguments were made against centralising stroke care, which
was centralised in eight hyper-acute stroke units. They are now
providing 24/7 acute stroke care. Stroke mortality is now 20% lower in
London than the rest of UK, and survivors are experiencing a better
quality of life.</hs_Para>

example to illustrate the fact that we must be wary of some of the
arguments against reconfiguration. I am quite clear that in London
something that was opposed for some of the reasons the hon. Lady has
touched on in her speech is now saving lives for my constituents and
others. I want to ensure that that point is at least
underlined.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121262000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121262000009">We

not accept the hon. Lady’s argument, which, as I understand it,
is that nothing should ever change. How, in a modern and ever-changing

that it would be wrong of her clinicians even to look at the case for
change?</hs_Para>

Riordan:</Member></B> I am sure that the Minister listened to my
speech. I did say at the beginning, just to give her some brief
history, that in 2001, under a Labour Government, we finally got that
brand new hospital for which we had waited nearly 20 years. It had been
promised by a Tory Government. We went from three hospitals to one. She

service changes should be led by clinicians, and be based on a clear,
robust clinical case for change that delivers better outcomes for all
our constituents. We have put patients, carers and local communities at
the heart of the NHS, by shifting decision making as close as possible
to individual patients, devolving power to professionals and providers,
who also have patient care, safety and sustainable service at the core
of their public service commitment, and liberating them from top-down
control.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121262000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121262000013">The
principles are enshrined in the four reconfiguration tests. I am sure
the hon. Lady knows them well, but for the record they are support from
GP commissioners; strengthened public and patient engagements; clarity
on the clinical evidence base; and support for patient choice. Those
are the tests against which any reconfiguration needs to be
judged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121262000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121262000014">A
and E is obviously very topical at the moment. The NHS is
seeing increasing pressure on A and E services,
but is generally coping well. I am sure that that is the case with the
hon. Lady’s local hospital as well. We are meeting our four-hour
A and E standard at the moment. It is the 32nd
consecutive week the standard has been met. We are determined to do
everything we can for the NHS to continue providing high-quality care.
She will know of some of the extra moneys that we have
allocated—I think it is £2.3 million for Calderdale and
Huddersfield—for winter pressures. That does not allow us to
escape the fact that there are longer-term challenges, and these have
been acknowledged across the House. One million more patients have gone
to A and E in the past three years, and there are
the pressures of an ageing population. We, across the House, have to
address those long-term challenges, and the Government are trying to
focus on some of the underlying causes, whether by having named GPs for
the over-75s or changes to GP contracts; or, in public health, helping
people to manage long-term 
<?notus-xml column=452?>conditions and to live well for longer; or the £3.8 billion
allocated to help to integrate health and social
care, because we recognise how vital that process is. All those
measures are about addressing the underlying drivers of pressure on
A and E and pressure on our health service and
looking at how we can make it sustainable in the longer term.</hs_Para>

recently had an excellent review from Sir Bruce Keogh that
looked at urgent and emergency care. It also looked at demands on
services and how the NHS should respond. We asked for that review
because of the determination not to sidestep the problem of growing
pressure on A and E but to deal long term with a
problem that has been building for decades. Too many sticking plasters
have been applied in the past to get through a year or two. That is why
we need to clarify to the public how we are planning to shape those
services for the longer term and where they will be
delivered.</hs_Para>

current reconfiguration projects are in line with the Keogh
report’s principles as an overall direction of travel. We have
been clear about that for some time. All local health economies that
are undergoing reconfiguration have to pay close heed to the direction
of travel set out in the Keogh report, the essence of which was that
this is about services, people and co-ordination. It is not just about
the bricks and mortar; it is about getting the right care to people at
the right time, and flexibility and the co-ordination of services are
just as important as how they are geographically configured, and that
was the message from the Keogh review.</hs_Para>

to the hon. Lady’s local area. She said that people want good
quality health care rooted in the local area. That is exactly what is
at the heart of the review that is being undertaken. As I have
outlined,  the configuration of local health services is a
matter for the local NHS, for the very good reasons I have given. It
cannot be dictated from Whitehall. Locally, I understand that the
review is considering health and social care services with the point
about ensuring that patients continue to receive high-quality and
sustainable services at its heart. The work includes considering how
best emergency care services and other acute services can be delivered,
and in an intervention my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley
touched on some of the ways that can be done differently and in a more
imaginative and responsive way.</hs_Para>

have been made at the moment, and of course any plans for major service
change that emerge from the review would be subject to formal public
consultation. Public consultation have to be real and robust.
Commissioners know that, and at all stages of the process I would
expect Members to be involved, as well as local government. At this
stage, the commissioners have not brought forward plans for
consultation, but they will need to be assured that any proposals they
make for reconfiguration and change will meet the strengthened tests I
mentioned
earlier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121262000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/debtext/131212-0003.htm#13121262000019">At
the heart of all this is the need to serve local people better. I
understand from some of the early engagement work, in which thousands
of local people were involved, that the message was that people want
quality and access. Those are the two key messages that came through
and that are the forefront of people’s minds. They want quality
services and they want access to them at the right time. The trust has,
I believe, identified a need to co-locate acute services to maximise 
<?notus-xml column=453?>the potential of its work force, to ensure that services are safe and to
deliver the best outcomes for patients for a long time.</hs_Para>

taking on board a range of views as part of the review. I know that the
hon. Lady has met local NHS leaders, as have my hon. Friend and other
interested local parties. That will include external independent
clinical opinion on how best to deliver emergency care, such as that
given by the Keogh review. I stress again that the process is locally
driven, and I encourage interested hon. Members to continue to engage
with the process and to work with the local NHS as it develops those
plans. The NHS is one of the world’s greatest institutions, so
ensuring that it is sustainable and serves the best interests of
patients sometimes means taking tough decisions, including on the
provision of urgent and emergency care. Those decisions are taken for a
reason: good-quality care and access to it are at the heart of
this.</hs_Para>

Lady has acknowledged, sometimes things change over time. The pressures
change, as do the way we respond to them and what we know about how
we  
<?notus-xml column=454?>respond to them. For example, we know that more than 30% of people who
go to A and E—in some places, it is more
in the order of 50%—do not even need to be there. That is not
sustainable in the long term and we need to address it, but those
decisions are best made when the NHS is working in collaboration with
local people, with local democratic representatives and with local
authorities and considering what is best for the people of their
area.</hs_Para>

hard-working NHS staff of Calderdale for the service they give to the
people of that area and to the hon. Lady’s constituents? I hope
very much that they have a good Christmas in the sense that they have

industry to develop an agreed “Organisational Standard”.
Last month, the Minister for Universities and Science announced details
of this new standard which will not only give companies a clear
baseline to aim for in addressing cyber-security risks to their company
but will enable them to advertise the fact that they meet a certain set
of criteria on cyber-security. This provides them with an obvious
competitive advantage in a 
<?notus-xml column=44?>marketplace that increasingly demands better cyber-security from
suppliers. To reinforce this and give the standard a kick-start, we
will be mandating its use in Government procurement. Its adoption will
be subject to proportionality and relevance, particularly in relation

to impose costs on business but rather to boost cyber-security while

and empower their customers to protect themselves by offering tools and
security solutions, or indicate where solutions can be accessed. If
their customer does experience a problem, ISPs will support them by
providing clear information about how to report the incident. They will
also inform them of a potential compromise, in line with company
policy, and explore ways to bring potential issues to the attention of
customers. This is an important step in not only protecting people

Elliott’s report recognises the leading role of the food
industry, placing responsibility for delivering a food supply to
consumers which is safe, resilient and free from crime, firmly on food
businesses. EU food law makes it clear that it is the responsibility of
food business operators to ensure that the food they sell is safe and
is as described. The need for a more standardised audit process and the
need for a balance between random and routine testing, reflect concerns
expressed during the horsemeat fraud incident. The food industry
undertakes a rigorous testing programme to ensure food authenticity.
For horsemeat alone, the results of over 31,000 tests have been
reported to the Food Standards Agency over the past nine months, none
of which post incident have tested positive. During the incident less
than 1% of tests of beef products in the UK were positive for
horsemeat, compared to over 4% in the Europe-wide testing programme.
The Government will continue to work with food businesses and local
authorities responsible for enforcement to ensure measures are
effective and not burdensome. We are already working with the sector to
generate better food fraud intelligence by identifying barriers and
solutions to intelligence sharing. This includes work being led by the
FSA to develop a new intelligence hub to improve its capability to
identify and prevent threats to food safety and integrity, based on an
approach used by

implementation. Significant action is already under way to address the

Since then, we have made rapid progress in meeting that commitment and

diseases and agree priorities for action. In addition we have commenced
work to put in place new procedures for preparedness and contingency
planning to ensure we can predict, monitor and control the spread of
pests and pathogens. We expect to see the results of this work next
summer and this will help ensure the UK is ready to deal effectively
with future incursions of diseases into this country and is also able
to respond better to those that are already established. Finally,
recruitment for the senior post of chief plant health officer is under

risks that will arise from using them or their legal status. We take
this very seriously and together with law-enforcement partners, the
Home Office has recently taken part in a concerted programme of
enforcement activity. This has resulted in 73 warrants being deployed,
44 arrests and the seizure of a large number of illicit items,

the start of the interior day the Commission (Reding) introduced its
communication on the free movement of persons, which came as a result
of UK pressure over recent months. The communication noted that while
free movement was a right, that right did not include moving to another
member state to claim benefits. The Commission noted that appropriate
safeguards and tools were available under EU law to combat fraud and
abuse and committed to work with member states on these issues. The
Commission believed that the five actions set out in the communication
represented concrete tools to maximise and protect the benefits of free
movement. In particular, the Commission committed to finalise the draft
of the sham marriage handbook and, together with the Committee of the
Regions, agreed to organise a conference of mayors on 11 February
2014.</hs_Para>

UK (Home Secretary) acknowledged that freedom of movement was an
important principle of the EU, but it could not be an unqualified one.
While recognition in the communication that pressure had increased at a
local level was welcome, it was disappointing that the Commission had
failed to take seriously the evidence provided by member states. The UK
believed the Commission needed to accept that fraudulent claims for
social welfare were a growing problem, and that current rules on social
security co-ordination prevented member states from taking the
necessary steps to ensure that only those migrating to work and
contribute to a host country’s economy could access welfare
benefits. On the sham marriage handbook, the UK and others were not in
a position to accept the draft given its narrow focus. The Home
Secretary also highlighted the domestic changes to tighten the
UK’s implementation of free movement rules and to protect local
communities, which had been announced by the Prime Minister. In
conclusion, the UK said the EU of today was different to the EU of 30
years ago and the Prime Minister had recently been clear that
transition to free movement for future accession countries could not be
done on the same basis as it was in the past. The UK believed that
abuse of free movement must also be part of the next justice and home
affairs work
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121259000297" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/wmstext/131212m0001.htm#13121259000297">A
number of other member states thought the Commission’s response
to the abuse of free movement was insufficient and ineffective, by
failing to clarify member states’ legal powers or proposing new
actions to protect the freedom of movement from abuses such as benefit
fraud, document fraud and sham marriage. If the Commission was not in a
position to support, member states would consider working together
outside the EU structures. Free movement rights came with
responsibilities, and tackling abuse would increase public trust in the
EU and the national authorities. Others noted that free movement was a
fundamental right and that the overwhelming majority of citizens move
to work. However, abuse, where it existed, needed to be tackled. The
presidency noted that the Council would return to these issues in the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121259000298" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/wmstext/131212m0001.htm#13121259000298">The
counter-terrorism co-ordinator (CTC) presented a paper on foreign
fighters in Syria and asked for a steer on how the proposals should be
taken forward. The Commission emphasised that while much of this work
was the responsibility of the member states, it stood ready to support.
The European External Action Service (EEAS) drew attention to the fact
that not every European who travelled to Syria was driven by extremism
and that humanitarian motives played a significant role. Eurojust noted
that the existing legal framework across the member states was
sufficient and considered judicial co-operation with non-EU states to
be crucial. Europol stressed that the success of its work relied upon
information provided by member
states.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121259000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/wmstext/131212m0001.htm#13121259000299">All
interventions supported the CTC’s paper and the majority called
for an emphasis on prevent work, third country engagement, and for
greater use of existing information systems. Almost all member states
specifically referenced the importance of agreeing the EU passenger
name records (PNR) directive. The UK updated Ministers on the key
findings of the extremism taskforce report of 4 December and pushed for
EU work to focus on prevent initiatives, particularly welcoming moves
in the internet and social media sphere. The UK underlined 
<?notus-xml column=60?>the importance of the PNR directive, particularly intra-EU PNR, third

EU’s response to the Lampedusa tragedy of 3 October developed

The short and medium-term actions to prevent further migrant deaths in
the Mediterranean were broadly endorsed and there was a strong
consensus that co-operation with countries of origin and transit was
the key to preventing migrant deaths and illegal immigration flows.
Ministers were more cautious about further sea operations in the
Mediterranean, and the Commission’s proposal to open more legal
migration channels was met with scepticism by some member states. The
UK broadly welcomed the proposed measures, but shared others’
concerns about proposals for more protected entry and legal migration
routes to the EU, which were unlikely to have any significant impact on
the problem. The focus of the EU response should instead be on
preventative work upstream, particularly in Libya and Tunisia; this
activity was also important in the context of Syria. The presidency

Council.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121259000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/wmstext/131212m0001.htm#13121259000303">The
Council considered the future JHA strategic guidelines and the
principles which should underpin them. A central theme running through
the debate was to ensure implementation and consolidation of existing
EU measures while ensuring that all future measures were carefully
assessed against the need for new measures and their added value. The
UK supported development of a short, strategic set of priorities and
reiterated that tackling free movement abuse, reducing illegal
immigration, action against human trafficking, return of foreign
offenders and improved exchange of criminal records should be the most
important priorities for action. The UK also argued that the JHA
Council should play a leading role in developing future guidelines. The
Commission noted its priorities would include better integration
policies, implementation of the common European asylum system,
solidarity and contingency planning, credible policies on tackling
irregular migration and return, strengthening internal security, and
preventing cross-border crime, tackling trafficking of firearms,
linking internal and external policies and using EU funds to support

Plus staff, which is used to help make sure claimants are clear about
the responsibilities they must fulfil in return for benefit and that
those requirements are reasonable and fair, taking into account the
individual circumstances of each claimant. This includes guidance to
ensure every Jobseeker's Agreement contains personalised information
about realistic and achievable job goals, the days and hours of
availability for work and those steps that, if taken, will represent
all the claimant can be reasonably expected to do to give themselves
best prospects of employment. Where it appears the claimant has not
fulfilled their responsibilities, Jobcentre Plus staff may be obliged
to refer the case to a decision maker for further consider and the

allowance claimants for benefit sanctions, either nationally or in the
Birmingham, Hall Green constituency. Therefore there are no steps for
me to take. All jobseeker's allowance claimants are required to meet
conditions of entitlement regulations. Only those claimants who fail to
meet these criteria are referred to an independent DWP decision maker

appropriate.</hs_Para>

citizens can evidence their right to work to an employer under the
checks to prevent illegal working in the Immigration, Asylum and

National Insurance number in combination with their full birth or
adoption certificate or certificate of naturalisation or registration

document check before the person's employment commences. An employer is
not required to contact the Home Office to seek confirmation of

applicants leave the United Kingdom voluntarily without informing the

departure on CID after conducting 'post departure checks'. However,
these checks do not cover all possible departure routes, or
eventualities—such as when an individual leaves on false

Inspector of Borders and Immigration's freight operations report
highlighted that there are areas that Border Force needs to work on
with regards to lines of communications. The Border Force relationship
with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), while good at senior level, needs
to improve at the front line. Border Force is taking steps to address
this. For example, senior HMRC managers have visited Border Force
front-line locations (e.g. Dover, Felixstowe) to listen to feedback on
practical border enforcement issues. This dialogue is informing customs
freight policy development and other work being done to improve customs
operational
guidance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121273000327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/text/131212w0001.htm#13121273000327">Recognising
the good relationships at the strategic level, effort is already
focused on improving these at the operational level. There are a series
of operating protocols that govern the working relationship between
Border Force and HMRC and these have all been updated to clearly
articulate referral and information exchange processes for front-line
officers relating to intelligence sharing, criminal investigations and
international trade. With respect to prosecutions, this also includes a
commitment to increase the number of HMRC-led investigations following
referral from the Border Force front

Hammond:</Member></B> In 2007, Network Rail undertook
an assessment of the feasibility of operating double deck trains on the
conventional UK rail network—including the line between Brighton
and London. The study found that the scope for extra seating in such
trains would be limited by the significant amount of space which would
be taken up by staircases and vestibules inside the carriages. In
addition, extra time would be needed for passengers to board and alight
from such trains at stations. Furthermore, to accommodate the much
larger carriages, extremely costly and disruptive rebuilding of
tunnels, bridges and other railway infrastructure would be required.
For these reasons, the study concluded that the operation of longer
conventional trains represented a more efficient way of providing
additional capacity for passengers. The introduction of double deck
trains on the West Coast main line as an alternative to High Speed 2
was considered by the Department for Transport in 2010. The option
suffered from the drawbacks set out in Network Rail's study and was
therefore not taken
forward.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13121282000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/text/131212w0001.htm#13121282000043"><B><Member PimsId="5547" UID="13121282000214" xid="1066" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131212/text/131212w0001.htm#13121282000214">Chris

is suspended, there is a presumption that the court will give effect to
the custodial sentence unless it considers that it would be unjust to
do so in view of all the circumstances. If the court does not give
effect to custodial sentence, it must impose more onerous community
requirements, or extend the supervision or operational period of the

examines the impact of age on prevalence, projecting this into the

vary by age at a national

was compiled in accordance with International Financial Reporting

change to the basis on which the data is compiled, and means that a
direct comparison should not be made between 2009-10 and the earlier
years' data. The change to IFRS means that many assets previously held

Period life expectancy at birth is an estimate of the average number of
years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the area's
age-specific mortality rates for that time period throughout his or her
life. The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in
each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area.
It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each
time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates
of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of
those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of
their
lives.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>2</Sup>

proposed that radio stations that can be accessed by a large number of

least 40% of an overlapping local multiplex area<Sup>1</Sup>

in respect of abandoned and silent nuisance calls. In total, Ofcom has
issued 12 monetary penalties for abandoned and silent calls since the
start of 2007. Ofcom has also undertaken informal enforcement action,
the result of which is that companies about whom Ofcom may have
concerns, are brought into compliance more quickly without having to
pursue formal action. In the first half of this year, Ofcom took such
action against 11 companies, and as a result complaints linked to the
telephone numbers used by seven of those organisations stopped and

kind as this information is not available. However, Ofcom research has
found that 82% of UK adults with a landline reported receiving a
nuisance call, during the four week research period at the start of
2013. Those who reported receiving a nuisance call reported receiving
an average of about eight calls (8.4) over a four week period, which
equates to approximately 2 calls per week and 26% reported more than 10
nuisance calls over the four week period. Ofcom will be repeating this

This represents approximately 26% of the 15,518 maintained schools who
were expected to administer the tests. The Department’s Head of
Profession for Statistics determined that a sufficient volume of
results was available to give a representative estimate of achievement
nationally, but advised that caution needed to be exercised in

look after wherever they are placed. There remains a significant gap in
educational outcomes of looked after children and care leavers compared

ensure that looked after children and care leavers receive the support
they need. Looked after children have top priority in school admission
arrangements so that they have the chance to go to schools that best
meet their needs and encourage them to reach their full potential. From
April 2014, the pupil premium for looked after children will include a
pupil premium plus which means it will more than double from

to secure a place for any eligible two-year-old since 1 September 2013.
By October 2013, local authorities estimated that around 92,000
two-year-olds were already accessing a place. Formal data on the number
of two-year-olds in funded places will be collected through the Early
Years and Schools Censuses, which will take place in January 2014 and

Government laid the regulations that would give effect to the new
entitlement on 4 October 2012, nearly a year ahead of implementation,
to maximise the time that local authorities had to plan. The
regulations set out which children would be eligible for funded places
when the new entitlement came into force, and many local authorities
chose to adopt the national eligibility criteria early. However, prior
to September 2013, places were delivered by local authorities on a
discretionary basis, and could, therefore, be allocated in accordance
with locally determined criteria. The Department for Education did not
collect information on the children to whom local authorities provided
places.</hs_Para>

pilots that were established in local authorities from 2006, around
20,000 children benefited nationally. Funding for two-year-old places
increased in 2012-13 and again in 2013-14 to enable local authorities
