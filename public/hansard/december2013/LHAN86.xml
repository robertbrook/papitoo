Hillsborough Castle is the official residence of Her Majesty the Queen
and has been the sovereign’s residence since 1922. The castle is
also the residence of the Secretary of State and of the Minister for
Northern Ireland. Current proposals are to pass the operation of
Hillsborough Castle to Historic Royal Palaces and significantly to
increase public access. However, full royal and ceremonial use will
continue

Lexden (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for telling
the House about the important decision to place Hillsborough in the
guardianship of the Historic Royal Palaces trust. Does not the
existence of a permanent royal residence both symbolise and underline
the enduring commitment of the Royal Family to all sections of the
community in this part of our country—a commitment perhaps best
expressed by the late Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who once told
my noble friend Lord Molyneaux that each night she included in her
prayers, “God Bless Ulster”? Does my noble friend also
agree that it is most fitting that the decision should come in the year
that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales celebrated his 65th
birthday, for the cross-community work of his many charitable
organisations contributes significantly to progress in Northern Ireland

Royal Family is to be commended for its loyalty and for the work that
it has done with Northern Ireland. We all remember the significance
almost two years ago of the Queen’s handshake. The existence of
Hillsborough Castle as a royal residence is guaranteed under the new
arrangements, and full facilities for royal access will be there. It
will be easy for members of the Royal Family to use the castle when
they wish for their royal duties in Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T15:09:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121184000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Alderdice" PimsId="3622" UID="13121184000754" xid="1044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000754">Lord
Alderdice (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, does my noble friend accept
that, given the extraordinary—indeed,
transformational—effect of Her Majesty’s visit to the
Republic of Ireland, and the fact that Hillsborough Castle is not only
a royal residence but a place of enormous political significance on the
island of Ireland because of the signing of the Anglo-Irish agreement
and the importance of other negotiations, there is a 
<?notus-xml column=774?>real possibility of tourist potential not just from within Northern
Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, but that many people south
of the border will be keen to come to Hillsborough Castle for its
associations with Her Majesty and the Royal Family, as well as the
important political associations that it also
has<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T15:10:26"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121184000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Randerson" PimsId="5929" UID="13121184000755" xid="2139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000755">Baroness
Randerson:</Member></B> My Lords, the intention is that the new
arrangements will make it easier to attract both domestic and foreign
tourists to visit Hillsborough Castle. It is important to remember that
as well as being a beautiful castle—a beautiful building with
beautiful grounds—it has tremendous historic significance. It is
important to remember that royal tourism alone is estimated to be worth
£500 million a year to the United Kingdom. Therefore, it is
important that we open up the castle as much as possible—and
considerably more than has been possible in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121184000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T15:10:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Lord Empey" PimsId="5912" UID="13121184000756" xid="2122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000756">Lord
Empey (UUP):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, in welcoming the
Minister’s reply, I will ask her two questions. Firstly,
Hillsborough Castle is owned by the Northern Ireland Office. When is it
anticipated that it will be transferred to the Historic Royal Palaces
trust, and will any additional trustees, including a trustee from
Northern Ireland, be added to the trust

ownership of Hillsborough Castle. An agreement will be signed with
Historic Royal Palaces. It is anticipated, following negotiations, that
it will be signed next April, but there will be a transition period of
two to three years before the full handover to the new arrangements is
complete. On the question of trustees, a Northern Ireland group already
exists in relation to Hillsborough Castle. It is intended that this
should be refreshed and set up anew under the new arrangements. It will
have a strong representation from Northern Ireland, as well as trustees

they need just to teach; they have to open their doors to businesses,
and businesses have to engage with them. In my travels around the

engage with schools; it is usually a question of putting in place the
structures. The organisation Business in the Community has a marvellous
programme called Business Class which is providing careers advice,
mentoring and workplace experience to 300 groups of schools. There is
the Glass Academy in Sheffield and a number of other such models.

the FCA to make sure that the adverts are not misleading. We debated
this at Third Reading of the banking reform Bill. The key thing is that
people should know what the repayments are, not just in terms of the
interest rate—people are very often not desperately familiar
with that—but in terms of being absolutely clear about what they
have to repay and when. The point that possibly lies behind the noble
Lord’s question is whether there should be payday loans at all.
As long as payday loans are legal, people have to make some sort of
assessment about whether they are going to be in a position to repay
them. What the Government and the FCA are committed to doing is to make
the costs as clear as possible and limit the potential downside of less

was delighted to help the Prime Minister lead the largest ever UK
business delegation to China. Our bilateral trade and investment
relationship with China is improving. Exports to China have almost
doubled since 2009 and more Chinese investment has come into the UK in
the past 18 months than in the past 30 years combined.
However, there is more to be done, especially in focusing on areas
where the UK has particular strengths and where these match
China’s emerging demands. Many of these
strengths—healthcare, education, the creative industries and
agri-tech, to name but a few—were showcased last week. Several
agreements in these sectors were signed during the visit and these will
open further opportunities for UK

on the trip. The law firms were represented, particularly in
discussions on the Shanghai free trade zone, in which the UK is going
to provide excellent support. The UK legal sector is a great strength,

its cities and needs to make its environment greener—there are a

The cultural sector was mentioned earlier. Yes, we can mention whisky.
We have even been selling tea to China, which is remarkable. Going

Amendment 105 is unnecessary. It has become clear over the course of

by my noble friend Lord Teverson, would allow application of the
emissions performance standard to any coal-fired power station that
fits the pollution clean-up equipment needed to meet the requirements
of the industrial emissions directive. To date, only one station,
Ratcliffe-on-Soar, is fitting the equipment needed to comply with the
directive and there is no evidence that a large number of others are
seeking to do the same. However, this amendment could result in all but
one of the 12 coal-fired power stations expected to be operational
after 2015 being subject to limited hours or forced closure under the
directive. There is a risk that this, in turn, could lead to a scenario
where more stations close earlier than might otherwise be the case.

capacity in this period. My department has therefore looked at a
scenario where all our coal-fired power stations close by 2025, which
is one possible risk of this amendment. The results of this analysis

fundamental purpose of the present amendment —and, indeed, the

unabated coal in the national energy mix is not foreseen beyond 2025.
Indeed, that is the Government’s position. In the other place,
the Minister indicated that he expected the overall contribution of
coal to our electricity generation in 2025 to be about 3%. In the
unlikely event that external events made it look as though unabated
coal would be needed longer, the Bill already contains provisions to

we are bothering with this now. It is simply to provide an additional
crumb of confidence to those who are contemplating investing in new,
gas-fired power generation. It is a bad time for investment in energy
utilities and it would be helpful to have a clear indication that gas
will be our main means of fossil-fuel generation from the 2020s
onwards. It is probably unnecessary to point out that this amendment
could have no real effect on energy prices in the foreseeable future.
This is mostly because the amendment would have no effect on generation
until well into the next decade and partly because power price is
largely determined by the swing producer, which is gas. At present,
coal is cheap and is making an increased contribution to our power
generation. However, you will have noticed that this does not translate
into lower electricity prices but rather into better margins for
coal-fired power stations.</hs_para>

about true competition in generation, handing yet more power and money

Canada the clarity of that regulation has brought forward investment in
the world’s first commercial-scale CCS plant, which will open
next year. In the UK we have not followed this but have opted instead
to try to tax coal off the system—an option that is not
delivering at the moment. Unfortunately, there is a great risk that
this course of action will continue to fail and operators of coal will
decide to sweat their assets for longer, using the large up-front

therefore be able to use their three-year capacity payments to offset
the costs of upgrading and continue to sweat their assets for another
five years at full capacity, which would then be available for 40% of
the time thereafter. This seems like a good deal. By 2025, all but one

have said is that we will seek out the least costly forms of carbon
abatement. There is no cheaper way of reducing carbon dioxide than
using existing gas stations in place of existing coal stations. That is
how the UK decarbonised its economy in the 1990s and that is how we
should be doing it again now. However, there is sufficient doubt about
that, because of the price of coal relative to the price of gas. It is

of the things that the Government are currently struggling with is

Hanworth (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we have been
told that the Energy Bill has two purposes. The first purpose is to
secure the much needed investment in new plant for generating
electricity. The second is to decarbonise our electricity supply.
Amendment 105, which has been rejected by the Government, was closely
aligned with these two purposes. Its effect was to ensure that if there
were major upgrades to coal-fired power stations, such as to enable
them to meet the European emission requirements in respect of
sulphates, nitrates and heavy metal contaminations, they should also be
constrained to meet the emissions performance standards in respect of
carbon dioxide that are imposed by the Bill. The subsequent amendment
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, reinstates this requirement but
includes a let-out clause that would allow the Government to alleviate
the requirement, if necessary. Presumably, this would be appropriate in
a case where the lack of capacity was so pressing as to imply a real
danger of the lights going out.</hs_para>

Fallon, argued in the Commons that to include such amendments would add
to the risks faced by investors. The logic of his position
escapes most of us, who believe that the original Amendment 105, or its
replacement by the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, would
clarify the intentions of the Bill in a way that would
actually encourage investment. Why does that Minister insist on the
rejection of these amendments? Is it that he wishes there to be a
loophole in the legislation that would allow dirty, coal-fired power
stations to remain in operation, notwithstanding the ostensible purpose
of the Bill? There are certainly grounds for such a suspicion. However,
the Minister has asserted on several occasions that he doubts, even
with the allowances the Bill affords, whether any of the old coal-fired
power stations have a

My Lords, I speak in favour of the
amendment. I find it difficult to understand, for anybody who
concentrates not on 
<?notus-xml column=790?>tactical issues such as the speed of passing of the legislation but
simply on the wording, what their opposition in principle could be. The
simple fact of the case is that Parliament several years ago passed an
Act of Parliament by huge majorities, committing us to the very
significant decarbonisation of our economy: an 80% reduction in
CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions by 2050. It is the clear conclusion of all
analysis, including that of the Committee on Climate Change that I used
to chair, that there is no believable path to that emissions reduction
by 2050 which does not involve the very significant—almost
total—decarbonisation of electricity in particular by around
2030.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121184000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000095">Clearly
that is completely incompatible with a role for coal other than as
providing a small number of hours a year of peaking capacity into the
mid or late 2020s. This amendment would simply ensure that that
possibility would clearly be excluded—with, however, a get-out
under Section 48 if that at all endangered an adequacy of supply. It
simply seeks to ensure that we will not have unabated coal in
significant quantities in the late 2020s, and it does so 12 years
ahead, in order to influence the decisions on investment that are
required for security of supply.</hs_para>

Lord Jenkin’s point that the Bill needs to proceed and that we
must get it on to the statute book. The only reason I have pursued this
is that, as the noble Lord, Lord Turner, suggested, the issue of the
continued generation of electricity by coal is fundamental to the
policies of both this and the previous Government, and therefore needs
to be clarified. These two amendments are attempts to increase as far
as possible certainty for investors and clarify the way forward. As the

least we can start to close down the risks and probabilities, which is
one of the main purposes of the

Will she comment on my questions about Eggborough, as that is the very
first test of whether this Bill is actually going to deliver? It was
part of DECC’s announcement on projects that are going forward
under the FID enabling scheme but I hear that next week they will
receive a letter saying that they are not eligible for the first
tranche because of a new system that the Government have introduced of
rationing out the CFD

quickly. The Bill has undergone thorough scrutiny and the Government
have listened very carefully to all the concerns raised during its
passage through this House. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord
Teverson for his warm
words<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:19:55"></hs_TimeCode>. We have
responded to a great many of the issues raised by colleagues from all
sides of the House on, for example, domestic tariffs and access to
markets, and we have introduced new topics—for example, carbon
monoxide and smoke alarms.</hs_para>

moreover, has welcomed them. It has recognised the expertise that this
House has brought to the scrutiny of the Bill and the real improvements
to it that this House has made. However, the other place has decided
with a considerable majority that it does not agree with this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:20:39"></hs_TimeCode>. The
elected Chamber saw an unprecedented majority for the Bill as it
completed its passage through the other place. Today, we can decide
that the Bill proceeds to the statute book—a Bill that is
essential for protecting consumers and for ensuring security of supply
and decarbonisation of our economy. Nothing will send a firmer signal
to investors than that this House will do nothing that prevents the
Bill receiving Royal

Oxburgh:</Member></B> My Lords, so much for my attempts to find an
uncontroversial middle way of bringing all sides together. The
temperature of this debate has been a little higher than I would have
expected and, indeed, than I would have hoped. I agree with a great
deal that the Minister has said on both security of supply and the
Bill’s importance for investors. However, the fact is that the
amendment increases, rather than reduces, both those things. If Members
with a keen sense of smell have detected a faint aroma in the Chamber,
it is the aroma of red
herrings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:22:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerns about certainty for investors if my amendment is agreed, and
the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said the same thing. He is quite right:
we do not really know what is going to happen in 10 years’ time,
but the Bill contains a measure that allows the Government to disregard
these constraints if severe circumstances mean that it is necessary to
do so. Therefore, that question of security of supply does not really
exist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:22:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

certainty for investors is concerned, in the near term the necessity is
for investment in gas-fired power stations. Everyone agrees with that.
This amendment would improve, not reduce, certainty for investors in
the time that we can look forward to. I do not know anyone who does not
think that we need new gas-fired power stations, and the amendment
would help
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:23:26"></hs_TimeCode> in

Jenkin, rightly said that we have to get on with it. I am going to
press this matter to a vote. I do not think that it need delay the
passage of the Bill for more than a few days. As far as investors 
<?notus-xml column=795?>are concerned, getting the right Bill before Christmas, which the
Government can certainly do if they are so minded, will be the main
thing. The fact that that happens a day or two later is neither here
nor there, and there will be a much more certain basis for investing in
new gas.</hs_para>

second amendment would leave out the requirement to return an expired

to be used for purposes for which it is no longer valid. My question,
of course, is: why not? If the document has expired, what harm is
there? Are there no other systems that are sophisticated and efficient
enough to pick up whether an expired travel document is, in fact,
expired? This seems an odd sanction, merely on the basis of reasonable
belief. My particular reason for questioning it is that it might really
irritate people quite unnecessarily. I have written “unnecessary
aggro” against this, and I genuinely think that we should avoid
causing unnecessary aggro, because there are enough sensitivities
around passport and immigration controls and so on without adding one
which, to my mind at any rate, is not
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:43:47"></hs_TimeCode>. I beg

Such powers may be necessary where a passport has been withdrawn in the
public interest; for example, to disrupt a person’s travel

terrorism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121184000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000132">Amendment
56YG relates to the ability of a constable to authorise a person to
carry out a search on their behalf. The purpose of this provision is to
allow a constable to make use of support if required when carrying out
a search at places other than a port. Such support would be exercised
under the authority of a constable, and I reassure my noble friend
that, in view of the type of case to which this paragraph applies, it
would in practice be likely to be carried out in the presence of a
constable. The authorised person—such as a police community
support officer—would not be empowered under the provision to
use reasonable force or to require a person to hand over the passport
for inspection purposes.</hs_para>

think my noble friend labelled the “avoiding unnecessary
aggro” amendment, relates to expired travel documents. I agree
with my noble friend that there is often little harm in returning an
expired document to the passport holder. Indeed, there is provision in
paragraph 4 of Schedule 7 for that very purpose. The provision
recognises that the passport holder may wish to retain the expired
passport because, for example, it may include extant visas for travel
to other countries. It may even provide memories of places that they
have travelled to previously; as well as a visual record, for good or
bad, of how we may have looked some 10, or even 20, years
ago.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121184000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000134">However,
on a more serious point, the British passport does of course remain the
property of the Crown at all times. There is no entitlement to a
passport and no statutory right to have access to it. If a person
intends to make use of an expired passport for a purpose for which it
is no longer valid—in other words, for a 
<?notus-xml column=800?>fraudulent purpose—it is right that a
constable should be able to remove the document. This would prevent it
being used elsewhere for fraudulent purposes, where the level of checks
may not be so robust.</hs_para>

inappropriate that a constable should hand back an expired passport to
a person where he or she reasonably believes that it is intended to be
used for a fraudulent purpose. It would send out the wrong message to
the passport holder and would simply allow—if not, indeed,
encourage—them to continue to make use of the document for wrong
and potentially unlawful reasons. I hope, in light of the explanation I
have given, that my noble friend will withdraw her
amendment.</hs_para>

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I will do so but I have to say that,
first, on the issue of the expired passport, there are some good
reasons which a passport holder may not even think of at the time. One
that immediately occurs to me is the need to be able to show the number
of days you have been in the country, which involves showing when you
have travelled out of and back into the country. There are tax reasons
why a number of people need to be able to show that. It is a matter of
the officer’s discretion and reasonable belief but I find it
difficult to imagine how the conversations would be
conducted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:48:19"></hs_TimeCode>. I
should perhaps ask my noble friend whether he can tell the Committee

regards whether someone other than a constable can exercise the powers

be the constable. If that is the case, the obvious question is: why
allow for anyone else to do it? Another question is whether there will
be instructions to officers—guidance, codes of practice or
whatever—that might deal with this. I do not know whether my

their biometric data, including their DNA and fingerprints, taken from

I agree with all the amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady
Kennedy, as well as those in our name. She made a convincing
argument, particularly on the ineffectiveness of the legislation. In
spite of the vast number of stops and searches that have taken place,
we have not had a single conviction. This is not a device for catching
terrorists or even being able to question them—the noble
Baroness added that none of them had even been charged. This matter has
caused enormous concern to the Joint Committee on Human Rights and to
the Equality and Human Rights Commission, with which we have an
opportunity to discuss the amendments. It is as worried as we are that
Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act could violate human rights and equality
laws and cause immense damage to community relations because of its
widespread negative impact, particularly on our Muslim population. The
EHRC made submissions to the Home Office consultation on Schedule 7
powers, and again, in 2013, it made a further submission to the Joint
Committee on Human Rights in relation to its scrutiny of the Bill. It
seems to me that the EHRC has been
ignored<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:09:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121184000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000164">We
recognise the importance of stop and search powers as a tool for crime
detection and prevention, and we acknowledge that Schedule 7 forms part
of the UK’s counterterrorism strategy, which is aimed at
protecting people in ports and airports and on the chief modes of
transport which have been targeted by terrorists in the past. It could
also prevent terrorists from entering UK territory.</hs_para>

believe—with others—that the legal form and practical

Schedule 7 is eroding Muslim trust and confidence in policing and
called for greater transparency and accountability around its use.
Following the consultation already mentioned, Clause 132 and Schedule 8
to the Bill propose certain changes to the provisions in Schedule 7 to
the Terrorism Act 2000 for stopping, examining and detaining people at
ports. However, I agree with the EHRC that to do this without the need
for reasonable suspicion or other limitations is far too broad, lacks
efficient safeguards, and could be a breach of the requirement that
such an interference should be prescribed by, and in accordance with,
the law pursuant to Articles 5 and 8 of the European Convention on
Human Rights.</hs_para>

been made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights and several of the
amendments in this group are based on its recommendations. This is
especially the case when an individual is questioned about his
political and religious beliefs and activities, as well as those of
others in his community and family. The Islamic Human Rights
Commission says it has received dozens of complaints of inappropriate
questioning, such as officers asking Muslims whether they pray, whether
they would be willing to spy on their communities and which party they
voted for at the last election. The commission concludes
that,</hs_para>

will give two examples from my own experience. First, a British Shia
imam, returning to the UK through Heathrow terminal 1, was detained,
interrogated at length and had his fingerprints and DNA
taken. I was told the samples would be retained indefinitely, for
comparison with samples taken at the scene of terrorist offences. I
wrote to Jacqui Smith, then Secretary of State for the Home
Office, on 5 December 2008, asking for the samples to be
destroyed, in the light of the case of S and Marper at the
European Court of Human Rights. I finally got the samples
destroyed and the imam’s name expunged from the database on
25 January 2010 after 13 months of correspondence and
telephone calls with Ministers and their offices and various
branches of the police, including SO15, or Counter Terrorism
Command.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121184000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000168">In a
second case, which is still ongoing, a friend of mine, who is a
Bahraini national, has been stopped several times at Heathrow and
King’s Cross and his complaint was taken over by the IPCC, which
issued proceedings against the Metropolitan Police on 10
October 2013 because it would not investigate the basis for the stops.
It was expected that some months could elapse before the case was heard
in the High Court, and I would be grateful if my noble friend could
give me an update on that. As I said to the security Minister, James
Brokenshire, it is clearly unacceptable that our police should be
harassing and intimidating Bahraini refugees here, including British
citizens, when they are entitled to protection from the regime that
persecuted them. Instead, it is clear that our police are acting as
agents of the al-Khalifa oppressors. It is odious that peaceful
opponents of any state which violates human rights should continue to
be persecuted after they seek asylum here. It is not simply an
operational matter for the police, but one that touches on our
obligations under the refugee convention. As I also said to
Mr Brokenshire, I do not believe the police would have acted in this
disgraceful way unless they had been told from on high that this is how
they were expected to
behave.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121184000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000169">More
widely, the EHRC’s statistical analysis of examinations and
detentions under Schedule 7 suggests that disproportionately high
numbers of black and Asian passengers are being stopped and the
disproportion increases further with over-the-hour examinations and
still further with detentions. The code of practice on Schedule 7
prohibits reliance on ethnicity as the sole reason for
examining a person, so the EHRC suggests that an investigation be
undertaken to see whether that is the practice. However,
statistics alone cannot prove that a power is being used in a
discriminatory manner; a more comprehensive study is needed
to see whether the conduct of the police under Schedule 7
breaches the Equality Act. I hope that my noble friend will say that in

that the power to detain and question for more than an hour

a reasonable suspicion that the person being questioned is or has been

amendments recommended by the JCHR. I hope that your
Lordships would agree with the distinction that it draws between, on
the one hand, the powers which can be exercised without
reasonable suspicion—such as the power to stop, question and
request documentation, and physically search persons and
property—and, on the other, the more intrusive powers such as
detention, strip-searching, searching contents of personal electronic
devices, the taking of biometric samples and the seizure and retention
of property, including personal information on electronic devices,
which should be exercisable only if the examining officer reasonably
suspects that the person is or has been “concerned in …
terrorism”. This amendment gives effect to the JCHR proposal for
a reasonable suspicion requirement before the more intrusive powers
under Schedule 7 are exercisable, and to its suggestion that the
threshold for these powers should be the point at which the person
being examined is formally detained, after one hour of
questioning.</hs_para>

one hour under paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 7. If the
examining officer wants to question the person for more than one hour,
then the person will have to be detained under new paragraph 6
of Schedule 7, which triggers the safeguards
contained

hour, and only one in 2,000 examinations lasted more than

to stop and seize and, at the same time, preventing so far
as possible any abuse of that power is a difficult balance to strike.
However, it is worth recording that we concluded that the Government
had made out a case for a without -suspicion power to stop,
question and search travellers at ports and airports, given the current
nature of the threat from terrorism, the significance of international
travel, the overall threat picture, and the evidence seen by the
independent reviewer demonstrating the utility of non-suspicion stops
at ports in protecting national security. Therefore, we also concluded
that the retention of this power under Schedule 7 was not inherently

56YK and 100A refer to a process by which effect could be given, almost

a mechanism to take action more quickly than always having to wait for
the next legislative slot for primary legislation in the

even with the affirmative procedure, would give adequate opportunity

has been pointed out, the independent reviewer of terrorism

have to say that, as Mr Anderson has also observed, there is a limit to

preliminary view of the amendments before us today. Subject to the

Lady Smith, invited me to do, I begin by touching on Amendments 56YJ

around safeguards for legally privileged and related material and the

would like to be clear that the current compulsion under Schedule 7 to
the 2000 Act to answer questions means that admissions made in an

independent reviewer of terrorism legislation makes recommendations,

decide what legislative changes should flow from the independent
reviewer’s recommendations. Given the importance of these
issues, any such legislative proposals should be subject to full
parliamentary scrutiny—as with the provisions in this

57 and 58 deal with fundamental principles of the powers. First,
Amendment 57 seeks to qualify the definition of the purpose
for which these powers can be used. The legislation is already clear:

noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, has expressed concern that the powers may
be used in a discriminatory way. Accordingly, Amendment 57 also
includes requirements on collecting data. Requiring examining officers
to collect data on all protected characteristics from all individuals
examined under Schedule 7 would be both very intrusive and extremely
bureaucratic. It would also prolong the majority of examinations, of
which 63% are completed within 15 minutes. There is a question as to
how useful such data would

comparison with the UK population is not really relevant here. A
significant proportion of those who travel through ports are not UK

threat to the United Kingdom, meaning that certain routes are given
greater focus. Consequently, some ethnic groups may be more likely to
be examined, but not because the powers are being used inappropriately.

final element of Amendment 57 would remove the compulsion on
individuals examined at ports and airports to provide information. This
would fundamentally undermine the whole purpose of the legislation.
Schedule 7 examinations have led to individuals being
convicted 
<?notus-xml column=813?>for terrorist-related offences and have produced information which has
contributed to long and complex intelligence-based counterterrorist

introduce a reasonable suspicion test to be met before an examining
officer may detain a person under Schedule 7. Again, this would
undermine the capability of the police to identify individuals who are
involved in terrorism as they passed through our ports and borders.
Examinations are not simply about the police talking to people who they
know or already suspect are involved in terrorism. They are also about
talking to people travelling to and from places where terrorist
activity is taking place or emerging to determine whether those
individuals appear to be involved in terrorism, whether that is because
they are or have been involved, are going to become involved or are at
risk of becoming involved either knowingly or

those reasons, I am not persuaded that it would be right to introduce a
test of reasonable suspicion. I am pleased that my noble friend Lord
Faulks has been able to explain that the Joint Committee on Human
Rights has supported this position. However, the independent reviewer
of terrorism legislation has recently recommended that detention be
permitted and continue on periodic review only when an officer is
satisfied that there are grounds for suspecting that the person appears
to be a person concerned with terrorism. We are reflecting on this
recommendation ahead of

59, 60 and 61 would further reduce the maximum period of detention. The
police need time to carry out checks and questioning. The person may
have a lot to say, detailed or complex questioning may be required,
inconsistencies in the person’s account or documentation may
need to be understood, or time may be needed to allow the person to
consult privately with a legal adviser or to allow for interpretation.
We are already reducing the maximum period by a third but there is a

further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121184000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#13121184000208">Amendments

recording facilities are not always going to be available. If recording
were mandatory, more individuals would

63, 64 and 64ZA relate to areas where we are already introducing
reforms through the Bill. While the Bill ensures that all persons

Amendment 63 would extend those rights to everyone examined.
As I have explained, some 63% of examinations last less than 15
minutes. More than 96% are concluded within an hour. Extending
statutory rights to all those being examined, even briefly, would
create an unnecessary burden and could well lead to longer examinations
than are necessary. I would also like to remind noble Lords that the

64 relates to biometrics. Biometrics play an important part in

small but significant number of samples have provided links to
counterterrorism investigations and identified individuals using alias
details. It is therefore important to retain this power. However,
perhaps I can reassure my noble friend Lord Avebury that DNA and
biometric material obtained under a Schedule 7 examination must be
destroyed in line with the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.
If the person has not been convicted of an offence, the
sample cannot be retained indefinitely. We recognise the impact that
taking a sample could have on a person’s privacy and we are
taking steps to limit it. I would remind the noble Baroness that the

recognise the importance of clear review periods as part of the new
provisions. Our intention is to address this in the code of practice

have made significant reforms to policing to enable the police to
respond to the individual concerns of their communities and to give
local communities direct access to engage with and challenge their
local force. Community-focused policing is key to improving
satisfaction rates and public perceptions of police legitimacy, as well
as to reducing the fear of crime and perceptions of local disorder.
Police community support officers are, of course, vital in delivering
this method of policing. Taking time to engage and really get to know
their communities, the problems they face and their priorities is
central to building these strong links and helps to shape an effective
police
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#131211116000007">When
the Bill was considered in the other place, my honourable friend Steve
Barclay, the Member for North East Cambridgeshire, highlighted
inconsistencies in police community support officers’ powers. We
have already taken steps to remedy the specific issue he raised by
adding Clause 135 to the Bill, but we want to go further to support the
important role that PCSOs play. We want to ensure that they have the
necessary tools to keep the public safe and tackle the issues that
really matter to the communities they serve. We believe that 18 new
discretionary powers introduced by these amendments will do just that.
These provisions will give chief constables greater discretion and
flexibility in how they deploy police community support officers to
tackle low-level crime and anti-social
behaviour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#131211116000008">I
turn first to new cycle powers. Failing to comply with road regulations
can expose both cyclists and their fellow road users to danger,
including pedestrians, as we sometimes see. That is why we want to do
more to ensure that road safety regulations are well understood and
adhered to. In addition to giving police community support officers the
power to issue a fixed penalty notice for cycling without lights, the
amendments will give them power to issue a fixed penalty notice for
cycling through a red light, failing to comply with a traffic direction
and carrying a passenger on a cycle. We believe that giving police
community support officers a more comprehensive package of
cycle-related powers will put them in a better position to drive
improvements in cycle
safety.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#131211116000009">I
turn to new traffic powers. We are introducing a new package of
measures to give police community support officers additional powers to
issue fixed penalty notices. These include for failing to stop for a
police constable, driving the wrong way down a one-way street, sounding
a horn at night, sounding a horn when stationary, not stopping the
engine when stationary, causing unnecessary noise, contravening a bus
lane and opening a door so as to cause injury or danger. Paddy Tipping,
the police and crime commissioner for Nottinghamshire, has indicated a
desire to see PCSOs tackling traffic offences. While we do not agree
that they should be given the power to issue notices for more serious
traffic offences, we believe that the new package I have outlined is
practical at this time. I want to be clear that these measures are not
intended to provide a means to pick on drivers or cyclists, or to raise
revenue. Our focus is improving safety for all road users and to do
that we must ensure that road regulations are respected and
enforced.</hs_para>

covering is parking outside schools. The power to tackle dangerous
parking outside schools is an issue that has been raised in previous
debates and it is something we wish to address. We know that patrolling
outside schools is a core function for many PCSOs and this makes them
well placed to use their engagement and problem-solving skills to
educate drivers about the risks of dangerous parking. However, we
recognise that, on occasions, stronger action is needed and to address
this issue we are giving them the power to issue fixed penalty notices
to individuals who park in restricted areas outside schools. Local
authorities currently play a core role in parking enforcement and we
know that a collaborative approach to tackle these types of offences is
essential. We believe that chief constables should consider the role a
local authority plays before making any decision to designate this
power and we have therefore imposed a duty to consult within this
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#131211116000011">Illegal
street vendors and house-to-house collectors is another area of
concern. In addition to the measures I have outlined, the amendments
aim to support the role PCSOs play in promoting crime prevention and
tackling anti-social behaviour issues. Illegal street vendors and bogus
house-to-house collectors can cause a nuisance to communities and have
a detrimental impact on those working legitimately. Tackling this type
of behaviour is important. We recognise that illegal street vendors may
be more common within highly populated cities and that is why we are
giving PCSOs in London the power to issue a fixed penalty notice to
illegal street vendors. This is in line with existing local authority
powers. Giving PCSOs the power to confirm the identity of
house-to-house collectors will support their role in providing
community reassurance and tackling nuisance
behaviour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#131211116000012">Finally,
we will be aligning the powers of PCSOs to seize and retain material
during premises searches with those of police officers. PCSOs already
play an important role in supporting police officers to execute search
warrants but their authority to seize material is limited. Granting
PCSOs this power will free up police time by enabling PCSOs to operate
more independently of police officers when carrying out this
function.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#131211116000013">We
know that the public value the presence of PCSOs within the community
and we have been clear that engagement is at the heart of their role.
This should continue to be their core function. We believe that a
distinction between the role of a constable and a PCSO should remain
and that is why we have taken time to fully consider the implications
of conferring the powers contained within this proposal. We are
confident that they will enhance, not dilute the community engagement
role of PCSOs and I commend the amendments to the Committee. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_time UID="131211116000345" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0001.htm#131211116000345"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:59:02"></hs_TimeCode></I>6

Rosser (Lab):</Member></B> I should like to raise one or two questions
about this proposal. As the Minister has said, the role that we
currently associate with police community support officers is one of
public reassurance through visible street patrols and, as again the
noble Lord said, through community engagement, including 
<?notus-xml column=820?>engaging residents more actively in local policing. Indeed, in my own
personal experience, on one occasion two police community support
officers knocked on my front door—fortunately they were not
there to take me away—to ask me what issues, if any,
were causing me concern in my own particular locality. Presumably they
were doing a survey of residents’ opinions about issues of
concern to them.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:00:31"></hs_TimeCode> we now have
is a list of additional powers for police community support officers to
issue mainly fixed penalty notices. It could therefore be argued that
these powers will put police community support officers potentially
into a more confrontational position with members of the public than
perhaps we normally associate with their role at
present<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:00:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

under the original terms of this Bill it had not been the
Government’s intention to make considerable additions
to the powers of police community support officers. Indeed, in the
letter that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, kindly sent to
us setting out the Government’s intentions in this
amendment, he referred, as has the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon,
to Stephen Barclay’s amendment in the other place that led to
the Government tabling a new clause, which I think is Clause 135,
conferring powers on police community support officers to issue fixed
penalty notices for cycling without lights. As a result of that,
something led the Government to say, “Let’s have a
further look at what additional powers we can give to police community
support officers”. We now have before us a much greater list.
The original Stephen Barclay amendment was one additional power, but
now we have a long list of additional powers not just affecting
cyclists and not just in connection with traffic-related powers; they
go further than that. One could make a case for saying that this is
beginning to change the role of
PCSOs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:02:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

here opposing this, but my question is this: what led the Government to
believe that the extension of powers now being proposed—in
Committee stage here, the Bill having been through the other
place—is appropriate when they did not believe it to be so at
the time it was drawn up and when, bearing in mind the title
of the Bill, we can presume that virtually all issues related to
policing and the powers of the police were in fact under review and up
for consideration? I would be grateful for an explanation of why this
has been brought forward at this stage, but was not considered
appropriate when the Bill was being drawn up. I understand that these
further powers are the Government’s own view of what they want
to do and are not, subject to what the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, may say
to me in response, due to any particular pressure from someone. I can
see why the Stephen Barclay amendment was made. He raised and then
pursued it, and obviously Government Ministers said that they would
accept it and take
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:03:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

these additional powers have been put forward at a pretty late stage,
and therefore presumably over a short timescale, who has actually been
consulted on this proposed extension? Has there been wide consultation
with those who might have an interest in this change of approach? Have
the police themselves been pressing for this extension for
some time but to no avail, and now they find that,
metaphorically 
<?notus-xml column=821?>speaking, they have hit the jackpot, because what
they have been pressing for has now been agreed at a rather late stage

points as questions for the Minister and my final question
is this. Since the Government have clearly now had a look at what
additional powers it would be appropriate to give police community
support officers, powers that begin to change the nature of the
job—the operative word is “begin”—without
taking away their former functions, are the Government now going to
carry out a full review of the role and responsibilities of PCSOs? I
ask this because what is now in front of us gives the impression, again
subject to what the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, may say in reply, of
something that has been drawn up in quite a short time and is being put
forward in the Bill now when it had not been the Government’s
intention to do so not very many months ago when the Bill originally

arising from my policing background and experience. I support to some
extent the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, in what he said, at least
initially. Police community support officers, if they have a useful
role, are seen by the police as a bridge between police officers and
the community. Part of the reason they are able to perform that role is
that they have very limited powers when it comes to enforcement. They
can be seen as friends of the community and not necessarily come into
conflict with it. As we know from what happened with traffic wardens
when they were introduced, they in fact became the enemies of
motorists. We certainly would not want to erode the useful role that
police community support officers play in terms of being friends of the
community and a bridge between the community and what it increasingly
sees as enforcement officers; that is, police
officers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:06:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the need to keep a very clear distinction between police officers and
police community support officers. The recruitment standards and the
training that police officers receive are far higher than is the case
for police community support officers, particularly in the training of
police officers in the use of discretion. If we are asking police
community support officers to use their discretion as to
whether they issue fixed penalty notices to erring motorists or
cyclists, considerably more training needs to be given to them on the
circumstances in which they should use that discretion. As I say, there
is a clear danger that the distinction between the police and police
community support officers will be eroded if slowly but surely we give
police community support officers more and more
powers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:07:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

already confusion in the minds of the public as to what police
community support officers can and cannot do. When police community
support officers arrive at the scene of an incident, the public look to
them to act as police officers would, and are surprised to find that
they do not have the powers or the ability to intervene in a way that
the public expect of them. Gradually giving police community support
officers more powers will add to that confusion among the
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:08:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_11_PT_1/533726391299CBE9DD06EC01FB2BE6498FB88BC4" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 December 2013">Wednesday,

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may say first that
when those PCSOs arrived at the door of the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, I
am glad that they did not take him away. We would have been
without his expertise and input in this Bill, so we are grateful for
that. Equally, he made an important point in mentioning it. I come back
to a point I made earlier: PCSOs are distinct from police officers, and
I think I made that clear in my comments. What they do in terms of
reassurance is something that the police themselves do. Again, speaking
from my experience of working with neighbourhood teams when I was a
local councillor, the police also did similar reassurance
exercises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:08:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

specific questions that have been put to me. The noble Lord, Lord
Rosser, asked why we are proposing this now. Of course, we are
responding in line with the scrutiny of the Bill in the Commons. My
honourable friend Stephen Barclay raised the issue, but it
did go wider and beyond the specifics of his amendments. This is not
something that the Government have only just thought about. I referred
in my earlier comments to a Labour police and crime commissioner, Paddy
Tipping, who wants us to go further. We have consulted on this and we
have looked at the position with relevant experts in the field to
understand the implications of the change. We have included discussions
with the police at both the operational and the strategic level, the
College of Policing, the partnership agencies and, indeed, national
police leaders. As I said in my earlier remarks, this is about
enhancing the powers of
PCSO<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>s and not
about taking away from their engagement. We believe it is right that
the engagement role performed by PCSOs is vital in making police
accessible to all, and we do not want to overburden them with
enforcement powers that would detract from that. That is why we have
taken a considered position on these new
packages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:10:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Rosser, also asked whether we will consider more powers.
These changes will mean a significant increase in the number of powers
available for designation to PCSOs. That is an important distinction:
this is not something that is carte blanche; it is right that the chief
officers should have the freedom to take account of local circumstances
and priorities when determining how their PCSOs are deployed. That will
be the case in these additional powers that are being proposed. That is
why we have taken the time to consider and, while we will be exploring
a wider role for PCSOs, the Government believe that their particular
role is being
enhanced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:10:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with all local authorities but, in our consideration, as I have said,
we talked to partnership agencies and national police leagues; that, of
course, in some respects includes local authorities’ opinions.
This is not trying to take away from local authorities: anyone who has
worked at local government level knows that local authorities, the
police et cetera all work in partnership in ensuring that we get the

turn briefly to the points raised by my noble friend, who
speaks with great expertise in this area. I would not in any
sense seek to challenge that. I believe that the vital distinction
remains between police officers and PCSOs. We are merely seeking to
enhance the functions of PCSOs to allow them to
engage more effectively in the community and to address the very issues
he has raised about their effectiveness when they arrive at a
particular point. Our proposals are a proportionate response to what is
needed. It will help in community engagement and effective enforcement
in respect of some of the lower-level issues that are
raised. Neighbourhood policing will be in a better place for that. I
beg to move.</hs_para>

that highlight how important it is that changes of the kind that we are

police officer, infiltrated—I think that is the
word—protest groups over a period of years: groups which said
that they were involved in lawful demonstrations, rather
than crime. The former policeman, it appears, had relationships with
women in the protest movement and travelled to eco-protests across
Europe. He later told a Channel 4 documentary of his remorse, including
his regrets about and feelings for a woman with whom he had had a long
affair. HMIC reviewed the activities of Mark Kennedy and
other undercover officers and stated that his actions had led to the
collapse of a trial of environmental protesters and that he had
“defied” management instructions. The report found that
Mr Kennedy had helped to unearth “serious
criminality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:15:02"></hs_TimeCode>”.
However, Mr Kennedy said that, while the subject had 
<?notus-xml column=825?>never been broached directly, it was “impossible” that his
superiors had not known he was having a sexual relationship with some
protesters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:15:16"></hs_TimeCode>. The
report suggested that an independent body might be required to
authorise such undercover operations. It also said that Mr Kennedy was
inadequately supervised and that oversight of undercover officers
needed to be
strengthened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:15:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000032">The
second case is that of the Lawrence family. Twenty years ago, Stephen
Lawrence was murdered at the age of 18. He was, of course, the son of
Neville and Doreen, who is now my noble friend Lady Lawrence of
Clarendon, a Member of your Lordships’ House. Stephen was
cruelly murdered by racists and there was evidence of racism in the way
the police inquiry was conducted. Serious allegations have now been
made that the police spied on the Lawrence family with a view to
discrediting them. Peter Francis, a former undercover police officer
and a member of the somewhat controversial Special Demonstration Squad,
has spoken of his activities as part of an operation to spy on and
attempt to smear the Lawrence
family<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:16:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:16:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:16:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:16:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000033">These
two cases and other incidents have led to serious concerns about the
accountability of the undercover police operations that were undertaken
and raised questions about the accountability of future undercover
police operations. Our amendment seeks to ensure that all long-term
undercover operations are signed off by a relevant
independent body, to ensure that, where needed, covert operations are
used proportionately, sensitively, only when necessary and with clear
and improved accountability

operations. There are various options we can explore and we hope that

also appears to be an anomaly, because currently, if the police or
security services want to enter—perhaps to break in, to bug a
room or to intercept a phone call—they need justification that
to do so is in the interests of national security in order to get a

course—and we appreciate this—undercover operations vary.
Some will be as short as an hour or so and may involve relatively minor
matters; it would be impractical to ask for independent approval for
all such operations. However, our proposed new clause is intended to
target long-term covert police operations, and these can span from six
months to 12 months or even several
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:17:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:17:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:17:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
When such operations are undertaken, there needs to be clarity about
the goals, the methods and the priorities. Therefore, there should be
independent approval prior to any such lengthy operation. It does not
necessarily have to come from a judge, but it must be truly
independent, and the very process of seeking such approval would help
to ensure proportionality, and clarity of objectives and
methods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:18:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:18:23"></hs_TimeCode>.

the hugely inappropriate and totally wrong campaign against the

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Rosser, for tabling this amendment because I agree
with him that the whole question of undercover policing is very
important. I do not think that any noble Lord should be in doubt that
covert techniques, including undercover policing, are an important
weapon in the fight against terrorism and other serious and organised
crime. Undercover police officers play a crucial role in keeping us all
safe. It is difficult and dangerous work and I welcome this opportunity
to pay tribute to all who undertake
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000040">The new
clause proposed by the noble Lord seeks to introduce a system of
independent authorisation for undercover policing operations. I do not
believe there is any great difference of view between the noble Lord
and me on this point. We both believe that there must be proper
safeguards to ensure that these covert techniques are used only where
appropriate and that the mechanisms for approving all such deployments
are fit for purpose. However, I hope that it will help noble Lords if I
set out why I do not believe that this amendment is required, not least
because the Government have already instigated changes that are
designed to meet the concerns that have arisen in the light of some
allegations of past misconduct, which were sympathetically described by
the noble Lord, Lord
Rosser.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000041">Undercover
deployments are authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act 2000, commonly known as RIPA, which stipulates that the use of an
undercover deployment can be authorised only at a senior level within
the police force or other law enforcement agency concerned. In giving
an authorisation, the authorising officer must balance the seriousness
of the crime being investigated, and the value of the evidence likely
to be gathered, against the right to privacy of the person under
investigation and of those others who are likely to have their privacy
intruded upon, such as family, friends and other associates.</hs_para>

Inspectorate of Constabulary conducted a rigorous and independent
review of undercover policing last year and made a number of
recommendations to improve the way authorisations and deployments are 
<?notus-xml column=827?>made. Earlier this year, the inspectorate reported
on the progress made in implementing its 2012 report and was generally
positive about the work already done. The noble Lord
referred to the role played by my ministerial colleague, the Minister
for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims, the right honourable Damian
Green, who announced to the Home Affairs Select Committee our intention
to strengthen this regime to enhance oversight of undercover law
enforcement officer deployments. I am pleased to say that the order to
give effect to this commitment was laid in October and is due to take
effect on 1 January next year.</hs_para>

effect of the changes that the Government are bringing forward. First,
law enforcement agencies will need to notify the surveillance
commissioners —all retired judges—of undercover
deployments. In practice, what will happen is that a
surveillance commissioner will see the same papers that were presented
to the authorising officer and will have the opportunity to raise any
concerns. Noble Lords will appreciate that most deployments are
short-term in nature and, in many cases, last no more than a few hours.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:25:42"></hs_TimeCode>, some
are long-term, and these may give rise to the greatest concern. Initial
authorisations last for a maximum of 12 months. Accordingly, the second
change we are putting in place is that an authorisation can be renewed
beyond 12 months only with the prior approval of a
surveillance commissioner—who, I remind your Lordships, is
someone who has held a senior judicial
office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000044">In
addition, we are increasing the rank of the authorising officer.
Deployments of undercover law enforcement officers will henceforth need
to be authorised at assistant chief constable level or equivalent. Any
deployments lasting longer than 12 months will be authorised by a chief
constable or equivalent, as well as by a surveillance commissioner, as
I have already explained.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:25:42"></hs_TimeCode> seniority of
those who will now be required to authorise these deployments is an
indication of how seriously the Government take proper oversight of
undercover law enforcement activity. We believe that these changes will
promote the highest standards of professionalism and excellence in this
most sensitive area of policing. We also believe that they will achieve
the aims of this proposed new clause by ensuring judicial scrutiny of
long-term deployments while preserving the flexibility of law
enforcement agencies to act swiftly where
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000045">Covert
activity is a necessary part of the armoury of law enforcement but it
is absolutely right, as is the intention behind this amendment, that it
must be properly controlled and regulated. That is why the Government
are making the changes that I have described. In the light of these
changes and the new regime that we are now putting in place, I do not
believe that this amendment is required and I hope the noble Lord will
withdraw

before I do, I have one question for the noble Lord. Does the proposal
that is to be implemented in relation to the role of the surveillance
commissioners also include, for particularly lengthy covert operations
lasting many months, any sort of regular oversight of the operation by
the surveillance commissioners, or is 
<?notus-xml column=828?>it a case of getting their approval beforehand and, once that prior
approval has been given, that is the end of the independent

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> The prior approval is of course
designed to make sure that there is no extension without the
surveillance commissioner being a party to the decision. I cannot give
the noble Lord a clear answer on this but I would suspect that the
surveillance commissioner could make his approval dependent on an
update at some point during the extended 12-month period. I will write
to the noble Lord and give him some indication of how this would
operate. I understand entirely what he is getting at and am quite happy

amendments are concerned with what is known as a Part 1 warrant, more
familiarly known as a European arrest warrant, or an EAW. While the EAW
has had some undoubted successes, there have been concerns about its
practical application. To their credit, 
<?notus-xml column=829?>the Government asked Sir Scott Baker to undertake a review of the
country’s general extradition arrangements, including
specifically the operation of the EAW. Sir Scott Baker
produced a report containing a set of recommendations. To their credit,
the Government accepted some of them and to their additional credit
they have gone beyond Sir Scott Baker’s recommendations in
certain areas, such as the introduction of a forum bar. However, the
Government did not accept all the Baker proposals and meanwhile the
continuing operation of the EAW has led to further concerns about the
way in which it is being practically
applied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000052">A
few minutes ago I referred to the successes of the EAW. It is
incontrovertible that it has led to some very nasty people being
returned to face justice in EU member states far faster than was
possible under the legislation prevailing before the EAW was
introduced. Nowhere is this more important and relevant than in this
country’s relationship with the Republic of Ireland and its
implication for the border in Northern Ireland. No doubt that is why
the Government, having exercised their general opt-out over justice and
security under the Lisbon treaty, have decided to opt back into the EAW
directives, a decision I strongly
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000053">Understandably,
governments of every persuasion have focused on the achievements that
concern terrorists, serious criminals, paedophiles and so on. The
overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens who become involved with
the EAW do not fall into these high-profile categories. As I will
attempt to illustrate with real-life examples, too often they concern
what Edmund Burke called the “little platoons”: people
who are caught up in a process that their knowledge, experience and
contacts—unlike, for example, Members of your Lordships’
House—do not equip them to
challenge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000054">What
is the scale of this issue? Every day, about four of our fellow
citizens are served with an EAW, and about three of these will be
surrendered. It is with this group in mind that I have tabled these
amendments. If we are to deprive one of our fellow citizens of his or
her liberty and hand him or her over to another state for trial and
possible imprisonment, which by any yardstick is a very fundamental
decision, we need to be sure that the appropriate level of safeguards
is in place. While safeguards undoubtedly exist, they do not yet
provide a sufficiently balanced position. As many noble Lords are
aware, I am not a lawyer, so some of my arguments may seem to those
Members in your Lordships’ House who are learned in the law to
be legally clumsy. On this occasion, I am afraid that I am the man on
the Clapham omnibus, or at least the man in the saloon bar of the Dog
and Duck.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000055">In
so far as the man on the Clapham omnibus is concerned about these
matters he is reassured by the fact that there are two hearings before
British judges as part of the EAW process. He has a touching faith in
the British judicial system. Unfortunately, in large measure this
confidence is misplaced, because the hands of a British judge, in
hearing an EAW, are substantially tied. The first hearing that takes
place within 48 hours of arrest is essentially entirely procedural: it
concerns issues of identity and whether the person arrested is the
right one, a point I shall return to in the 
<?notus-xml column=830?>debate on my Amendment 94. It sets the date for the second hearing,
normally within 21 days, and it decides whether to remand a person in
custody or on bail, or to accept surrender if the person accepts the
charge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000056">The
second hearing is also highly restricted on the matters that the judge
can take into account in determining whether the warrant should be
executed. Here, there are some technical issues including double
jeopardy and specialty, considerations of age and passage of time since
the alleged offence was committed, and concerns about the physical and
mental condition of the subjected person. What is not discussed are the
facts of the case. So
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:34:57"></hs_TimeCode> as little as
35 days a person can be on their way to another jurisdiction, with all
that that means for their family, their employment and indeed their
whole life. In short, that is why I believe that proper safeguards need
to be in place.</hs_para>

I said at Second Reading, similar amendments were tabled at the
Committee stage of this Bill in the other place. Not one was debated,

important issue of public

that perhaps overelaborate explanation of the background to my
amendments I turn to the substance of this first group. As can be seen
from the wording, Amendments 65, 66 and 67 seek simply to change the
words “prosecution decision” to “decision to
try” in that part of Clause 137 entitled “Absence of
prosecution decision”. Amendments 70, 73, 74 and 75 are
consequential amendments to the later parts of the clause.</hs_para>

group brings us to an important issue raised by the different nature of
the UK’s judicial system from most of those of our European
partners. Along with Ireland and Malta, this country has a common law
system, with a familiar adversarial judicial system where prosecution
and defence parade their arguments before a judge and jury for them to
determine. Other European states have an investigative system. This is
not better or worse; it is just different. It does mean, however, that
a decision to prosecute can mean a decision to continue to collect
evidence that may or may not lead to a
trial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000060">The
current drafting is ambiguous and could be interpreted as allowing the
execution of an EAW where a decision to prosecute has been taken, but a
decision to try has not been. I am aware that under Section 2 of the
2003 Act and Article 1.1 of the EAW framework decision, an EAW is
defined as a decision issued for the purpose of prosecution. However, I
argue that the test for execution of an EAW should be whether the case
is trial-ready in the issuing state. Concerns have been consistently

well known case is that of Andrew Symeou, a British student who was
extradited to Greece in July 2009 to face charges in
connection with the death of a young man on a Greek island. Andrew was
extradited long before the Greek court was ready to try him and endured
a year in appalling prison conditions before being granted local bail
in Greece. Andrew was finally 
<?notus-xml column=831?>cleared by a Greek court in June 2011, almost four
years after the events in question, during which time he had not been
able to continue his university studies and his family had had their
lives turned upside down. The fact that a decision is taken at some
stage to charge may mean that the issuing state intends to proceed to
trial, but as Andrew’s case showed, what matters is whether the
issuing state is ready to do so. Accordingly, these amendments set the
test for executing the EAW as trial-ready.</hs_para>

address the problem of too-early extradition by putting pressure on the
requesting state to make use of other less disruptive measures, such as
videoconferencing and temporary transfers. These amendments would
ensure that the issuing state could not rely on its own refusal to use
alternative arrangements, such as videolinks or temporary
transfers, to justify extraditing the person in order to
charge them. I have already referred to the different legal
investigative and adversarial approaches. The Government’s
objective in the proposed Section 12A(1)(a)(ii) and
12A(1)(b)(ii) is to cater for the situation in which a decision has not
been made formally to charge the person, but only because their
presence is required in order to do so. In some countries, such as
Sweden, it is a basic defence right for the person to be charged in
person. Thus the English and Irish courts have accepted that an EAW
issued in such cases can nevertheless be considered to be for
prosecution even though it may include a decision to charge taken in
the future. However, I repeat that one of the dangers of the EAW system
is that people may be extradited too early in the process, when the
case is not trial-ready, resulting in prolonged pre-trial detention and
uncertainty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000063">I
have already mentioned Andrew Symeou. Equally, Michael Turner was
extradited to Hungary in November 2009 and was held in a high-security
prison for four months before being allowed to return home. He then had
to bear the cost of repeated trips to Hungary while the case was
investigated further. He was finally tried in October 2012, three years
later.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131211116000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000064">The
issuing authority might legitimately insist that the person be present
in order to be charged but I am concerned that this might simply begin
a protracted process between charge and trial. In these circumstances,
the use of a temporary transfer under proposed new Section 21B would be
more appropriate, enabling the person to attend and be charged and then
return to UK while the case is readied for trial. Equally, if the law
of the issuing state allows the remote attendance of a suspect using
video technology, and this does not risk prejudicing the suspect by
reason of poor quality or lack of recording, this option should be
used. These amendments allow the judge to refuse extradition where the
issuing state unreasonably refuses to consent to use either
method.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000065">Amendment
72 requires the judge to consider external evidence when determining
whether there are “reasonable grounds” to believe that no
decision has been taken to charge or try the person wanted on an
accusation EAW. Section 2(3) of the 2003 Act already requires the Part
1 warrant to contain the statement that the person is accused of the
offence, and it is possible to raise the issue of whether the EAW has
been issued as an aid to 
<?notus-xml column=832?>investigation. However, at present the courts will assume that if the
EAW contains the statement in Section 2(3) of the 2003 Act that the
person is accused, and is unambiguous in this wording, this correctly
reflects the state of proceedings and external evidence will not
normally be taken into account.</hs_para>

on the mutual trust that needs to exist between judicial authorities,
and the need to ensure that proceedings are swift and
uncomplicated. There are concerns that under the current drafting of
proposed new Section 12A no change to existing practice will result. It
may be difficult for the requested person to establish that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that no decision to prosecute has been
taken if the EAW states unambiguously that the person is the accused
and that the EAW was issued for the purpose of prosecution. In order to
fulfil the intention behind the amendment, it should be specified that
the judge should take into account external evidence, which might
include documents from the case file or expert evidence on the state of
the proceedings in the requesting state. The judge should also have
sufficiently broad direction to be able to take into account evidence
such as the past record of issuing states in this regard, as evidenced
by other documented cases involving the same
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000067">To
conclude, the Government’s proposed amendment of Section 11 of
the Extradition Act by referring to a “prosecution
decision” in Clause 137(1) has moved the game on, and I am
grateful for that. But for the reasons explained, I do not think it
goes far enough. In this very critical area, the decision to try must
surely be the gold standard and these amendments will ensure this. I

Faulks:</Member></B> My Lords, I will add just a few comments to the
excellent and clear introduction of these amendments by my noble friend
Lord Hodgson. He stressed the importance of the matter being
trial-ready before extradition takes place, and quite rightly drew a
distinction between the adversarial system, which prevails here, and
systems elsewhere of a more inquisitorial
nature.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000069">Of
course, if somebody is awaiting trial here, the question of bail
becomes highly relevant before a judge. Indeed, a judge will
be able to exercise some pressure on prosecuting authorities to get on
with it, in order to ensure that somebody is not kept in custody for
too long. That becomes impossible once somebody has been
extradited. The matter is then in the control of the local court, and
there may be just the sort of delay described by my noble friend in the
case of Symeou; not only was he in Greece for a very long time but when
he was granted bail it was so-called local bail, which is not the same
as being granted bail in your own country, because of all the
compromises that have to be made in terms of work and family
life.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131211116000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000070">As my

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend Lord Hodgson for giving us a chance to debate these issues. He
has tabled a number 
<?notus-xml column=833?>of amendments—some in this group and some to follow—and it
was good that he was able to put the different groups in context of the
overall value of the European arrest warrant. The Government attach
great value to this facility but are seeking to improve its operation
by provisions in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000072">As the
Committee will be aware, the Home Secretary announced in July that she
would introduce legislation to reform the operation of the European
arrest warrant in the UK and increase the protections offered to those
wanted for extradition, particularly British citizens. My noble friend
has drawn attention to circumstances in which the system did not
operate as we would have wished. His amendments would revise the
resulting provisions in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000073">Clause
137 will require the UK courts to bar surrender of the requested person
where the issuing state has not taken both a decision to charge and a
decision to try the person, except where the sole reason that such
decisions have not been taken is that the person’s presence in
the country is required in order for those decisions to be taken. This
will have the same effect as that intended by my noble friend’s
Amendments 65 to 67, 69 and 70 and 73 to 75; that is, a person will not
be surrendered before the issuing state is ready to try the person.
However, the clause has the added benefit of requiring the issuing
state to prove that both a decision to charge and a decision to try the
person have been made, if the judge has any doubt that either—or
both—of those decisions has been taken. This provides greater
protection for the requested
person.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000074">I can
also reassure noble Lords that when deciding whether there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the issuing state has not taken
these decisions, the judge can consider any factors or external
evidence that could inform his or her decision. We do not believe it is
necessary to set this out in explicit terms, as Amendment 72
would.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000075">Finally,
Amendments 68 and 71 seek to add a further restriction, so that
extradition could not occur where the person’s presence was
required in the issuing state for the required decisions to be made, if
that could have been achieved by temporary transfer or
video-conferencing. I understand my noble friend’s concern about
the need for safeguards. However, I do not believe that this additional
restriction is necessary. As I have explained, Clause 137 already
ensures that extradition cannot occur in the early stages of an
investigation when the issuing state is nowhere near a decision to
try.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131211116000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000076">In
addition, if the judge is satisfied that the sole reason that a
decision to charge and a decision to try have not been taken is the
fact that the person is absent from the issuing state, there is no
reason why the person should not be extradited so that those decisions
can be taken and the case proceed to trial. In these circumstances,
requiring temporary transfer simply to charge does not seem to us to
achieve anything in terms of safeguards and seems
unnecessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:49:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

hope I have quoted him right—that the judge can consider any
external factor. Certainly the advice I have received is that that is
far from the case, that the judge’s hands remain very carefully
circumscribed and tied and that the judge would not have the width and
breadth of discretion that my noble friend’s remarks suggested.
It would be helpful if one could read in some detail what he had to
say, as it is obviously highly complicated and technical, and then see

the Bill, the judge must have regard to the specified matters relating
to proportionality so far as he or she thinks it appropriate to do so,
but must not take other matters into account. Thus, the judge is
limited to the three specified matters but has discretion to ignore
them. As a starting point, I would like the Government to justify why a
judge should be able to ignore factors that will always be germane to
the issue of proportionality. If an offence is serious, extradition is
more likely to be proportionate but that does not mean that the
proportionality test has no place in serious crimes. Amendment 76
therefore removes the discretion to ignore relevant
factors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:53:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000081">Under
the proposed test, the judge can take into account just three factors
but it is unclear how they are supposed to relate to each other. In any
case, the current list of specified matters does not allow a useful
proportionality analysis. As drafted, the judge would be able to take
into account the seriousness of the offence and the anticipated
sentence, but since regard 
<?notus-xml column=835?>cannot be had to any other matter, the judge cannot balance these
against the relevant considerations. For example, it is difficult to
see how the judge can decide whether a less serious offence would make
extradition disproportionate if the judge cannot also take into account
the implication of extradition in terms of the human impact or, indeed,
the costs for the UK taxpayer. The financial costs of extradition are
high. The Government estimate that the execution of each EAW costs on
average £20,000. In addition, the human impact of
extradition can extremely severe. Recent cases under Article 8 of the
ECHR have shown that the extradition of single parents can drastically
disrupt the development of their children. There was the judgment of

amendments therefore provide the judge with sufficient discretion to

provide evidence of its very low level of seriousness, and the public

recognise that this will call for a case-by-case test and a
fact-sensitive assessment. However, this need not affect the length or
complexity of EAW proceedings. An issue raised in relation to human
impact would in any event have to be considered under Article 8 of the
ECHR. Under the operation envisaged by these amendments, the factors
considered under Article 8 of the ECHR will be considered as part of
the statutory proportionality test but alongside the cost of
extradition to the United Kingdom and having greater regard to the
seriousness of the extradition offence. Indeed, under the
Government’s proposal, it can be argued that there will often
have to be two separate proportionality 
<?notus-xml column=836?>analyses—one under the statutory test,
excluding anything to do with family life, and another under Article 8
of the ECHR, potentially resulting in confusion and
complication. Unifying the two tests, as would be achieved

Faulks:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 138,
“Proportionality”, will not be an easy one for a judge to
interpret, as my noble friend has outlined. The question of
proportionality under the Human Rights Act 1998 is one matter and then
there is the statutory proportionality, which apparently is to be
restricted to certain specific matters mentioned in subsections (2) and
(3) of the new Section 21A that Clause 138 inserts into the
Extradition Act 2003. I respectfully ask the Minister to explain why it
is so necessary to distinguish between the two types of
proportionality. Proportionality is a fundamental principle in EU law
and, in particular, under the Human Rights Act. I suggest there is
scope for confusion and therefore possible litigation if a judge
misdirects himself or herself in applying proportionality in one sense
and not in
another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:58:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:58:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, as my noble friend Lord
Faulks has just said, Clause 138 is dedicated to addressing this issue
and bringing the fundamental concept of proportionality into
extradition matters. Much of what my noble friend Lord Hodgson of
Astley Abbots proposes has already been included within the Extradition
Act 2003, as it will be amended by the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000088">It is
important to recognise that the judge will consider proportionality in
addition to the existing bars to extradition, such as the passage of
time and human rights considerations, including any impact on family
and private life. Consequently, new paragraphs (d) and (e)
as provided for in Amendment 78, which seek to merge these existing
considerations into the proportionality bar, are unnecessary and would
have little practical impact.</hs_para>

proposed new paragraphs (f) and (g), which relate to the cost of
proceedings in the UK and the duration and cost of proceedings in the
issuing state, I do not believe that those considerations are relevant.
The proportionality bar is designed to provide additional protection to
those whose extradition is sought. It is appropriate that the matters
concerned should relate to the alleged crime and the potential impact
on the person concerned. Of course, costs are an issue for us all, and
that is why the totality of our proposals is designed to improve the
workings of the Extradition Act, including reducing unnecessary delays.
However, costs to the UK arising from the extradition process should
not mean a denial of justice where it is right that a person is
extradited. On new paragraph (g), the costs and the duration
of proceedings in the issuing state are a matter for the issuing
state.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000090">New
paragraph (h) would require a consideration of the public interest.
That is implicit in any consideration of extradition by the courts,
which look at a range of factors alongside the proportionality bar.
Taken together, the statutory bars to extradition provide a broad
public interest test, so it is not necessary to include a separate test
here in the Bill.</hs_para>

new paragraph (i), which refers to other matters that the judge
believes relevant, is too open-ended and leaves too many issues that
could be considered. It could lead to duplication and potential delay
as a result of proportionality considerations overlapping with other
considerations. My noble friend Lord Faulks talked about the complexity
of these issues and the opportunity that he believed the provisions
give for judicial consideration, deliberation and challenges. I think
that the proposals in the amendment would complicate the matter
further. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:03:07"></hs_TimeCode> must
emphasise that the proportionality bar is one among a number which must
be considered already, not least whether extradition would be
compatible with the requested person’s human
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000092">Let
me assure my noble friend that, in addition to the provisions in Clause
138, we will also take a more pragmatic approach to our administrative
processes when an EAW is received. This will ensure that the most
trivial requests are identified and, where appropriate, dealt with
administratively before even getting to the courts. The aim will be to
work practically with other member states to identify alternative
solutions for trivial requests.</hs_para>

Faulks asked: why not merge proportionality and human rights? The
proportionality bar deals specifically with the proportionality of
extradition as a way to deal with the conduct alleged. Proportionality
is indeed a factor when considering interferences with various rights
under the ECHR, but it is considered when examining the specific rights
one at a time. Our bar adds to that, but deals with the wider issue of
human rights within the
EAW.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000094">I hope

Amendment 77, I shall also speak to Amendments 79, 80, 81 and 87. This
set of amendments keeps us in the area we have just been talking about:
one of the three specified matters. The amendments emphasise the
importance of less coercive, less disruptive measures than a full
European arrest warrant. Where a state issuing an EAW refuses to use
them, the judge could take that refusal into account before granting an

assumption underlying the provision relating to less coercive measures
is that the severely restrictive measure of extradition, involving
deprivation of liberty and the physical transport of a person away from
home and family, should be used only as a last resort. The issuing
state should therefore use that mechanism only when other, less
restrictive measures are unavailable. If other such measures are
available—for instance, because of the existence of mutual legal
assistance mechanisms or, once it is negotiated, the European
investigation order—extradition should be refused if they have
not been used<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:08:49"></hs_TimeCode>.
The reference to the possibility of using such alternative measures may
result in an issuing state avoiding their use due to a lack of
resources and/or bureaucratic difficulties in liaison between the
competent authorities of the issuing state and the judicial authority
that issued the
EAW.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000101">I argue
that, although the EAW system provides for extradition between judicial
authorities, the physical transfer of a person under an EAW is still a
process between two EU member states which are, as a whole, bound to
observe the principle of proportionality. All their authorities, such
as ministries of justice or the interior—where these are
responsible for mutual legal assistance requests—should,
therefore, be jointly expected to search for alternative solutions
before choosing the heavy-handed option of extradition. Accordingly, if
an alternative is available, under bilateral or multilateral
arrangements between member states, this should be used before the
EAW<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:09:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000102">Amendment
79 would ensure that, if there are alternative mechanisms available to
the issuing state, its failure to use them will always result in the
refusal 
<?notus-xml column=839?>of the EAW, irrespective of the gravity of the offence or any other
matter. The inclusion of the less coercive measures test appears to
rest on the assumption that the step of issuing an EAW—which
involves deprivation of liberty and serious human impact—should
be taken as a last resort. The responsibility is on the issuing state
to use less coercive measures if these are available. In the handbook
on how to issue an EAW, to which I referred, the section on
proportionality encourages the authority considering an EAW to use
alternatives, including mutual legal assistance, videoconferencing or a
summons. The logic that less restrictive alternatives should be used
before issuing an EAW applies regardless of the seriousness of the
allegation in question. The amendment therefore ensures that
extradition is always considered disproportionate if other measures are
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:11:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000103">The
case of Andrew Symeou demonstrates the need for it to be made clear
that alternatives should be used in preference to the EAW, irrespective
of the offence at issue. The Greek police and prosecution authorities
could have made use of mutual legal assistance; for instance by asking
UK authorities to obtain evidence from the witnesses who had allegedly
incriminated Andrew. These witnesses would have been able to explain
that they had been subject to police brutality and did not stand by
their earlier evidence, which had been taken under pressure and without
the assistance of an interpreter. Instead, the Greek authorities opted
to have an EAW issued, requiring Andrew’s extradition to Greece
to face trial for allegations which might have been found to be without
basis much earlier if MLA had been used. The English court should have
been able to refuse Andrew’s extradition on the ground that
alternative measures were

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, as my noble friend
explained, his amendments in this group seek to widen yet further the
proportionality bar to extradition in Part 1 cases. As I have already
indicated, Clause 138 will allow the UK courts to deal with the
long-standing issue of proportionality, which, as I have already said,
is a fundamental principle of EU

77, 79, 80 and 81 would require a judge to consider whether the
requesting state has less coercive measures available to it. If so, the
judge must bar extradition on proportionality grounds. However, even
where such measures may exist, they may not be appropriate in each
case, depending on the nature of the crime and other factors
such as relevant previous criminal history. It would not be right to
require a judge to bar extradition wherever less
coercive measures are available. I therefore prefer the existing
subsection (3)(c) of the new section inserted by Clause
138—to which my noble friend drew attention—which
addresses the issue more attractively than the choice of words proposed
in the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:14:27"></hs_TimeCode>. That
said, the existence of alternatives is clearly a relevant factor, and
that is why the clause specifies that this is one of the factors that
the judge must take into account when considering
proportionality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000106">Amendment
87 to Clause 140 is consequential on the amendments to Clause 138. It
would require a judge to conclude that less coercive measures were
available if a person had made a request for temporary 
<?notus-xml column=840?>transfer, as envisaged by Clause 140, but the
issuing state had refused that request unreasonably. This would mean
that the judge would have to bar extradition on proportionality
grounds. This would require our courts to make an assessment of the
rationale of a decision made by the authorities in another member
state. Given this, we do not think it appropriate
automatically to link a decision not to agree to a temporary
transfer with the consideration of proportionality. The EAW
framework decision is clear that temporary transfer must be agreed by
mutual consent, and it is therefore open to the issuing
state to refuse a request, including the UK where we are seeking
someone’s extradition to the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:16:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:17:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="131211116000350" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000350">7.15

the government Amendment 81A in this group. This seeks to build on the
proportionality bar operated by the courts by ensuring that robust,
pre-court, administrative procedures are also in place. Amendment 81A
amends Section 2 to stipulate that the National Crime Agency must not
issue a certificate if it is clear to the NCA that a judge would be
required to order the person’s discharge on the basis that
extradition would be disproportionate. To facilitate this, the
amendment will enable the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, with
the agreement of the Lord Justice General of Scotland and the Lord
Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, to issue guidance in relation to the
proportionality bar to the NCA, which it must apply in deciding whether
to issue a certificate under Section 2 of the Extradition Act 2003. The

somebody, on an EAW, without taking all the measures necessary to
ensure that the person’s life is interrupted as little as
possible? I am not convinced that my noble friend has the balance

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> My Lords, I now seek to move
Amendment 82 and will speak to Amendment 93. The background to these
amendments is the existence of two different types of European arrest
warrant: a prosecution warrant where a person is to be prosecuted for a
crime, and a conviction warrant where a person has been convicted and
has fled to another country, knowingly or unknowingly. As drafted, the
Bill provides for a proportionality check for prosecution warrants but
not for conviction warrants. Amendment 82 seeks to remedy this by
inserting the new clause
shown<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendment creates a proportionality check for EAWs to parallel the
existing human rights bar in Section 21 which will, under the Bill, be
relevant only to prosecution
EAWs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000111">Fair
Trials sees many cases where suspended prison sentences imposed in
respect of minor offences have been reactivated, several years after
the person left the category 1 territory, with an EAW then being issued
on that basis. This leads to the drastic measure of extradition being
used inappropriately in respect of minor offences. There is the case of
Natalia Gorczowska, who was convicted of possession of 4 grams of
amphetamines and given a 10-month suspended sentence. She left to begin
a new life; several years later, with no apparent reason for the delay,
the sentence was reactivated and, still later, an EAW was issued,
leading to significant expense and very nearly to a drastic impact upon
her young son’s life. The Committee might like to note that, had
the same conduct been the subject of a prosecution EAW, it would
probably have fallen to be considered as one of minor gravity and
unlikely to attract a lengthy prison sentence in application of the
specified matters relating to proportionality to be considered before
granting a prosecution EAW but not in the case of considering a
conviction warrant.</hs_para>

amendment to Section 21 allows a proportionality analysis, including a
broad range of factors tailored to conviction EAWs. Applying the
proposed test, the judge would be able to take into account the
person’s conduct and other circumstances when addressing
proportionality—for instance, whether the person deliberately
evaded onerous community obligations by leaving the country, or whether
the sentence was reactivated systematically, long after the person left
the country and without his or her
knowledge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000113">Amendment
93 provides discretion to refuse a conviction warrant where the subject
is a British national and will serve his or her sentence in a UK
prison. The proposed amendment would allow the judge at the extradition
hearing to refuse to surrender a person under a conviction EAW if that
person is a British resident or national, and if it is possible for
them to serve their sentence in the UK. It is worded in similar terms
to Section 3(1) of the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984, which also
provides for the issue of a warrant to authorise a person’s
detention to serve or complete in the UK a sentence imposed by a
foreign court.</hs_para>

have no discretion to refuse to extradite a British national or
resident to serve a sentence in another country on the basis that it is
more appropriate that he or she serves that sentence in the UK. This
issue has been highlighted in a number of Fair Trials cases.
Individuals have been extradited from the UK following conviction in
another jurisdiction yet, following surrender, have been transferred
back to the United Kingdom after the lengthy and bureaucratic prisoner
transfer process. This is a waste of time and money. UK courts should
be given the option of refusing extradition and allowing the defendant
to stay in the UK to serve the sentence. Other member states including
Belgium, Denmark, Italy and Poland have included this ground for
refusal in their implementing legislation.</hs_para>

reference to UK nationals in the Home Secretary’s announcement
suggests that this reluctance may be because the Government wish the
policy to benefit only UK nationals and not non-national residents. It
follows clearly from the case law of the Court of Justice that, if the
UK implemented paragraph 6 of Article 4 of the EAW framework decision,
which applies to both nationals and those staying in or resident of the
executing member state, it would not be able to reserve the benefit of
this provision to UK nationals only. The drafting in the Bill appears
to be a way of avoiding that constraint. However, the policy
discriminates in favour of UK nationals and could be the subject of

Amendment 82 seeks to introduce a proportionality bar for
post-conviction cases. As my noble friend Lord Taylor has said, Clause
138 will allow the UK courts to deal with the long-standing issue of
proportionality, which is of course a fundamental principle of EU law
in cases where a person is sought for prosecution. Under the EAW
framework decision, an EAW can be issued in a post-conviction case only
if a sentence of at least four months has been imposed. We believe that
this is a sufficient proportionality safeguard in such cases.</hs_para>

reassure my noble friend that the courts will still consider any
representations made that the extradition would breach a
person’s human rights—I believe that he mentioned this in

safeguards available for British citizens wanted for extradition. In
that Statement, the Home Secretary set out our commitment to make
greater use of EU prisoner transfer arrangements. Where a UK national
has been convicted and sentenced abroad, for example in their absence,
and is now the subject of a European arrest warrant we will ask for

in moving Amendment 83, I shall speak also to
Amendments 84 to 86. With these amendments I am seeking to
address some of the weaknesses of the temporary transfer system.

temporary. Amendment 83 would insert in proposed new

make a temporary transfer conditional on the issuing state providing
assurance that the person will be returned within the time allotted for
the transfer. The purpose of the temporary transfer system is to enable
the issuing state to complete certain steps in the criminal case which
we referred to earlier, such as charging the person, and to allow the
person to return home, without seeking their extradition. However, in
the Bill as drafted, there is no system for ensuring the return of the
person<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:33:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="131211116000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000132">The
concern is that a person brought before a judge or court in the issuing
state in the course of a temporary transfer could rapidly find
themselves processed in accordance with the usual course of procedure
and detained pending trial. I believe that it is therefore necessary to
enable the judge to obtain specific assurances that the person will be
returned within a fixed period by the judge. The amendment allows the
judge to refuse to grant a temporary transfer in the absence of such
assurances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:33:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000133">Amendments
85 and 86 permit the temporary transfer system to be used more than
once. The Bill allows for the temporary transfer scheme to be used once
only. I entirely accept that there is a need to ensure that the
temporary transfer process is not used repeatedly to delay extradition,
but I believe the current restriction to one use may be too blunt. If a
new point comes to light later in the proceedings suggesting that
further progress could be made by the requested person attending again,
then, provided it is not an abuse of the system, the procedure should
be available again. It must also be unfair to prevent a requested
person using a temporary transfer just because they have previously
agreed to a request, perhaps by the requesting state. There is an issue
here of equality of arms. I beg to

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, the provisions in Clause 140
will allow a person to speak with the authorities in the issuing state
before any extradition takes place. The clause allows for the
person’s temporary transfer to the issuing state and for the
authorities in that state to speak with the person while he or she
remains in the UK, for example, via videoconferencing. I understand my
noble friend’s concerns that there should be safeguards, but I
believe that there are sufficient safeguards already in
place.</hs_para>

parties must consent to a temporary transfer—a temporary
transfer is only possible where the person concerned agrees to

the person would be returned to the UK. If the person was not returned,
the issuing state would, of course, be in breach of that agreement and
the clear terms of the European arrest warrant framework decision.

this particular case the Government are not persuaded that there are
sufficiently compelling arguments for making such a change. Allowing
more than one request could be used to delay the extradition process to
no good end. We would expect the cases to which my noble

individual would still be able to approach the requesting authorities
via their legal representatives to provide further information to
consider in that case.</hs_para>

am convinced about Amendments 83 and 84, but I cannot see how the
ability to get a second temporary transfer is going to cost the
Government anything. In fact, it would greatly improve the efficacy in
the administration of justice. If I were an EAW subject, I would be
very disappointed that because the requesting state had used the
temporary transfer system up for its own purposes, I was not then able
to use it for myself. It is a shame that we do not have even a measure
of equality of arms, always providing for the fact that this should not
be allowed to detain and block up the process.

remove the requirement for leave to appeal. We have spoken about how
extradition has an enormous impact on suspects’ lives and those
of their families. Given the problems that, for example, Fair Trials
regularly sees arising at first-instance extradition hearings, there
are concerns about any measure that limits access to appeal courts. The
vast majority of those subject to extradition
procedures—the “little platoons” that I referred
to in my first group of amendments —cannot afford a lawyer and
are therefore represented by a duty solicitor. Many duty solicitors
have little experience of extradition cases and therefore may not be
familiar with the complex conditions of the 2003 Act and associated
case law. This can be contrasted with the position of the
requesting state, which is automatically entitled to representation by
a specialist unit of Crown Prosecution Service lawyers. The complexity
of extradition cases also means that there is often
inadequate time at a first-instance hearing for
consideration of all the relevant facts and issues. If suspects lose
their automatic right to appeal then, so long as these problems at
first instance remain, there may be cases that result in people being
wrongly extradited.</hs_para>

demonstrated by the recent case of Krzysztof Juszczak, who in February
2013 appealed successfully against extradition to Poland on the basis
that his removal from the UK would constitute a disproportionate
interference with his family life under Article 8 of the ECHR. Although
Mr Juszczak is the primary carer for his severely disabled
stepdaughter, this was not raised by the duty solicitor before the
district judge, an omission that was criticised as a failure of duty by
Mr Justice Collins in his appeal judgment. As this evidence was
obtained late in the process, there is a clear danger that under the
proposed system Mr Juszczak would have been denied leave to
appeal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000144">I

appeal. The inclusion of any higher standard of proof would be
inappropriate, not least because the requirement to demonstrate an
arguable case, as is the case in the judicial review process, would
suffice to weed out those cases with no merit. Leave should be sought
on paper, with written reasons provided for the outcome. Defendants
must then have a right of appeal against refusal to a judge at an oral
hearing. Only the judge at first instance or the High Court judge who
would hear the appeal should consider applications for leave to appeal.

satisfy the above recommendations of the Sir Scott Baker review, and
people could still have their lives ruined by an unjust extradition. As
this concern remains unanswered in the Bill as currently drafted, the
argument regarding appeal remains flawed and liable to create
unfairness and inequality of arms. It has also been
pointed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:43:27"></hs_TimeCode> out that
the Government’s proposed amendments did not affect the
requesting state’s automatic right to appeal if an extradition
request is refused, thus introducing a further inequality of arms into
proceedings that are already heavily weighted in favour of requesting
states, which have far greater resources than individuals and benefit
from a strict “no questions asked” regime that gives
courts very little power to refuse extradition.</hs_para>

flexibility in relation to appeal deadlines, but I remain concerned
that the current drafting may be insufficient to address potential
injustices, particularly when linked to the proposed removal of the
automatic right to appeal. Given the impact of extradition on
individuals, a standard period of seven days to appeal or seek leave is
pretty short. This is often exacerbated by the need to obtain evidence
from other jurisdictions and can raise enormous challenges when a

already discussed the introduction of the leave-to-appeal requirement
of the person to comply with the appeal deadline, but it should also be
taken into account if the leave requirement is to be introduced. If the
proposal set out in paragraph 10.14 of the Baker review is followed,
with leave to appeal being sought and granted or refused on paper, the
drafting needed to produce the leave application could become more
onerous, complex and time-consuming than for the current notice. It is
therefore proposed that the timeframe flexibility introduced in the
amendments to Sections 26(5), 103(10) and 108(5), as amended in
accordance with paragraph 4.1 above, be retained but that the permitted
period in Section 26(4) should also be extended to 14 days.

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, I will be brief with what has been
described as my blunt instrument on Clause 141. I will not
repeat the detailed arguments put by the noble Lord, Lord
Hodgson of Astley Abbots. As he said, Amendments 88 and 90 seek to
preserve the automatic right to appeal against an extradition order by
deleting provisions in the clause that would make the ability to 
<?notus-xml column=850?>appeal against an order subject to obtaining the permission of the High
Court. Essentially, it appears that the Government
are now proposing to remove a key safeguard for individuals at risk of
extradition by repealing the automatic right of appeal. We have real
concerns about this change, which of course removes safeguards for UK
citizens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:47:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000151">The
automatic right of appeal is a key safeguard against the wrongful
extradition of individuals, which allows them to raise new evidence
that was not available at the time of the extradition hearing or to
challenge the decision of the original judgment. It was surely this
automatic right of appeal that allowed Gary McKinnon and his family to
challenge the initial decision to extradite him to the US, leading
ultimately to the decision not to extradite him at all. Without the
right of appeal, he might have been extradited without any further
consideration of the evidence, old or new, showing that extradition
posed a serious risk to his right to life. Indeed, in the Statement
that the Home Secretary made on 16 October 2012, she specifically
referred to this issue when she
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="131211116000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000276">“After
careful consideration of all of the relevant material, I have concluded
that Mr McKinnon’s extradition would give rise to such a high
risk of him ending his life that a decision to extradite would be
incompatible with Mr McKinnon’s human

subject to what the Minister may say, the Government appear to be
introducing changes to the Act that would mean that if a similar case
occurred after this Bill had been passed, the Home Secretary would not
be able to make the same
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:48:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="131211116000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000152">Clause
141 amends Sections 26 and 108 of the 2003 Act to provide that an
appeal will lie only with permission from the High Court, and no
indication is given in the Bill of what criteria will be used to decide
whether permission should be granted. I hope that the Minister will be
able to indicate the reason for the Bill being so vague over an
issue—namely, the criteria—that could have significant
human rights consequences. What in fact do the Government expect the
criteria to be, do they expect them to be evidence-based and will they
be available for scrutiny? What impact do the Government believe any
likely criteria will have on the number of cases able to be
appealed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:49:24"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000153">Once
an individual has been extradited, of course, there is virtually
nothing that can be done if new evidence arises to show that that was
not the appropriate or fair decision and was contrary to the interests
of justice or their human rights. Does the Minister not agree that,
because of that, it is crucial that people effectively have an
automatic right to appeal against a decision to be extradited, or at
least some other means of ensuring that justice is done, and that we do
not end up in a situation which, frankly, does our own extradition
system no
credit?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000154">I
cannot vouch for this personally, but Liberty says that extradition
experts are of the view that a large number of cases that have been
successful on appeal probably would not have been granted leave under
the Bill. Removing the right of automatic appeal will potentially have
considerable human rights and legal implications. If the Minister
cannot offer some movement on this issue when he replies tonight, I
hope that he  
<?notus-xml column=851?>will at least be able to explain why the Government
appear to be taking such a major backwards step,

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, as my noble friend has
explained, Clause 141 makes the right of appeal against a decision to
order extradition subject to the leave of the High Court. Similarly, it
makes the requesting state’s right of appeal against a decision
to discharge a person from extradition proceedings subject to the leave
of the High Court.
Clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T19:51:31"></hs_TimeCode> 141 also
allows the requested person to make an application for leave to appeal
out of time in certain circumstances. This does not apply to the
requesting
state.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000156">The
noble Lord, Lord Rosser, using his blunt instrument, gives me the
opportunity to broaden the debate beyond the immediate amendments and
explain how this process will work and why the Government feel
justified in introducing Clause 141. My noble friend Lord Hodgson, in
tabling his Amendments 88 and 90, challenges us on why we are making
these changes. At present, a person has an automatic right of appeal
against a decision to order his or her extradition, and the requesting
state also has an automatic right of appeal against a decision not to
order extradition—an important factor to bear in mind.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131211116000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000157">As noble Lords are
aware, the Government commissioned a review by Sir Scott Baker of the
UK’s extradition arrangements. One of the key findings of his
review was that the success rate of appeals was extremely low: less
than 13% in 2010. In other words, the court system is burdened by
unmeritorious appeals, a fact to which my noble friend Lord Hodgson
referred, which then delay hearings for all appellants and means that
justice is deferred. Clause 141 addresses this problem by making
appeals subject to permission from the High Court. This filter applies
to appeals against, for example, a judge’s decision to order
extradition to a Part 1 territory, that is, another member state; a
judge’s decision to send a case to the Secretary of State to
consider extradition in Part 2 cases, that is, where the requesting
country is not an EU member state; and to a decision by the Secretary
of State to order extradition in Part 2 cases. To provide parity, it
also applies to appeals against decisions to discharge a
person.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131211116000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000158">My
noble friend Lord Hodgson asked what sort of issues a court would
consider in deciding whether to allow an application to be heard. This
will be, as one would expect, a matter for the judge concerned. They
will, of course, give full consideration to all the relevant factors
raised by the appellant before reaching a decision. We do not think
that they are appropriate to be set out in legislation, as it is a
matter for the court itself to consider. I understand that
noble Lords will have questions about what safeguards will be
available. Let me reassure noble Lords that this provision does not
prevent anyone from applying for permission to appeal. Once an
application has been made, the High Court will decide which cases
proceed to a hearing, but each application will be considered by a High
Court judge. Furthermore, Clause 141 sets out that the High Court must
not refuse to entertain an application for leave to appeal by the
requested person solely because it has  
<?notus-xml column=852?>been submitted outside the normal time period, if
the person did everything reasonably possible to ensure that the notice
was given as soon as it could be.</hs_para>

to the matters that my noble friend Lord Hodgson raised in relation to
this in his Amendments 88A, 89, 91 and 92. My noble friend proposes to
amend Clause 141 to insert a requirement for the courts to allow an
appeal to be made out of time if it is in the interests of justice to
do so. As I said, Clause 141 allows the High Court to hear an
out-of-time appeal where the person has done everything reasonably
possible to bring the appeal as soon as possible. Our approach follows
that of the Supreme Court, which ruled last year that out-of-time
appeals should only be considered exceptionally. We believe that this
provision gets the balance right: the timetable for an appeal is clear
and there must be an onus on an appellant to meet the statutory
requirements, as happens in the vast majority of
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000160">My
noble friend is also proposing to extend the time limit for appeals in
Part 1 cases from seven days to 14 days. As he has explained, this was
one of the recommendations that Sir Scott Baker made in his review of
our extradition arrangements. We have therefore considered it very
carefully in developing the provisions in the Bill. Our view is that
extending the time limit in this way would have no practical effect
beyond increasing the likelihood for delay. As I said, we have
introduced new protections where people are unable to submit their
appeals on time through no fault of their own. We believe that this new
provision will address the concerns raised by my noble friend, and
indeed by Sir Scott Baker, on this
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000161">What
safeguards will exist under these new provisions? We do not believe
that we are removing any existing safeguards. We need to get the
balance right between ensuring proper protection for those subject to
an extradition request while ensuring that people do not delay their
proper surrender by burdening the courts with unmeritorious appeals. We
believe that this approach gets these matters right. The court itself
will decide the issues and the relevance of any out-of-time
considerations.</hs_para>

Clause 141 will allow the courts to focus their attention on the right
appeals, removing the burden of unmeritorious appeals while ensuring
that proper safeguards are in place for those subject to extradition. I
commend the clause to the Committee and I hope that my noble friend
will be prepared to withdraw his amendment, and that the noble Lord,
Lord Rosser, will see the merit in the

are taking to introduce prohibitions on and difficulties in getting an
appeal process going in the first place. Obviously, however, this is

is concerned with mistaken identity, and Amendment 95 would insert two
new clauses into the Bill. Amendment 94 would enable the judge at the
extradition hearing—whether it is a prosecution or a conviction
warrant—to request more information where there is a real doubt
as to whether the person sought is actually the person suspected or
convicted. This would be particularly valuable in cases where there is
a reasonable belief that the person sought has had his or her identity

courts have, however, given very short shrift to arguments alleging
that extradition would lead to a violation of human rights. In
accordance with the concept of mutual trust, on which the operation of
the EAW is based, the courts assume that the issuing state will protect
the extradited person against any unfairness and that past proceedings
giving rise to convictions on which EAWs are based were fair. A person
must show that they are at risk of a “flagrant” breach of
their fair trial rights in order to resist extradition. The approach is
difficult to sustain when there are ongoing systematic deficiencies in
a justice system, which are liable to impact upon an extradited person.
For instance, the European Court of Human Rights recently found Italy
in violation of Article 3 of the ECHR and applied its pilot judgment
procedure, recognising that widespread overcrowding was leading to
systematic infringements of Article 3. The concept of mutual trust is
difficult to defend in such circumstances. If an extradited person is
going to be detained in the same prison, it is plainly likely that
their human rights will be
infringed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T20:05:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211116000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000170">The

affirm that the latter shall not have the effect of modifying the
obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal
principles, as recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union
and reflected 
<?notus-xml column=855?>in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, the precise

extradited; the wider issues relating to identity were carefully
considered during the review of the UK’s extradition
arrangements. Sir Scott Baker did not find any evidence that a person
who was subjected to mistaken identity had actually been
surrendered to stand trial. He concluded that there was no need to
amend the Act to require a judge to request further information
concerning the requesting person’s identity. Nor did the

authorities admitted their error in making the request for him rather

Court had to consider a case where an individual was being sought to be
extradited to Albania. The court was told that there was a high degree
of corruption among the judges and the extradition was stayed so that
the degree of corruption could be investigated further. The matter is
now in the hands of the Lord Advocate in Scotland. That is an example
of the kind of phenomenon to which the noble Lord referred—where
the standards in one of the new countries are not up to the standards
that one might expect. However, I suggest that the courts are very
astute in ensuring that the human rights protection in relation to a
fair trial is preserved. That is a very recent example which I think

framework decision. Finally, Amendment 99 implements one of
the recommendations in the 12th report of the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee. That committee recommended that the
order-making power in new Section 189E of the Extradition Act 2003
should be subject to the affirmative procedure. New Section 189E
enables the Home Secretary to specify descriptions of persons, other
than constables, who may exercise powers of detention, search and
seizure in respect of people who are in transit through the UK and
being extradited from one foreign territory to another. Such a power
might be used, for example, to designate immigration officers. The
Government are content to accept the committee’s recommendation
in this regard. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="131211116000489" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#131211116000489">Amendment

themselves the victims of a crime. That situation cannot possibly have

Government are determined to provide the best support for victims of
crime, which must be properly funded, but increasingly by offenders
rather than taxpayers. In 2010-11, offenders contributed less than
£1 in every £6 of funding that supports victims’
services. We intend to raise up to an additional £50
million from offenders to pay for services to support victims of crime.
That is why we brought forward reforms to the victim
surcharge last year, following public consultation, to ensure that all
offenders bear a greater proportion of the cost of victims’
services. Proceeds from the surcharge are ring-fenced to fund support
services for victims and witnesses. From October 2012, the victim
surcharge for adult offenders was increased when ordered with a fine
and extended to a wider range of in-court disposals such as conditional
discharges, community sentences and custodial sentences. Similar
provision was made for juvenile offenders who even before the changes
made in 2012 were required to pay the surcharge when sentenced to a
fine<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T20:26:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

victim surcharge is that all offenders, including juveniles, take
responsibility for their offending behaviour and make a contribution
towards funding victims’ services. Juveniles have therefore
always been within its scope and I do not believe that it would be
right to introduce discretion to exempt them. Having said that, I
recognise the concerns of the noble Lord about the practicalities. When
the offender is a juvenile, Section 137 of the Power of Criminal Courts
(Sentencing) Act 2000 provides that the parent or guardian might become
liable to pay a financial order made by the court. There may,
therefore, be circumstances where the parent or guardian of a juvenile
becomes liable to pay the victim surcharge when they have been the
victim of the offence. We recognise the issue that such cases
raise.</hs_para>

me reassure the noble Lord that the court does have the discretion not
to order the parent or guardian to pay the surcharge if, having regard
to the circumstances of the case, it considers that it would be
unreasonable to do so. While the court would still need to order the
surcharge in respect of the juvenile, there are a number of options
open to it when it comes to payment. In this vein, the Justices’
Clerks’ Society issued a circular to its members in June this
year outlining some of these approaches. These could include inquiring
as to any income the offender may be receiving, particularly if they
are older juveniles, in which case responsibility for paying the
surcharge would fall directly to the young person. Additionally, in
exceptional circumstances, the court has the power to defer payment of
the surcharge until such time as it considers the offender 
<?notus-xml column=862?>would be able to pay it, again making responsibility
for paying the surcharge the offender’s rather than that of his
or her parents.</hs_para>

right that all offenders, including those aged under 18, should take
responsibility and make greater reparation towards the cost of
victim support services as a result of their actions. It is
therefore appropriate that the surcharge should continue to be ordered
when a court deals with an individual, whether as an adult or a
juvenile. I hope that I have been able to reassure the noble Lord on
the points he raised and that he will be content to withdraw his

Second Reading I described the Bill as not so much a curate’s
egg as a curate’s omelette, comprising as it does so many
ingredients, both good and bad, mixed up together. It is perhaps
fitting that the Committee should end with a debate on a clause which
impels me to produce another culinary analogy, for this clause and the
process which has informed it can best be described as
half-baked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#1312122000002">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T20:30:25"></hs_TimeCode>

such as those in the commercial court which the Government are anxious

saga does not end there—perhaps I should say does not start
there—for the Government launched yet another
consultation last April, this time on fee remissions for courts and
tribunals, with a four-week period for responses, and published their
response, conveniently, no doubt, for them on 9 September, when
Parliament was in recess. Interestingly, that document introduced a
disposable capital test and airily dismissed concerns that this might
have a deterrent effect on
claimants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T20:32:50"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is, incidentally, currently concern about an apparently significant
drop in employment tribunal claims following the hotly contested
introduction of fees, which were widely regarded as too high. Perhaps
the Minister would save me the trouble of tabling a question by
agreeing to write to me in the new year with details of the number of
claims before and after the imposition of charges. It is, after all, an
analogous situation to that which this clause deals
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#1312122000007">The

60 of the consultation proposes to combine the fees for issue and

higher track cases are higher than the average cost of such, but it
does not propose to adjust them, thereby importing the concept of more
than full-cost recovery by the back door. In divorce cases, while the
Government say, at paragraph 71, that they will maintain the
issue fee at £410, already above the actual cost price of
£270, they will impose an extra charge of £300 to cover
the cost of the 
<?notus-xml column=864?>remainder of the proceedings. Given that, in many cases these will be a

improvement. But will the Government consider the amendments I have

prime consideration before setting the size of the fee increases, and

with the two government amendments in the group, namely, Amendments 95B
and 95C. These give effect to the recommendation 
<?notus-xml column=865?>made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee relating to
the power to charge enhanced court fees. Clause 155 currently provides
that, when the power to set a fee or fees at an enhanced level is used
for the first time, the relevant statutory instrument should be subject
to the affirmative resolution procedure, with any subsequent changes to
the fee or fees being subject to the negative procedure. The
Government’s intention was that the principle of charging an
enhanced fee should be subject to a full debate in Parliament, after
which the negative procedure would provide the necessary level of
parliamentary oversight for any subsequent changes to the
fee.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312122000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#1312122000016">However,
the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee was
concerned that this would provide the Lord Chancellor with a very wide
discretion to set the level of fees. Although the legislation requires
the Lord Chancellor to have regard to the financial position
of the courts and tribunals and to the competitiveness of
the legal services market when setting fees, the committee felt it was
possible that, in future, very different considerations might apply and
that these should be taken into account. The committee therefore
recommended that the power to set an enhanced fee should be subject to
the affirmative procedure unless the amendment is being made solely to
reflect the change in the value of money. The Government agree that
this change would be appropriate and, accordingly, Amendments 95B and
95C will implement this recommendation.</hs_para>

amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham. Amendments 95AA
and 95AB seek to require the Lord Chancellor to have regard to the
principle of “access to justice” when setting fees. I can
wholeheartedly agree with the noble Lord that this is an important
consideration. However, the Lord Chancellor is already under a duty to
do exactly this when setting fees under Section 92 of the Courts Act
2003. Subsection (3) of that section provides that the Lord
Chancellor,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1312122000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#1312122000149">“must

make the remission scheme subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure. As noble Lords will be aware, there is already a remission
scheme in place. Indeed, the scheme has been in place for a number of
years, but was updated and revised as recently as 7 October 2013 when
the Courts and Tribunals Fee Remissions Order 2013 came into
force. It is the Government’s intention that the existing
remission scheme will continue to apply in all cases where enhanced
fees would be
introduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0002.htm#1312122000019">The
current scheme provides for certain court and tribunal fees to be
remitted in whole or in part where litigants meet certain criteria
based on their disposable capital and gross monthly income. The
existing scheme is made under the same order-making powers as apply to
the setting of fees, for example, Section 92 of the Courts Act 2003,
which relates to fees payable in respect of proceedings in
the senior courts, county courts and magistrates’ courts. As the
remission scheme relies on the same order-making powers as the
statutory instruments prescribing court and tribunal fees, they are
subject to the same level of parliamentary procedure—namely, the
negative procedure. In its seventh 
<?notus-xml column=866?>report of Session 2002-03, the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee welcomed a government amendment to make the
order-making power in what is now Section 92 of the Courts Act 2003
subject to the negative procedure. Given that previous endorsement by
the committee, and the fact that the current arrangements have been in
place for some years, I see no good reason why we should now alter the
level of parliamentary scrutiny.</hs_para>

would require the Lord Chancellor to report to Parliament on the
outcome of the public consultation on these proposals and to
obtain approval for its response. As the noble Lord indicated, the
Government on 3 December set out their detailed proposals for using the
power to set enhanced fees in the consultation paper, <I>Court
Fees:</I> <I>Proposals for r</I><I>eform</I>. This seeks views on a
series of proposals for charging enhanced fees, including for money
claims, in commercial proceedings and for divorce, alongside proposals
for reducing the current deficit of £100 million in the cost of
running the Courts and Tribunals Service. The consultation
closes on 21 January. In the normal way, we will publish a
response to that consultation in due course and Parliament will have an
opportunity to consider it when we lay a draft order under
Clause 155. I therefore take Amendment 95D as a probing
amendment rather than an attempt to enshrine in statute the normal
process of reporting on the outcome of a consultation.</hs_para>

Carlile of Berriew (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, in speaking to the two
Motions standing in my name on the Order Paper, I should start by
saying that I do so with sadness and regret. The fact that we are
having this debate on annulment Motions at all is a symptom of the
breakdown in trust between barristers in criminal practice and the Lord
Chancellor’s Department. I have 
<?notus-xml column=870?>been at the Bar for 43 years now, with 42 years in practice. Over that
period there have been pinch points, there have been negotiations about
costs, but they have always been resolved by constructive engagement.
We are now in a situation in which, for the first time in my time at
the Bar, barristers are intent on withdrawing their labour, and they
are at loggerheads with a Government who a great many of them have
supported over the years. That is a sad state of
affairs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T20:53:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000029">I
declare my interest at the outset. I am a barrister who has conducted
several very high cost cases, the category on which I will focus. I was
but am no longer involved in a still current case which is not affected
by the changes. I am very grateful to my noble friend the Minister for
meeting me, with two officials present, on 26 November. I thought the
meeting was useful and possibly constructive for the future. I hope he
shares that

are VHCCs? They are called “very high cost cases” but
that is somewhat pejorative. In truth, the letters could also stand for
“very high complexity cases”. They are few in
number and among the most complex cases that come before any court,
criminal or civil, in terms of the law that is involved and the facts
that they engage. All, by definition, have to be expected to last more
than 60 court days—they are massive cases. Substantial prison
sentences may ensue for the people convicted, and usually those
convicted in this class of case are not career criminals but people of
previous good character.</hs_para>

I am aware involves nine parties, including the prosecution; 20

those lawyers are doing, trying to read between 5 million and 8 million
pages for the defence. Are they just making work for
themselves?”. No, not at all. “Disclosed” in this
context means that the documents have been described by the prosecution
as either materially undermining the prosecution case or materially
assisting the defence case; there is a clear obligation on the defence
to examine those documents as best as it
can.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000032">These
cases are every bit as complex as some of the legendary civil cases
involving Russian oligarchs and the like about which we read, and the
huge commercial disputes that some of the distinguished noble and
learned Lords now sitting in the Chamber were involved in in practice

most difficult civil cases. There is an added element. All these cases
are heard by juries; so the hugely complex material has to be

defendants are wealthy and would like to pay for their own defences,
but they are not allowed to by the state. For the most part they cannot
use their assets to pay for their defences because they have
been seized by the state. They are the unwilling people who have been
thrown on to legal aid and basically obliged to take it or defend
themselves. We have had arguments in this House in the past about
whether these assets should be unfrozen under careful
scrutiny and management to allow them to be used to pay for their
defences, but for a completely strange reason the Government are 
<?notus-xml column=871?>not prepared to allow this to happen. I suggest to your Lordships that
that is a stubborn, unreasonable and unrealistic
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000034">As I
have said, these defendants are thrown unwillingly on to legal aid
representation, like it or not, and the public pay. Theoretically, if
they are convicted some of the costs can be recovered, but I would like
to hear from my noble friend what proportion of the defence costs have
been recovered in these cases. Defence costs are notoriously difficult
to recover. There are a legion of anecdotes, mostly true, about how the
families of those convicted can sit quietly on the assets that have
been frozen and live, for example, in expensive family homes for years.
Recovery is very
unsuccessful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000035">There
seems to be an implication that the Bar is being greedy, setting fees
that are totally unrealistic, but I remind your Lordships and

and negotiation, which is a process founded on reason.</hs_para>

VHCCs have developed a substantial bureaucracy which is extremely
frustrating to those of us who have had to conduct them. They involve
case managers who are civil servants. I have occasionally suggested to
these case managers that they are “valued members of the defence
team”, a phrase that I have repeated on a few occasions in
messages to them. Even that flattery has failed to secure a single
attendance by a case manager at a conference in the case, or a single
attendance at court when there was a critical incident occurring in a
preparatory hearing or the trial. This is mere bureaucracy, which adds
totally unnecessarily to the cost of these cases, the fees for which
could be assessed by the very people who are sitting in the
court—as used to be the case—the associates or court
clerks, who saw what was going on and were able to see how much work

founded on payment per hour for preparation and per minute for

of the work on the old fees is unpaid. If we say that 30 seconds per

difficult financial documents—and that does happen,
commonly—much work is unpaid. In some cases, there is
a vast proportion of unpaid work because of the massive detail that

all future cases. Here, they have cut the fees in mid-case.
People who have been committed to cases have seen a savage reduction in

Last year 59% of VHCC fees were paid at category 3, which pays
£91 per hour for a QC and £61 for a led junior. In crude
terms, that sounds like quite a reasonable amount of money, but let us
not forget that every barrister has a chambers, staff, office costs and
VAT; as self-employed individuals, they have no pension provision
unless they pay for it, they have no sick pay and they do
not get paid when they are on holiday. The reality of those hourly

VHCC with five defendants, the advocates of three of them exercised
their contractual

barristers’ chambers and 330 barristers with suitable

Deech (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I speak in support of the noble
Lord, Lord Carlile. The extent of the concern about this is evident in
the noble and learned Lords and noble and legally aware Lords who are
gathered here tonight. In fact, the cuts to legal aid and the way in
which they are being implemented are set to take their place in the
great pantheon of government failures, which were foreseen but went
ahead anyway. The list includes home improvement packs, ID cards, the
Millennium Dome, child support and so on. I predict with confidence
that, in a few years’ time, people will look back at
the legal aid cuts and add them to that list. They amount to the
suffocation of the criminal Bar and the weakening of the quality of the
judiciary who would have been expected to emerge from
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000047">I have an

They will damage the administration of justice, the rule of law and
equality and diversity at the Bar. There will be too few advocates

dropping them now, mid-case, and will refuse new instructions at
those rates. We are talking about contracts entered into
before 2 December where the case will be heard after
31 March, so advocates are being forced by the statutory

will end up spending more because of the cost of getting another

Justice is breaching contracts retrospectively and placing future VHCC

regulator, I say right now that the retrospection of the statutory
instrument is the most offending feature. If the Government simply
changed the date of effect, so that only new instructions offered in

would be mitigated. Will the Minister tell the House why that should
not be the case? Retrospectivity is contrary to the law of contract and
the rule of law. For example, when income tax rates are cut, the
Government do not expect the payer to take advantage of the new rates
before the starting date. In fact, such cuts are normally given a
starting date well in advance, to allow parties to plan their affairs
accordingly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000050">The

long way, in Europe. Some 14% of the world’s largest law firms
are headquartered in London. The Government should not trumpet the
excellence of the UK—as indeed it is—as a global legal
centre whose success and desirability depends on the utter reliability
of adherence to the rule of law and the quality of its lawyers, and

in recent years have gone to such young people. That cannot now be
maintained. Young people cannot be expected to go into criminal or
family law at those rates when they have higher than ever
university debts behind them and, of course, the cost of qualifying as
a barrister. In the past, they were happy to take that on

example, cuts have been made in welfare so that it pays to work;
unpopular charges for spare bedrooms have been applied to try to
rationalise housing allocation. One may not agree with it,
but there is a policy. In legal aid, there is no policy in
cutting, save a crude cut. It is not alleged that these cuts will make
the courts run better, free more funds for them, make professionals
more efficient or increase consumer access. There is no rationale at

has painted a vivid picture of the sort of cases that we are involved
in. It is vital for this country’s justice system that those
most difficult and demanding cases are properly tried. If they are not
properly tried the whole of our criminal justice system will be under a
dark shadow, which this Government will have created without
proper consideration of the information available, to the extent to
which consultation has taken place. I say that having been in practice

not only for recruits but for the help it gives to the judiciary to do
justice. You do not save money just by fiddling with fees. If there is
the need to create savings that the Government say there is, they
should have taken action before to ensure that judges have the benefit
of barristers who are paid not by the hour or by the day, but on a more

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T21:30:13"></hs_TimeCode> criminal Bar
has been the poor relation of the various specialist Bars. Over the
past decade it has already suffered a series of cuts in public funding.
Of course it does not earn for the Exchequer the riches that, for
example, the commercial Bar earns when acting, very often on both sides
of the litigation, in commercial disputes. However, I argue that the
work undertaken by the criminal Bar is altogether more important than
most commercial work. Most commercial cases result ultimately just in
the adjustment of companies’ balance sheets and book entries;
they rarely affect the quality of people’s
lives. The outcome 
<?notus-xml column=878?>of criminal cases, by contrast, is generally critical to real people;
usually their very liberty is at stake. More than this, the strength of
the rule of law, and indeed public respect for it, depends above all
else on the proper administration of the criminal justice
system.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312122000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000068">Very

elite of the criminal Bar. There already exist few financial

that elite will fall away.</hs_para>

Hope of Craighead (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, along with others, I am
extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, for tabling these
Motions so that we can debate these important measures. I should make
it clear that I have never practised at the English Bar and never sat
in an English court. My experience has been of practice, both civil and
criminal, north of the border. However, although I have never sat in an
English court, I have sat in a United Kingdom court, have had some
experience of dealing with criminal cases and think that I can speak
with some authority in support of the points which have been made so
effectively by the noble and learned Lords, Lord Woolf and Lord Brown
of

previously set by the Government surely must be regarded in the present
financial climate as severe. I appreciate, of course, that the Minister
and those for whom he speaks in this House have very little room for
manoeuvre, given the cuts that already have to be made across the
entire department. However, it would help if the Minister in his reply
were able to put these two measures into their overall context. As I
understand it, we are dealing here with cases that take a very long
time and provide the advocate with the benefit of continuity of
employment throughout a long period. As has been pointed out, these are
complex cases which require unusual amounts of work outside the court
room and are, in comparison with rates elsewhere in the system, better
paid. I could therefore perhaps understand it if the strategy behind
these measures was to reduce the cost of legal aid at this level, so as
to keep any reduction at the lower levels, with which we are not
concerned this evening, to an absolute minimum—or even to
preserve the existing position at the lower levels. After all, it is at
the bottom of the scale that there is real hardship. One hears not
infrequently that the costs of travel and other overheads exceed the
amounts payable as fees to the advocate. If there is any margin over
that, it is often very small. I would be grateful if the Minster would
say whether this is what the Government have in mind, and give us an
assurance that there is no question of cuts of this dimension being
made elsewhere across the system. That would be some reassurance to
those who are deeply concerned about what the Government have in mind
in the overall planning.</hs_para>

to the amendment set out in regulation 3(5) of the Criminal
Legal Aid (Remuneration) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, as the provision
which it seeks to insert affects the advocate’s freedom of
contract. The standard terms already provide for their amendment within
the terms of the contract. There is a contractual power to do this, but
it is not entirely unqualified; this is not the place to debate how
extensive that power is. However, when it comes to altering the terms
for payment, I suggest that it is a question of degree. The stage may
be reached when the amendment proposed, purportedly within the
contract, is so great that it cannot be altered without the
advocate’s agreement. In that situation, if agreement is not
reached, the advocate would have a right to terminate the
contract<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T21:39:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000075">That
leads me to consider what the effect would be if the amendment goes
through. As I understand it, it would tie the advocate who agrees to
this form of contract to the rates set out in Schedule 6. That being
so, those rates can then be amended by a further order without the need
for the advocate’s agreement. There is no need to alter the
contract: what one does is to look at the schedule and alter the
schedule by a further order. Once the advocate is tied in to such a
contract, he or she has no escape from it, however much the reduction
in the rates may be. As there is every prospect, if one is realistic,
that the cuts now proposed will not be the last, the stage could be
reached when the rates will become wholly uneconomic—indeed,
some may say that this stage has already been reached. That amendment
is a profoundly unattractive change in the 
<?notus-xml column=880?>existing arrangement. I do not understand why it is there and I suggest
that the Government are taking a great risk by proceeding along these
lines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T21:40:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

after all, are not civil servants. One of the strengths of the Bar,
vital in our modern democratic society, is the independence of each one
of its members from each other and from anyone else. That is an
essential part of the system, which lies at the centre of maintaining
the rule of law, which we all believe in. One of the characteristics of
their independence is that advocates cannot be forced to accept terms
to which they have not agreed or which they find unattractive. That
leads directly to the consequences—to which the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Woolf, drew our attention —which could be
very far reaching and very damaging. Those already engaged in work of
this kind might be well advised to withdraw from their contracts, lest
they be sucked into an ever increasing pattern of cuts. There are many
who might be attracted to this kind of work in other circumstances who
would not wish to subject themselves to the reformed contract where
they are subject to change without any further amendment of the

therefore have this further question for the Minister: what assurance
can he give to those who may be willing to accept employment on these
amended terms as to what the future holds for them? This is very
relevant to the issue of recruitment. Schedule 6, as I have suggested,
is open to further amendment. Are we to expect further cuts in these
rates next year or is it proposed to do so within the life of this
Parliament? If so, what further opportunity will there be—indeed
what opportunity will there be at all—for consultation before
any further amendments are proposed? What opportunity will there be for
an advocate to withdraw if he decides that the rates that are then
proposed are so completely unattractive that he is not prepared to
carry on with that work? These are questions that all those engaged in
this kind of work would wish to be answered and I hope very much that
the Minister will be able to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T21:42:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000078">Lastly,
on the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, about
jury trials, I come from Scotland where, as it happens, there is no
right to a jury trial. It is up to the prosecutor to decide whether the
offence should be tried by a judge alone in the sheriff court, with a
sheriff and a jury, or in the High Court with a jury. The length of
sentence is affected by that decision, but there is no reason why a
case of very considerable complexity should not be tried before a
single sheriff. The accused has no right to object to that. It raises
the issue as to whether there is not considerable force in the point of
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, that we are reaching the stage
where a jury trial in some of these cases may need to be
reconsidered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T21:43:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000079"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Faulks" PimsId="5823" UID="1312122000178" xid="2086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000178">Lord

entirely understand the desire on the part of the Government to reduce
spending on legal aid. The LASPO Act was the Government’s first
move in reducing costs. There is no reason why lawyers should be in any
way immune from austerity, nor should justice be recognised as some
sort of special case, up to a point. Nevertheless, what troubled many
noble Lords in scrutinising that Bill as it went through the House was
the risk of real injustice not to lawyers but to those who encountered
the system and would be at risk of being denied access to justice. The
Minister reassured those of us who were anxious, particularly in
relation to Part 1 of the LASPO Bill, as it then was, and made some
important concessions. However, the impact of the Act is going to need
careful watching to ensure that real injustices do not

Secretary of State has now proposed further cuts in the legal aid
budget, focusing principally, but not exclusively, on criminal legal
aid. Perhaps I may say how much I am looking forward to the response of
the party opposite to these proposals. During the passage of the LASPO
Bill, it was often said by the party opposite that, had it won the last
election, it would have made significant cuts in the legal aid budget,
but it was not apparent from the stance that it took to the proposals
in the Bill where those cuts would in fact have occurred. On a number
of occasions, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, whom I see in his place,
indicated that the cuts would have come in criminal legal aid. I think
that the House would regard it as important for the party opposite to
be clear—if not on the detail then certainly in general

previous Government were in the habit of publishing figures for the top

milking the legal aid system. However, I acquit the Secretary of State

the years, successive Governments have attempted to cut the fat off the
criminal justice system and, as we have heard this evening, it is
beyond argument that criminal barristers are, for the most part, very
moderately paid. They are self-employed and have little muscle or
obvious appeal in any negotiating process. There is no

high cost cases are now likely to be ignored by the most competent

judge assisted by experienced barristers, as we have heard from noble

that it is a tragic 
<?notus-xml column=883?>fact that the reduction of 30% that has been

want to add one additional circumstance that I can foresee. If you are
doing a very long case which, as my noble friend Lord Carlile

minds of instructing solicitors with that case—“Oh Mr

on for months and with many more to come”. When you finish that
case, you will find typically that there is no work left and you will

fundamental misunderstanding of the Lord Chancellor’s role. It
is his duty to ensure that there are sufficient resources so that
access to justice for all people at all times can be equally made

Increasingly, our profession reflects the people it serves. I am

the Bar, you had to be a person of independent means because it was by
no means assured that the money you would derive from your profession
would be sufficient to keep you in a manner that was reasonable as
opposed to even comfortable. That changed to allow a greater number of
people to join our profession. I joined the Bar in 1977. I was a person
without comfortable means, state educated, non-Oxbridge and with very
little opportunity, some might have thought, of
succeeding. Looking at the position we are now faced with, I must ask
myself what a Patricia Scotland of today would

Alton of Liverpool (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps a non-lawyer
might be permitted to detain your Lordships’ House for just a
few moments. Although I am not a lawyer, I have a daughter who has this
year qualified as a barrister and should declare that. I was
particularly struck by what my noble friend Lady Deech said in her
remarks earlier on, when she reminded us of the deleterious effect that
the Government’s policies may well have on this rising
generation of young lawyers. Taken together with what the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said in his remarks about the high ideals
that so many lawyers have when entering the legal profession, in
pursuing this vocation, I think that the Government need to listen
extremely carefully to the very distinguished contributions that have
been made this evening and with such
force<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:05:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000102">I
support the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, for two principal reasons. The
first is that I think that the Government’s policies will
significantly impede the possibility of younger people from more
disadvantaged backgrounds from entering the law—the point that
the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, has just made. Secondly,
having represented and been associated with inner-city areas of
Liverpool since I was first elected to the city council there as a
student some 40 years ago—at about the time when the noble Lord,
Lord Carlile, began to practice at the Bar—I am acutely aware
that social justice does not just require access to health, welfare and
decent housing: it also requires access to law. That was a point that I
made several times during the course of the LASPO
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:06:20"></hs_TimeCode> and

the past few decades, much has been done to improve the diversity of
those working at the criminal Bar. However, the further reduction of
barristers’ remuneration proposed by the Government has alarming
social mobility implications. Criminal banisters have already sustained
a disproportionate reduction in remuneration over the last decade. The
noble and leaned Lord, Lord Mayhew, and others have rightly
emphasised the dramatic effect that a devastating
30% reduction will have on those who are now working in the profession.
In return, they are expected to work 
<?notus-xml column=886?>long, unsociable hours and tackle difficult
and, as we have heard, complicated issues of
public importance.</hs_para>

further swingeing cuts are simply unsustainable and the reality is that
they will deter talented individuals from middle and low income
backgrounds from entering or staying within the profession. Instead,
the criminal Bar will once again become the preserve of the
independently wealthy. Those without independent wealth to sustain them
will turn to more financially rewarding areas of practice or to another
profession altogether; we heard about the alluring effect of commercial
law. They will do so not out of greed but simply out of a desire to
receive an income comparable to the earnings of other equivalent
professionals.</hs_para>

instead of treating criminal barristers like other professionals, the
Government have asked them to bear wholly disproportionate cuts to
their incomes. As the Criminal Bar Association has pointed out in its
correspondence with Members of your Lordships’ House, no other
public service professionals have been asked to shoulder cuts on the
scale proposed by the Ministry of Justice. I think that the noble Lord,
Lord Carlile, was quite right to say to us at the very outset that this
is simply
crude<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:08:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:08:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312122000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312122000106"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:08:10"></hs_TimeCode>As
a consequence of these measures, the criminal Bar will see an exodus of
talent. The results will be far reaching and the consequences borne by
society as a whole. That is my second point. People accused of serious
crimes face the prospect of not having anyone of sufficient quality to
represent them; and there will also be a lack of experience to
prosecute the more serious cases in due course. As we have heard, it
will also influence the make-up of the Bench as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:08:48"></hs_TimeCode> as the

is all too easy
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:08:45"></hs_TimeCode> forget the
important part that criminal legal aid has played in ensuring a fair
and just society because the criminal law is not something that
impinges on the everyday life of most of us. Yet when liberty and the
protection of the public are at stake, it is paramount that both the
defendant and the state have quality of representation. If we accept
the fundamental principle that all defendants are innocent until proven
guilty, and may not have actually done what they are accused of, we
should ask ourselves this simple question: “If I found myself in
court accused of a serious crime and was trying to defend my innocence,
who would I want defending
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:09:32"></hs_TimeCode>?”. If
the answer is a highly qualified, independent and dedicated advocate,
it has to be understood by us all that the price of these measures is
that we will forfeit that, and justice will be the loser. It is for
those reasons that the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile,

Thomas of Gresford (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a privilege to

beginnings, I was one of those who, having left university, was not in
a position to go to the Bar as I had wished. I became a solicitor, and
as a young articled clerk I instructed Lord
Elwyn-Jones<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
leading Emlyn Hooson, in a number of cases. I was attracted by the
lustre that surrounded the Bar at that time.
Elwyn-Jones was a Nuremberg prosecutor, as was David Maxwell Fyfe, 
<?notus-xml column=887?>which my noble friend has recently had brought to his attention. Maxwell
Fyfe really wrote the European Convention on Human Rights. It was the
attraction of this profession that drew me, after serving as a
solicitor for five years, to pay my 100 guineas to my pupil master and
to enter on a different track as a

thereafter in civil cases, but more often in criminal cases,
prosecuting, defending and later sitting on the Bench as a recorder. I
was proud of the system in which I played such different roles. I was
proud of the way in which justice could be achieved under the system
that we had inherited over so many centuries. I am really sad
today—a word that has been used by a number of
people—that we seem to be coming to the end of that great
tradition at the Bar. I know that my noble friend says no, but that is
not how I see it. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, who
talked about the suffocation of the criminal Bar by these proposals.

position on these regulations is fairly simple. Some cuts to criminal
legal aid are justified; some cuts to VHCC costs are also justified. I
had to make such cuts some years ago in criminal legal aid and VHCC
rates. I do not resile from having to do that—any Government
would have to do that at a time of economic difficulty. But frankly the
percentage of cuts that is being proposed—the crude and absurd
figure of 30%—seems to be much higher than any figure for which
I was responsible and which can possibly be justified. I say
“absurd”, because quite a lot of the burden of this will
not necessarily fall just on eminent Queen’s Counsel who lead in
these cases, but on junior barristers, either those being led or who

terms, destroying a system of law that gave some access to justice,
often in the form of fairly cheap legal advice, to poor people at the
point in their lives when they needed it and in order that their lives
could be put back on track? In exactly the same way that many noble
Lords and noble and learned Lords have spoken tonight about how
criminal law affects people’s lives, we must not forget how
those acts of legal advice on housing or welfare benefits that have
been given to people on legal aid also affected their lives in very
important ways, often so that their lives could be put back on

that Act in practice, this hard-nosed, ignorant approach to our law

allowed to close. The exceptional cases provisions of the Act are now
so rarely allowed that they might as well not exist. The anecdotes and

was taking place, because all that was about was a few solicitors who
did this kind of work or advice centres that advised in civil law, and
that criminal law legal aid would be seriously touched, could not have
been more mistaken. At least the Bar Council and the Law Society were
very much part of the fight against the LASPO Bill and they should be
commended for that. However, we are in this position now with this only
the first of a number of orders that the House is likely to have to
consider. The Government are not satisfied with the havoc—again,
I chose my word carefully—they have already caused and are
causing day by day and have turned their attention in a very real way
to criminal legal aid and then potentially to destroying a great deal
of the principles behind judicial review. All of which, no doubt, will

those who have spoken tonight. I ought therefore to declare my interest
which is, of course, registered. I also have, like the noble Lord, Lord
Alton, a paternal interest because my daughter is a barrister. She also

the earlier debate tonight, I raised the issue of how the Government go
about or do not go about consulting on matters of great significance.
We are in exactly the same position in relation to the present
proposals. The noble Lord, Lord Faulks, on the other hand, perhaps to
protect himself from his colleagues, threw the question at the
Opposition regarding our stance. If he looked at the record he would
have seen, as my noble friend Lord Bach’s reply has indicated,
that there were some cuts under the previous Government —indeed,
my noble friend Lord Bach put through a 5% cut in fees. That is
one-sixth of the present cut this Government is
inflicting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312126000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312126000012">We
made it very clear in discussions over the legal aid bill that there is
a need to look at the cost of the whole system of justice, not to
isolate a particular part like this and impose a massive swingeing cut
on it. One can look, for example, at the Serious Fraud Office which
unfortunately again is in the news, having again incurred a significant
cost, perhaps because it is underresourced. In all events, there are
other areas under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice that would
repay attention and if we are looking for savings—and it is
accepted that there have to be savings—then we ought to be
looking not just at this end of the system but at the system as a whole
to find sensible savings that would not impact on access to
justice.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="1312126000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312126000054">10.30

insult to injury, as other noble Lords have pointed out, the Government
have entered into the dangerous territory of, effectively,
retrospectively changing people’s contracts. That is, frankly,
outrageous in any field. It is an appalling thing for a Government to
do to the justice system, and I very much hope that they will look
again at that. They have made a tentative move, because they tempered
slightly the cuts in fees for transitional cases but, as others have
pointed out, it still seems to be open to members of the Bar to decline
to proceed with a reduced fee. As others have said, that seems likely
to lead to increased

was that those matters were discussed. They were negotiated. I dare say
that it was felt that the Government had the stronger hand in the

was, however reluctantly, agreed. That is not the situation here. It

Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee has, as we have heard, made it
very clear that it does not feel that the Government have made their
case for those changes and that they should do so. Others have pointed
out that it is wrong just to cite the figures, and the noble Lord, Lord
Carlile, referred to the fee figures as being gross and not referring
to the fact that there are substantial overheads. I think that he said
that VAT was included; he may be mistaken in that respect. In any
event, as far as savings are concerned, it should be noted that counsel
will be paying tax. Counsels of the eminence of the noble Lord, Lord
Carlile, will be paying tax at 40%—hopefully, a little higher,
in due course. The net savings to the Exchequer, in the bald assertions
of the documents, do not refer to the fact that a substantial loss of
tax revenue would also occur, so the net savings to the Exchequer are
not as large as the Government might
claim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312126000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312126000017">As the
Criminal Bar Association points out, an inquiry is going on at the
moment commissioned by the Government—the Jeffrey inquiry into

looking at that problem would have awaited the outcome of the
commission’s work; the Government have chosen not to do so. Will
the Government look at fees again in the light of what the commission
produces? It would have been better to have waited; if they are
insisting on going ahead with the changes now, will they review the
situation in the light of the Jeffrey inquiry’s report? I assume
that that will take some time. Will they also look at the impact of
these changes not only on costs but on how cases are handled, the
length of time that is taken and the problems that may arise by
eminent, senior counsel refusing to undertake that work?</hs_para>

thus far has been—for understandable reasons, given the history

but there is another group affected by the regulations: expert
witnesses. We had some debate, during the discussions on LASPO, about
the cuts for expert witnesses of broadly 20%. This is differentially
higher in London, because London expert witnesses are, in many cases,
being paid significantly less than those in other parts of the country.

extremely difficult to find expert witnesses to give evidence in the

increasingly difficult to find experts. We must not forget that this is

transformation in context, as was requested by the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead. The need for reform of legal aid-funded
services to ensure a cost-effective, sustainable legal aid system is
recognised by all the major political parties and has been the subject
of debate for a decade or more. It was the Labour Party that instituted
the Carter review. It was the Labour Party that made cuts in legal aid
prior to 2010 and promised further cuts in its 2010 manifesto. During
the passage of LASPO, it said that it would not cut civil legal aid but
would cut criminal legal aid. Now, it does not like the legal aid cuts.

aid cuts if it were to come into office in 18 months’

in technology and its increasingly fundamental role in the functioning
of the criminal justice system demand the kind of changes to working
practice and business models seen throughout the public and private
sectors in recent years. The introduction of alternative business
structures and an increasingly well informed customer base are examples
of changes that present their own challenges, and which the legal
professions must meet. Those changes are accompanied by the fact that
the number of businesses providing criminal legal aid services now
exceeds demand for such services. To put it bluntly, there are too many
lawyers seeking the work available. New entrants to the market, new
technologies, new working methods and oversupply in relation to demand
are all factors that force change in any industry, sector or
profession. I urge the Bar to recognise that the change is necessary to

part, the Government recognise that the services the profession
delivers are a vital component of our legal system and, where
necessary, ensure access to justice and equality before the law. That
is why, looking more widely, the Lord Chancellor has asked Sir Bill
Jeffrey to review the provision of independent criminal advocacy in the
courts of England and Wales, as just referred to. That review is
intended to consider the experience, skills and future structures that
might best support the continuing provision of quality,
independent advocacy services. However, alongside the need to ensure
access to justice and a healthy, sustainable legal sector, the
profession must also recognise that the Government are obliged to seek
the best possible value for money from the legal aid
budget.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312126000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312126000027">I turn
now to the instruments that are the subject of this debate. They apply
a reduction of 30% to the legal aid fees paid to litigators and
advocates in what are known as very high cost criminal cases, although
I will accept the description of them by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile,
as being very high complexity cases as well. This will save £19
million per annum in a steady state. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, will
be familiar with these cases; as he told us, he has undertaken this
sort of work in the past. For the benefit of others, I should explain
briefly that VHCCs are the longest and most expensive Crown Court
trials funded by legal aid. Under the current system, they are those
cases which are expected to last more than 60 days at trial; the
overwhelming majority of them relate to fraud offences of one type or
another.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312126000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312126000028">These
cases are managed by the Legal Aid Agency under contracts with service
providers, with work being agreed in three-month stages in advance as
the case progresses. Typically, these cases are complex and run for a
number of years; the amount of preparation involved can be enormous.
Although the debate today has concentrated on fees in VHCCs, I should
also mention, for completeness, that the remuneration regulations also
make two other changes to the criminal legal aid scheme. As the noble
Lord, Lord Beecham, indicated, they reduce fees paid to most expert
witnesses involved in legally aided criminal cases by 20%. They also
amend the category of work in which a provider of legal aid services
can claim a fee. This is a consequence

discussed over a long period. We received 16,000 responses
from representative bodies, practitioners and other 
<?notus-xml column=895?>organisations, individual members of the judiciary,
Members of the House of Commons and the House of
Lords, individual solicitors and barristers, and members of the public.
The majority of responses did not support the Government’s
original proposals for reform, although there was some
support for particular measures. Some, including the Law Society,
specifically acknowledged that VHCCs were an area where the Government
might be able to make
savings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312126000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312126000041">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:48:33"></hs_TimeCode>
we said in responding to consultation, the Legal Aid Agency analysis of
fraud VHCCs shows that the average value of a contract is £1
million and such contracts run for three or four years on average. Even
with a 30% reduction in fees VHCCs will remain high-value,
long-duration cases that, because of the way these cases are managed
with regular phased payments, bring certainty of income for providers
for the extended period in which they are instructed in these matters.
That is why the Government believe that a reduction in fees is
sustainable in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312126000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-0003.htm#1312126000042">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T22:49:08"></hs_TimeCode>

those with fee income of more than £200,000 worked on VHCCs,
compared with just 20% of those with fee income of between

have been raised about the impact of this fee cut on existing

years that we must ensure that the ongoing fees represent value for
money. We are therefore reducing rates in existing contracts where
cases are at a relatively early stage and where the ongoing costs are
likely to be significant. I cannot give any assurances about changing

three or four years away, legal aid will have been cut from just over
£2 billion to £1.5 billion. That leaves us
with a legal aid expenditure about which I will not bandy words as to
whether it is the most generous in the world, but it is an extremely
generous allocation of money by the taxpayer. It is incumbent on all

a further 10% after a further review in 2012, and a further 1% in this

sought to elide into the VHCC changes consultation that had taken place
on completely different legal issues. It is important to emphasise at

not just to make cuts for the sake of making them. He said in relation

conducted the inquiry, which resulted in the report <I>Sport and
Exercise Science and Medicine: Building on the Olympic Legacy to
Improve the Nation’s Health</I>, during the run-up to the 2012
Olympics. The inquiry had two purposes. First, we wanted to find out
how robust the research and evidence base for improving the performance
of our elite athletes is. Secondly, we asked how this knowledge for
helping elite athletes might be translated into treatments and
preventive interventions that could help improve the nation’s
health. Our focus was on biomedical research rather than the
engineering science that refined and improved the equipment used by
elite athletes and amateur sports men and women
alike<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T15:49:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000005">Our
inquiry included sport and exercise science, which is about
understanding the physiology, nutrition, genetics and biomechanics of
the human body in order to improve performance as well as sport and
exercise medicine, which is about the treatment and prevention of ill
health that might arise from exercise: for instance, muscle strain or
joint injury. We did not investigate the important issue of behaviour
change—how to encourage people to become more
active—because we had already completed an inquiry into this
topic in 
<?notus-xml column=154?>2010. Although we focused on sport, we recognised that exercise includes
a much broader range of activities, such as recreational walking,
gardening and
housework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T15:47:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000006">Both
of our questions were highly relevant to the Government’s two
objectives for the Olympics. These were, first, to ensure top
performance of our athletes in winning medals and, secondly, as part of
the legacy of the Games, to encourage the nation to
be,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121194000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000067">“healthier,

the first of these two objectives, Team GB surpassed expectation,
winning more medals than in any Olympics since 1908. The haul of 65
medals, against a target of between 48 and 70, included 29 gold,
placing Britain third in the gold medals table and fourth in the total
medals table. This was a stunning success, but might the performance of
Team GB have been even better with more systematic appliance of better
science? One of Team GB’s greatest Olympic successes was in
cycling, winning seven out of 10 track cycling gold medals. While the
majority of this remarkable success is down to the athletes themselves,
it is thought that some of it is attributable to the meticulous
attention to detail of Matt Parker, “head of marginal
gains”. He analysed down to the last detail the factors that
might make that marginal difference between a medal and no medal:
techniques such as spraying tyres with alcohol to remove dirt and
increase the friction at the start of a race; heated shorts for the
cyclists to keep their muscles warm; and measures to reduce the chance
of athletes succumbing to performance-diminishing infections may all
have contributed to the fraction of a second difference that is needed
to win gold instead of
silver<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T15:49:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13121194000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000007">However,
as our inquiry showed, even in the outstanding cycling team, not all
the techniques believed to enhance performance of elite athletes are
based on sound evidence. For instance, we were told by an expert
witness that feeding elite athletes large quantities of antioxidants to
help muscle recovery not only does not have a beneficial effect but may
even be detrimental. So when we look ahead to the next Olympics, there
may be room for even better performance by our athletes by deploying
the best scientific
knowledge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000008">Our
second question was about using scientific knowledge to help the
Government’s objective of getting the population as a whole to
become healthier through exercise. The health benefits of exercise are
undisputed and affect a wide variety of health outcomes. The Department
of Health told us that there was research to show that exercise could
help to prevent or manage more than 20 chronic conditions, including
coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, type 2 diabetes and a number of
mental health problems. Yesterday’s news story about an article
in the <I>British Journal of Sports Medicine</I> lamenting the lack of
exercise by children even used the emotive language of “child
neglect” to refer to the health problems that will arise because
children are not encouraged to do enough exercise.</hs_para>

do not yet understand the biological mechanisms that give rise to such
far-reaching benefits of exercise. One theory is that exercise promotes
a process called autophagy, in which worn-out surplus or malformed
proteins and other components of our cells are recycled. Perhaps an
understanding, through  
<?notus-xml column=155?>research, of exactly how exercise benefits our bodies would help to
improve and enhance the advice to the population at large on exercise,

research into sport and exercise science and medicine? One fundamental
problem of research on elite athletes is that, by definition, there are
very few individuals to work on. Furthermore, elite athletes are
understandably reluctant to be exposed to invasive measurements that
might interfere with their training or become part of a control group
in an experiment to test the efficacy of a particular intervention. For
this reason, most of the research on elite athletes is observational
and anecdotal. That is not to say that all sport science and medicine
is weak, but several of our witnesses, including the Physiological
Society and the Ministry of Defence, were critical of weak
methodologies<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

quality of research is to carry out the work on non-elite athletes and
the wider public and explore the two-way flow of understanding between
those groups and elite athletes. We heard about examples of well known
techniques that are supported by good evidence—altitude training
to improve stamina, and carbohydrate loading for long-distance
runners—as well as those for which there is no evidence of
benefit, including taking ice baths after vigorous sport and, as I have
already mentioned, taking anti-oxidant
supplements<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000012">UK
Sport is the arm’s-length body of DCMS charged with funding
research to enhance the performance of elite athletes, with a budget,
we were told, of about £20 million over the period between 2009
and 2013. We were surprised that DCMS did not appear to have in place
any mechanism to ensure that UK Sport was commissioning science of the
highest quality, comparable to that in fields of basic biomedical
research. The Government’s response did not specifically address
that point, and I would welcome clarification from the Minister about
how DCMS carried out that quality
assurance<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000013">I
now turn again to the relevance of sport and exercise science and
medicine to the wider public. Most but not all of our witnesses agreed
that the findings from research on elite and non-elite athletes had
relevance to the wider population. Examples include the use of exercise
and muscle conditioning to improve back and knee pain in
osteoarthritis, conditions that affect many people in this
country.</hs_para>

to the public on exercise is contained in the Chief Medical
Officer’s guidelines on physical activity. These guidelines
exist, but how many people are aware of them? I have no doubt that all
noble Lords in this Room are acutely aware that the CMO recommends that
19 to 64 year-olds do 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of
vigorous activity a week, and that there are specific guidelines for
people such as myself who are over 65, but we found in our inquiry no
strategy for ensuring that those guidelines were more widely
disseminated to the public. Indeed, we were told of one survey of 48 GP
practices in 28 London boroughs, which found that none of
the GPs was aware of the latest CMO
guidelines<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

our recommendation that training at all levels for health professionals
should include the need to support the prescription of exercise for
both prevention and treatment of ill health. We also suggested that
physical activity should be added to the quality outcomes framework for
GP practices. I would welcome comment from the Minister on what
progress has been made in this area and whether any measurable change
in disseminating activity guidelines and encouraging physical activity
by health professionals has been
achieved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000016">At
the same time, the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence—NICE—has a role in ensuring that any
prescription of exercise for chronic disease is based on sound
evidence. Could the Minister please update us on NICE’s
assessments and how they are being translated into recommendations?
Many of us who exercise do things that we believe—and are
told—are good to do, like stretching before or after exercising,
or engaging in muscle-strengthening as well as aerobic exercise. I
would be interested to know how robust the evidence is to support these
particular pieces of advice and information that are in the general

mind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000017">Finally,
I turn to the National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine, which

centre was established with a £30 million grant to three
consortia. However, we were told in our inquiry that no ongoing funding
for posts or research was provided and therefore there is a question
about the sustainability of the centre. We also suggested that the
centre should take the lead in developing a national strategy for sport
and exercise science and medicine. Could the Minister please update us
on the progress of the national centre and how its sustainability is
being established, and also on the production of a national
strategy?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13121194000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000018">No
one can doubt the importance of sport and exercise. The health of the
population at large would be hugely enhanced if people exercised more.
The prestige and entertainment provided by our elite athletes was
vividly demonstrated by our national success at the 2012 Olympics and
by Andy Murray’s Wimbledon triumph. Science and medicine can
make an important contribution to the realisation of these benefits of
sport and exercise. The United Kingdom has an absolutely outstanding
science base in the biomedical sciences but the evidence that we heard
suggested that there is insufficient cross-fertilisation between this
excellent science base, carried out in our world-class universities and
institutes, and the application of that science to improving the
performance of our elite athletes and the health of the nation. I look

is clear that this goal is well worth achieving, and if sports and
exercise science and medicine can impact on the population at large and
reverse what is, in the case of obesity, an epidemic that has been
running for many years, it will be something well worth attempting. As
well as mentioning obesity, as the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, reminded us,
Tessa Jowell could have mentioned the 20 other chronic conditions
identified as lending themselves to prevention or alleviation through
physical
activity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:01:30"></hs_TimeCode>. So we
seek to increase participation levels in sport and exercise for all
ages in order to capture the health benefits for the population at
large<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

given credit for having put together a number of cross-departmental
initiatives, listed at paragraph 45. They involve, of course, the
Department of Health, the Department for Transport and the Department

DCMS Minister, when giving evidence to us, said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121194000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000072">“the

does not make a lot of sense. We all agree that we want more people to
participate. Why? I think we all recognise that it is because there are
going to be those 
<?notus-xml column=158?>benefits. I say again that it is perfectly reasonable for UK
Sport—a DCMS arm’s-length body, as the noble Lord, Lord
Krebs, reminded us—to spend government money and, for that
matter, lottery money on promoting the agency’s primary
objective of winning more medals in competitions. I am all for that. UK
Sport also receives money from third parties that are not subject to
the same commitment to share the benefits that derive from public
funds. With commercial organisations there may well be a
confidentiality clause, and I recognise that. However, it should be a
condition of receiving public funds for there to be an obligation to
promote the sharing of the research findings that I mentioned in order
that the wider public might benefit. That is not happening; the links
between some of the elite research, other athletic research and the
wider public are not as strong as one would have
hoped<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:03:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

professionals plenty of information is available. We have heard about
the Chief Medical Officer’s guidelines on physical activity.
However—I repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, told
us—there does not seem to be an effective mechanism for
promoting this information, the guidelines and other advice, to the
medical professionals. Surveys show that their knowledge of the
guidelines is, frankly, disappointing. At paragraph 36 we point out
that Sport England told us that exercise prescription should
“sit alongside” pharmaceutical and surgical
interventions. Yet GPs have no incentive to prescribe exercise; I can
quite see that many GPs say that that is all very well but it is most
impractical for them to tell some of their more obese patients to go
out and take exercise. What they want is a prescription. Nevertheless,
as a layman, I am fairly confident that in many cases a prescription
which simply said “Go out and take more exercise” would
be a jolly sight more effective than a surgical or pharmaceutical
intervention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000024">If
you think about the quality and outcome framework, there are incentives
to GPs to do this, that and the other. One incentive is to list those
of their patients who fall into the category of obese, but the
incentive is to put them on the list, not to take them off it. Once
they are on the list, GPs get paid for keeping them there. That is not
exactly an incentive for them to tell their patients how to get below
the magical figure at which they are considered obese. Clearly the
quality and outcome framework needs to be revised. Adding physical
activity to the quality and outcome framework, as Sport England
suggested, might be a good start. It would save a lot of money—I
am quite confident of that. You would perhaps even make a very modest
dent in the culture change we are looking for so that people recognise
that exercise can help solve some of the problems that we are facing as
an ageing and ever more obese population. We need to raise the profile
of physical activity.</hs_para>

there are up to 20 different chronic conditions which could benefit
from physical activity, and I shall not repeat them. I am surprised, as
a complete layman, how little understanding there appears to be of why
physical activity can help with so many of those conditions, including,
for example, mental health problems, cancer, type 2 diabetes and the
like. This is clearly a field of great potential interest and benefit
and one where sports and exercise medicine 
<?notus-xml column=159?>has a unique contribution to make alongside the medical and biological
sciences. It would be enormously helpful if there could be much greater
collaboration in order to ensure that these helpful insights are
captured. However, as I said earlier, that will happen only if we have
a culture where research findings—particularly those funded by
the public—are made available to the wider research community
and, through that, to the public at
large.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_11_PT_1/492ED75BDD2F7D468517D3687D34B728CCACE558" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 December 2013">Wednesday,

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, this is one of those papers that
when you pick it up and read it makes you think, “Oh!”. I
have raised sport and exercise medicine on numerous occasions, and the
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, have been dragged
in. My approach has always been about enhancing general medicine and
making sure that people are encouraged to take up sport, because they
are put back together again quickly to carry on with the rest of their
lives and to carry on with
sport.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000027">This
report is a fairly academic paper, and I feel that it misses some of
the point. You do not play a sport or push yourself to keep fit; that
is a by-product. If we could all stay fit by jogging 2.3 miles every
third day or whatever it is, everybody would be happy. We would have
the medical benefits. We could get on with it without trouble, but we
do not. We know we do not. We need an incentive and a reason to take
the exercise to get the benefit. This report slightly missed the point
that you do sport because it gives you a buzz. Enjoyment is not quite
the right word. Sport at various levels gives you a buzz, a feeling of
achievement, the competition and the thrill. Exercise sometimes
provides you with another good feeling: the chance to get outside.
These feelings are going on. Although the report mentions the
psychology, I do not think it got under the skin of why you are doing
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121194000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000028">Having
said that, the report is right about the fact that we do not
co-ordinate, in trying to make sure that we get the benefit of the
health agenda—and, presumably, the preventive health
agenda—and the saving that the nation gets. The two bits do not
speak to each
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000029">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:10:34"></hs_TimeCode>
have come to the conclusion that sports are slightly worse than
political parties for wanting to sit in darkened rooms talking to each
other about themselves—only slightly, but probably worse. They
do not like people intervening on what they do, and change is usually
forced on them—usually by a failure to perform at a certain
level, to achieve an increase in numbers or, classically, to compete at
the level to which they aspire or that they are used
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:10:30"></hs_TimeCode>. So when the
report says that the science of elite-level sport is unclear, that does
not surprise me very much. I suspect that the art of coaching and
getting the best out of people is at odds with scientific method. The
psychology involved, and the signs that you are responding to what goes
on around you, are probably not approached best by this. There is also
resistance to intervention. Sharing—and we are much better at
sharing now than we were before, probably because we have to take on
funding from outside government, and it is taken seriously—still
has not gone into the culture.</hs_para>

obvious thing that I had not even thought about until this report came
out is that, if you are an elite-level sportsman, you do not want to be
experimented on. It is a bit of a no-brainer. Who does want to be
experimented on, to be perfectly honest? They want to be treated,
helped, supported—yes. But they will take on a revolutionary new
course of action only if they absolutely have to. That is a very
logical point of view to take. It is always going to be anecdotal when
slight changes in practice
occur.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000031">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:12:12"></hs_TimeCode>
am increasingly aware that I am not qualified in my own sporting life.
Although I flirted with the top of my sport, I am totally aware that we
were amateurs; although we did not think that we were amateurs, we
absolutely were. I remember the shock when a first-class rugby club got
its first diet sheet. Those days are long gone. But having worked a
little bit with the elite level, I can say that trying to change the
culture of behaviour, when people’s whole lives have been
dominated by trying to achieve performance, is something that acquires
scientific language, if nothing else. Trying to identify exactly what
you are getting out of it is a very important factor here. To get
benefit for wider society in terms not just of health but of community
support and interaction is another very important point that is not
covered
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000032">Sports<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:13:29"></hs_TimeCode>
medicine has important lessons to teach ordinary medicine. It is a
simple fact that a sportsman knows that, if you get a bump, you get it
treated quickly; you do not go to your GP and wait three weeks for a
physio appointment, because then you would find that a muscle was
weakened or that there was a slight imbalance in how you walked that
has led into an imbalance in your entire body, which means that you
might have to take time off work. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that
it was a very sensible idea to get more physios involved in accident
and emergency, when I raised this issue a few years ago. We are still
not quite there yet, because we do not take soft tissue injuries
seriously enough. Sport has already taught us, and given us examples,
that you should intervene early on those things to stop them becoming
chronic. We have simply not adopted that
yet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:13:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000033">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:14:15"></hs_TimeCode>
have always been something of a fan of having sport more closely linked
to the Department of Health so that we can get those benefits together,
especially preventive stuff. Certainly, exercise is a factor in
controlling weight and gives you an incentive not to carry extra
weight—by which I mean surplus weight. My rants against the body
mass index are well recorded here, and I think that we will leave the
subject there. But a sensible approach to how to control weight and
stay healthy is something that probably should be led by the Department
of
Health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:14:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

interesting because it starts to open a door to what is going on. When
you open a door you do not know what you will find, but here was a
corridor leading to interesting places which was perhaps felt to be
irrelevant to sport, at least at the moment. It is an interesting start
but to think that the Olympics would change the culture overnight was a
total misconception. It will not be the only misconception about the
Olympics. My noble friend and I have been sitting on a committee which
looked at this issue and 
<?notus-xml column=161?>we got the impression that many people felt that, once the Olympics

is certainly true that some sports fare better than others in this
respect but in our flagship sport—football—those who earn
a living dance to the tune of the paymaster. When Alex Ferguson
employed a team of sports scientists, he did not want its work made
publicly available to Chelsea. As a result, the Premier League has no
research-based ethic, in part because of the powerful marketing machine
of professional sport in the United Kingdom, and in part because there
is little equipment research as the great confounder is the constant
change of kit for commercial gain. The public want to buy the style of
football boots used by Messi or Bale. The money is in the kit that
people want to own. Tennis players will employ one model of shoes for a
year and the likes of Adidas and Nike, with their research teams, will
fiercely guard their commercial-in-confidence research. Every season
brings a new range of kit—new ski shapes and sizes; new tennis
shoes. That commercial reality is a major inhibitor to long-term
research<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:17:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121194000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#13121194000038">Secondly,
it is very difficult to extrapolate the science of elite sport down to
the recreational player. The science required to provide a marginal
gain to Chris Hoy is of little relevance to the recreational cyclist in
the country lanes this weekend. The outstanding work that Sir Clive
Woodward, his team, the coaches and the intricately woven sports
scientists undertook for Team GB in 2012 only marginally impacts on
wider participation. For this is specialist science; it is
world-leading scientific knowledge. It was borne out by 29
gold medals, as opposed to one in Atlanta only 16 years
before when such specialist knowledge was absent.</hs_para>

said, there is room for wider dissemination of research where it does
not impact competitive advantage for young athletes. Other countries do
better in this respect. The NHL and NFL in the United States are
examples. The NFL collates data centrally and provides public awareness
programmes without disclosing the internal secrets of the sports
scientists at the Miami Dolphins or Seattle Seahawks. Australia and

main reason for the difference is the sources of funding. In countries
where research is funded by those without vested interests, the
prospect for dissemination is enhanced. For countries such as ours,
where tight funding control is exercised via our Premier League

the wider issue of an Olympic legacy to improve the nation’s

challenge caused by obesity among young people, the expensive
consequences we face as a country from having low levels of physical

improving the nation’s health. I regret that we still have a

Kate Hoey when the bid was won in 2005, we called on the Government to:
begin work on pioneering a nationwide programme of sport and exercise
medicine, echoed in parts of this new report; substantially increase
the number of training schemes for GPs as well as for sport and

course, at the heart of such a programme is the need for co-ordination
in government. In my view, the Department of Health should lead a major
cross-government strategy to promote the health benefits of physical

scientific case for a unified, high-priority national campaign could
not be stronger. The twin causes of so much of the burden on the
National Health Service are either genetic or environmental. On the
environmental side, so many diseases are preventable if you maintain a
healthy lifestyle. We need lifestyle departments, with teachers
qualified in relevant disciplines in every school, both primary and
secondary. We need to design opportunities which young people enjoy. If
you want to try to improve the health of the nation it has to be
through a sport that people can do by themselves. A sport requiring 22
people to take part is never going to be easy to facilitate and roll
out nationwide. If you want to get girls involved, which should be a
priority, it has to be in activities they want to do. They do not all
want to take part in outside team sports, which is why dance is such an

closing, the report also calls for further work to be undertaken on
international best practice. There is no better place to begin than
Finland. No more than 30 years ago—I speak with affection and
respect for that great country—it was characterised as a
heavy-smoking, heavy-drinking, unfit country. It has completely
changed. The past two decades have been marked by a 
<?notus-xml column=165?>major shift in emphasis from competitive and elite sports to
health-enhancing physical activity for all, as seen most clearly in two
successive sports Acts and a government resolution. Now, increasingly,
multi-sectorial initiatives have led to substantial changes in the
public funding of sports organisations, services and the construction
of sport and recreational facilities.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:37:05"></hs_TimeCode> is a system
built on the enthusiasm of volunteers. In stark contrast, it is also a
country where local authorities are central to the delivery of

often to be cut first.</hs_para>

recognises the health benefits of the cradle-to- grave approach that is
so important. We need a health and fitness programme that is both
low-cost and designed from cradle to grave. Cycling, swimming and, in
Finland, cross-country skiing figure prominently—all activities

am a huge fan of the benefits of sport and exercise science if it is
used in the right way. In my career I have undergone numerous tests,
aerodynamics, skinfold measurements, maximum lung capacity testing,
something called a VO2 test—there is nothing like pushing on a
treadmill until you feel you are about to collapse, and then having
needles stuck into you—and I can confirm that ice baths are
indeed vile. On one memorable birthday, my husband bought me three

agree with the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, about history. There is an
assumption that not much has gone on before and that sports science
testing has been used for a long time. I also agree with the noble
Lords, Lord Krebs and Lord Addington, that athletes do not want to be
used as guinea pigs—I certainly did not—unless it is your
own idea, and then it is marvellous. However, it is quite difficult

of the problems I see going forward—and I have seen way too much
of it—is that of literally reinventing the wheel: we do not
learn from the past, somebody comes along with a new idea and sometimes
wastes money doing things that have previously been done. Overall,
lottery funding has significantly helped our athletes by ensuring they
get the right support at the right age. As an athlete who benefited
from it, I think that is tremendous. We need to keep urging national
governing bodies to invest and use sports science. Some sports are
using less of it now than they were 15 years ago.</hs_para>

a positive influence on the general population. The design of sports
equipment at Paralympic Games level has led to better design of day
chairs. They are lighter, stronger and more aesthetically pleasing.
Certainly in amputee running, the work that has gone into the
development of prosthetics for sprinters has had a massive positive
influence on non-runners in terms of their walking gait and equipment,
and it is more generally accepted that they deserve really good
prosthetic equipment. There have been some very positive things that we

Hunt of Kings Heath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome this
debate and the report of the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord
Krebs. I think it is a truth universally acknowledged that the Olympic
Games in London were outstanding and never to be forgotten and that the
legacy is as important. The argument for investing in sports science in
elite performance and in non-elite sports and exercise has been very
persuasively put by all noble Lords who have spoken in the debate this
afternoon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000002">The
question first posed by the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, was: the
performance of Team GB in the Olympics was outstanding, but could it
have been even better if even more use had been made of science? The
noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, answered in the affirmative and pointed the
way forward in terms of there being a very strong case for future
investment in science in relation to elite sport.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131211117000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000003">The noble Lord, Lord
Krebs, referred to heated shorts. As a commuting cyclist, I am very
attracted to the idea, particularly as Christmas is coming up and the
winter will, no doubt, get colder. More seriously, it would be good to
hear from the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about future investment in sports
science in elite and non-elite sports. The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan,
made a very important point when he said that there is a problem with
the sharing of knowledge with the vested interests of investors in
sports science as opposed to the non-vested interests. That does not
necessarily have to be government, but government can, no doubt, play
an important role.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131211117000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000004">The other question
that arises from this is about the extent to which we are investing in
science to increase our knowledge of the impact of exercise on good
health. This is the second argument that has been put in your
Lordships’ debate this afternoon. The noble 
<?notus-xml column=167?>Lord, Lord Krebs, and other noble Lords referred to the health benefits
of exercise, and it is striking that although this is increasingly
known about, it does not seem to have much impact on the general
public’s desire to exercise. The post-legacy figures for the
public taking up sport or more generally taking part in exercise have
been very disappointing. The figure of 150 minutes of moderate exercise
per week seems as far off for many of the population as it ever was.
Noble Lords probably know that I live in Birmingham, and my
understanding of the latest statistics there is that 22% of young
people in Birmingham are classified as obese. That is a shocking
figure. We know the impact that that will have in future years in terms
of health inequalities and demands being made on the health service. As
we know, we have an epidemic of diabetes in many parts of society and
of the country. As regards the figure of 22% obesity among young people
in Birmingham, you do not need much knowledge of science to know that
that will lead to huge pressures being put on the health system in that
city in the coming
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:45:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000005">I
wish to ask the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about the role of general
practitioners. A number of points have been made in that regard. It was
argued persuasively that if GPs were to prescribe exercise that might
have a positive impact in terms of people’s response. We know
that as regards health issues, particularly smoking, nothing is more
effective than a GP telling a patient that he or she needs to think
about giving up smoking. It would be helpful to ensure that GPs are all
facing in the right direction on this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:45:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000006">Does
the noble Earl think that health and well-being boards ought to
prioritise investment in sport and exercise vis-à-vis local
authorities and the health service? After all, health and well-being
boards recognise that local authorities have a big role to play in this
area. Local authorities are also responsible for running extensive
leisure services—or at least they were—and have a wider
role in this area in liaising with schools. Surely sport and exercise
ought to be a major priority in joint strategic needs assessments,
which attempt to bring together wider health policies. Will the noble
Earl assure the Committee that the Government will push health and
well-being boards in that direction? I would argue that they could be
the local equivalent of the committee set up by the BMA in the 1930s,
and its successor organisations, to which the noble Lord, Lord
Moynihan,
referred<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:47:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000007">Another
very important point raised by the committee of the noble Lord, Lord
Krebs, was the attitude of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
towards the health benefits of sport. The Government reject the
committee’s assertion. My own experience in government suggests
that there is a gap between the Department of Health’s policy of
encouraging exercise and the DCMS’s focus on sport. Indeed, I
have taken part in theological debates between the two departments on
where one element ends and the other begins. This is a fruitless
exercise as it is patently obvious to anyone with any common sense that
sport and exercise go together. If those departments find it difficult
to resolve that issue, something else needs to happen. That could
involve assistance in the form of a Cabinet committee, to 
<?notus-xml column=168?>which the Government refer in their response to the report of the noble
Lord, Lord Krebs, or, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, suggested, we
should simply make it clear that a good health outcome is the number
one priority. I believe that something more needs to happen in this

Lords have not really mentioned the role of the Department for
Education despite the fact that it has a crucial role to play in this
area. We have seen very regrettable reductions in government support
for school sport and I hope that the noble Earl’s department has
actively pointed out to Mr Gove the error of his ways. Following the
reaction to the original cuts in government support for school sport,
the Department for Education partly retracted its proposals and
established the School Games project—as we are told in the
Government’s response—which attempts to provide more
opportunity for pupils of all abilities to take part in competitive
sport in schools. But I would like to see more—and I would like
to see the Department of Health become the champion in Whitehall of the
need to promote school sports, competitive sports and other

would also like to hear more about how we can encourage sports clubs to
work in schools. The noble Baroness, Lady Heyhoe Flint, has done so
much to
encourage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:50:14"></hs_TimeCode> girls
to take part in competitive sports; she will know of the Chance to
Shine project, which is about encouraging state schools to come back to
playing cricket. Part of that approach is to encourage local cricket
clubs to send their coaches into schools. I would like to hear more
about how the Government might encourage that in

then come to the issue of investment. The noble Lord, Lord Krebs,
referred to the role of the National Centre for Sport and Exercise
Medicine. Clearly, there is a concern here about its future viability.
Can the Minister give the Committee some comfort that the Government
recognise that continued funding support needs to be provided? Does he
think that the Department of Health’s own research and
development fund could come up with some support? It seems a persuasive
argument that, given that the department is concerned with improving
the health of people in this country, and given that sports and
exercise clearly have a vital role to play in doing so, I would have
thought that the argument for some support and funding from his own
department’s R&amp;D fund, which is not extensive but is very
significant, ought to be
considered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:51:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000011">The
noble Lord, Lord Addington, suggested that the noble Earl, Lord Howe,
and I were interlopers in this debate. However, I have no doubt that
the encouragement of sports and exercise can play a critical role in
improving the nation’s health and well-being. I am also in no
doubt, having listened to the debate and read the report, that
investment in science and science research could help us and use that
knowledge to encourage more of the population to play a part. When one
looks at some of the great health problems that we face—of
frailty, dementia and obesity—one can see emerging research that
suggests that exercise and sports can very much help us to meet some of
those challenges. Given the department’s role, does the 
<?notus-xml column=169?>Minister not accept that it could play a much bigger role in this whole
area in future? I hope that the department will accept that
opportunity.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_11_PT_1/2722D8AF0E2B00D860CEA8D0735C0BB7700E7F2C" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 December 2013">Wednesday,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, first, I
congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, on securing this debate and on
the excellent work of the Select Committee on Science and Technology,
which he chairs, in highlighting the important issues associated with
sport and exercise science and medicine. The Government have welcomed
the Committee’s report and its focus on the quality and
application of research in this
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:53:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:53:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000013">We
agree that the biomedical basis for improving performance of elite
athletes needs to be of the highest quality possible and meet
international peer review standards. For this reason, UK Sport and the
English Institute of Sport have robust processes in place to
quality-assure the projects that they support. For example, all
projects are reviewed by an independent research advisory group, which
includes a number of leading experts in the field of sport
science.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000014">Our
elite<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:54:15"></hs_TimeCode> sport
programme is the envy of the world. UK athletes continue to perform
strongly at the highest levels, thanks to the funding and technical
support they receive from UK Sport and the home country sports
institutes. Based on Team GB’s performance, there is no reason
to doubt the quality or appropriateness of the
research<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:54:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:54:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000015">In
the light of this success, it makes sense for this knowledge to be
shared so that it might benefit non-elite sports men and women. Indeed,
there are a number of ways in which UK Sport disseminates research
findings. However, it is important to remember that the end goal of
research is to support and maximise athletic performance on the world
stage. Although UK Sport and the English Institute of Sport concede
that more could be done to disseminate their findings, they need to do
so without compromising the UK’s competitive
edge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000016">The
committee’s report rightly highlights the societal and economic
costs of inactivity—a point well made by the noble Lord, Lord
Hunt—and the benefits of exercise in promoting health and
treating chronic disease. Indeed, the UK CMOs’ report, <I>Start
Active, Stay Active</I>, contains recommendations across the life
course on the levels of physical activity needed to achieve these
benefits. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, mentioned the research funded by
my department. I can tell him that the department’s National
Institute for Health Research funds a wide range of research on the
benefits of physical
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000017">I
completely agree with my noble friend Lord Selborne that it is of
crucial importance that breakthroughs in sport and exercise science and
medicine are translated into health benefits for patients and the
public whenever relevant and applicable. For example, characterising
the mechanisms by which heart function improves with exercise in elite
athletes and the military can help explain how heart function is
impaired in people with diabetes or with high blood pressure. There are
numerous examples of where the work of UK Sport and the English
Institute of Sport is linked to benefits in the 
<?notus-xml column=170?>health and wellness domains. These typically involve partnerships with
universities and necessitate the sharing of knowledge—for
example, vitamin D supplements for bone injury and soft tissue injury
recovery. There are a number of other channels, including formal and
informal events where knowledge is shared within and outside the elite
sport community. I think we can therefore be reassured about one of my
noble friend’s central points—that taxpayer funding
should lead to benefits to the wider public.</hs_para>

research is a high priority for the Government. In August 2011 we
announced a record £800 million to support this through
biomedical research centres and units funded by the National Institute
for Health Research. Some of this money has been used to establish a
new research unit at Leicester and Loughborough. This unit is helping
to expand lifestyle interventions available for the prevention and
treatment of chronic diseases. The funding is also enabling the NIHR
biomedical research centre at University College London Hospital to
study the mechanisms through which exercise promotes health, and how to
deliver effective exercise
strategies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000019">An
important link in all this, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord
Krebs, is the first ever National Centre for Sport and Exercise
Medicine, a legacy bid commitment of the 2012 London Games. The
£30 million project funded by health is on track,
with the London hub now actively functioning and treating patients.
Loughborough is anticipated to become operational in 2014, and
Sheffield will be the final site to become operational in late 2015. As
well as supporting elite athletes, the centre’s influence will
extend to local NHS hospitals and primary care facilities to provide a
service for anyone who plays sport. Public Health England is overseeing
the continuing development of the national centre and is keen to ensure
that the centre performs a clear leadership role for sport and exercise
science and medicine for the next five years and beyond. Public Health
England is supporting the national centre to position it as an
international voice on sport and exercise medicine, with strong links
with the wider physical activity agenda and a global academic platform.
PHE is considering an outline business case for funding in 2014-15 to
support co-ordination across the national centre and as pump priming
for long-term sustainability. The centre is keen to be seen as an
independent organisation which generates income through direct patient
care and research funding. It has appointed R&amp;D leads to start that
work. We can see the makings of the centre as a sustainable long-term
organisation going
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:00:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000020">The
noble Lord asked about the centre as a source of a national strategy.
Public Health England is, once again, working with the national centre
to develop a sport and exercise medicine network of academics to help
collaboration in research funding bids across multiple academic units.
However, potential for conflict of interests has emerged as a stumbling
block in developing a national research strategy.</hs_para>

public health, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked about the role of
health and well-being boards and his view that they should be
prioritising investment in exercise. Many noble Lords would identify 
<?notus-xml column=171?>with that view but we must remember that health and well-being boards
have been given, quite explicitly, the freedom to prioritise their own
spending in relation to local public health priorities. However, I
expect Public Health England to show the way in the area for local
health and well-being boards to
follow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000022">We

health benefits of physical activity, the Select Committee was right to
focus attention on the training of health professionals at all levels
to be able to prescribe exercise for prevention and treatment. Clearly,
the content and training curricula for doctors is determined by the
medical schools and royal colleges, but the Department of Health will
work closely with Public Health England and other interested
organisations to make the case for physical activity in healthcare. On
a more practical level, I am pleased to announce that Public Health
England has commissioned an e-learning module on physical activity for
healthcare professionals, to be distributed by BMJ

Krebs, mentioned the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence. NICE plays an important role in turning research evidence
into authoritative and practical guidance for practitioners and
commissioners. Where appropriate, both its public health and clinical
guidance recognise the contribution that physical activity can play in
the prevention, management and treatment of particular conditions,
ranging from obesity to osteoarthritis and low back pain. I assure the
noble Lord that many of NICE’s clinical guidelines recognise the
important role that exercise and physical activity can play in the
management of individual conditions. For example, its clinical
guidelines on osteoarthritis and low back pain already recommend
exercise. I am confident that NICE will continue to consider the role
of exercise and physical activity in the management of particular
conditions, where the evidence
allows.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000025">The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked about the scope for disseminating exercise
guidance for specific chronic conditions to GPs. We are exploring the
options for a national dissemination of this learning, which would need
to be underpinned by better training for doctors in the benefits of
physical activity. The new e-learning package commissioned by Public
Health England represents an important step in that
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:03:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

also play an important role in supporting the most vulnerable patients
to exercise as part of their treatment for a range of
conditions—for example, as part of cardiac rehabilitation.
Ukactive has been working with the royal colleges and training
organisations for the fitness industry to develop new professional and
operational standards for exercise referral. That work is awaiting the

noble Lord, Lord Krebs, asked about the possibility of incorporating
physical activity into an indicator in the quality and outcomes
framework. 
<?notus-xml column=172?>This year saw the introduction of two new QOF indicators for physical
activity. Those measured the percentage of patients with hypertension
who had been screened for inactivity and, of those not meeting the
guidelines, the percentage offered brief advice on how to be active. I
have to tell him that these indicators have been retired from the
2014-15 QOF as part of the exercise to free up space for GPs to provide
more personalised care. That agreement saw a reduction of the QOF by
more than a third. However, the NHS health check programme continues to
recommend that patients should be screened for their physical activity
levels and the delivery of brief advice or an exercise referral for
those who are shown to be
inactive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:05:26"></hs_TimeCode>. At the

initiated by the DCMS. I have already alluded to that very briefly.
There is no specific monitoring or assessment undertaken by the DCMS of
the research commissioned by its arm’s-length bodies. However,
UK Sport acknowledges that further steps are necessary to provide
stringent assessments of standards and has already made progress on
this for the next funding cycle from 2013-17. This includes the
appointment of an independent, technically structured sub-committee in
addition to the research advisory group that has been in existence for

with other departments to support active lifestyles. Departments have
jointly made available £300 million to raise the game in primary
school sport. The Department for Transport awarded £77 million
to increase cycling in eight of our major cities, with £1.2
million from the Department of Health to support walking. More than a
million more people are playing sport than in 2005. I suggest to noble
Lords that that progress is positive. As regards the

important point when he talked about the enjoyment of sport and
exercise. Perhaps the key to encouraging people to be more active is to
show them the enjoyment that can be obtained from it. He also referred
to the art of coaching elite sports men 
<?notus-xml column=174?>and women. There may well be an art to it but that does not mean there
cannot be science as well working alongside the art. The point made by
the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and others about learning the lessons of

that estimating the levels of fraud perpetrated in the individual

plan to concentrate on four key aspects of our report: first, the
vulnerability of EU funds to fraud and their potential scope for fraud;
secondly, fraud specifically in the UK related to EU funds; thirdly,
the European fraud concerning VAT; and, fourthly, the European
Union’s anti-fraud structure. I turn first to one of the main
conclusions of our report; namely, the vulnerability of EU funds to
fraud. In 2011—the year that forms the main focus of the
committee’s inquiry—the EU’s budget was
€141.9 billion. In 2011, the total government revenue in the UK
for the same year was £589 billion. The UK’s budget is
three and half times the EU
budget.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000048">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:19:45"></hs_TimeCode>
its obligation to report annually on its anti-fraud work, the
Commission produces a figure for fraud in the European Union based on
the frauds reported to it by the relevant member state authorities. The
figure for 2011 was €404 million, or 0.28% of the EU’s
2011 budget. Many of our witnesses told us that this was an
underestimate of the problem, and Rosalind Wright QC, former director
of the Serious Fraud Office in the UK, said this figure represented the
tip of the
iceberg<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:20:21"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Commission rejected the iceberg analogy and 
<?notus-xml column=176?>suggested that EU funds were no more prone to fraud than national
budgets, while the UK Government argued that EU
funds,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="131211117000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000154">“will

UK’s National Fraud Authority which, until its recently
announced abolition by the Home Secretary, was tasked with
co-ordinating anti-fraud action in the UK, told us that the current
level of fraud suffered by the UK public purse amounts to about
£20.3 billion per annum, which suggests that for 2011 in the UK,
3.4% of the public purse was lost to fraud. So, in line with the
Commission’s evidence that the EU’s budget is no more
prone to fraud than national budgets, the committee took the estimate
for fraud in the UK and applied it to the EU’s annual budget for
2011 and arrived at a figure for fraud on the EU’s budget for
2011 of €4.82 billion, a figure more than 10 times more than the
Commission’s official
figure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:20:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000050">The
committee’s report recognised the various caveats and warnings
that have been applied to the process of deriving these figures for
fraud on the EU’s budget from national figures. Nevertheless, it
is clear to the committee that the Commission’s official figure
for 2011 of €404 million offers only a glimpse of the levels of
fraud perpetuated against the EU’s finances. If the Government
are right that EU programmes will always be vulnerable to fraud, and in
some member states increasingly so, the final figure will be even
greater<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:22:12"></hs_TimeCode>. I note
that in its recent impact assessment in support of the proposed
European Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Commission suggested
that the actual level of fraud on the EU’s budget was in the
region of €3 billion, so it is moving towards the
committee’s
figure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:22:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000051">In
their formal response to this report, the Government expressed concern
about our estimate of the level of EU fraud, adding that they did not
recognise the committee’s figure. We were disappointed with the
Government’s lack of engagement with this key conclusion of our
report, so I offer the Minister an opportunity during this debate to
engage with this aspect of our conclusions. Given this disappointing
context, we were unable to see how the member states’ and
Commission’s claims to protect the EU’s financial
interests could be justified. We hope that the introduction of the
directive on protecting the EU’s financial interests via the
criminal law, which introduces an EU-wide definition of fraud on the
EU’s finances, will help to alleviate this
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000052">We
also looked specifically at the extent to which fraud against the
EU’s budget was committed from within the UK and assessed the
rigour of the Government’s duty to report evidence of fraud to
the Commission. I regret that the picture that emerged was not good.
The committee recognised that the same difficulties that apply to
estimating fraud on the EU’s budget also apply to assessing the
levels of EU fraud committed from within our shores. None of our
witnesses was willing to place a precise figure on the problem, but the
National Fraud Authority suggested a figure of £41 million,
about 1% of the total EU-funded expenditure in the UK. However, it
warned us to treat this estimate with a “high degree of
scepticism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:24:09"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000053">What
emerged is that no single government department or body appeared to
co-ordinate or take ownership of the UK’s fight against EU
fraud. The Government 
<?notus-xml column=177?>told us that they take all these matters seriously and EU fraud
“extremely seriously”, but the responsibility to deal
with fraud and to report it to the Commission falls on the individual
department dealing with the relevant
funds<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:19:50"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:24:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:23:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:24:42"></hs_TimeCode>.
When asked, the Minister was not “sure” whether the
Government collated all the different departmental figures into one
place. This lack of co-ordination concerned us and confirmed our view
that individual member states, including the UK, do not devote
significant resources to pursuing EU fraud and, as is their
responsibility under EU law, to reporting it to the
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000054">We
therefore recommended in the report that the Government nominate a
single department or agency to co-ordinate the fight against EU fraud
in the UK and to take responsibility for attempting to quantify the
problem. In their response to us, the Government agreed that this
information should be shared between government departments and that,
while there is room for improvement, such sharing already takes place.
We welcome this, although we have wondered why it has been so difficult
for the committee to get a clearer estimate of the level of the problem
in the UK, even allowing for the nature of fraud, from those witnesses
we saw from the relevant national
bodies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000055">Furthermore,
on 2 December the Home Secretary by way of a Written Statement
announced the abolition in March 2014 of the National Fraud Authority.
I note that her Statement makes no mention of EU fraud, nor does it
assign responsibility for dealing with the problem to any specific UK
body. I therefore have to ask the Minister: who will be responsible for
leading the fight against EU fraud in the UK after 31 March
2014?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131211117000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000056">I turn
now, briefly, to VAT fraud or carousel fraud, as it is often known.
This is a highly technical fraud perpetrated against the VAT system
involving a series of often non-existent transactions involving the
purported movement of goods and services within the EU’s single
market. At the outset of our inquiry, the Government were of the view
that VAT fraud was outside the scope of our investigations, but it was
clear from the evidence received that this remains a very significant
problem throughout the EU. The report is clear that the committee
understands the Government’s opposition to any EU measure or
action which would extend the EU’s competence into tax
enforcement in the UK, but we argue that this legitimate concern should
not allow fraud which diminishes the amount due to the EU to be ignored
or not pursued with vigour. We have our doubts that existing EU
measures are tackling this problem and, therefore, the report called on
the Government to suggest alternative robust measures to combat VAT
fraud. In their response the Government reassured us that they are
fully committed to fighting VAT fraud and that it is “pursued
with vigour” by HMRC. Perhaps the Minister will confirm what
that figure will be. We do not doubt their determination, but are the
Government sure that the other member states’ authorities pursue
this problem with similar enthusiasm and
vigour?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000057">The
committee considered the quality of the EU’s current
institutional framework for dealing with fraud. We found that
OLAF—the EU’s anti-fraud body— 
<?notus-xml column=178?>remains an agency of limited powers. Budgetary restrictions force it to
be selective about the cases it pursues. We are concerned that if OLAF
were to be seen as a body whose recommendations are never followed up
by the individual member states which lack enthusiasm in dealing with
EU fraud, its effectiveness will be questionable. We also fear that the
relationship between the EU’s crime-fighting
agencies—Europol, Eurojust and OLAF—as currently
constituted represents a tangled web which undermines any co-ordinated
response to fraud on the EU’s finances.</hs_para>

given that it was repeatedly proposed as a solution to the problems
inherent in the EU’s anti-fraud system, the report briefly
addressed the then unpublished proposal for a European Public
Prosecutor’s Office. This was brought forward by the Commission
in July, and we issued a reasoned opinion challenging the proposal on
subsidiarity grounds. We concluded the report by asking the Government
how they would propose tackling the flaws identified in our report
without participating in the European Public Prosecutor’s Office
proposal. We have as yet not received a satisfactory reply to that
question and would be grateful if the Minister could address the issue
in his
reply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000059">While
combating fraud in the EU’s finances may pose unique challenges
for both the EU’s institutions and individual member states,
protecting the public purse in these difficult economic times remains
the responsibility of us all, as we say in the opening chapter of the
report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:29:59"></hs_TimeCode>. Those of
us committed to countering negative public scepticism about EU
institutions also have every interest in a more vigorous approach to

am delighted that the House, albeit eight months after publication, now
has the opportunity to debate this report. I will emphasise a few
points, although they have been covered very adequately by my noble
friend. I particularly regret the rejection by Her Majesty’s
Government of the suggestion that one department have overall
responsibility for ensuring that the fight against fraud is kept to the
forefront of everyone’s attention. I note from the response that
the Government believe that individual departments are best placed to
detect, prevent and rectify fraud or irregularities and that reducing
this to a single department would lead to duplication and slow down the
process. Of course, the report did not advocate that but rather that
one department should have responsibility for co-ordinating the efforts
of each. While we understand a lack of knowledge of the
amount of undetected fraud, 
<?notus-xml column=179?>it is less understandable why, in evidence, the
Government were unable to give us a total figure for
detected
fraud.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000062">We
also advocated one point of contact between OLAF and the United
Kingdom. The Government highlighted the difficulties of different
jurisdictions within the United Kingdom. However, that should not
create a problem. This is still one country with a national Government.
There could well be a single point of contact. What happens thereafter
would and should remain a matter for the relevant devolved
Administrations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000063">We
are also well aware of the Government’s position on the European
Public Prosecutor’s Office. Indeed, the Committee and the House
made their position on that clear. I do not know whether the present
proposal will go ahead under enhanced co-operation but the
recommendation in the report urged the Government to make clear what
proposals they would bring forward to tackle this problem. Like my
noble friend Lord Stoneham, I ask the Minister to explain
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000064">We
were singularly disappointed by the apparent lack of engagement by the
Government and HMRC in the course of this inquiry and report. That
appeared to stem from the belief—a proper one—that
matters of taxation are the exclusive prerogative of the member states.
However, protecting one’s turf should not exclude recognition of
a problem or the search for a solution. That I felt particularly true
of the problem of VAT fraud and its international elements, coupled
with the complicated and some may say tenuous connection between VAT
gathered and money due to the European Union. It seemed and still seems
to be an area of legitimate inquiry for the committee. That view was
confirmed when the Minister told us, “Oh, it was only a very
small proportion of the money that went to the European Union compared
with VAT totals as a whole”. That small sum was £2
billion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000065">The

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Bowness, who was the chairman, and his sub-committee
on their decision to focus on this extremely pertinent matter and on
the thoroughness of their engagement in this revealing inquiry. I also
take the opportunity to welcome my noble friend Lady Morgan to the
Front Bench on a European issue. It is the first time I have had the
privilege of standing beside her or behind her on a European subject on
which she has been leading for my
party<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:37:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000069">Three
particularly striking and salient points emerge from this report. The
first relates to the amount of fraud. The Commission suggests that
fraud was running at €400 million in 2011—I have taken
this figure from the report—which would be 0.28% of the current
budget of the EU. That is a very low figure indeed. The committee
obviously thinks that that is an understatement and has decided that it
wants to multiply that to produce a figure that corresponds to the
fraud estimated to exist in this country as a proportion of its public
expenditure. It came up with figure roughly 10 times greater
than the commission has
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:38:26"></hs_TimeCode>. It
does not have any reason for that particular multiple and it may be
that the truth lies between those two figures. However, what is
inconsistent with the picture given by this report is the notion, which
is purveyed the whole time in Eurosceptic propaganda, that the European
Union is a sink of iniquity in terms of fraud. Clearly the level of
fraud is, at worst, comparable with the level of fraud in this country.
That is a bad situation. All fraud is regrettable and must be dealt
with thoroughly. It should be of particular concern to parliamentarians
because it is our job to monitor the performance of governance in this
area.
Nevertheless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:39:18"></hs_TimeCode>,
the figures before us will be quite surprising for the British public,
who are used to being fed the propaganda line by the media in this
country that the level of fraud in the EU is vastly greater than here.
Some of the analogies that the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, has cited
about British government departments’ records in that area
reinforce
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000070">The
second matter is very salient. It is quite clear that the overwhelming
majority of fraud, perhaps 99%, arises in the area where national
Governments are disbursing EU programmes. It does not arise in the
institutions of the Union where fraud is an extremely rare event. That
is even more striking in relation to the false propaganda that I
referred to. There is an irony here because the Eurosceptic lobby in
this country, which is very powerful, as we know, always makes out 
<?notus-xml column=181?>that this fraud is a consequence of too much European integration and is
part of the evil of European integration or, they would say, the evil
of European federalism. In actual fact, ironic as it is, it
is quite clear from these figures and from the reality of the position
that the reverse is true. If in fact these programmes were all run by
the European Commission with disbursements under the CAP, the
structural funds or the cohesion funds and were the responsibility of
European officials, there would not be anything like the same kind of
problem. There would be vastly less fraud. The problem is that the
national states are disbursing this money, and it is in the national
states that the losses, fraud and corruption occur, in some nation
states much more spectacularly than in others. I shall come on to that
in a moment.</hs_para>

is not evidence of an excess of federalism in the European Union but an
argument for an insufficient degree of federalism in the European
Union. I do not suggest for a moment that it is practical to have all
the community budget disbursed by an enlarged Commission. In the United
States, a lot of federal programmes are actually run by the individual
states, and they are responsible for making disbursements under those
programmes. Nevertheless, that is a very important and authoritative
corrective to the prevailing and utterly false impression given in this
country quite cynically by the media purveying a picture that is the
exact obverse of the
truth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000072">The
third salient point that emerges very strikingly from this report is
that there have been quite serious impediments in some of the member
states in following up on allegations of fraud or prima facie evidence
of fraud that have been brought to their attention by OLAF. I refer
noble Lords to the very interesting Table 1 on Page 29 of the report.

shows the number of referrals by OLAF of prima facie evidence of fraud.
All the columns are interesting but for the sake of brevity I switch
right away to the far right-hand column which shows the level of
convictions. Noble Lords will see that for all 27 member
states—there were 27 at that time—there were 199
convictions out of 1,030 referrals. I calculate that as being roughly
18%. That is the average. One sees immediately that the United Kingdom
is slightly below that. I calculate that figure as being about 15%; so
in this country we are not quite as good as the average. The worst
performers are Italy, Poland and Greece, which all have a record of
about 6% or 7% of convictions in relation to the number of referrals.
Far and away the star performer is Germany, with almost 40% of
referrals resulting in convictions.</hs_parafo>

organisation involving people who will be working on different cases
involving different fraud allegations in different parts of the Union
at any one time, so one can assume that their standard of performance
and the solidity of the cases that they make will be the same
irrespective of the member state where the fraud happens to have
occurred. That means that there is an enormous discrepancy in the
extent to which these allegations of fraud are followed up. That is a
very serious matter for EU taxpayers as a whole. The question is: what
do we do about it?</hs_para>

is what they are paid to do and it is what we expect a Government to do

chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, for all that he did. I also
thank our senior legal adviser Mike Thomas, ably supported by Messrs

noble Lord, Lord Davies, said, the subject of fraud in the European
Union is enough to get everyone excited, not only the Eurosceptics but
also those who consider the UK to be free of blame and squeaky clean.
The fact is that fraud exists everywhere: not just abroad but in this
Palace, in the City and in businesses all over the country. Noble Lords
will remember that one of the biggest frauds occurred in the al-Yamamah
contract. After that was investigated by the SFO and discussed at
length in Parliament, it was abruptly hushed up by the then
Attorney-General in the public interest. Of course, that was all about
a princely sum, even for a prince, and it was assumed by most people
that it was the way things worked in Saudi Arabia. But no: the SFO
calmly and correctly reminded us that there are two parties to every
contract who shared responsibility equally. That is worth mentioning in
this
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000080">This
country is in no position to complain about the European Union or other
EU states. In fact, if our consultants wish to teach anti-corruption
measures to developing countries, as they do daily around the world,
they may be qualified to do so but they cannot expect countries such as
Kenya and Afghanistan to look up to us as angels of accountability. We
may be higher in the transparency index but we are all in the mud
together. The Commission protests that fraud in the EU is no worse than
fraud in the member states and it is right that there always seems to
be a presumption of member state innocence. The EU institutions usually
get blamed for the failure to prosecute when in fact it is more likely
to be the individual country concerned. As our report states,
responsibility for avoiding fraud does not rest solely with the
Commission. The treaties require both the EU institutions and the
member states to counter fraud affecting the financial interests of the
EU.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000081">There
are, of course, recent examples of general fraud in both the EU and
national Parliaments, and the issue can lead to strong emotions. In
some cases, it can come to blows; last June, an Italian MEP called
Raffaele Baldassarre was caught red-handed on YouTube entering a lift
in the European Parliament. He proceeded, on camera, to box the Dutch
journalist who was accusing him of fraud. Astonishingly, in southern
Europe, the public do not always notice when their representatives are
accused of fraud. There was another case, which I shall not go into, of
a Maltese MEP who faced criminal charges for alleged fraud over three
years. This was uncovered by the anti-fraud office,
OLAF.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000082">That
brings me to one of our main recommendations, that while OLAF itself
needs to improve its act and protests that it is already doing so,
member states must give more support to OLAF, including taking
the  
<?notus-xml column=184?>decision to prosecute. We were told that, in principle, to investigate a
case of fraud against the EU budget, OLAF is supposed to request
information from the judiciary in the member state involved. As the
noble Lord, Lord Davies, said, one of our key witnesses, Rosalind
Wright QC, said that judiciaries in member states
are,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="131211117000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000159">“in

heard from Professor Spencer and others that, even after an
investigation, OLAF has no powers to compel member states to act. Some
call it toothless—but that is just the point. It was a conscious
decision of the member states not to give it those powers. Because of
this, at €404 million in 2011, the total amount of fraud is
being wholly underestimated by the
Commission.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="131211117000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000083">The
Government’s response throws doubt on the estimates of €5
billion, although they are derived from National Fraud Authority
figures. As the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, said, in explaining the
difficulty of estimating the amount, the Government say that the
Commission’s database is constantly being updated and that it
makes no distinction between “suspected and established
fraud”. Irregularities are sometimes included and sometimes not.
Again, if we and other member states are reluctant to investigate, we
are never going to find out how serious the problem is; we are just
going round in
circles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000084">Communications
with OLAF have been inadequate, to say the least, and what we call a
lack of enthusiasm all round for reporting fraud is, to me, the most
serious issue. A related problem for OLAF is that there is no single
point of contact in the UK Government and very likely not in other
Governments either. The Commission’s response agrees with our
analysis, saying that member states have a continuing duty to provide
the information. The Commission refers to the recent tightening of the
system through new investigative procedures, mentioning a new
regulation establishing a clearer legal framework. Her Majesty’s
Government’s comment is that “progress is being
made”. We shall hear in a minute what that
means.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000085">The
Commission invests rather a lot of hope in establishing an EPPO, which
it conceives as a “decentralised structure” integrated
into the national judiciaries. We all hope that that will never
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000086">On
the question of a UK focal point, the Commission says that there must
be a national body designated to co-ordinate what it calls anti-fraud
co-ordination services, which will strengthen the co-operation between
OLAF and member states. Perhaps the Minister will update us on the
likelihood of any such co-ordinated service in the UK, and on any
further conversations between the Home Office, the City of London
police and others
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000087">The
Government’s response merely says that there is room for
improvement; it quite reasonably rejects the idea of a new department,
mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, but it seems to me and to
him that we are putting off the more fundamental question of
co-ordination—unless the Minister proves us

identification of problems and the practicality of solutions to them. I
was also minded to think that many empires have fallen because they
were top heavy. Today we know very many things and how to do them; in

considering the report, I wondered: where do we, the United Kingdom,
rightly come into this picture? The report says with great accuracy
that fraud is opaque. As the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, said, it is
also endemic. It does not matter what we are going to do, it will not
disappear, because human nature is best seen as a constant. Therefore,
the first question that we might ask is: how many programmes do we
want? What level of expenditure within those programmes do we want?
What complexity do we want those programmes to have? What are we
actually trying to do with them? If we had fewer programmes we would
have less fraud. The more complex the programmes are, the greater the
army of people. I have applied for European money in the past, and the
number of people who will advise you on how to knock down that money
from the tree is legion. It is a profession—and, of course,
those people could be doing something else, perhaps adding more value.
So is that the right use of resources? We should think rather more
seriously about the objectives we are looking
for<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:58:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

another danger and another question. Are we right to be judging others
by ourselves? Almost certainly not. The Commission, after all, is sui
generis, and I join others in saying that there is absolutely no point
in being highly critical of the Commission because there is fraud
against its programmes. That does not make any sense at all. I
completely agree with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:58:41"></hs_TimeCode>. Then we
think about the members, their objectives, the reasons why they are
members in the first place and their capacity to implement programmes.
If they take advice, which they do, there are many imaginative ways of
providing that advice. That imagination can extend into how you spend
the money, as well as how you get it in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:59:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the uncertainty in the figures. My question is: what do you do
about the situation? What is the United Kingdom’s contribution 
<?notus-xml column=186?>to wise implementation of answers to these problems? When there are
problems there is always a temptation to design new institutions or
seek more legal procedures. However, in my experience, for all the
people who claim to have a good plan to do this or that, few could
implement such a plan if it were put into place. Therefore, for me, it
is important to implement measures within the existing systems. How can
we make the existing structures work better? Reference has been made to
OLAF and I completely agree that there is a pressing need to co-operate
and exchange data. Whether it is sensible to have that channelled into
one place, I leave to others to decide. If people are willing to work
with and talk to one another, we do not necessarily need just one focal
point.</hs_para>

I am certain: that is, in the difficult circumstances that pertain,
particularly within the eurozone, we need to work with what we have. I
do not see any future in having new centralised institutions. As for
the United Kingdom, we should cope better than we do with any fraud
that is perpetrated here. We should seek to minimise fraud and
prosecute those committing it. As regards cross-border fraud, we should
offer others maximum co-operation, but seeking a centralised, European
Union-wide silver bullet to solve these problems will not work and we
should not contemplate

Rowlands (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, while I have listened to the
debate I have tried to recall the evidence we received and the
witnesses we heard. I regret to say that my abiding impression of the
evidence we took and the witnesses we heard was that there was a kind
of collective buck-passing going on and that no one was willing to
accept responsibility. Everybody said that they hated fraud and that it
was a serious issue, but you did not sense that dealing with it was a
priority for any of the institutions. I do not know whether other
members of the committee were left with that
impression<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:02:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000095">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:04:33"></hs_TimeCode>
report found a lack of enthusiasm, a lack of uniformity of approach and
weakness in the ability of OLAF to fulfil its remit. The noble Lord,
Lord Bowness, reminded us of the rather extraordinary day when we
witnessed a kind of internal warfare going on before our very eyes. I
hope to goodness that when the Minister replies to the debate, he will
reassure us that OLAF has got over that spat. This lack of
co-ordination and enthusiasm are partly reflected in the incredible
divergence of assessment in relation to the size of the fraud, which
reflects the fact that there is no collective grappling with this
problem. Incidentally, there is no lack of activity on this issue. I
calculated that no fewer than 13 documents and legislative proposals
dealing with various aspects of fraud were presented to our committee.
It is not a question of lack of activity on the part of the Commission
or anyone else but rather, it seems to me, a lack of effective
follow-up, and of matching that activity with effective operational
action on the ground across the
piece<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:03:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000096">There
have been suggestions about reforming OLAF and Eurojust, and my noble
friend Lord Davies mentioned the EPPO. The committee did not, and has
not, endorsed 
<?notus-xml column=187?>the concept of the EPPO. I am sure that he did not intend to create the
impression that it had. It did not endorse that concept in the report
and has not undertaken a full inquiry into it. I hope that noble Lords
do not have the impression that it has endorsed that concept. That is
certainly not the case. Of course since we did our report, the
Commission has come forward with a proposal. I am afraid to say that,
as it was brought forward, it certainly would not have gained my
support in any shape or form; I am not sure about other members of the
committee. I shall tell my noble friend why. First, this House, the
other House and indeed 11 Parliaments found the
Commission’s EPPO proposal offensive to the whole principle of
subsidiarity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000097">It
is not only that. I have one other suggestion why the
Commission’s proposal is fundamentally flawed, and it is exactly
one of the points that my noble friend made. The draft seeks to propose
exclusive criminal jurisdiction to one office, seeking to override
national needs and priorities. I am afraid that that does not make any
sense. As my noble friend rightly points out, 80% of the budget is
delivered at national level. It cannot be the exclusive criminal
jurisdiction of one new office to deal with the issue, when in fact the
disbursement of such money is overwhelmingly conducted at national
level. It has to be a shared responsibility with shared co-operation.
Indeed, the treaty obliges the Commission and member states to deal
with this
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:06:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, rather than looking for a solution in a brand new, single
office of the kind my noble friend obviously rather likes, I would look
for an alternative form of enforced shared co-operation between
institutions, governments and national and European agencies. That is
where the future solution to these problems
lies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:06:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that, within those improvements that we should have in co-operation and
shared responsibility, and within our own arrangements, is the question
of having a single agency or point of contact. Interestingly, over a
year ago in the evidence that we received, there was a volunteer:
Commissioner Leppard of the City of London Police volunteered to be the
first point of contact, as members might recall. Indeed, in his
evidence, he said that his force was in discussion with the Home Office
to develop the concept of the first point of contact being the City
police. That was November 2012. We are a year on. How much progress has
been made? Is the proposal still considered significant? How far have
we got with it? If we have got very little from it, it will only
reflect what we all fear: that there is not a willingness to carry some
of the reforms and changes

specific proposal was put on the table just over 12 months
ago—one organisation saying, “We will be the only point
of contact to co-ordinate activities, including the devolved
Administrations”.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:08:34"></hs_TimeCode> the
Minister comes to reply I would be grateful if he would tell us how far
that proposal has gone. I would judge the success of the changes that
have occurred by our doing at least the one thing that we can do
ourselves: to decide on one single point at which the co-ordination of
these activities takes place. If we do not do that, we will not be seen
as combating European
fraud<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:08:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Morgan of Ely (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Stoneham, for his introduction. I also thank the committee for its
work not just on this report, but over many decades. The reputation of
this committee is second to none. Certainly during my years on the
budget control committee in the European Parliament, we used to look
forward to giving evidence to your committee because we knew that there
would be a thorough investigation, with sophisticated understanding of
the complexities of the way in which EU finance works—so I feel
privileged to speak in front of you
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:09:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000101">The
clamour for change and the screaming headlines against the EU when the
Court of Auditors published its annual report were things we learnt to
live with on an annual basis. I learned then—this is underlined
in the report—that the picture is much more complicated. There
needs to be a better understanding than the one those screaming
headlines
suggested<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:09:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000102">We
need to be absolutely clear of what we are talking about when we
discuss fraud. The Court of Auditors first takes sample payment
transactions in the EU at EU level, national level, regional level and
even down to individual beneficiary level. Any errors found in these
audits are classified as either quantifiable—which means there
is a potential impact—or not. The impact rate of the error is
then extrapolated to reach a most likely error rate. That then applies
to each department, and then to the budget as a whole. It is completely
different from the way in which we do things in Britain and that is
probably part of the reason for the
misunderstanding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:10:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000103">We
should be clear that those error rates cannot simply be translated into
an amount lost. Let me give an example. If you have a tender process to
build a road and someone completed the forms in a way which did not
comply with all the rules, that does not mean that the road was not
built or that you did not get value for money; it means that the forms
were not completed in the correct way. That would be counted as a
problem; it would be put into the figures as
problematic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:11:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000104">As
the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, reminded us, 80% of finance is
controlled by member states. In fact, the money never leaves Britain.
It does not go to the EU and come back; it never leaves Britain.
Therefore it is expected that member states should put systems in place
to protect the EU’s financial
interests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:11:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000105">It
is also worth noting that the Court of Auditors has signed off the EU
account for the sixth year in succession. It has given a clean bill of
health to the Commission’s accounting books. That means that
every euro spent from the EU budget was duly recorded in the books and
properly accounted for. However, for payments the court requires an
error rate of less than 2% before the EU budget can be declared to be
free from material error. At the moment the error rate is below 5% but,
as it is not close enough to that 2% , it will not sign off the
payments
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:12:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000106">Turning
to the subject of the report, deliberate fraud is different from
errors. It constitutes a criminal action and has to be dealt with
severely. The question 
<?notus-xml column=189?>being asked in the report is whether the systems and mechanisms that are
in place are adequate to measure fraud and defend the EU against it. Is
the UK taking up that responsibility and policing this area
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:12:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000107">The
recommendations made in the report seem eminently sensible. The
proposals to establish a government agency or department to take
overall responsibility and for OLAF, the anti-fraud unit of the EU, to
have one point of contact make sense. OLAF did not exist when I was in
the European Parliament but was set up while I was there. I can assure
noble Lords that there was a great deal of in-fighting when it was set
up, but I hope things have settled down since
then<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:13:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000108">It
makes sense to have one point of contact. I was a member of the Budget
Control Committee in 1999 when the Commission was forced to resign in
response to the failure to take seriously the matter of fraud against
the EU budget. The subsequent report written by the wise men suggested
that it was impossible to find anyone, at any level, in the Commission
to take responsibility. That phrase stood out to everyone. My concern
is that having sat in the European Parliament for 10 or 15 years
considering this issue and hearing that it is up to the member states
to do something about it, I do not want to come back to the UK and
hear, “It is not our problem. It is a difficulty for the EU. We
all have to work
together”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000109">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:14:23"></hs_TimeCode>
falling between two stools is the problem here. It is a fate that we
must avoid in the UK. Knowing who is responsible for collecting and
collating information and where the buck stops is fundamental to good
governance. I take issue with the suggestion that the multiple
jurisdictions of the UK provide a block to this. We manage to organise
this for every other aspect of the EU’s relationship with the
UK, so why not in the area of
fraud?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000110">Of
course, the amount of fraud is by its nature difficult to quantify, so
the Commission’s figures are only estimates, but it seems that
there is a lack of enthusiasm to engage with the detection and
reporting of fraud against the EU. This is underlined by the fact that
the Commission has reported a very low number of irregularities as
fraudulent in the UK, which has a relatively high EU spending rate
compared with other member states, suggesting a degree of
non-compliance with reporting principles. Will the Minister therefore
explain what control systems and mechanisms are being put in place to
detect fraud, in particular in the higher risk
areas?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000111">It was
extremely disappointing that the Government did not answer the issue of
VAT fraud against the EU budget seriously. Of course, a larger
proportion of VAT goes to member states, but the contribution to the
EU’s budget is fundamental. The figure of £2
billion that was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, is
fundamental to the revenue stream of the EU. Carousel fraud is not
insignificant. While nobody is suggesting that the EU should extend its
competence into tax enforcement, it is entirely legitimate for the
Commission to question member states on their pursuit of this fraud
which has a material effect on the Commission’s
budget.</hs_para>

fraud remains a national matter, and while the UK does not want to sign
up to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, I question
whether we take our responsibilities seriously in terms of prosecuting
fraud against the EU budget. I remember on several occasions hearing
how OLAF investigations were passed on to member states but were not
pursued with any vigour in the member state. We heard evidence from
some very senior British police enforcement representatives who
suggested that although they understood their responsibilities, they
had an inbox full of domestic crimes and targets on specific crimes
that they had to meet so, somehow or other, EU fraud cases always
seemed to find their way to the bottom of the in-tray. What is the
Government’s target for prosecution? We have heard that 18% are
prosecuted. What is the target? That seems to be a way to get this to
the top of the in-tray of those police enforcement
agencies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000113">Finally,

finances.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131211117000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000115">It
may be blindingly obvious, but I start by saying that the Government
also take fraud and the management of taxpayers’ funds very
seriously. We have adopted an increasingly robust stance on financial
management, and we remain committed to securing and enforcing the most
effective means of fighting fraud at both a national and EU level.
Fraud against the EU budget remains a matter of great concern, and this
Government have adopted a leading role in calling for improvements to
the way EU finances are managed.</hs_para>

that we are the first Government to take a firm stance on fraud against
the EU budget by voting against the Council’s decision to
recommend discharging the Commission of its responsibility to manage
the EU budget. We took a stand by abstaining on the Council position on
discharge of the 2009 EU budget and increased the pressure by voting
against the Council’s recommendation to discharge in 2010 and
2011. We have also continued to encourage like-minded, budget
disciplinarian member states to join us in sending the strongest
possible message that financial management needs to be improved. In
2010 and 2011, Sweden and the Netherlands joined the UK in voting
against the Council’s discharge recommendations and issued a
joint statement calling for improvements to the way EU funds are
managed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131211117000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000117">We
have also been at the forefront of the drive for real changes to
improve errors within EU budget expenditure. For example, in the light
of the European Court of Auditors’ reports confirming that much
of the expenditure error is due to excessively complex rules, the
Government successfully worked with allies to push for the significant
simplification of the complex rules for beneficiaries of EU funds. I
note what the 
<?notus-xml column=191?>noble Lord, Lord Bowness, said about it being disappointing that the
Court of Auditors has been unable to provide a positive statement of
assurance for the most recent budget, as has been the case for a number
of years. The noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Ely, explained why it is
quite difficult to get to the necessary level of assurance. As the
noble Lord reminded us, and as I have, over the years, reminded
Eurosceptics within your Lordships’ House, it is a very long

the Government replied to the report in July, the Financial Secretary

Lords raised concern over the estimated level of fraud against the EU
budget. The Government appreciate that the Commission’s
assessment of the amount of fraud against the EU budget is an estimate
and cannot give a full picture, by which I mean that the real level of
fraud is necessarily going to be higher than the figure that it has
produced. In order to get more nearly to a figure, it is therefore
important to ensure that the quality and consistency of reporting by
all member states is of a standard that allows the Commission to
receive accurate information upon which to base its estimate.</hs_para>

that other contributing factors, such as the constant updating of the
database, are resolved to improve the data that the Commission receives
and holds. The noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Ely, explained some of
the complexity of the process, and although it is very easy to damn it
on the basis that it should be possible to sort this out, in practice
it is extremely difficult in a 27-member Union to get the kind of
consistency and quality of reporting that gives us absolute confidence
that the final correct figure has been reached. As the recipient of
reporting information from member states, the Government believe that
the Commission is best placed to provide such a clear estimate, but
more work needs to be
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000121">I am
sorry that the committee finds the Government’s decision not to
recognise its estimate of actual fraud disappointing, but we maintain
the view expressed by the Financial Secretary in his substantive
response. I have a lot of sympathy with the noble Viscount, Lord
Eccles, who said that we should not get excited about the absolute
estimate of fraud but should worry much more substantively about
bearing down on
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000122">With that
that in mind, I turn to our reporting of fraud against the budget. The
Government remain committed to this work and do not accept the view
that we are lacking in enthusiasm or drive in our approach to tackling
such fraud. In line with existing reporting obligations, the Government
rigorously collate comprehensive data on fraud and consistently report
them to the Commission.</hs_para>

committee’s report, the UK does not have a central department or
agency responsible for the fight against fraud. Individual departments
and agencies are responsible for monitoring and acting 
<?notus-xml column=192?>on fraud against the EU funds they receive and spend. This does not
demonstrate a lack of commitment or dedicated resource but reflects the
UK’s national arrangements for handling EU funds. When one is
talking about funds being spent by Administrations in Northern Ireland
and Scotland, it is natural for them to be contacting the EU directly
with information. Furthermore, the Government have a new approach to
fraud because the creation of the National Crime Agency has given us
the opportunity to pull expertise in anti-fraud work into a dedicated
Economic Crime Command. The ECC will work closely with national police
forces and partners, as well as with the EU and international
equivalents. However, the Government remain of the view that the
Commission, as the recipient and collator of fraud statistics, is best
placed to provide a breakdown of fraud at an EU level and within
individual member states. I shall come back to the question of the
single point of contact.</hs_para>

Lords raised the issue of VAT fraud, which has been and remains a
significant problem. It is, however, worth pointing out that since
2005-06 NTIC fraud estimates have decreased from between £3
billion and £4 billion to around £1 billion in 2011-12,
which demonstrates that effort has been put in to tackle this very
serious, arguably the single biggest, area of EU fraud that affects the
UK. We have had a significant positive impact.</hs_para>

forms of fraud, which is why in the 2010 spending review HMRC was
allocated an additional £917 million to help it recover unpaid
tax and excise duties in the next four years, of which some £90
million is being spent on tackling organised criminal attacks, and we
have had some significant successes. Further, the number of criminal
prosecutions across a range of taxes, including VAT, is to be increased
fivefold. I am not sure that that is quite the target that the noble
Baroness was looking for, but it is an indication of the
Government’s ambition in this area. However, it is clear that
VAT fraud is not solely a concern for the UK and, noting the
committee’s concern and points raised by noble Lords, I can
confirm that we encourage other member states to maintain the pressure
to reduce VAT fraud within their jurisdictions with the same enthusiasm
and vigour that we employ.</hs_para>

engagement with the European anti-fraud office, OLAF. It is clear that
its success relies on effective co-operation with partners in member
states, third countries, international organisations and EU
institutions. The Government fully cooperate with OLAF’s work in
the UK. Its efforts to detect and tackle fraud, including through
seeking financial redress for the EU budget where possible, is highly
important to us. The UK, through the National Crime Agency, provides a
number of UK-wide liaison services and is taking steps to improve our
engagement with Europol, Eurojust and OLAF. This includes, through the
NCA, providing bureau services to Europol and Interpol and being home
to the UK Financial Intelligence Unit. It does this through the Europol
national unit, which is based in the UK International Crime Bureau of
the NCA and is supported by the UK national unit based in The Hague.
The ENU provides a channel for all UK law enforcement engagement with
Europol. The Government believe that the NCA’s work with 
<?notus-xml column=193?>these agencies and services, including Eurojust, Europol and OLAF, will
strengthen co-operation with our European and international partners to
fight cross-border
fraud.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000127">I

on to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Government
accept that multijurisdictional crime against the EU budget is European
in nature but believe, as noble Lords pointed out, that an EPPO is not
the only or the right solution to the problem. The noble Lord, Lord
Rowlands, gave some of the arguments for that, but I repeat our view: a
centralised European prosecutor with harmonised powers to initiate
investigations and order investigative measures is incompatible with
the division of responsibilities in many EU countries where law
enforcement and prosecutors have different roles from that of the
independent judiciary. As such, it would require fundamental changes to
those member states’ legal systems and existing operational
structures to implement the Commission’s vision of a
supranational body with powers of investigation or prosecution within
UK
jurisdiction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000131">The
Committee asked how the UK would address the shortcomings in existing
processes for tackling fraud in the absence of being a participating
member of the EPPO. The Government will continue to focus on preventing
and tackling fraud against the budget and draw on their new approach to
policing fraud. On the response to identified crimes, the Serious Fraud
Office uses a similar model to the EPPO by bringing prosecutors and
police together to fight serious fraud but there are differences. There
are limits to the SFO’s statutory investigative powers but the
existence of the SFO at national level is evidence of a domestic model
that is similar to the EPPO proposal. Further, the creation of the
National Crime Agency’s Economic Crime Command means that we
have an opportunity to pull expertise in anti-fraud work into a
dedicated policing unit. The ECC will work closely with national police
forces and partners as well as the EU and international
equivalents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000132"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Davies of Stamford" PimsId="5785" UID="131211117000187" xid="2057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000187"><B>Lord
Davies of </B><B>Stamford</B><B>:</B></Member> I am grateful to the
Minister for giving way. If, as on the Minister’s own admission,
the Serious Fraud Office and the ECC 
<?notus-xml column=194?>have structures that are very similar to the proposed EPPO in that they
combine investigative and prosecuting functions, what is the
ideological objection to accepting the EPPO? It appears that we have
already accepted that those two functions should be shared by the same
agency. The Minister will know that there is no suggestion that the
courts—the judicial function—should be combined with the
EPPO. The EPPO having decided to prosecute would have to do so in front
of judges who would be quite independent from
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131211117000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000133"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="131211117000188" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-gc0001.htm#131211117000188"><B>Lord

think<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T18:34:59"></hs_TimeCode> that the
noble Lord is slightly confused about the difference between a
political decision and a sensible decision. Just because something is
in a political agreement does not mean that there are not very serious
substantive reasons for it, apart from any reasons that he would

extremely unfortunate dispute that has arisen, and there is a limited
amount that the UK Government can do on their own to resolve it. We
accept that the Supervisory Committee has an important role but,
equally, it is important that it does not operate in such a way as to
impede OLAF’s work. We are trying as best we can not to knock
heads together—that is perhaps too strong—but to use what
influence we have to get these two bodies to work together. It is
extremely depressing to read that part of the committee’s report

final issue that I want to address, which the noble Baroness raised, is

be in a position to offer the relevant scrutiny committees a fuller

2011 this Government published the Multilateral Aid Review (MAR)
– the first systematic assessment of the performance of the 43
multilateral organisations that the UK supports through core funding.
The MAR is a central part of our wider efforts to ensure that we
scrutinise the value for money of each pound we spend, whether we do so
directly or through other organisations. Our efforts in this area were
recognised by the PAC who gave us their Civil Service Award for the
most improved government body on value for money and financial
management in 2013. Other donor countries have emulated our
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121183000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131211-wms0001.htm#13121183000084">The
findings of the Review confirmed the important role multilateral
organisations play in supporting the UK to meet its development and
humanitarian objectives—delivering humanitarian support in
countries affected by conflict such as Syria or by natural disasters
such as the Philippines, on promoting the rights of women and girls,
and in ensuring that developing countries have the infrastructure they
need to support their economic growth. The Review also had a major
impact on our spending decisions. While some high performing
organisations received considerable increases in funding, some poor
performing institutions had their funding stopped altogether and others
were asked to make urgent reforms if they wished to secure any future
funding from DFID. The Review also highlighted the strengths and
weaknesses of multilateral organisations, and enabled us to give them a
clear list of future priorities and essential reforms.</hs_para>

undertaken to assess whether the multilateral organisations have made
the progress we asked for. The report being published today sets out
the results of this work. It shows that all of the multilaterals have
made improvements over the two years since the Multilateral Aid Review,
that those organisations we asked to make urgent reforms are 
<?notus-xml column=81?>making progress, and that some multilaterals which were already doing
well are doing even better. There have been significant improvements in
crucial areas such as the management of finances, and how organisations
work with others. This is encouraging, but more needs to be done. Not
all organisations made the progress we expected of them, and the
performance of some in critically important areas, such as the
empowerment of women and girls, could be improved.</hs_para>

International Development (DFID) remains committed to strengthening
multilateral effectiveness. Over the next year we will use the evidence
from this Update to work with multilaterals and other partners to bring
about further change. There will be a particular focus on areas where
progress has been too slow. We will also work with other governments to
ensure that the methodology and evidence base for future multilateral
effectiveness assessments continue to improve, providing a sound basis
for a full reassessment of the value for money that multilateral
organisations offer in 2015. In doing so, we will seek to address
issues raised with us by multilateral organisations, and in the

highlighted in the Programme. To encourage further action, we will
support change in a number of ways. For example, we will bring industry

amended as soon as reasonably possible thereafter on the same day

of the Act was delayed initially by work on other priorities and more
recently by the need to amend it. The principal aim of the proposed
