his issue and for raising this concern on behalf of her constituents
and others. Exclusivity was one of the issues we found in the
fact-finding exercise over the summer to be of real concern, so
that will be one of the issues that we will look at further in the
consultation. We will also consider whether the transparency of
information can be improved between employers and employees, so that
there is a bit more certainty about what is expected on both sides of
the contract. Used well, these contracts should provide flexibility in
our labour market that can benefit both employers and
employees.</hs_Para>

downsides of job insecurity. We already have robust data from the
workplace employment relations study, which gives us a strong base of
research on which to draw to understand those issues. However, I
gently point out to him that an increase in job insecurity
is related to the fact that we had a massive economic shock on his

importance to his constituents, as evidenced by the number of
signatories to the petition. He will know that short-break services are
a priority for this Government. We know how they support children with
disabilities and their families, which is why £800 million has
been made available to local authorities for short breaks and why we
have introduced a short-breaks duty requiring all local authorities to
provide such services for disabled children and young people. As my
hon. Friend will know, it is for local authorities to decide, in
collaboration with local health services, the level and type of support
they will make available. It is encouraging that the cabinet member for
Essex county council has given assurances that no final decision about
the centre’s future will be taken unless alternative services
are available that meet families’ needs. I hope that is of some
reassurance to my hon.

Lansley:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman will know that registration of
notice of manorial rights at the Land Registry is not related to rights
relating to shale gas or oil. The Petroleum Act 1988 vests all rights
to the nation’s petroleum resources in the Crown. Manorial
rights have a distinct legal history, but can be legitimately bought
and sold in the same way as other property rights. The registration of
notice of manorial rights records existing rights so that people know
they exist; it does not create new rights although it does, of course,
help prospective buyers avoid what would otherwise be hidden rights.
The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that property owners who were
unaware of existing mining rights when the notices arrived may have
been alarmed by that, but I recommend they obtain legal advice, which
should reassure them. If Members of the House have evidence of
problems, my hon. Friends at the Ministry of Justice will be happy to
help.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000294"><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Mosley" PimsId="5727" UID="13120554000978" xid="1045" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000978"><B>Stephen

Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr George Osborne):</Member></B>
Britain’s economic plan is working, but the job is not done. We
need to secure the economy for the long term, and the biggest risk to
that comes from those who would abandon the plan. We seek a responsible
recovery, one in which we do not squander the gains we have made, but
go on taking the difficult decisions, and one in which we do not repeat
the mistakes of the past, but this time spot the debt bubbles before
they threaten financial stability. We seek a responsible recovery, in
which we do not pretend we can make this nation better off by writing
cheques to ourselves, and instead make the hard choices. We need a
Government who live within their means, in a country that pays its way
in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000299">Three
and a half years ago, I set out our long-term economic plan in the
emergency Budget. That plan restored stability in a fiscal crisis, but
it was also designed to address the deep-seated problems of
unsustainable spending, uncompetitive taxes and unreformed public
services for which there are no quick fixes. Over the last three years
we have stuck to our guns and worked through the plan. We have done so
in the face of a sovereign debt crisis abroad, and at home in the face
of opposition from those who got Britain into this mess in the first
place and have resisted every cut, every reform, and every effort to
get us out of that mess. We have held our nerve while those who
predicted there would be no growth until we turned the spending taps
back on have been proved comprehensively wrong.</hs_Para>

sacrifice and endeavour of the British people, I can today report the
hard evidence that shows our economic plan is working, but I also
report the hard truth that the job is not yet done. Yes, the deficit is
down, but it is still far too high, and today we take more difficult
decisions. Yes, the forecasts show that growth is up, but the same
forecasts show growth in productivity is still too low, and today we
set out further economic reforms. Yes, jobs are up and unemployment is
down, but too many of our young people lack the skills to fill those
jobs and the opportunities to acquire them, so now we take bold steps
to remove that cap on aspiration. Yes, businesses are expanding, but
business taxes are still too high and exports are too low and we must
address that. And yes, real household disposable income is rising, but
the effects of the financial crash on family budgets and the cost of
living are still being felt. So where we can afford to help hardworking
families, we will continue to do
so—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I></hs_Para>

me turn to the report from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Again,
I thank Robert Chote and his team for their rigorous and independent
work. The  
<?notus-xml column=1102?>OBR report notes that the Office for National Statistics has reassessed
the depth of the great recession. The fall in GDP from peak to trough
between 2008 and 2009 was not 6.3% as previously thought, but was
instead an even more staggering 7.2%; £112 billion was wiped off
our economy—about £3,000 for every household in this
country—in one of the sharpest falls in the national income of
any economy in the world. That is a reminder of the economic calamity
that befell Britain and of the simple fact that our country remains
poorer as a result of it. A lot of work still remains to be done to put
that right. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:20:24"></hs_TimeCode>
data revisions also showed something else: there was no double-dip
recession.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120554000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000304"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me turn to the future. At the time of the Budget in March, the OBR
forecast that growth this year would be 0.6%. Today, it more than
doubles that forecast and the estimate for growth will be 1.4%. Next
year, instead of growth of 1.8%, it is now forecasting 2.4%. Faster
growth now means that it has revised the following four years to 2.2%,
2.6%, 2.7% and 2.7%, so growth over the forecast period is
significantly up. It is still not as strong as we would like it to be,
but this is the largest improvement to current year economic forecasts
at any Budget or autumn statement for 14 years. I can report that
Britain is currently growing faster than any other major advanced
economy: faster than France, which is contracting; faster than Germany;
and faster even than America. That contrast itself points to the risks
that remain for the UK from abroad, and the weakness of many of our
main trading
partners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:22:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000305">The
first risk the OBR identified to our economic recovery is a recurrence
of the damaging instability in the eurozone. Even with the relative
calm of recent months, the OBR still forecasts that the euro area as a
whole will shrink by 0.4% this year. Its growth forecasts for the US
and emerging markets have also been revised down, and world trade has
been weaker than it expected in March. While our exports are growing,
they are not growing as fast as we would like. That is because we are
too dependent on markets in Europe and north America. The Prime
Minister’s visit to China this week is the latest step in the
Government’s determined plan to increase British exports to the
faster growing emerging markets, something our country should have done
many years ago. Today, I am doubling to £50 billion the export
finance capacity available to support British businesses, expanding the
help available to firms in these emerging markets and ensuring that our
excellent new trade Minister, Lord Livingston, has all the firepower he
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:23:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000306">Let
me turn to the forecast for employment. Today in Britain, employment is
at an all-time high and the OBR has revised up its forecast for the
future. It was expecting jobs to stay flat over the year, but it now
expects the total number of jobs to rise by 400,000 this year. This is
being felt right across the country. Since 2010, the number of jobs in
Carlisle and on the Wirral, and from Selby to south Tyneside, have all
grown faster than in London. Meanwhile, the number of people claiming
unemployment benefit has fallen by more than 200,000 in the past six
months—the largest such fall for 16 years.
Unemployment is also lower than in 2010, and is forecast to fall
further from 7.6% this year to 7% in 2015, before falling even further
to 5.6% by 2018. We have the lowest proportion of workless households
for 17 years.</hs_Para>

were those who said it was a “fantasy” to believe that
businesses could create jobs more quickly than the public sector would
have to lose them. What they should have said was that it would be
fantastic if it happened. So I have good news for them. Businesses have
already created three jobs for every one lost in the public sector, and
the OBR report today forecasts that this will continue, with 3.1
million more jobs being created by businesses by 2019, which, in its
words, “more than offsets” the million or so
reduction in the public sector
headcount<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:25:05"></hs_TimeCode>. Far
from the mass unemployment predicted, we have a record number of people
in  work, hundreds of thousands fewer on welfare, and
unemployment lower than when we came to office, and we will have 2
million more jobs than in 2010—an economic plan that is working
and a Government who are seeking a job-rich recovery for
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:25:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000308">Let
me turn now to the forecasts for Government borrowing and debt. When
this Government came into office, the deficit was 11% of GDP. That was
the highest level in our peacetime history. One pound in every four was
being borrowed, and a former Chancellor and a former Prime Minister
have now joined the consensus that spending was too high. The borrowing
posed a huge risk to the economic stability and credibility of the
United Kingdom, and we have taken many difficult decisions to bring
that deficit down—every one contested and opposed.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120554000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000309"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:26:15"></hs_TimeCode>I
can report today, however, that the effort is paying off. The OBR uses
a measure of what it calls “underlying public sector net
borrowing”, which excludes the impact of the Royal Mail pension
scheme and asset purchase facility transfers. I can tell the House that
this underlying measure of the deficit, like the other deficit measure,
has been revised down substantially since March. From the 11% back in
2010, the underlying deficit now falls to 6.8% this year, instead of
the 7.5% the OBR forecast back in March. It then falls to 5.6% next
year, then 4.4%, 2.7% and, in 2017-18, 1.2%. By 2018-19, on this
measure, the OBR does not expect a deficit at all. Instead, it expects
Britain to run a small
surplus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:27:19"></hs_TimeCode>. These
numbers mean that the Government will meet their fiscal mandate to
bring the structural current budget into balance and meet it one year
early.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120554000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000310">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:27:30"></hs_TimeCode>
me turn to the forecasts for cash borrowing on this same underlying
basis. At the autumn statement last year, there were repeated
predictions that borrowing would go up. Instead, borrowing is
down—and down significantly more than was forecast. In their
last year in office, the previous Government borrowed £158
billion. This year, we will borrow £111 billion, which is
£9 billion less than was feared in March. That falls
next year to £96 billion, then down to £79 billion in
2015-16, £51 billion the year after and £23
billion the year after that. So we are set to borrow £73 billion
less over the period than was forecast in
March<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:28:20"></hs_TimeCode>. That
means that we are borrowing the equivalent of £2,500 less for
every household in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:28:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000311" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000311">In
2018-19, on this cash measure too, the OBR forecasts that the
Government will not have to borrow anything at all. Instead, we will
run a small cash surplus. Of course, this will only happen if we go on
working through our long-term plan, delivering the reductions in the
deficit we plan this year, next year and in the three 
<?notus-xml column=1104?>years after. If we gave up on the plan now, we would be saddled with a
deficit still among the highest in Europe, and the Government side of
the House is not prepared to take that risk.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120554000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000312">While the
deficit remains, it adds to our national debt every year. The OBR today
expects debt this year to come in at 75.5% of GDP, which is £18
billion lower than was forecast in March. It rises to 78.3% next year,
before peaking at 80% the next year—5% lower than forecast at
the Budget. In 2016-17, it then falls, albeit slightly, to 79.9%; then
falls again to 78.4% and then to 75.9%. By 2017-18, debt is over
£80 billion pounds lower than forecast in March. The
supplementary debt target is for debt to be falling in 2015-16. At the
Budget, the OBR forecast debt to be falling in 2017-18. It is now
forecast to fall in 2016-17, which is one year
earlier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000313">But
let me enter this note of caution. The OBR is clear that this is a
cyclical improvement. The forecast for the continuing fall in the
structural deficit has not improved. The structural deficit is the
borrowing that stays behind even when the economy improves. Thanks to
our actions, it has fallen from the 8.7% we inherited to 4.4%
today—more than in any other major advanced economy. It goes on
falling, but no faster than was previously expected because, as we have
always argued, the central task of reforming government and controlling
spending does not simply dissolve when growth returns. It supports the
case we have made all along that economic growth alone was never going
to be enough to repair Britain’s broken public finances. An
improving economy does not let us off the hook for taking the difficult
decisions to make sure that the Government live within their
means.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000314">The
single most important economic judgement I make today is this: we will
not let up in dealing with our country’s debts; we will not
spend the money from lower borrowing; we will not squander the
hard-earned gains of the British people. The stability and low mortgage
rates, the lower deficit and falling borrowing have been hard won by
this country, but let us be clear that they could easily be lost. That
is why we must work through our plan to secure the British economy for
the long
term.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000315">So
this autumn statement is fiscally neutral across the period. Indeed, I
can announce today that we will take three new steps to entrench
Britain’s commitment to sound public finances. First, we will
bring forward next year an updated charter for budget responsibility
and ask Parliament to support it. I can say today that both parties of
the coalition have agreed that we must ensure that debt continues to
fall as a percentage of GDP, including using surpluses in good years,
for this purpose. In other words, this time we will fix the roof when
the sun is
shining.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000316">We
will look to see whether the five-year time horizon of the fiscal
mandate could be shorter and even more binding now that the public
finances are closer to balance, and we will see how fiscal credibility
could be further enhanced by a stronger parliamentary commitment to the
path of consolidation already agreed for 2016-17 and 2017-18. The
answers will be written into an updated charter for budget
responsibility, which will be presented to Parliament a year from now
and voted
upon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0001.htm#13120554000317">The
second step we take today to entrench Britain’s commitment to
sound public finances is this: we will cap overall welfare spending.
Welfare budgets were 
<?notus-xml column=1105?>completely out of control when we came to office and the number of
households where no one had ever worked nearly doubled. We have taken
very difficult decisions to bring benefit bills down; we have
saved  £19 billion a year for the taxpayer. We need to

those who have worked hard all their lives because the costs on, say,
housing benefit for young people had got out of control.
That is not fair, so we will not include the state
pension, which is better controlled over a longer period. We will also
exclude from the cap the most cyclical of benefits for jobseekers. All
other benefits—from tax credits to income support to the vast

the beginning of each Parliament, the Chancellor of the day will set
the welfare cap for the coming years, and will ask the House of Commons
for its support. If the cap is breached, the Chancellor will have to
explain why, and hold a vote in the House. The principle is clear: the
Government have a responsibility to taxpayers to control their spending
on welfare, and Parliament has a responsibility to the country to hold
the Government to account for

brings me to our third step. Ultimately, the test of fiscal credibility
is whether you are prepared actually to make the difficult decisions
that will keep spending under control. Tight discipline means that most
Departments are now living well within their set budgets. This year
they are expected to underspend by £7 billion, which is
testimony to good financial management. We can therefore be confident
in reducing the contingency reserve by £1 billion this year, and
reducing departmental budgets by a similar amount in the next two
years. That will save a further £3 billion in total. The
protections for the NHS and schools will apply, and the security and
intelligence agencies and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will
be exempt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>. The

further £2.95 a week. That increase, and the other increases
that have been made under this Government, mean that pensioners will be
more than £800 better off every year. I can announce that we are
also going to offer current pensioners an opportunity to make voluntary
national insurance contributions to boost their income in retirement,
and that we will extend that opportunity to those who reach pension age
before the introduction of the single-tier pension. That will help
those who have not built up much entitlement to the additional state
pension, especially women and the

we must also guarantee that the basic state pension is affordable in
the future, even as people live longer and our society grows older, and
the only way in which to do that is to ensure that the pension age
keeps pace with life expectancy. The Pensions Bill, which is currently
going through Parliament, puts in place reviews of the pension age
every five years. We have set the principle that will underpin those
reviews. We think that a fair principle is that, as now, people should
expect to spend up to a third of their adult lives in retirement. Based
on the latest life expectancy figures, applying that principle would
mean an increase in the state pension age to 68 in the mid-2030s and to
69 in the late 2040s. The exact dates will be set by the future
statutory reviews and in line with the most up-to-date demographic
data, of which the next update is published next week. This is one of
those difficult decisions that Governments have to take if they are
serious about controlling the public finances. Future taxpayers will be
saved around £500 billion pounds. Young people will know that
our country can afford to give them a proper pension when they retire.
That is this generation fulfilling its obligations for fiscal
responsibility to the next generation, not saddling them with the debts
and the decisions we were not prepared to deal with
ourselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0002.htm#13120554000328">Having
sound public finances also means making sure that we collect the taxes
that are due. Most wealthy people pay their taxes and make a huge
contribution to funding our public services; the latest figures show
that 30% of all income tax is paid by just 1% of taxpayers. We have
given incentives to enterprise and cut punitive tax rates, and this

underpins opportunity. It is business that provides those opportunities
and the best way to help business is by lowering the burden of tax.
KPMG’s report last week confirmed for the second year running
that Britain has the most competitive business tax system in the world.
Some in this House suggest that our response to this good news should
be to increase corporation tax from 20%. Today, we publish the first of
our studies into the dynamic effects of tax changes that shows that our
corporation tax cuts increase investment and raise
productivity—so much so that more than half the cost of the tax
cut to the Treasury will be recovered because of higher growth. Putting
up corporation tax hits investment, cuts productivity, costs jobs and
raises much less. We thank the hon. Members for their submission, but
we think it would be economic madness to pursue
it.</hs_Para>

reverse, today we take further steps to make our business taxes yet
more competitive. The Budget announcement that we would abolish stamp
duty on AIM shares was applauded around the world. Today, we also
abolish stamp duty for shares purchased in exchange traded funds to
encourage those funds to locate in the UK. We are making our successful
film tax relief even more generous, and looking to extend the
principle, including to regional theatre. We set out major reforms to
encourage employee ownership of the kind that makes John Lewis such a
success. And from April, we will be one of the first countries in the
world to introduce a new tax relief for investment in social
enterprises and new social impact bonds. I want to thank Sir Ronnie
Cohen and the charities Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for
Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd), for all their help in putting
this innovative scheme
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000353" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0002.htm#13120554000353">Business
rates impose a heavy burden on businesses of all sizes. Today, we will
help ease that burden—and here is how. The last Government
wanted to halve small business rates relief—a relief that helps
cut rates bills for half a million companies and means a third of a
million of the smallest businesses pay no rates at all. If we had
followed that plan, small businesses would have faced a rate increase
of up to £3,375. So we have rejected that plan. Instead, we have
extended that rate relief scheme year after year. It was due to expire
next April. We will now extend it for another whole year.
We  
<?notus-xml column=1111?>have also listened to the small business groups and will relax the rules
that discourage these firms from expanding and opening extra
premises.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000354" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0002.htm#13120554000354">But
that does not go far enough. All businesses are expecting rates to rise
by 3.2% next year. Instead, I will cap the inflation increase in
business rates for all premises at 2% from next April. We will also
allow businesses to pay their rates in 12 monthly instalments. We will
clear almost all the backlog of valuation appeals by July 2015, with
reform of business rates on the agenda for 2017
revaluation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000355" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0002.htm#13120554000355">There
is one group of businesses that has found the recession especially
hard, as it has coincided with a rising challenge from the internet
that is only getting stronger. These are our local retailers—the

Government to do all we can to help them. We are already changing the
planning rules to help town centres compete. To get the vacant shops
that blight too many town centres to open again, I am introducing a new

occupants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000356" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0002.htm#13120554000356">But

help those who have struggled hard on our high streets—often
working long hours for not enough in return. So I can announce today
that for the next two years every retail premise in England with a
rateable value of up to £50,000 will get a discount on their

instead of penalising people with more taxes and more regulation, give

the biggest recession ever. It cannot talk about the deficit, because
it has no plan to deal with it. The right hon. Gentleman cannot even
talk about infrastructure and his much vaunted plan for a cross-party
consensus, because he was the person who tried to break the consensus

there were 420,000 fewer affordable homes at the end of the Labour
Government. He cannot talk about business rates, because they went up

wants to put taxes up on business. He cannot ask about standing up to
the powerful, because this is the week that Labour caved in to the
trade unions. He cannot ask about jobs, because he wants more jobs

up so much under Labour. It left us with an 11% budget deficit, which

McDonnell</B> (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</Member> Whatever
one’s view of the past, there are worrying signs that the bonus
culture is returning to the City, with large payouts, share
distributions and high dividend payments disguising what were formerly
bonuses. Will the Chancellor of the Exchequer make it clear that the
Government stand ready to introduce further measures to control
the bonus culture? I believe that they would have the
support of the whole House in doing so.</hs_Para>

Osborne:</Member></B> I find myself in agreement with the hon.
Gentleman. He put his question in a very measured way. We do not want
to see a return to the uncontrolled bonus culture. We now have a much
tougher regime in respect of the transparency of bonuses and clawback,
which means that if things go wrong in trades or for  a bank,
they can get the money back that they have paid people in bonuses. We
will take measures to tackle things such as dual contracts, as I
mentioned briefly in my statement and as is set out in the document.
People who work in the financial industry often split their contract so
that they can claim that they are only working for part of the time in
the UK to avoid tax. Where there is egregious tax avoidance, we will
take steps. I agree with him that the banking system as a whole must be
cognisant of the times in which it

who live in this country cannot be detached from the performance of the
overall economy, as the country sadly discovered when it had the
biggest recession in modern history and people’s incomes were
hit so badly. Our argument is that the only way to improve living
standards in this country is to create jobs, support businesses as they
expand and create those jobs, and ensure that the country gets out of

one listens carefully to what the shadow Chancellor says, he makes a
promise about current spending in the year in which the election will
be held, but he makes no promise about capital spending in that year

changes to the ECO, as implied by the hon. Lady’s question, she
would be saying that bills should go up for the families she

its position. The solid-wall insulation industry will be supported by

that times have been incredibly difficult for this country because we
had the deepest recession in this country’s modern history. We
had a 7% fall in GDP, which makes the country poorer. I argue that the
best way to help that family, and many other families, is by keeping
mortgage rates low and ensuring that more and better jobs are created
in the economy, and that people can work longer hours if they want to.
All those things are happening because we are standing behind our
businesses and have control of our public finances. We are now

revolution. The Treasury has produced a dynamic model for tax
reduction—in this case, for corporation tax. At the moment that
sits alongside the static, more orthodox, model that the Treasury has
always used. That dynamic model—which we have made available and
will, of course, be subject to scrutiny—shows that reductions in
corporation tax not only increase investment in this country, but as a

way in which the Barnett formula is applied. We are clear that we want
to be fair to Northern Ireland. In designing our reoccupation relief we
noted how some of Northern Ireland’s schemes to help people

us the biggest boom and the biggest bust in our history—it was
spectacularly unsuccessful. One would think that those who had been
through that would have learned their lesson and be keen to see
borrowing controlled, public finances in good order and the deficit
come down, but they are not. That speaks to a broader truth, which is
that in bad times the Opposition say, “Borrow more because the
country needs it” and in good times they say, “Borrow
more because the country cannot afford it.” What they never say

Connarty</B> (Linlithgow and East Falkirk) (Lab):</Member> I do not
know if the Chancellor does irony, but does he realise that the
fundamental structure of his economic plan is similar to the strategy
used by RBS, which was revealed in his own Tomlinson report? RBS looked
after its big clients and attacked the financial circumstances of its
small clients, driving them down into debt, poverty and eventually into
bankruptcy, and then selling off their assets. That is, of course, what
he is doing at the moment. The small folk in a democracy can vote out 
<?notus-xml column=1131?>the Chancellor, unlike with the banks. One question I have raised in
writing with the right hon. Gentleman relates to companies moving their
assets of their pension funds to offshore funds—for example, in
the Channel Islands—and declaring bankruptcy. The workers then
have to go to the Pension Protection Fund. When will the Chancellor do
something about that? I was told in a letter from his Department that
that is legal, but those companies are clearly cheating the taxpayer

an acknowledgement of that in the extra money for UK export finance.

specific point. We are expanding the scheme to help small businesses
export, which is one of our central objectives. If we can go further, I
will happily look at that and take it forward in the Budget, because
that is our shared objective. We want more exports, but the issue is
that our main export markets have been in a deep recession for the past
year. It is not surprising, unfortunately, that exports have been hit.
That has led to companies exploring opportunities much further afield.
One of the best things to do for small exporters is to ensure that,
when they turn up in places such as Shanghai, there is a helping hand,
with facilities and an office available for them to start their search
for partners. That kind of thing is precisely what we are funding
today.</hs_Para>

announcements, which will not necessarily be on the front pages
tomorrow, was the increase in student numbers and the lifting of the
cap on aspiration. That is a major structural improvement in the
British economy. Britain has fewer graduates as a proportion of
population than many other comparable countries, and it is a basic
tenet of economic success that we should do more in this area. We are
providing additional money for STEM subjects so that they are taught

across the country, and I know that the hon. Lady was previously
connected with them, but cutting income tax for the low-paid and taking
them out of income tax is a real help, as is the freeze in fuel duty,
rail fares and the like. As I say, in the end, the biggest thing we can
do for this country is deal with our debts and get people into work. In

issue. When I announced this measure in the autumn statement, one
member of the Opposition Front-Bench team said, “Why
aren’t you doing it sooner?”. Labour had 13 years to make
this tax change, and the man who actually designed the tax policies and
wrote the statements is the shadow Chancellor. I find it extraordinary
that, whether it is dealing with this unfairness in capital gains tax
or the general unfairness where they boasted that people in the City
were paying lower tax rates than people who cleaned for them, we have
stepped in to deal with the unfairness.</hs_Para>

the levels that applied at 
<?notus-xml column=1136?>the end of 2010, his hubris is staggering. He did not answer the

flood defence programme. Indeed, additional money in the autumn
statement has gone into coastal management, too. The hon. Lady makes a
point about the economy, but we have not, of course, heard a serious
economic argument advanced by the Labour party so far. Let me point out
that in the hon. Lady’s constituency, unemployment is down 30%

for the people she

welcome the Chancellor’s announcement about capital gains tax
for foreign owners of property, particularly in London, and the
increase in the borrowing limits for local authorities. When he does
his review, promised in the autumn statement, of local councils’
ability to deliver more affordable housing, will he look at some very
good examples of housing associations that, by using private sector
investment and private sales, have hugely increased their capacity to
build social housing—not just at affordable rents, but at social
and target rents as

Osborne:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. Some
excellent housing associations have used private money and sold off
some of the most expensive 
<?notus-xml column=1137?>social homes in order to provide more resource for building more homes,
which is precisely what we want to encourage. On the additional money
in the housing revenue grant, which I know has been of particular
interest to the right hon. Gentleman’s party, we have said that
that money should be available on a competitive basis to those councils
that are going to work with housing associations, for example, to
deliver the sort of innovative schemes that he
champions.</hs_Para>

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> Some of the predictions in
the OBR report have not been mentioned today. One is an upgraded
prediction on how much is going to be spent on certain benefits, such
as employment support allowance, which by 2017-18 is going to be
£2.1 billion higher than in the last prediction, and
housing benefit, which is going up by £1.8 billion—again,
higher than the previous estimate. Quite apart from the misery caused
by things like the bedroom tax, these welfare reforms are simply not
working. When is the Chancellor going to ensure that his Government get
a grip on that problem, rather than let those bills spiral? Given these
predicted rises to spending, it is going to be very difficult to put a
cap on
welfare.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000524" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0002.htm#13120554000524"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr George Osborne" PimsId="2219" UID="13120554001109" xid="458" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0002.htm#13120554001109">Mr
Osborne:</Member></B> Although the hon. Lady put her question in quite
a partisan way, she hits on a very good point. There are sometimes big
increases in welfare spending that are not subject to the kind of
control that we in this House exercise on much smaller sums in
Government Departments. Precisely because of the forecast increases in
employment support allowance and housing benefit, it is right for us to
bring those issues to the House and discuss them. It is a bit
wrong-headed to complain on the one hand that housing benefit is going
up too much while on the other hand campaigning to increase housing
benefit. No doubt we will be able to have a fuller debate when we
introduce the welfare cap.</hs_Para>

Government gutted the public sector in the north-east, the Chancellor
insisted that the private sector would make up the shortfall. A recent
report by KPMG, however, shows that over a quarter of private sector
jobs pay less than the living wage, compared with less than 10% in the
public sector. Is it any surprise to the Chancellor that in-work
poverty has risen in my constituency?</hs_Para>

would welcome the 15% fall in unemployment in her constituency. We want
to make sure that people get better jobs, and the
way to achieve that is to ensure that our businesses can expand and our
country and economy can grow, thus also dealing with the scourge of
youth unemployment. One thing noted by the hon. Lady’s
predecessor as MP for South Shields, before he left to look after
International Rescue in New York, was that youth unemployment was
rising from 2004. Since then, however, it has gone down by 23% in her
constituency. If we invest in apprenticeships, in higher

I have learned one thing. When “trafficking” was first
mentioned to me, like many people, including my constituents, I had a
vision of people in the back of vans coming into the country. We talk
about modern-day slavery and people talk about manacles. Possibly the
most recent publicised incident in south London fits in more with
people’s idea of modern-day slavery but, as far as I can see,
that is a rather extreme case. Modern-day slavery is probably in all

labour—as slaves.</hs_Para>

people, who have been made to do something criminal—there will
be exceptions and they might have committed crimes that were not the
result of forced labour, but most of their crimes will have
been—and we must think strongly about whether to prosecute. I
believe that the Lord Chief Justice recently delivered a judgment on
cannabis farms in which he said exactly that. I understand that young

Although we should not frighten kids with some of the more horrific
things, if in school they are gradually made aware of modern-day
slavery from an early age, they might be able to spot what is going on.
Then, with their friends, they might notice something untoward. There

it could occur here, in our own constituencies. As we have heard, the
shackles are different today. There are no manacles; the slaves are not
in irons. They are controlled even more effectively. The job that the
Government have is different from Wilberforce’s. In a country
where slaves were all too apparent, Wilberforce’s role was to
change public opinion and persuade it to condemn such evil acts. Now,
the chains take a different form, and people do not believe that such
evil takes place. The control mechanisms of fear, violence and the
knowledge of what will happen to brothers and sisters or parents back

move. I want to make a plea to the Government not just to settle on a
Bill, but to use the opportunity to make it a world leader of a Bill,
not because we want credit for our country—though that is a
noble objective to wish for—but because the evil is so great and
so widespread that we want whatever we can craft in this Chamber as the

this House who set up the Human Trafficking Foundation. I am conscious
that any Prime Minister must weigh up whether to increase the amount of
red tape for businesses—I believe that economic revival will
come and more constituents will have jobs if businesses can
thrive—with another duty, which is that if the supply chains of
some of the businesses that are proud to operate from this country are
infected with slavery, they, and their boards in particular, are
clearly liable to be participating in the most serious criminal
offences. We must therefore weigh up the worries about red tape in this
instance against the proper concern about businesses putting themselves
in that
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000639" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000639">Like

journey that the Government have been on, which they have encouraged
other people to join, in rethinking their position on how we can most
effectively counter modern slavery will continue right up until the

Selous</B> (South West Bedfordshire) (Con):</Member> It is a great
honour and privilege to speak in this important debate. It is
significant that it is entitled “Modern-day slavery”. A
few years ago it might have been entitled “Human
trafficking”, but of course modern-day slavery encompasses human
trafficking but goes wider, because one of the many terrible truths
about the issue is that there are British slaves who are moved from one
part of our country to another, or indeed overseas, to be forced to
work in
slavery.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000642">It
is worth putting the whole issue in context. The United Nations
estimates that some 27 million people are today living in modern-day
slavery around the world, which is more than there were in
Wilberforce’s day. When I was young I learned my history and was
taught, as most of us were, that Wilberforce and many others had
abolished slavery, so it is a real indictment of us, in 2013, to see
the extent of slavery around the world and, indeed, in our own
country.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=1156?>Ruislip (Sir John Randall) explained, it could be happening on our own
streets or yards away from our constituency offices, and of course it
is very difficult to spot. The awful truth is that huge amounts of
money are being made by the slave owners and traffickers. If their
labour costs are virtually nil, they can make a great deal of money
from their business. Sheer greed and the evil of one human being
wanting to exploit another for financial gain are at the heart of what
we are talking
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:45:10"></hs_TimeCode>

was made aware of the issue a couple of years ago while on a church
holiday with my family. We heard a presentation from the A21 Campaign,
one of the many excellent groups fighting modern-day slavery. I was
convinced then that it was an issue I should study, devote time to and
work on, with colleagues on both sides of the House and many
influential people outside, to try to do something about it.</hs_Para>

received a phone call from Bedfordshire police to tell me that there
would be a major police operation in my constituency on Sunday morning.
They could not give me more details, because it had to be secret, but I
was told that I would be briefed later that morning. That morning, some
200 police officers from both Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire police
moved on to a Traveller site in a small—I might even say
sleepy—village in south Bedfordshire. There they
discovered  23 modern-day slaves, some of whom had been on the
site for up to 15 years. They were mainly British
citizens.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000646" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000646">Those
modern-day slaves had been picked up in the most appalling
circumstances, generally at one of the lowest points in their lives.
Some of them were picked up from homeless hostels. One gentleman had
even been on a bridge and about to commit suicide. They had been picked
up under the most terrible false pretences. They had been told that
they would be paid £80 a day, given board and lodging, looked
after and included in the general family in the place they had been
taken to. If a person is down and out and life is not particularly
good, I guess that seems quite a good
offer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:47:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000647" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000647">The
reality was horrifyingly and shockingly different. They were taken to
the Traveller site. On arrival, their heads were shaved, as happened to
the victims in the concentration camps, for hygiene purposes. Many of
them were forced to live in horse boxes. They had no washing
facilities, although they were taken to the local leisure centre on a
Friday evening, purely because on Saturdays they were shown to
potential clients to try to get more business. Their owners did not
want them to smell on Saturday mornings, but it did not really matter
if they smelled the rest of the week.</hs_Para>

had to clean the immaculate homes of the people who were exploiting
them, but they were not given any toilet facilities themselves. They
had to watch wonderful food being prepared for the people they worked
for, but they were given meagre portions of a sloppy stew to eat. They
were often woken at 5 o’clock in the morning and taken in a van,
often for miles around, and occasionally overseas to various countries,
and forced to do hard manual labour all day. They were brought back
late at night and the same thing happened again and again. On some
occasions they did not even know when it was Christmas day. That was
the reality of their lives for, as I said, up to 15 years. Like

more terrible for me, as the local Member of Parliament, was that I had
previously been round that Traveller site with Bedfordshire police

because, as my right hon. Friend said, slaves today are not like they

issue about what happened in my constituency was that these slaves had,
in the main, been doing block paving work on people’s drives and
so would have been highly visible to many of my constituents and many

smuggled through ports in the backs of lorries, but many others arrive
at a UK airport accompanied by an adult trafficker. The adult abandons
the child in the airport with no identification, instructing them to
claim asylum, while the adult leaves the country as a transit
passenger. When picked up by the airport authorities, the child is put
into the care of children’s services and taken to a home or
hostel. Typically, a phone number has been sown inside their clothing,
and when it is safe to do so, they contact a handler and then
disappear. Traffickers also get to know where the children’s
homes are
situated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000675" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000675">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:02:58"></hs_TimeCode>
of the reasons why many non-British trafficked children go missing from
care is that they are groomed so effectively by their traffickers: they
are so terrified of what might happen to them or their families if they
break their bond or tell the authorities that they run back to their
traffickers.
Being<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:03:19"></hs_TimeCode> exploited
for labour is the most common form of exploitation of trafficked

a situation is partly the result of a lack of awareness about the
indicators that a child might have been trafficked, as well as a lack
of knowledge about the steps to take to prevent trafficked children
from going missing, such as placing them away from their
trafficker’s local area. 
<?notus-xml column=1161?>Budget constraints in local authorities and a culture that prioritises
immigration control and criminal prosecution over child protection,
combined with a lack of specialist accommodation or foster care, also
contribute to the inadequate support received by these young

this year, the national referral mechanism has identified 1,500 child
and adult victims of trafficking, according to the UK Human Trafficking
Centre. However, the data on children are patchy and incomplete. That
is why the all-party group recommended a comprehensive and independent
national system of data collection for trafficked children who go
missing. Under the recent reforms to the data collection system for
local authorities, it does not include data on trafficked children,
nationality or immigration
status.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000679" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000679">Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:05:26"></hs_TimeCode>
professionals agree that the best solution to help trafficked children
break contact with their traffickers is to use specialist foster carers
who are trained to identify and respond to the specific issues and
needs of trafficked children, and who know how to keep them safe. We
recommended that the pilot scheme that was run by the Department for
Education and Barnardo’s to train more foster parents to support
trafficked children and/or sexually exploited children should be rolled
out
nationally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000680">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:06:22"></hs_TimeCode>
provision of specialist accommodation for child victims of trafficking
is very limited. Many such children are being accommodated in bed and
breakfasts, hostels and supported lodgings, which do not provide the
level of supervision and specialist support that is needed to prevent
them from going missing or being targeted for further exploitation.
That is despite the guidance that was issued by the DFE and the Home
Office in 2012, which states that trafficked children should be placed
in foster care or residential care and that the local authority should
assess the child’s vulnerability to the continuing control of
their traffickers and take into account the risk that they will go
missing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000681" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000681">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:06:22"></hs_TimeCode>
recent “Newsnight” investigation revealed that
15,728 children aged 16 and 17 had asked local authorities
with help for homelessness. Of the local authorities that responded to
a freedom of information request, 148 had housed children
unlawfully in band B accommodation in 2012, despite statutory guidance
stating that such accommodation is not suitable for children. That is a
problem for trafficked children because most of them will be in that

I have said, trafficked children often go missing before their level of
vulnerability has been assessed by children’s services and
before identification has taken place. That is why I support the
recommendation of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre
and the Association of Chief Police Officers that photos of the
children should be taken and recorded along with their passport number,
nationality, fingerprints and DNA. That would mean that if a child
turned up later in a cannabis factory, or was a victim of sexual
exploitation or had been charged with an offence in a different part of
the country, they could be identified as a trafficked child and the
right level of intervention could be used to safeguard
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:07:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000683" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000683">To
re-emphasise what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:07:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Slough said, it is important to understand that children
do not volunteer the information that they have been trafficked. If we
want to break the bond with 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>the trafficker, the child must be given an advocate, guardian or social
worker at the point of entry to the country to support them and
encourage the formation of a trusting relationship, so that they have
someone to turn to other than the trafficker. In recent debates in this
House, we have talked about the importance of communicating with
children and giving them a voice. That is all the more important when a
child arrives in the country unable to speak the language, with no
understanding of our laws or customs, and fearful of what might happen
if they divulge anything to the
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:08:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000684" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000684">Only
five of the 64 local authorities that responded to the all-party
group’s call for evidence last year collect data on the
nationality of children in care. Only two authorities, Hillingdon and
Portsmouth, collect data on whether children have been trafficked.
Witnesses told our inquiry that professionals often had a negative
attitude towards trafficked children and that that had implications for
the way in which such children were treated. We recommended that the
DFE should lead a programme of work to support local authorities to
meet the needs of trafficked children through existing child protection
frameworks. Local authorities could also reflect on the needs of
trafficked children in their annual sufficiency surveys, which show how
they will provide care to meet the needs of looked-after children in
their
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000685" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000685">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:09:22"></hs_TimeCode>
major factor in the failure to protect trafficked children is the lack
of knowledge among professionals of the indicators that a child might
have been trafficked. Children and Families Across Borders, which
trains local authorities, reported to the all-party group that 98% of
social workers have not heard of the national referral mechanism and
have no clear understanding of the issues involved in identifying or
protecting trafficked children. The inquiry heard from practitioners
and the police that effective multi-agency working would improve
information sharing and strategic responses. We heard evidence of
consistent failure in intelligence-sharing between the UK Border
Agency, the police, and statutory and local authorities about organised
criminal networks and trafficking
trends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120554000686" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120554000686">Pat

<?notus-xml column=1163?>point of entry. We therefore need better data collection, and better
understanding in agencies with responsibility for protecting children
of indicators that a child may have been trafficked. We also need safe
places for children to try and break the relationship between

Thompson, who spent 11 years in the red-light district of Mumbai. This
e-book can be purchased for the price of a glass of wine through the
website, takenebook.com. I commend it to hon. Members. Hazel tells of a
girl who was 11 when she was trafficked from a poor village in India.
Her trafficker was her mother’s friend, and she promised
Guddi—the girl’s name—well-paid domestic service
in Mumbai that would help feed her struggling family, but when Guddi
arrived she was taken to a brothel and raped. The madam of the brothel
and her daughter held her down by her arms and legs to restrain her. If
Guddi and her family had known about domestic trafficking and where she
was really going, her life today would be very different.</hs_Para>

clubs, but which will in fact be brothels. It is essential that we
ensure that international hotels have nothing to do with this. I
commend Hilton Worldwide for taking action, operating training

the term “child prostitution” is a euphemism: it fails to
describe the shocking details of this vile trade; it is nothing short

for too many child prostitutes leads to an early death. As the hon.

sexually transmitted diseases take their toll on such young bodies.
Slavery appears endemic in India, and according to the global slavery
index of 2013, an estimated 14 million people are in slavery
there—more than in any other country, accounting for nearly 50%
of the world’s slaves. Nearly 90% of this is in domestic

Mumbai. It was set up for rescued children who had been forced into
enslaved prostitution. It was a harrowing experience—one that
will not leave me for many years, if at all. It really brought to light
just how tough life can be on this planet, even 12 years after the
signing of the millennium development goals. The cross-party delegation
witnessed the very depths of inhumanity. These were children that in
many cases were seized from rural areas and trafficked across India to
work in large cities such as Hyderabad and Mumbai. Poverty had in some
cases led to children being sold into slavery by their parents, while
in many other cases, the poorest families were simply conned by the
traffickers by a promise of a better life for their children in the
cities. Which parent would not want a better life for their children?
The parents do not know where their children have been taken, and the
children are too young to know where home is. The refuge we visited
explained that, in most cases, there was no way of tracing a rescued
child back to their parents. It was harrowing.</hs_Para>

very much a leafy suburb. What shocked me was the small number who
turned up to hear those very impressive speakers. Allowing for the fact

the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) that this is not a party
political matter; it never has been. We have always urged the
Government, regardless of who they are, to do more and to do better.
After studying this topic and spending time at the Serious Organised
Crime Agency, when I was part of the police service parliamentary
scheme, I found that as we change our attack on the business—it
is a worldwide business and a seriously organised crime
network—the perpetrators change their business model. Women used
to be forced into slavery and brought here by force. Now, they are
being offered a new life. They are often EU citizens who have a right
to come here. They are promised good jobs and a career and then find
themselves entrapped in slavery and sexual exploitation. As we change
our attack, we will find that the perpetrators change. It is a matter
that every Government will have to deal
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000030"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:46:23"></hs_TimeCode>The
decade of work commenced when Anthony Steen, who has been mentioned
often, took an interest in the trafficking of Roma children, who were
trained to thieve on Southeastern trains and on the underground. There
were large numbers of them, and they were clearly organised. They were
all swept up by police and the social services and returned to their
country of origin. Very few went into any form of support system in the
UK. From that episode came Anthony’s interest, which infected
all of us, and many of us became involved in the pre-2010
activities.</hs_Para>

was also struck by a book by Baroness Cox called “This Immoral
Trade”. It is a study of what happened in Burma and Sudan where
people were trafficked in the old way. They were put into slave gangs
and taken to slavers in the north of Africa where they were sold. They
are now being bought back from those very slavers by their communities.
It is a replication of what used to happen when people were taken to
the colonies of the European countries. That practice is still going
on. I spoke at the re-launch of the second edition of Baroness
Cox’s book in the House of Lords last month. It was said that
between 11 million and 17 million people are enslaved in the world at
the moment. A number of types of slavery are used.

developed an amazing mapping and monitoring process. Using a mapping
system used for the movement of traffic—the movement of
lorries—they can map the movement of people and are becoming
adept at watching the movement of people from Brazil into Portugal for
the summer trade on the beaches. Then, in the winter, the traffickers
move them into the cities, into indoor brothels. The Portuguese can cut

only half a dozen have ever replied when a Government organisation has
asked them for information because they feel that they have a
responsibility to protect the victims they have helped release and who
they are looking after. They worry that if those victims get into the

charity bags that had been put out for charitable organisations, but
they were driven out and it was taken over by a mysterious
organisation. We reported it to the police, but they did not act
quickly enough and in the middle of the night a large lorry turned up,
took all the lamps and all the cannabis and unfortunately the

signed up to the directive on human trafficking to implement it

heard about domestic slavery, and I join those who have criticised the
Government. I do not see that as party political, but as speaking
against a silly thing that was done—that is, the abolition of
the one thing that gave domestic servants, or slaves, even if they were
brought in as a family as they sometimes are, the chance to have a
domestic servants visa. That meant that they could leave a bad family
and, usually through Kalayaan and the police, find another employer as
long as their visa allowed them to stay.</hs_Para>

that the Government said that every year maybe 40 or 50 people out of
the thousands involved used that concession to stay behind and
disappear, but it protected those young women—it is mainly young
women—from being beaten, treated “worse than the
dogs”, fed the scraps off the table of the families they lived
with, and sleeping in cupboards. They could leave that behind and find
a better employer while they had a domestic servant visa. That does not
exist any more—it is now a six-month visa. But most people do
not come in with visas; they come in as members of families. They are
then kept with the family and treated in the most appalling way, so I
hope that the Government will find a way of reinstating the protection
of domestic workers in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000043">It

sexual exploitation—rent boys, I think they call them in London.
But they are even younger than that; they are children, because some
men particularly like young boys. They are exploited in many ways. They
are exploited for begging. They are exploited by fake families for
benefit fraud; quite a lot of that goes on. They are trafficked also
for thieving—they are trained to pickpocket in the cities of the
UK and  in
Europe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000044">We
have to look at how we can keep the criminalisation of the victim away
from the care of the victim. It is unfortunate that it became mixed up
in the debate about immigration. We have to look at immigration. We
heard my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field) say
that there is nobody in the House as tough as he is when it comes to
the idea of restricting immigration. He is part of the balanced
immigration group in Parliament, along with senior Conservative
Members, but he does not want to see this mixed up 
<?notus-xml column=1174?>with the immigration problem; it is a different matter. These people are
brought in, maybe with promises, with delusions that they would be
coming to a better life, and then abused. We should tackle that. We
found when we talked to NGOs that the excessive focus on immigration
substantially impacts on the confidence of victims in speaking to the
UK Border Agency, and in speaking to the police authorities who, if the
Bill is correct, will be their best saviour rather than their biggest
threat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000045">I
want to say a word or two about the Scottish situation, because I am
the only Scottish Member speaking in the debate. There is a parallel
debate going on in Scotland. We had a strange comment by the Justice
Minister after the launch of the inquiry into human trafficking in
Scotland, which I went to. It was chaired by Helena Kennedy, Baroness
Kennedy of The Shaws. When I said to him that many things in the
inquiry could be taken forward into a Bill, the Justice Minister, who
is known for being a bit sharp, and whom I have known for a long time,
said, “The trouble with us is the UK Border Agency, Michael. If
we could do something about them, we could do something about human
trafficking.” He felt very strongly indeed that because it was a
UK matter, it was the UK Border Agency that distorted Scottish
Ministers’ wish to do something about it.</hs_Para>

mention three elements very quickly. First, in 2011 a document called
“Scotland: A safe place for child traffickers?”
by Tam Baillie, the children’s commissioner, shocked Scotland.
It was not, “Scotland: A safe place for trafficked
children?” but “Scotland: A safe place for child
traffickers?” He could identify 200 children trafficked
into Scotland over a period of 18 months.</hs_Para>

then an inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission into human
trafficking. Its report came out in October 2011. It was very
far-reaching—I think much more visionary than anything we had
had in responding at a UK level to the human trafficking directive. It
talked about some elements which I shall mention in a
minute.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000048">Finally,
there is now a draft Bill on human trafficking and modern-day slavery
headed up by Jenny Marra, MSP for Dundee. The Scottish Parliament is
considering the matter with a Bill before them that they can look
at—a fully laid out Bill, rather than what we have at the
moment, which is some rumours and some whispers and some wishes about
what our Bill will contain. The process that we follow may produce a
much more comprehensive Bill, but I was very impressed with the Bill

Friend the Member for Slough that it would be a good idea to have Jenny
Marra down to the all-party group to discuss with her the thinking
behind her Bill. I spoke at a conference with her in Glasgow about the
fact that if the Bill became law, it would need to contain a framework
to deal with events such as the Olympics, or the Commonwealth games in
Glasgow, which represent a truly attractive opportunity for human
traffickers to profit and

understand that there is a proposal—the Minister may correct
me—that the UK anti-slavery Bill will contain a better
definition of the crime. We currently use anti-sex trade Acts that are
years, if not decades, out of date. It would be good to know what the
crime is and for it to be defined as widely as possible. There should
be a clear prosecution policy and a sentencing policy that makes it
clear to people that if they are caught, it will result not in a small
fine or a few years in jail, but in a long period in jail—up to
life imprisonment, I hope, for anyone caught running a major criminal
operation in human trafficking and
slavery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:00:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000052">During
the inquiry in Scotland, we heard the idea that other crimes could be
made more severe by being defined as aggravated by human trafficking.
At present, many traffickers go to prison for other small crimes, not
for the crime of human trafficking. I understand from the Serious
Organised Crime Agency that that change would make the tariff high
enough to provide access to the criminals’ money. As
SOCA said, to follow the crime, follow the money. That is important. At
the launch of the Scottish inquiry, the Advocate-General
spoke in favour of such a
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:01:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000053">There
should be a commissioner-ombudsman, independent and well resourced, and
a clear focus on asset reclamation. Since the activity is aimed at
making money from the exploitation of humans, selling them cheaply or
abusing their rights, if the authorities can get their hands on the
money or the assets, that will hurt. It has been proposed that any
money recovered should be used for anti-slavery purposes, rather than
taken back into the Treasury like fines for speeding and so on. I
suggest that we consider giving some of assets recovered to the Human
Trafficking Foundation to make that a well-resourced organisation that
does not just rely on charity, but is funded by the effectiveness of
the campaign that it

must respond to the reality of labour exploitation in UK supply chains.
This is a plea, a hope and a wish. The Minister may make me happy or
unhappy when he speaks. There are many organisations such as Walk Free
set up by the owner of Fortescue from Australia, who now has 5 million
people signed up as members of Walk Free, which exposes human
trafficking and exploitation for sex and for cheap labour across the
world. Every day members of the Walk Free network get e-mails asking
them to send petitions and write to companies to try to stop that
behaviour. There is also the organisation set up by the then world
president of Manpower, which has tackled human trafficking through all
its networks. The 2.5 million companies that Manpower deals with all

spoke to various organisations while preparing my Bill. The case that
was exposed which everyone heard about in this country involved eggs
and chickens for the Olympics. A special programme was carried out by
the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, which it would not 
<?notus-xml column=1176?>normally do. The authority focused specifically on
supplies to that event. It found that the chickens had been rounded up
by Lithuanian men—40 of them kept in a big house and hounded
from place to place by rottweilers. They were driven round the country,
working 17 hours a day. By the time they had paid their so-called fare
to get there and their dig money—their rent—they ended up
with very little at all, and they were badly fed. The gangmaster was
taken to court.</hs_Para>

people hired as gangmasters, who were licensed gangmasters, then hired
Lithuanians,  who were not gangmasters, to run the show for
them. We have to think seriously about that. When I spoke  to
representatives of McDonald’s, they brought me a wonderful
brochure about all the standards that those who sign up to supply the
company should observe. It stated that workers should not be locked in
or guarded, and that they should not be indebted to a recruitment
agency. It is fabulous, but the company did not realise that it meant
nothing. People signed bits of paper and put them in the bin or in a

or reporting to see whether it happens. I received a letter from the
chief executive of Sainsbury’s telling me that he thought we
should fight for more resources for the Gangmasters Licensing
Authority, which he told me was being downgraded. It had been
“downgraded” by being taken into the Serious Organised

writing and at your annual general meeting, on what you find. If you
find something, eradicate it.” If we do not have that, we will

people came to me when I was preparing my private Member’s Bill
and suggested that we use stickers like the ones we used to have
against apartheid, with a skull and crossbones, saying,
“Contaminated by human trafficking.” They said that they
would go around sticking them on clothes from Gap or Next, one of the
companies that was found guilty, to let people know that they had been
contaminated by human trafficking. But that is not the generality of
it. People will either buy fashion garments because they are in vogue,
or they will buy other garments from cheaper places because that is
what they can afford. It is up to us, as a Parliament, to carry on this
fight to the point where we make all those organisations responsible.
By all of us pitching in, we will create a better

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:07:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) is absolutely right
to focus on the acute risks in the supply chain, because subcontractors
are often responsible for the worst abuses, particularly in relation to
payslips and wage legislation. Like my hon. Friends the Members for Mid
Derbyshire (Pauline Latham)
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:07:19"></hs_TimeCode> for South

is particularly acute in rural communities. In recent years there has
been a perception that it is largely confined to cities, so powerful
speeches, such as the one my hon. Friend the Member for South West

problem right across the

very much welcome the opportunity to have this debate before the draft
legislation is published. There are three specific concerns relating to
legislation that  I do not think have been particularly well
aired in  the debate so far and that I therefore want to draw
to the House’s attention.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:08:05"></hs_TimeCode> first is the
importance of wages being paid electronically. In parts of my
constituency, such as the middle of the fenland farming community, the
tradition is for gangmasters to make payments in cash. That lends
itself to abuse, both of tax and in the form of deductions at source.
As soon as the wage is paid in cash, deductions are often made for
transport, food, counterfeit goods supplied and the debts that are part
of the mis-selling that got people over to the UK in the first place,
often on the false promise of
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000064">The
Home Office could learn some interesting lessons from the recent
legislation banning cash payments in the scrap metal trade. I hope that
my hon. Friend the Minister, who has a reputation for his commitment to
detail and who has the great confidence of Government Members as the
Minister introducing this legislation, will look at electronic payment,
in particular, because that is a key enabler that could allow law
enforcement agencies to track where abuse has taken
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000065">It
is wrong, particularly as regards the subcontracting that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:09:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Linlithgow and East Falkirk identified, that we allow so much cash
payment to take place given its links to criminality and the abuse of
people who are often not in a position to complain. Requiring payments
in electronic would also deal with another common abuse whereby
migrants, including those who come to my constituency, are misinformed
by gangmasters that they are not allowed to have a bank
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000066">My
second point, which not been much aired, although
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:10:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) touched on it, is about the importance of
having civil fines rather than requiring enforcement authorities always
to pursue a criminal route, which is more resource-intensive and
time-consuming and requires a higher standard of proof. The Gangmasters
Licensing Authority possesses draconian criminal sanctions, but they
are very rarely used. In the past two years, it issued 300 warning
notices but undertook just 11 criminal prosecutions. The sorts of
penalties imposed in those prosecutions are very ineffective. In two
cases in Northern Ireland, the fine was just £500. I do not
think anyone would imagine that the profits made did not exceed that
sum.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120571000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000067">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:11:15"></hs_TimeCode>
fact that 300 warning notices were issued gives us an idea of the gap
between enforcement and the scale of the problem. There is sympathy
within the Department 
<?notus-xml column=1178?>for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for the idea of further
empowering bodies such as the GLA. Guidance issued in 2012 by the
Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Michael

in relation to the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008
curtails the ability to issue civil penalties against firms with fewer
than 250 people. My right hon. Friend has a well-deserved reputation as
a champion of tackling red tape, and I fully support him in that, but I
do not think for a minute that it would ever be his intention to
protect those guilty of criminality. I hope that my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary will consider dealing with that issue in the Bill so as
to make it less resource-intensive for enforcement bodies to take
action against those abusing the vulnerable within our
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:12:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000068">The
third issue that I want to bring to my hon. Friend’s
attention is the definition of an HMO—a house in multiple
occupation. In recent months, we have seen excellent progress
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:12:24"></hs_TimeCode> North East
Cambridgeshire in taking action to restore confidence within
the community. Last month, we had Operation Endeavour, with
300 officers conducting dawn raids and making 10 arrests.
The problem is that most of the houses raided were not HMOs even though
they had 20-plus people living in them, because an HMO is defined as a
house with three storeys. Indeed, there is some contradiction between
that definition and part of the local authority definition.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:13:00"></hs_TimeCode>That takes us on
to a further point about clarity as regards what enforcement action
should be taking place ahead of the legislation. To what extent should
letting agencies be putting in place tenancy agreements? Is there a
requirement for tenancy agreements?</hs_Para>

mentioned the abuse of wage slips.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:11:46"></hs_TimeCode> I tabled a
parliamentary question last week, I found that there had not been a
single prosecution for the abuse of wage slips, so we have existing
legislation that is not being enforced.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:13:35"></hs_TimeCode> same is
happening with the abuse of planning legislation. My local council has
issued many a letter warning rogue landlords to change their behaviour,
but to date it has not enforced it. I welcome the work of
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:13:49"></hs_TimeCode>the
Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon.
Friend the Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins), on pilot funding to
tackle rogue landlords. Fenland district council has made a bid for
such funding. I spoke to him about that earlier this week, and I look
forward to the announcement on it.
Before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:19:30"></hs_TimeCode> we
legislate again, it is crucial that we enforce existing legislation and
clarify why the issue of 20-plus people living in a house, which leads
to many antisocial problems, including street drinking, urination on
streets and community tension, is not being tackled by local
authorities
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:14:45"></hs_TimeCode>through

make a plea to the Minister about resource allocation. This House has a
tendency to legislate and then to assume that the job is done, but
legislation is effective only if it is enforced. This is a problem in
the fens, which is hidden and where the crime is often unreported
because people’s backgrounds mean they are too afraid to report
to the authorities or because they have language difficulties and are
isolated and vulnerable. They have been misled into coming to the UK in
the first place, have got into debt and have then been abused. Women in
particular are led into debt much more quickly and then pressured into
sham marriages, abuse and prostitution as a

important to look at the resource allocation. The Home
Secretary’s recent launch of the National Crime Agency is
particularly welcome, because it is ideally placed to take a leadership
role on the issue. Where I am in the fens—on the border of three
counties—people often work one minute in Lincolnshire, the next
in Norfolk and then in Cambridgeshire, so the issue is not always
applicable to a county police force. The NCA has a role in tasking
regional organised crime units and in looking at the resource
allocation and where the issue sits in its priorities. What will the
budget allocation be? Rather than advising on arrests, as the NCA did
very helpfully on Operation Endeavour, to what extent will it take
investigations through to prosecution? Will it also be able to address
the second and third waves, given that each enforcement activity tends
to be finite in terms of the number of crime gangs that can be
investigated at any one time? The issue of resource allocation
needs to sit alongside any announcement about
legislation. I hope the Minister will provide clarity on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:17:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000072">The
NCA also has a role to play with regard to the source country. As a
number of Members have said, this is an international issue. In the
case of the fens, people from Latvia and Lithuania—dare I say
that this will also be true of people from Bulgaria and Romania in the
months ahead?—are being misled and told that they can have a job
and accommodation, only to find that the situation is different when
they get here. Such a case was raised with me just last week. Someone
was brought into my constituency on that basis and told that his job
was to drive. When he pointed out that he could not drive, he was told
that either he drove—which would have obvious, various risks to
other motorists—or he would be out on his ear without a
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:18:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>.
The important role that the NCA should play in the source country has a
resource implication and that needs to sit with the
legislation.</hs_Para>

of not only this but other questions. Over the years, I have employed
people to look after my children. One young woman was unable to get a

eventually—but she repeatedly could not get one. That is often a

There is a genuine issue about the ability of banks to provide
people with basic bank accounts. The number of hoops they now have to
go through in providing identification can make it genuinely

discover some of the issues concerning children’s rights and
child trafficking in particular. Nigeria is the main source country for
people trafficked into this country, so it is vital that great thought
is given to whether a British Bill can help to tackle the issue in the
countries of origin. We need to prevent and tackle trafficking at

traffickers are aided by the poverty, and by profits that can be made
along the line. Those profits, as someone is trafficked through

children’s rights are, which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:24:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) described. There is strong
legislation in Nigeria to support children’s rights, but the
desire to tackle such problems is not as widespread as it could be and
they are often excused. We heard of terrible situations in which very
young girls are raped and the rapist then buys off the family for less
than the price of a parking ticket in the UK because of the shame. The
girl will find it very hard to get married if she has the stain of rape
on her and it brings shame on the family. Sometimes that is just a
criminal matter, but sometimes it is to do with
trafficking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000087">I
commend the report of the all-party group to the Minister. It is worth

highlight human rights across that country. That is a wider issue than

want to make a couple of points to the Minister while he is forming the
modern slavery Bill. I reiterate what colleagues have said about
domestic worker visas. Many families in Nigeria see domestic servitude
as the norm. People excuse it and say, “The girl from the
village is getting educated. What’s the problem?”
However, the girl from the village does not have the freedom to move.
Sometimes, families bring such individuals to the 
<?notus-xml column=1182?>UK. Domestic worker visas did provide some
protection. The Minister will know that no immigration system is
perfect and that people will exploit bits around the edges whatever
system is in place. However, things have gone too far the other way and
the Minister needs to ensure that domestic workers are supported. If he
does so, it might stem the flow of such workers into the country and
act as a preventive
measure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:26:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000089">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:26:33"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister for Immigration mentioned in a recent sitting of the
Immigration Public Bill Committee that Operation Paladin is still in
operation. I would be keen to hear more details from the Minister, if
not in this debate then at another time, on how it is working across
different airports. The operation was introduced in Gatwick. Trained
professionals watched the people who were coming into the airport to
see whether the children were related to them. They could recognise
whether a child was trafficked and intervene. That does not prevent
trafficking, but it does stop it at the border. Given the announcement
about further cuts to the Home Office budget, I would be interested to
hear whether there is a threat to Operation Paladin or whether there
are plans to extend it. At the very least, it should be continued. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:27:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Cambridgeshire said, if we are serious about a human

the victims is obviously a big issue. I have had experience of that in
my constituency. The national referral mechanism is important, but it
should not be an alternative to well briefed local agencies, whether
they be social services or schools. There is an opportunity, perhaps
not in legislation but certainly in practice, to ensure that schools
can recognise and understand trafficked children. Churches and
community groups can also have a role. Often, vicars in my constituency
meet trafficked people and are able to have a more honest conversation
with them than they have had with other people. I have met trafficked
people, but it has usually been long after they have been
trafficked.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000091">Schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:28:20"></hs_TimeCode>

very close to them. We need something similar to happen if there is a
suspicion of trafficking while the child is in a safe place. Schools

is a delicate balance to be struck, because if anyone who said that
they had been trafficked 10 years ago got to stay in the country, it
would provide traffickers with an incentive. I am aware that the
Minister has  to tread that line. We must not incentivise
people to  use children as a way to get different treatment in
the

that issue, but that does not mean that we should not take robust

big concern is people who are trafficked and appear many years later. I
regularly meet young people in my surgery. Usually they appear at the
point when they might want to go to university and therefore need
status in this country. On questioning they are vague about what
happened—an aunt or friend of the family brought them in, but
they have lost touch with that adult. That child is not at fault, but
the people who trafficked them have gone—although sometimes we
cannot be sure—and they have great difficulty getting through
the system.</hs_Para>

people are not enslaved, as such, although it is difficult to be sure.
I spoke to one woman at my surgery, and we eventually got to a point in
the conversation where I said, “You have two children, who is
the father?”—I was asking about the father’s
citizenship. I said, “Did you want to sleep with the father of
the children?” and she shrugged and said, “He gave me
somewhere to stay.” In some ways she did not consider herself a
victim because she had been downtrodden to the point where she needed a
roof over her head, and in return the man got what he wanted. There are
real challenges in identifying victims who have been under the radar
for so long that there is no likely prospect of finding their
trafficker. That is a two-pronged issue for the Minister: tackling the
perpetrators, but also supporting the victims.</hs_Para>

people have the right advice once they have been identified as a
potential victim of trafficking. That is important because it helps the

beginning of my remarks I said that prevention was the most important
thing. The Home Office is promising to work with source countries, but
we need resources for that to happen. We hear that often, a law passed
in this Parliament helps Nigerians to tackle corruption and so on, and
similarly, if we get this issue right we may help tackle it in Nigeria.
I think we need a review of our national reporting mechanism.</hs_Para>

would touch on issues concerning child abuse in Africa, although adults
are trafficked too. Traffickers often use witchcraft and juju as a
means of control. Juju priests are held in high
esteem and command a great 
<?notus-xml column=1184?>deal of respect which, when combined with a fear of
witchcraft, means that many people are very vulnerable. People are
afraid of what will happen to them if they declare they have been
trafficked. That fear is hard to understand from the perspective of
many Members in the Chamber today, but it is very real. People are much
controlled and will not escape even if given the chance—it is as
much of a ball and chain as a physical one would be. Trafficking
victims in the UK often display signs that are identifiable with juju
and witchcraft, and the torso of Adam, found floating in the Thames,
first highlighted that very spectacularly to the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000100">The
key issue is identifying victims, as too often that is a barrier. I
hope that an anti-slavery commissioner can be genuinely empowered with
investigation arms and good links to the National Crime Agency and
other police as appropriate, and I will be watching the Government on
that issue. The modern slavery unit should not be a passing fad in the
Home Office, but something real that will engage people. I commend my
colleagues for initiating this debate, and look forward to hearing the
Minister’s
response.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/9ABA345144BB053428F5C15087ABC496E3244231" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 December 2013">Thursday

Johnson</B> (Kingston upon Hull North) (Lab):</Member>  I
congratulate the hon. Members who secured this debate. My hon. Friend
the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart), the excellent chair of the
all-party group on human trafficking and modern day slavery, made a
powerful and well-informed speech. She did so in an inclusive way, and
paid tribute to her predecessor, the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr
Bone), after what was obviously a hard-fought election for the position
of chair. My right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)
also talked about the need to put victims at the heart of the Bill and
for us to lead the world with a modern slavery Bill. I also pay
tribute to Anthony Steen, who did so much to raise this issue in the
last Parliament, and to Baroness Butler-Sloss, who takes a keen
interest in this matter in the other
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000102">Given
that we are debating slavery, it gives me special pride to speak from
the Front Bench as a Hull MP. We have heard many mentions this
afternoon of William Wilberforce, who was also a Hull MP and one of the
leaders of a 20-year campaign to bring about the abolition of the slave
trade. In a Back-Bench debate, it is important to note that he did that
entirely from the Back Benches. The full horror of the slave trade is
remembered at the excellent William Wilberforce museum in Hull, which I
would encourage all hon. Members to visit when they visit our city as
the city of culture in 2017 or before. We are also fortunate to have
the Wilberforce institute for the study of slavery and emancipation,
which is attached to the university of Hull and provides great
information. I am sure that it will also offer support to hon. Members
looking at the draft
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000103">It
is worth reminding the House that when the slave trade was abolished,
through William Wilberforce’s Bill becoming an Act of
Parliament, it was felt appropriate to compensate the slave owners, not
the victims. It is shocking now, but the family of the Liberal Prime
Minister William Gladstone received £93,526 in compensation for
losing their 2,039 slaves after abolition. Several hon. Members have
made the point that we hope that any proceeds that are available will
go to  the victims of this dreadful crime, and perhaps
also  to the police and the Human Trafficking
Foundation.</hs_Para>

pay tribute to all those who have contributed to this excellent debate.
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) spoke
knowledgeably, as ever, about the needs of trafficked children, and
about the need for multi-agency safeguarding hubs to be extended to
every area. My hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)
talked in some harrowing detail about child abuse and slavery in India,
and shocked all hon. Members when he talked about children as young as
three being used as prostitutes. My hon. Friend the Member for
Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) talked knowledgeably
about the EU dimension as well as the Scottish experience, and the need
for the auditing of supply
chains.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000105">The
right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir John Randall)
paid tribute to the NGOs—very important—and also raised
the issue of supply chains. The hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire
(Andrew Selous) talked harrowingly about his constituency experience of
23 British slaves who had been slaves for up to 15 years,
and about the vital work that needs to be done to raise public
awareness of the issue. The hon. Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)
talked about the global sex trade and the hon. Member for Mid
Derbyshire (Pauline Latham) talked about the need to make sure that
people understand it happens anywhere—down our own streets and
roads. The hon. Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay)
talked about the particular issues of electronic payments and civil
penalties that could be used. He made some very interesting points and
I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to them.</hs_Para>

know, and we have heard again today, that modern-day slavery exists. We
think that there are around 27 million people enslaved around
the world. The UK Human Trafficking Centre estimates that at least
2,200 human beings were trafficked into the UK in 2012. In 2009, the
Home Affairs Committee held an investigation into human trafficking and
it estimated that the number is likely to be nearer 5,000. Just two
weeks ago in Lambeth we saw three women escape from what appears to
have been 30 years of enslavement. Few people can understand how that
could happen on an ordinary street in south London, but although that
is an extreme case, it is far from isolated.</hs_Para>

slavery is on the rise. Human beings, mainly women and children, are
being trafficked into and within the UK to work as labourers, domestic
servants, prostitutes, cannabis farmers, forced beggars and to do a
whole range of other jobs.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:39:57"></hs_TimeCode> have had a
number of excellent suggestions this afternoon on what can be done to
tackle this practice, and I know that the Minister will have been
listening carefully.</hs_Para>

put on record that the Opposition support the principle of such an
important Bill on modern-day slavery. We will work constructively with
the Government to ensure the Bill passes within the limited
parliamentary time available, and we will press for a Bill that does
all that is needed to address this horrendous practice. I stress that
the Opposition will be looking for a Bill that puts victims at its
centre and the first step is to recognise who the victims are. The
situations into which people 
<?notus-xml column=1186?>are trafficked either from outside or within the UK
are disparate and we need a system that recognises that. It is not just
neighbours, such as those in the Lambeth case, who fail to recognise
victims in their midst. Too many cases are missed by the police, social
workers, health workers and immigration staff.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120571000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000110"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:40:50"></hs_TimeCode>We
need frontline professionals across a range of sectors to be trained to
recognise trafficking in all its forms. There has to be an
understanding that enslavement does not have to mean chains or cellars.
Once we have identified victims, we need to give them protection and
support, and that is where we think the current system is left wanting.
There is a national referral mechanism to collate information on
victims, but it is currently not fit for purpose. As I mentioned, the
UK Human Trafficking Centre, in collaboration with the Serious
Organised Crime Agency, identified 2,255 human trafficking victims,
whereas the NRM identified 1,186. The failure is equally pronounced for
children: the UK Human Trafficking Centre identified 549 child victims
in 2012, while the NRM identified 349. We think the true figure is
probably much higher. Given that there are 23 bodies authorised to
refer to the NRM, the Government need to address urgently the multiple
deficiencies in the system that are stopping referrals. One measure the
Opposition support fully is the introduction of a commissioner to
oversee the proper collection and use of
information.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000111">Once<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:42:03"></hs_TimeCode>
we have identified victims, we have to ensure that the support is there
to look after them. The support required will depend on the
circumstances in which people have been trafficked. We must not
criminalise human trafficking victims. We have to move away from a
situation where the first instinct of the authorities is to treat
people as an immigration problem rather than as victims. If we are to
get more prosecutions, the first stage has to be to identify and
protect the victims. They will be then be more willing to come forward
as
witnesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:42:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000112">We
know that support for child victims is a particular weakness. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:42:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stockport said, a horrifying 60% of child victims taken
into care go missing. One local authority admitted to losing 90% of
children. This happens because the strength of the bond between child
victim and trafficker is not diminished when the child is taken into
care. Factors that made the child vulnerable in the first place remain
and often the trafficker will retain a psychological hold. Without
special provision, the child will often return to the trafficker. This
is especially true if the child is repatriated. I welcome the vital
cross-border work being done to minimise the risks to children when
they are returned
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000113">Trafficked
children in the UK require specialist care that is tailored to their
individual circumstances. That kind of tailored care will only be
provided if trafficked children are given specialist and independent
guardians. That system has worked elsewhere in Europe, and, as the
Minister will know, was set out in the EU directive on human
trafficking. The Government have so far decided not to introduce a
system of guardians, but I hope they will look at that again. The
Government’s own review, “Still at Risk”, which
was commissioned by the Home Office, was unequivocal about the need for
guardians.</hs_Para>

prosecutions, the Opposition will certainly support the Government in
increasing the penalties for convictions for offences relating to human
trafficking, but will look to the Government to introduce aggravated
offences for such cases as well. We would also support the inclusion of
the specific offence of child trafficking and exploitation, which
currently does not exist. I pay tribute to ECPAT for highlighting that
particular
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:45:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000116">In
conclusion, I commend the Government for their commitment to
introducing a modern slavery Bill, but I urge them not to waste the
opportunity before us. There would be many more prosecutions if we
could identify more victims and give them the support and protection
they need to become witnesses and then help them to rebuild their
lives. Unless the Bill recognises that, we will waste a great
opportunity. I want to finish by quoting William Wilberforce’s
words to the House of Commons on 12 May 1789, which I think sum up the

know the full extent and nature of the criminality involved, hence the
work of the hon. Member for Slough and the all-party group to seek to
identify information more clearly. That was clear, too, from the
contribution of the hon. Member for Stockport. We have seen figures
coming through the national referral mechanism relating to the
provision of support to victims, and information from the UK Human
Trafficking Centre is also relevant. I am clear, however, that that
understates the position, and I expect the numbers to rise over the
coming years. I see it as a good thing, not a bad thing, if we are
better able to identify those in need of support. We will be
strengthening our enforcement response by bringing to justice those
responsible for these heinous
crimes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0003.htm#13120571000126">The
Government are absolutely committed to combating human trafficking and
to supporting and protecting the victims of these appalling crimes. We
have announced plans to introduce a modern slavery Bill, which will
strengthen our response to human trafficking and underpin the work of
law enforcement agencies in prosecuting the perpetrators. In so doing,
we shall be able to identify more victims and ensure that these crimes
are prevented.</hs_Para>

consolidate existing trafficking offences to make it simpler to
prosecute human traffickers. It is important to
assist law enforcement to achieve that. It is
intended to increase the maximum sentence for trafficking
offences to life imprisonment, so that modern-day
slave-drivers 
<?notus-xml column=1189?>will face the full force of the law. The Bill will introduce an
anti-slavery commissioner to oversee efforts to tackle modern slavery

traffickers.</hs_Para>

also about the here and now. I want the draft Bill to make a
difference. It is that crucial first building block. I think it was the
right hon. Member for Birkenhead who said that we were on a journey,

Bill will lead to further action that could be taken by successive
Governments over the years ahead as well.</hs_Para>

support activity without legislation—the practical
issues—is another key point, and it is important that the Home
Secretary has made tackling human trafficking a priority for the new
National Crime Agency, which will provide strong national leadership to
drive forward prosecutions and bring traffickers to justice. My hon.
Friend the Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay),
along with my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) and
others, highlighted the need for greater enforcement. Victim care is
also fundamental to our comprehensive approach to combating

David Winnick</B> (Walsall North) (Lab):</Member> I am pleased to have
the opportunity to speak about the acute water shortages in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories. Perhaps it would be useful if I
started by referring to an article by Giles Fraser, who until recently
was the canon chancellor at St Paul’s cathedral. While on a
visit to a refugee camp near Jerusalem, he went to the local secondary
school, which has 2,000—not 200—pupils. There had not
been any running water there for some nine months—we can only
imagine that type of situation. The pupils did not quite understand the
purpose of the visit, but they hoped that it would bring the
supply of water, but it did not.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120571000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000147">I checked
with the Library yesterday to see whether there had been any response
from the Israelis. Usually the Israeli embassy is quick to respond to
criticism, but apparently there was no response to that article in a
national newspaper, so
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T17:03:12"></hs_TimeCode>I decided to
look further into the situation of water in the territories occupied by
Israel. There can be little doubt that there is much wrong and
unacceptable with the availability of drinkable water and that those
who are under the Israeli occupation are denied access to necessary
water.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120571000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000148">The
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T17:03:42"></hs_TimeCode>reports that
have been made on the situation show that the average Palestinian uses
some 50 litres of water daily, which, as I am sure the Minister is
aware, is just half the amount recommended by the World Health
Organisation, the average Israeli uses at least four times that amount,
and sometimes uses more. Nearly 10% of Palestinian communities in the
west bank—about 200,000 people—have no connection to any
drinking water system at all. That should be of utmost concern to all
Members of Parliament. Because of restrictions on movement, travelling
to buy water is far from easy. Indeed in some circumstances,
Palestinians pay up to 40% of their total income on water
alone.</hs_Para>

Water Committee was established to administer the water arrangements
under the Oslo accords. It is true that both the Israelis and the
Palestinians have representation on that committee, but there is one
snag: Israel has a veto. That veto has been used on new water drilling
for Palestinians. Again, I make a comparison. That veto is frequently
used when it comes to Palestinian water development, but it does not
apply to the settlers or to those who are given every encouragement to

me mention that figure again: 90% of the water in that territory, Gaza,

concern was expressed over the situation in Gaza and rightly so. Lord
Warner had been twice to Gaza and confirmed that 90% of Gaza’s

take access to clean water for granted in the UK. We rarely question
where the water in our taps and sanitation systems comes from and we
assume it will be there again the next day. We take it for granted that
it has been treated effectively to make it safe for us to use. The same
cannot be said of those living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories
today. Water resources there are limited. A lack of rainfall in recent
years, inadequate infrastructure and the inequitable distribution of
water resources with Israel combine to make life very
difficult.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000163">We
cannot do anything about the naturally arid environment, but we can
address the binding human and political constraints that perpetuate
this problem. It is an injustice that in the 21st century Palestinians
should still lack for something as basic as clean water and sanitation.

this
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000164">In
the west bank, the story begins with the unfair and unequal allocation
of resources. Palestinians, as the hon. Gentleman said, are limited to
withdrawing 20% of the water from the aquifers underneath the west
bank. Domestic usage, understandably, is prioritised, leaving little
left over for the vital irrigation of agricultural land. Palestinians
have to buy water from the Israeli national water company to make up
any shortfall. In 2012, this cost about $37million. Illegal Israeli
settlers, on the other hand, do not have to worry—they are free
to consume, on average, four times as much water per capita as
Palestinians in the west
bank.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000165">Around
200,000 Palestinians in the west bank have no access to piped water at
all. Half of Palestinian wells have dried up over the past 20 years.
The only option, as the hon. Gentleman said, is to travel to buy
tankered water—an option made all the more difficult by Israeli 
<?notus-xml column=1195?>movement and access restrictions in place across
much of the west bank. As a result, communities depending on tankered
water pay up to 400% more for every single litre than those connected
to the water network; and, of course, there is no guarantee of its
quality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000166">That
is no minor inconvenience. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Emergency
Water, Sanitation and Hygiene group, which co-ordinates efforts by
around 30 donors and agencies to improve water and sanitation in
the west bank and Gaza. It estimates that in isolated
communities in the west bank, water consumption can be as low
as 20 litres per person per day. Even worse than the hon.
Gentleman’s description of that is the fact that that is the
minimum amount recommended by the World Health Organisation in
emergencies to sustain
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000167">We
are perhaps more accustomed to hearing about such precarious situations
in Gaza. While the situation there has indeed been precarious for a
long time, in recent months things have only got worse. Today, only 15%
of Gaza’s population receive clean running water daily. The Gaza
aquifer is set to become too polluted for use by 2016, and will be
irreversibly damaged by 2020. Just two weeks ago, the failure of the
main sewage pumping station in Gaza City led to 35,000 cubic metres of
raw sewage flooding into the
streets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000168">There
the problem is not so much access to water, but the ability to treat
and distribute it effectively. Why? In part, it is because Israel
continues to limit the import of construction and dual-use materials
into Gaza that are necessary for building pipelines and pumping
stations. The Gazan economy remains stifled, so there is no way in
which it could pay for the infrastructure anyway. Recent actions by
Egypt to close the smuggling tunnels have cut off a lifeline and served
to make the situation even more
difficult.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000169">In
fact, water shortages in the west bank and Gaza are part of a much
bigger problem. Even while the US-led middle east peace talks continue,
life for ordinary Palestinians is getting worse. We have seen a spike
in settlement announcements and demolition orders. Violence has erupted
in east Jerusalem and the west bank and unemployment is on the
rise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000170">To
make the case for peace, which this Government firmly believe in, we
need to bring about real and tangible change on the ground, and to do
so before it is too late. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs has made clear, there is no
more urgent global priority in 2013 than the search for middle east
peace. We see a two-state solution as the best way to meet the national
aspirations of both Israelis and
Palestinians.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120571000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/debtext/131205-0004.htm#13120571000171">So,
first, we will continue to support efforts to achieve a negotiated
peace. Working with our EU partners and with the US, we will encourage
both Israelis and Palestinians to take the bold steps needed to reach
an agreement. Hard work and difficult choices lie ahead, but we are
ready to provide support in any way we can. In part, that will include
support to the Kerry-led economic package to foster private sector led,
sustainable economic growth in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories.</hs_Para>

lead to a successful conclusion next year. In the meantime, to assist
those discussions, we in the Department for International Development
and the Government, working with the EU, are doing our best to underpin
some economic progress. For instance, our plan aims to generate
investment of $4 billion, increase Palestinian gross domestic product
over the next three years, and reduce unemployment to single digits.

will continue to lobby Israel to make good on its promises made in
September to improve access to water for Palestinians. This includes
doubling the amount of water sold to the Gaza strip, and reviving the
Joint Water Committee to adopt a truly co-operative approach to shared
water resources. We know that Israel has made excellent progress in
water technology in recent years. From drip-irrigation to desalination,
perhaps no other country has contributed more breakthroughs in the area
of water and food security than Israel. What an opportunity there is

£1.8 million to restore agricultural wells serving nearly 1,000

That is not the logic that we adopt. We believe that our support for
the Palestinian Authority is underpinning an organisation that is a

is our wish to build a viable Palestinian state and to protect those
who are most vulnerable. On the specific topic of this debate, water
shortages are a stark reminder of the harshness of Palestinian daily
life. From the farmer in the west bank who cannot grow the same produce
as his settler neighbour, to the family in Gaza having to wade through
sewage to get home, the situation is unfair and untenable. Indeed, it
is unjust. It is essential that peace negotiations on a two-state
solution include discussions on shared water resources as part of a
final status agreement, and it is essential that Israel makes good on
its promises to improve access to water. In the meantime, Her

300,000 governors across the country perform an important job, and hon.
Members on both sides of the House would want to send our thanks for
the service that they perform in their communities. Holding schools to
account for the quality of the education that they offer to pupils is a
serious responsibility, and it is not all about external bodies; it is
important that governors have the skills, self-confidence and ability
to fulfil that role. Many governors offer outstanding advice and
service, and they devote large amounts of time and expertise to
monitoring and improving the schools in their
charge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:31:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000009">By
contrast, recent events at the Al-Madinah school in Derby underscore
the importance of governance and the need for robust intervention when
it is failing. The school’s chair of governors, Shazia Parveen,
resigned in late October, and the remaining trustees finally resigned
last month. Despite the shambles over which they had been presiding,
the governors of the Al-Madinah school were under no obligation to
resign; nor could they have been forced to do so under current
regulations. That example is extreme and unusual, but I should be
grateful to the Minister if she told us whether she thinks that the
current situation is satisfactory, or whether changes need to be made
to the regulatory framework to ensure that such people can be replaced
sooner if they are clearly failing in their
duties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:32:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000010">There
is considerable variation in the quality of governance across different
types of schools. The former chief inspector stated in Ofsted’s
2010-11 annual report that governance was good or outstanding in 71% of
special schools and 64% of secondary schools, but only 55% of primary
schools and just 53% of pupil referral units had such a rating, which
is not
acceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000011">School<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:32:53"></hs_TimeCode>
governance has recently been scrutinised by the Government. In
September 2012, Ministers introduced regulations that provide greater
flexibility to the governing bodies of maintained schools to
reconstitute themselves, so that they may be smaller, with an emphasis

inquiry, we found that schools are not making the most of the freedoms

second recommendation is that the Government should work more closely
with the CBI to recruit governors, as business is potentially an
important source of capable governors. Will the Minister say something
more about that? I know that the CBI is keen and is working with the
Government. The CBI and other business groups are looking to get more
involved. I would be interested to hear more from the Minister on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000017">Linked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:34:35"></hs_TimeCode>
to those issues is the fact that the barriers to recruitment must be
removed. For example, the current legal requirement to give time off
for the governors of maintained schools has not yet been extended to
academy governors. That obvious oversight needs to be addressed. Last
week, the CBI echoed our call for academy governors to receive time off
to fulfil their duties. Will the Minister commit today that academy
governors will be given the same time and opportunity to do their work
as governors of maintained
schools?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000018">The
third part of our inquiry concerns whether governors receive good
training or, indeed, proper training at all. The Government told us
that such training can be encouraged through Ofsted. Our report
recommends that Ministers report back in due course on whether
Ofsted’s intervention has been effective and, if it has not,
reconsider making training mandatory for all
governors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000019">We
were also concerned by suggestions that few quality alternatives are
emerging to the training that local authorities traditionally provide,
which has been reduced in recent years. Ofsted and the Department for
Education need to monitor the availability and quality of governor
training, particularly in the context of greater academisation and
reduced local authority services. If school governing bodies in the new
context have even greater responsibility than under the old system, it
is essential that the services to support those governing bodies and
the training available to them is improved, rather than reduced, in
quality and
scope.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000020">Ofsted
has sharpened its focus on governance, which the Committee welcomes
wholeheartedly. Part of  Ofsted’s new approach, for
example, is to provide a clear description within its inspection

highlighting the importance of a good clerk to the success of a
governing body. The evidence indicates that that should be a
professional role, similar to a company secretary, and it is an
important recommendation of our report. SGOSS may be ideally placed to
take on the role of recruiting clerks, while simultaneously ensuring
some sort of quality assurance. I would be grateful to learn

also need to be equipped with high-quality information and guidance. We
are particularly concerned that the revised governors’ handbook,
which contains less detailed guidance than the previous version, is
aimed only at new governors. Will the Minister inform us of what steps,

also welcome Ofsted’s new data dashboard, which will help
governing bodies to become more adept at using performance data
effectively. It is important to note that, although the data dashboard
provides an easier route to start grappling with such data, it is not
the end of the road. One would hope that governors will use the data
dashboard to get a feel for the issues and then delve more deeply into
the data, to hold their schools effectively to

believe that Ofsted should explicitly recommend IEBs following an

State for Education have been reluctant to use their powers of

procedures, subject to approval by the Secretary of State. Such
freedoms for academies have led to the evolution of new models of
governance, from which lessons could be learned in many cases. Our
report highlighted some confusion, however, about the accountability of
some academy governance models, and we made three main recommendations.
First, the Government should identify the roles of governors in the
different types of academy. Secondly, the Government should explain how
relevant local groups, including pupils, parents and staff, should have
a voice in the business of the governing body and the running of the
school. Thirdly, clarity should be provided on how decisions are made
in academies, along with details of where to turn should concerns

doubt, governing bodies within schools play a critical leadership role,
but inadequate governance is not addressed frequently enough and has
ramifications that reverberate far beyond the governors’ meeting
room and reach into the classroom. School governors provide the
strategic leadership and accountability that are so important in
determining the success of our schools. Governors appoint head teachers
and other staff and in some instances, as trustees, own the school
grounds. Governors are responsible for school finance, and they work
with head teachers to make the tough decisions about balancing
resources. In many cases, governors are actually dependent—often
over-dependent—on their head teacher to enable them to fulfil
their role, particularly in primary schools. That is why one of the key
focuses of our report was on training, the need for it to be
comprehensive and good enough to ensure that governors know their
responsibilities, and how to get the information they need to make
decisions and to hold the head teacher and staff robustly to
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000040">Some
300,000 people serve as school governors across the country, and we can
be proud of the majority, who do an excellent job leading our schools
and have a true passion for improving education in their communities.
We must not forget that these individuals are unpaid and that, as such,
governors constitute the largest volunteer group in the UK. We owe them
a tremendous debt of gratitude. They do their very best in what I know
from nearly 30 years of first-hand experience can be exceptionally
challenging circumstances.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:45:06"></hs_TimeCode> cannot,
however, overlook the areas of weakness and the room for improvement.
We must not lose sight of what the system does well, but attempting to
convince ourselves that it is perfect would only make things worse. I
was therefore pleased to have the opportunity, as part of the Education
Committee, to examine the issues in much more
detail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000041">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:45:25"></hs_TimeCode>
of my principal concerns when exploring the evidence to put the report
together was the high vacancy rate on governing bodies, and the
difficulties that many schools experience in recruiting. That, of
course, can contribute to other shortcomings, such as a lack of the
necessary skills base to fulfil core functions. Department 
<?notus-xml column=336?>for Education figures suggest that 11% of roles nationally are vacant.
Having been responsible for nominating and appointing school governors
for Cleveland county council before it was disbanded, and then for
Stockton borough council for several years thereafter, I know the
magnitude of the problem and the repercussions for the quality of
governance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000042">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:46:18"></hs_TimeCode>
also appreciate that the difficulty in recruiting governors can vary
enormously within the boundaries of a single local authority, let alone
between different authority areas. The Committee took evidence to that
effect from the National Governors Association, which confirmed that a
large proportion of governing bodies have considerable difficulty in
finding skilled governors. It is common sense that schools in cities
and large urban areas are often better able to attract individuals with
the specific skills required successfully to carry out the functions of
a governor. From my experience, I know that that is not equally the
case for smaller towns, let alone more rural areas, and so was able to
relate to the observation, submitted to the Committee by the National
College for Teaching and Leadership, that there is significant evidence
that governors are recruited for their representative role, rather than
for a particular skill
set.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000043">Some
schools struggle to attract governors not only from the community and
local business, but also from among parents, who may not have the
confidence or do not think they have sufficient experience. I remember
well talking with head teachers across the Stockton borough about their
struggles to persuade capable parents to agree to put their names
forward. The idea that an election would ever be necessary was, in many
cases, a fantasy. It is true that a wholly representative structure
would not necessarily lead to high-quality governance. It is equally
the case, however, that governors recruited on the basis of skills
alone may lack the all-important community knowledge that enables our
schools to cater to specific local circumstances and challenges. An
adequate skills base therefore need not be at odds with representation,
but it is important to get the balance right, and training is the key
element.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000044">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:48:14"></hs_TimeCode>
was therefore pleased that the Committee’s report welcomed the
Government’s commitment to raise the profiles of school
governors. Governors, like teachers, are pillars of the community, but
I often wonder whether they realise how important they are to our
education system. Clearly highlighting the importance of governors, who
have the potential to shape the future of our young people by ensuring
provision of the highest educational standards, is a fundamental first
step if we are to attract the most able candidates, and I welcome moves
to make specific functions clear in both legislation and the
governors’ handbook.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:48:50"></hs_TimeCode> am more
cautious in welcoming the removal of rules and regulations, in
particular where they exist to safeguard important standards and
performance, although I appreciate that it will be necessary in some
cases to allow for greater flexibility to take decisions, as that can
impact positively on educational
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000045">During<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:49:08"></hs_TimeCode>
the final part of my speech, I want to concentrate again on training,
and on my concerns about the Government’s failure to give clear
direction on the need for both proper training and bodies to deliver
it, particularly in the light of more and more schools opting to become
academies, and the run-down of local authority services in the face of
cuts inflicted due to both the academies programme and general central
Government policy.</hs_Para>

Short, now retired, who ran the governor support service in
Stockton-on-Tees when I was cabinet member for children and young
people. His team won awards for the quality of its provision, and
governors in the area had better understanding of their roles and
responsibilities as a result. Even then, not all governors undertook
training, and some did little towards sharing the burden of the
governing body’s work
load<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:49:56"></hs_TimeCode>. It is all
very well to stand at the school gate and say, “I am a parent
governor”, but often such people did not know about anything
other than saying, “I am a parent governor”, or how to do
anything other than attend the
meetings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000047">We
have a new kind of leader, and even governor, in the brave new world of
academies and free schools; some do extremely well, but there are
examples of failure, and some recent reports have shown that. If we are
to get the best from our governors, however, they must be trained
properly and, if they take on extra responsibility, such as being chair
of the governors or of the finance and staffing sub-committee, they
ought to undergo even more training. Not every school can attract an
accountant, a human resources professional and a lawyer to sit on its
governing body—though I would argue that they, too, should
undergo compulsory training. The Government must therefore ensure that
such training is available, but sadly, Ministers do not appear to
agree<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:51:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120553000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120553000048">I
do not want to defeat my own argument by suggesting that Members
present might point out that even Ministers do not undergo training for
their roles when appointed by the Prime Minister, and they are dealing
with matters of state. There should, however, be training for
governors, who have day-to-day responsibility for the most important
people in our community and ought to know what they are doing. I hope
that the Government will rethink the need for high-quality, preferably
compulsory, training, and having done so, that they will make the
resources available to provide it for maintained schools, academies and
free schools

What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:56:29"></hs_TimeCode> is

standards in their businesses, whether they are a recruitment firm, a
manufacturer or whatever; and, secondly, on the other side of the coin,
businesses will be able to talk to education as a whole and schools in

it, as we are probably done and dusted with IEBs—is that if the

Accountability rests on that point. The real interface of
accountability is between governors and parents. If parents think that
the governing body simply is not doing a good enough job, they should
be able to dismiss it. It is important to give parents as a group the
capacity to make a decision as big as that, in defence of their

problem with stakeholder representation and all that sort of thing is
that it actually dilutes accountability: the fact is that once parents

because the people on those boards are focused, dedicated, highly

all governing bodies everywhere should be small and similar in make-up
to IEBs. That is simply not possible, given the weight of work required
of governing bodies. That was the evidence we heard: as Professor Chris
James of the university of Bath said, there is no statistical
relationship between governing body effectiveness and governing body
size or vacancies. I put it to my hon. Friend that there is no evidence

governing bodies. First, with a governing body of about 20, the
influence of individuals is diluted. That applies to any committee
system, including school governance. Secondly, it is not necessary to
replicate exactly an interim executive board because that would be
counter-productive. The word “interim” does not imply
permanence, the word “executive” does not imply strategic
decision making, and the word “board” is not commonly
used in schools. The characteristics of IEBs and how they operate are
important and we should think about how that might influence the way in

the ultimate option—parents revolting—but there are
processes between doing nothing and using a “nuclear
deterrent”. Those processes must be teased out and must have
some relationship with measurement of attainment and inspection of

school governing body between individuals with specific skills and
representatives of stakeholder groups, as we have discussed today.
Overall, there was agreement with the DFE’s view that the
stakeholder model does not preclude skills, but conversely, several
witnesses felt that individuals recruited for specific skills may lack
important local or community

experienced that—we have spoken about it today—when we

was a school governor, back in the mid-’90s at a school in
Kilburn, and in the late noughties at a school in Hampshire. At both
schools, the experience was very interesting. In the mid-’90s,
we seemed to spend a lot of time talking about children and teachers,
but by the time I next became a school governor 10 years later, most of
the agenda at our meetings seemed to be focused on whether we had done
this or that policy update, or what about the charter mark we were
going for, or what about this and what about that. As a consequence,
the amount of time we spent speaking about children and teachers was
dramatically reduced. I am pleased to see that there seems to have been
quite a revolution in reducing the amount of direction given, and in
allowing good school governing bodies to get going. However,

terms of recruitment and retention, my experience is that one of the
barriers to becoming a school governor—at the moment in my
constituency, I am trying to encourage people to become school
governors—is perhaps the perception of the amount of time it
takes, and the feeling about what value people can add. We know that
some of the brightest and best business people are already dragged into
so many other situations and are being asked to give their time,
whether on issues to do with the future of the high street, their
business association, or the chamber of commerce. Nevertheless, I find
that when people do the work, they really enjoy it, and recognise that
an effective governing body is critical to the good—if not
outstanding—performance of a school. I encourage more people to
come from business, but also from our public sector.</hs_Para>

the tools available, the Committee was right to talk about data, such
as those data provided by RAISEonline—reporting and analysis for
improvement through school self-evaluation. Although I have a PhD, I
will not pretend that it is always the easiest thing to encounter cold,
but it gives people very detailed information about children’s
progress. That is why I was so pleased to see the data dashboard that
came from Ofsted last year. Some amendments have already been made to
it, to try to focus on the key issues. I have been to every school in
my constituency and have met plenty of school governors, and I took
great delight in encouraging them to use the tool. I cannot wait for
the next set of results to come out, so that we can continue to try to
understand whether progress is being
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:26:25"></hs_TimeCode>.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:26:33"></hs_TimeCode> division
between key stage 1 and key stage 2 was particularly illuminating for
some primary school governors in deciding where they should be focusing
their efforts, and I welcome that.</hs_Para>

my <hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:26:37"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Friend
the Member for Beverley and Holderness referred to clerks. He is so
right: they can make a critical difference to whether a governing body
is effective. High levels of training should be made available, and I
recommend that clerks should not serve in a school for more than a
certain number of terms—not school terms, but terms of
appointment—because it is useful to exchange clerks and make
sure that things stay fresh and that the latest ideas come
in.</hs_Para>

agree with the Government on pay; I do not think that we should pay
school governing bodies. As is pointed out in the Government response,
it is open to any governing body to buy in services, and that is very
useful. Federations are a new model of governance.  I represent
a mainly rural seat, and with 54 schools in 300 square
miles—some of those schools are very small—there are,
rightly, increasingly moves towards more federations, the sharing of
head teachers and so on. However, what has not happened yet, but should
happen, is a merging of the governing bodies of those schools. I
understand why people might feel concern that that reduces
accountability, but it absolutely does not. There should be a
partnership across schools. A suggestion was made in the Royal Society
for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce report on
Suffolk schools, called “No school an island”, to have
parents’ 
<?notus-xml column=346?>councils to ensure—how can I put it?—that schools do not
feel ignored. We see services merging, and the sharing of head teachers
and senior
teachers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:28:24"></hs_TimeCode>; I
think we need to see the same with our school governing
bodies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120555000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120555000018">In
terms of the mix of skills, I wonder, at some schools, how prepared
governors are to be critical friends. It is not the role of the
chairman or chairwoman of the governing body to be only a cheerleader.
We see that dilemma at the BBC: is the noble Lord Patten a cheerleader,
or a critical friend of the BBC Trust? We have the same challenge for
our school governing bodies; we must try to address what is really
going on.</hs_Para>

should ensure that their teachers are up to scratch, but there is also
another challenge. In one of the governing bodies on which I
served—thankfully, I joined just after this took place—it
took more than two years to try to displace a head teacher who was
simply letting children down. It is very challenging for governors to
do that kind of thing, and sometimes, the easiest way out is simply to
do nothing at all.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:29:30"></hs_TimeCode> has been said
eloquently today, we cannot allow that to happen, which is why I am
very pleased to see that a number of colleagues—I do not know
how they manage to fit it in—continue to be school governors.

round of inspections in Suffolk, his school moved up the ratings to
“good”. I shall be honest: many schools in Suffolk went
the other way, so I thought that that was good for its credibility. I
need to inspire myself to take that leap and go and do something to

shall focus on a number of the themes on which the Select Committee
report makes recommendations. The Chair of the Select Committee, in
particular, highlighted some of these points. First, the Select
Committee recommended mandatory training for governors. This is a
crucial issue. As I said, it is crucial in this time of change that we
ensure proper accountability. At a time when local education
authorities are losing powers of oversight and there is no clarity
about what the role of a middle tier would be, it would be helpful for

ensuring that
accountability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120555000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120555000027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Graham Stuart" PimsId="4814" UID="13120555000051" xid="803" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120555000051">Mr

recommend that training should be mandatory. We said that that should

The point is that appropriate training is vital. According to
<I>T</I><I>he</I> <I>Times Educational Supplement</I>, 93% of the
respondents to the joint survey said that this would be helpful; they
supported training. That reinforces the Select Committee’s
recommendation. The Government should examine the issue closely,
genuinely to ensure that governors have the appropriate support and
that schools get the kind of governing body that they need to respond
to the challenges of running their institutions. Governors need to feel
equipped and able to perform their role effectively and work towards
building achievement and raising standards in schools. In the end, that
is what motivates people in communities to take part in this work as
volunteers. They give their time and make that contribution to see a

seen schools taking on this role actively and ensuring that proper
training is provided. I certainly benefited from training as a governor
of a further education college. The charitable organisations that
provide training to governors, not just of schools and colleges but of
charities, charitable organisations and social enterprises, are vital.
The question is about those schools that currently are not able or

<?notus-xml column=350?>excellent and well thought through report, which casts valuable light on
an important issue in our education system that does not always get the

Government believe that school governance has a vital role to play in
driving up school and pupil performance. In an increasingly school-led
system, we need governing bodies that create robust local
accountability, and the future of schools is truly in governors’
hands. As has been said in the debate, there are more than 300,000
governors across the country, all of whom give of their time with great
passion and effort to improve schools, and to improve the lives and
outcomes of the children who attend them. Schools need dynamic,
confident and skilled governing bodies that understand their
responsibilities and are focused on their core functions. Many
governors benefit from their role as school governors, which helps them
to build up their skills in leadership and management, and improve
their understanding of what goes on in schools and the community. We
must all highlight the benefits of being a governor when we talk about
that extremely important role.</hs_Para>

Government have made several reforms to improve the ease with which
governing bodies can operate, and more sharply to focus the work of
governing bodies on improving educational standards in schools. As
several hon. Members have mentioned, new regulations have set out the
strategic role of the governing body and the central role of the chair
in setting the vision of the school, holding the head teacher to
account for educational performance and ensuring that the
school’s money is well spent. Those functions reflect the
criteria that Ofsted inspectors use when they consider the
effectiveness of governing bodies. Ofsted plays an important role in
ensuring that those governing bodies are fit for purpose.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey) commented, governing
bodies may unfortunately have been diverted on to other issues of less
strategic importance. The purpose of our reforms is to ensure that
governors can spend more time holding the head teacher to account,
ensuring that funds are well spent and that the quality of education in
the school is high. One of my roles in the Department is to implement
the new national curriculum, which will be ready in September 2014. I
see one of the key roles of the governing body as ensuring that that
implementation takes place and that schools take advantage of their new
freedoms to create new school curricula. The governing body is a
helpful conduit of information between the school and the
community.</hs_Para>

for schools to use their budgets effectively. Ensuring that governors
get the quality training they need is an effective way to do so. There
might be a debate about how we achieve those objectives, but our view
is that the outcomes of the Ofsted inspection process are the best way
to make an assessment, rather than insisting on mandatory training,
which can sometimes become a tick-box exercise. We want high-quality

number of points were raised about accountability. As the programme for
international student assessment outcomes has shown this week, autonomy
and accountability are two of the key drivers in any successful
education system. Lord Nash told the Select Committee that he thought
the Ofsted inspection framework was the sharpest tool in the box for
improving the quality of governance. I certainly think that is true.
Any school failure is a failure of governance. Interim executive boards
can be an effective solution in certain schools to secure a step change
in the schools’ performance, through a complete change in the
school’s leadership and management. IEBs are not always
necessary; sometimes the governing body can
self-improve—ultimately, it is up to the local authority or the
Secretary of State if the school is in an Ofsted category. Where
individual governors are not pulling their weight, it is a matter for
the chair of governors. We would like all chairs to have annual
conversations to take stock with every member of the governing body.
Ultimately, it is the chair’s responsibility to ensure that
members of the governing body have the skills they need to do the

I mentioned, the Government recognise the value and benefits of

bring opportunities for a far more strategic perspective and the
ability to contrast between schools in the grouping. That can bring
more robust accountability for head teachers, because the governors
have more points of comparison when looking at different schools. In
the next version of the model funding agreement, we will offer
multi-academy trusts even greater flexibility by allowing local

to have this debate today. The Minister looks shocked and horrified at
the prospect of my summing up, but I am sure she will survive. We have
had contributions by hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber, and
thoughtful ones at that. Many of them were from Members who not only
sit on the Select Committee and hear the evidence we receive, but who,
prior to that, spent many years on governing bodies themselves, trying
to making a difference to schools.</hs_Para>

her response to the debate, the Minister said, “The
future of schools is truly in governors’ hands.” The
Government have made good progress in taking the role of governors
seriously; I congratulate her on that. I and the other members of the
Committee will be delighted that the Government will be working with
the CBI, the School Governors’ One-Stop Shop and, I assume, the
national college on a campaign to promote the role of governors, in
order to attract more people to be governors and to make a difference
by filling the empty places for governors that we have heard
about.</hs_Para>

would not be doing my job if I did not chide the Minister on one thing,
which concerns the legal requirement to release staff. At the moment,
companies are obliged to release staff for maintained schools but not
for academies. Now, either the Government think that that requirement
is an over-regulation and it should be abolished, so that all schools
are on the same playing field, or they should extend that to cover
academies. I cannot see any case—intellectually or
otherwise—for justifying an unlevel playing field, such as the
situation we are in now. So I ask the Minister to look at that issue
again.</hs_Para>

have one final point. My understanding, and it may well be incorrect,
is that the Secretary of State does not have the power to appoint an
interim executive board for an academy; they have the power only to
rescind the funding agreement. However, I may be wrong about that. If
it turns out that the Minister is incorrect, perhaps she could write to

very helpful in ensuring that we are all on the same page on that

Committee published our report, “School sport following London
2012: No more political football”, in July this year. As the
first anniversary of the Olympic and Paralympic games approached, we
wanted to hold a short inquiry into school sport. Both the 2012 games
were an extraordinary display of sport’s potential to inspire,
move and excite us. For young people watching, the achievements of the
likes of Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and David Weir were a tremendous
example of what hard work and dedication can achieve, as well as a
great advert for a healthy lifestyle.</hs_Para>

games represented a badly needed opportunity to turn the tide. For too
many young people today, sport does not play a significant role in
their lives. As a consequence, they are significantly less fit than
previous generations. In November, American researchers published an
ambitious new dataset, covering more than 25 million children across 28
countries. It showed that children today run a mile 90 seconds slower
than their counterparts from 30 years ago. Closer to home, in this
country, one in five children are now overweight or obese when they
enter reception class. The figure rises to nearly one in three by the
end of primary education. That gives some sense of the scale of the
challenge that faces us as a nation.</hs_Para>

were delighted by the interest in our inquiry. Our online survey about
sports provision in schools received more than 300 responses from
teachers, while a similar survey of young people received nearly 800
replies. We also visited three schools in east London: Hallsville
primary school and Curwen primary school in Newham; and Barking Abbey
school, a sports specialist college for 11 to
18-year-olds<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:04:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000037">What
were our main conclusions about school sport? First, we concluded that
just as the foundations for verbal literacy and numeracy are
established in the primary years of school, so too must the foundations
of “physical literacy” be established. School is the one
place where all young people have access to sporting activities, and it
is where a lifelong sporting habit can be formed and built upon, which
should be a priority for every
pupil<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:05:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000038">The
Government’s position on school sport, as outlined in December
2010, emphasised the role of competitive sport. However, many witnesses
told us that a focus on competition discourages some children,
particularly girls. The Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation has
reported 
<?notus-xml column=356?>that as many as half of girls are currently put off being active by
their experiences of PE and sport in school. It is not that schools
should not offer competitive sport—far from it. They should
offer both competitive and non-competitive sporting opportunities, to
ensure that sport provision appeals and is accessible to all
pupils<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:05:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000039">Our
second conclusion was about how school sport is delivered.
Pupils’ opportunities to become involved in school sports are
often limited by a lack of facilities. For example, we were concerned
about the availability of accessible swimming pools, especially as a
recent survey by the Amateur Swimming Association found that around
half of children aged between 7 and 11 could not swim 25 metres. Think
about that; it is a truly sobering statistic.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000040">That
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:06:10"></hs_TimeCode> could be
tackled through partnerships between schools to promote the sharing of
facilities and, where possible, by encouraging private schools to make
their pools available to local state schools. However, fruitful
co-operation between schools is not simply a question of sharing
physical resources; it also involves co-operating to set up sporting
events. School sport partnerships were highly regarded by many
witnesses. Their main strength lay in the links and networks that they
created, particularly between school sport and community
sport—the clubs in the communities around schools.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000041"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:06:48"></hs_TimeCode>Evidence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
suggests that the Government’s decision to end funding for SSPs
has had a negative impact on young people’s opportunities to
access competitive sport in school. The Smith Institute reports that a
third of schools have experienced a decrease in school sports since the
end of the ring-fenced funding for SSPs.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:07:07"></hs_TimeCode> our report,
we recommended that the Government should devise a new strategy for
school sport, building on the many positive elements of the SSP model.
Can the Minister provide us with an update today on whether the
Government intend to take such a strategy forward and, if so, on when
we can expect it?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000042">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:07:13"></hs_TimeCode>
third finding related to the quality of sport teaching in schools.
Ofsted has found that PE teaching needs improvement in 30% of the
primary schools that it visited, and as I said earlier, it is at
primary level that we need to get high-quality sport teaching in place,
to build the positive attitudes, habits and interests for lifelong
sporting activity. Research by the Youth Sport Trust shows that many
primary teachers lack the confidence and competence to deliver PE
properly.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000043">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
particular, we were very concerned by the discovery that many
mainstream schools are unable to provide sport for disabled children,
who are too often sent to the library instead of participating in
sport. Initial teacher training for primary school teachers should
include a more substantial course on PE, including PE for children with
disabilities or special
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:08:06"></hs_TimeCode>. When the
Minister responds, I would be grateful to him if he clarified what
action he will take to ensure that new teachers receive the training
that they need, particularly at primary level, to deliver the
transformation that the figures that I mentioned at the beginning of my
speech show is clearly required.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000044"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:08:18"></hs_TimeCode>If
all these things are to take place, the right funding framework needs
to be in place. The fourth conclusion of our report was that the
Government need to ensure that sustained funding is available for
school sport. Successive Governments have failed to provide long-term 
<?notus-xml column=357?>stability in this area, and the coalition should avoid falling into the
same trap. The SSPs, which I have already mentioned, were undeniably
expensive, and it is worth remembering that the previous Labour
Government’s plan was not that SSPs should continue; they had
planned for SSPs to come to an end.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000045"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>The
Government now propose to introduce the primary sport premium, which
was announced in March this year. We believe that this programme is
correctly focused on the primary phase of education. However, it is due
to last for only two years. That is simply not long enough for schools
to develop lasting provision. If the primary sport premium is not
extended, this very worthwhile idea risks becoming yet another
short-term
fix<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000046">Must
we wait for a major sports event to be hosted in this country before
the then Government announce some short-term measure? Occasional
attempts at pump-priming or, more cynically, headline grabbing, are
simply not good enough.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:09:44"></hs_TimeCode> are also
concerned that head teachers lack simple guidance on using this funding
in the best way to meet the needs of their pupils and staff.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:09:50"></hs_TimeCode>Will the
Minister therefore promise to look into how funding can be arranged for
the long term? Will he also tell us what progress has been made on
providing detailed guidance for schools, so that they can make the most
of the primary sport premium in the time that it has
left<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:10:05"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000047">Of
course, improving school sport is not simply a question of funding. Our
fifth finding was that schools need to be made more accountable for
their PE and sport provision. That would prevent resources from being
diverted to areas on which schools are measured and held to account.
Schools are rightly strongly held to account for the outcomes of their
pupils, but where something is not a central focus for the school, it
will be put to the side, and that happens all too often with
sport.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000048">Until<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:10:40"></hs_TimeCode>
2010, schools were required to report on the number of pupils who
participated in at least two hours a week of PE or sport. We
acknowledge criticisms that that measure did not capture information
about the quality of pupil engagement—it was not
perfect—but we are concerned that, without some measure of
activity, schools are not fully accountable for whether their pupils
receive a decent amount of exercise. At the moment, it is highly
unlikely that a head teacher will find their job under threat because
they have failed woefully to provide for their pupils’ physical
needs, so they concentrate entirely on the
academic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:11:11"></hs_TimeCode>. We
therefore recommended that schools be required to report annually on
their website the proportion of children involved in at least two hours
of core PE each week. If the Minister has alternative proposals, we
would like to hear them, but sport at the moment goes by the bye, and
that cannot be allowed to continue.</hs_Para>

the time spent on PE and sport, the need to monitor the quality of
teaching and provision was a theme that ran through all the evidence
that we received. The Youth Sport Trust told us about school games
kitemarks, which have been introduced to measure the quality of
provision in schools. Schools should be encouraged to achieve such
quality marks, but they should check that the scheme that they enter is
sufficiently rigorous and
meaningful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:11:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

summarised our main recommendations. Five months on from our report,
where do we stand? I confess to being rather disappointed. Although the
Government response to our report was broadly supportive, it avoided
committing to specific actions or a changed agenda. It did not address
our concern about the need for a longer-term funding
commitment—quite the contrary. Nor did Ministers make any
conclusive statements about their plans to improve schools’
access to sport facilities. Regarding our concern that schools need to
be more accountable for the quality and quantity of sport provided, the
response implied satisfaction with current accountability structures.
Like many Government Members and possibly Opposition Members, I do not
want unnecessary bureaucracy and regulation, but in a schools system
driven by the outcomes on which schools are measured and held to
account, we must ensure that important factors such as sport do not
lose out, as they do  today.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000051"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:12:59"></hs_TimeCode>The
Government response is all the more disappointing because, last month,
the House of Lords Committee on Olympic and Paralympic Legacy published
a report that largely echoed our concerns. It found that an exclusive
focus on competitive sport risks discouraging some children from
participating. That may be controversial in the <I>Daily Mail</I>, but
I do not think that it is controversial with anyone who has had any
experience of working with different children. The Committee reported
that the difference in participation between young people with a
limiting disability and those without is “unacceptably
stark”. Its report highlighted the need for teachers,
particularly in primary schools, to have specific training and skills
to teach PE, and it called on the Government to conduct a review of
initial training for specialist PE
teachers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:13:50"></hs_TimeCode>. Their
lordships also identified the importance of co-operation between
schools, particularly between primary and secondary
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:13:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000053">There
is, therefore, great consensus about what needs to happen and about
what is at stake. This summer, Public Health England reported that 70%
of young people do not undertake the recommended one hour’s
physical activity each day. What we do to address that lies in our
hands. Sport is important for all our children, not just future Olympic
hopefuls. I am optimistic that London 2012 can have a long-term legacy,
but we need to do more to ensure that the promise that the games would

that is to happen, there is a challenge for every part of the system.
Schools need to offer competitive and non-competitive sporting
opportunities to maximise participation. The Government need to commit
to longer-term funding provision and to hold schools properly to
account. Teachers need to be properly trained, so they are confident in
delivering high-quality PE and school sport. That is not rocket
science, but it will require sustained funding, focus and ministerial
support. In other words, it will require precisely the qualities that
made the London Olympics such a success and that could now revitalise
sport in our schools if Ministers take this

Cunningham</B> (Stockton North) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Sir Alan. As with my earlier
contribution on school governors, 
<?notus-xml column=359?>I hope to offer further insight into the Committee’s
thoughts—this time on school sports in the post-2012
environment—while expressing some of my own thoughts along the
way.</hs_Para>

doubts the importance of physical activity, and of having opportunities
to participate in sport from a young age. Nowhere is that more
appropriate than in our schools, where children are a captive audience
and can learn of the full range of benefits that involvement can
bring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:15:46"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not
need to go into detail, because every Member present knows that sport
can nurture the very best personal attributes; develop strong skills
that cut across social, educational and physical frontiers; and inspire
advancement away from the sporting arena.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000057">Needless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:16:04"></hs_TimeCode>
to say, the Committee’s report rightly recognised the importance
of school sport as a central piece in that bigger picture. We were in
broad agreement that the correct target for future Government
investment is primary school level, as funding would allow positive
messages and benefits to reach children at an early age and to
stimulate the formation of positive attitudes that will shape future
behaviours and, hopefully, last a lifetime.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000058">That builds
on the need for the Government to develop a long-term strategy for
school sport, matched by sufficient funding to promote that vision. The
primary sport premium, which is doubtless a step in the right
direction, is not sufficient in itself. Similarly, while the Committee
welcomed the Government’s announcement that 120 primary school
specialists are to be trained, I share the concern that such a
programme will struggle to improve sport provision across the 17,000
primary schools in England. With each specialist responsible for an
average of 142 schools, I have difficulty imagining that any tangible
benefits will be felt from investment on such a small
scale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:17:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000059">At
the same time, I am concerned that the positive outcomes of sport in
schools are being jeopardised by the focus poured on to competitive
sport, which risks turning young people away from physical activity
altogether and undermines the purpose of encouraging a programme of
school sports. The Chairman outlined that in considerable
detail.</hs_Para>

many of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Committee, I do not
think that competitive sport should be done away with in schools.
People, and children in particular, are competitive by nature. However,
there is certainly a time and a place for competition, and I feel
strongly that competitive sport should not automatically be favoured
over non-competitive activities, as seems to be the current default
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:17:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

and participation must be paramount, and they can be achieved in the
simplest ways. It was great to visit the schools in east London, and to
see some of the things happening there, including the multiple games
taking place in the playground. However, one thing really tickled me.
We were standing by a door, when all of a sudden, 20 or 30 children ran
out of it and ran all the way round the playing field and straight back
into their classroom. The head teacher told us that the school was
using that physical activity as a way of stimulating the children. They
might have got past the stage where they were learning anything in the
classroom, so they needed to use a bit of energy and to express
themselves in a different way. The head teacher told us that that small
amount of physical activity ensured that the children were ready to
learn as soon as they were 
<?notus-xml column=360?>back at their desks, which was
tremendous<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:18:58"></hs_TimeCode>. If
such small activities can have a major benefit, a proper school sports
programme can, too.</hs_Para>

Esterson</B> (Sefton Central) (Lab):</Member> I am afraid that I could
not resist the temptation to say that my hon. Friend raises that point
only because he was jealous at not having the opportunity to join in.
Is he aware of the scientific research—I do not think we
considered it in our inquiry—that points to the link between
physical activity, brain development and learning in the classroom? The
head teacher was making the point, based on her experience, that
physical activity clearly works, but the scientific evidence is there
to back that
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000063"><B><Member ContinuationText="Alex Cunningham" PimsId="5668" UID="13120570000204" xid="1209" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000204">Alex

the price of competition is inclusion, we should perhaps rethink
whether a new balance is needed in the national curriculum between
competitive sport and other activities, perhaps taking additional
measures to encourage and promote more competitive sport as an
extra-curricular option. With that idea in mind, I welcome the school
games, not only as a legacy of the London 2012 games, but as an
additional channel to enable young people to participate competitively,
should they wish to. It is important, however, to ensure that funding
is secured for long-term sustainability, and to allow participation to
grow beyond the 60% of schools currently taking
part<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:20:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000065">Continuing
the theme of participation and inclusion, the Committee’s report
examines in detail school sport partnerships and the impact that cuts
to funding have had on sport provision in schools. We heard from Linda
Cairns, a school sport co-ordinator at George Abbot school in
Guildford, that the funding cuts have resulted in the system tailing
off, and that there are only a handful of school sport co-ordinators
left. That was backed up by evidence from the NASUWT showing that 48%
of local authorities recorded a decline in the number of partnerships,
while a further 28% had no functioning partnership in their area.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:21:22"></hs_TimeCode>When I
questioned her further, Linda said that the upshot was a hole in local

future well-being and development of young people. I know from personal
experience in the borough of Stockton that the partnerships work. They
encourage greater uptake and promote wider sporting opportunities, and
such participation leads to positive outcomes. More than that, however,
the partnerships created a true link between secondary and primary
schools. I saw young people working with much younger children, which
gave them someone to look up to and even admire. When we visited east
London, we saw older students acting as mentors to the young. I was 
<?notus-xml column=361?>extremely encouraged to see their relationship. The younger ones hung on
every word that the older pupils
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:22:38"></hs_TimeCode>. In another
school, we saw the Football Association in action, and the young people

is not to be found in most places. However, although we did not see
some of the poorer provision in the country, we took evidence about the
impact of the partnerships’ demise, and that may have redressed
the balance to an extent. Many witnesses lamented the loss, because the
partnerships were successful. Several witnesses strongly put forward a

tinkered with school sport and have not got stuck in to create a
long-term approach. I hope that after analysis and evaluation the
present Government will recognise the sustainable and lasting benefits
brought by partnerships, and will correct their mistake by reinstating
the funding. School sport partnerships are a true investment in the

first change by the coalition Government was the announcement that the
ring-fencing for school sport partnerships would end in March 2011, the
rationale being that that would increase and encourage more competitive
sport in schools. That brought quite a high level of disagreement from
schools and, as a result, the Secretary of State announced an extension
of the funding until August 2011. He also gave an extra £65
million to enable secondary PE teachers to spend a day a week assisting
and supporting primary schools. In March 2013, the Government announced
new ring-fenced funding of £150 million per annum for two years,
for primary school sport. That, unusually, is funded from three
Whitehall Departments—the Department for Education, the
Department of Health and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
Each primary school in England is getting approximately £9,250
per annum. That, as hon. Members will know, is called the primary sport
premium. At the same time, as

biggest problem for the primary sports premium, as with SSPs, is that
the money is not long term, and there is not a long-term strategy. As

Members have mentioned Jonathan Edwards’ excellent account to
the Committee, when we met him with two young athletes. He was clear
about the wider benefits of sport, physical activity and participation.
He drew our attention, in his concluding comment, to the health impact
of taking part in sport. The wider benefits are as important, if not
more so, as the benefits of taking part in sport, including competitive
sport. That came out in the evidence of a number of
witnesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:35:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000087">This
was an inquiry about school sports and the Olympic legacy, so we asked
questions about the legacy, too. Jonathan Edwards drew our attention to
the fact that Pierre de Coubertin, when setting up the modern Olympic
movement, visited this country because he was impressed with the way
that sport was integrated throughout the education system and that we
demonstrated the principle of a healthy mind in a healthy body. In the
19th century, the principle of the value of sport and education was
well established in this country. It is instructive that there is
nothing new in some of the things that we discuss today about the
origins of sport and its role in school, and the evidence of what
constitutes good
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:36:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000088">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:36:57"></hs_TimeCode>

historically. <I>[Interruption.]</I> The Minister is reacting as if I
may be on to something here. It has been hard, historically, to get
Ministers from different Departments together to discuss issues where
there is a crossover. The way that Whitehall and Government work often
makes such things far more difficult than they should
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:37:33"></hs_TimeCode>. The

hon. Members said, we heard a passionate defence of school sport
partnerships from pretty much every witness. My authority in Sefton had
a well organised school sport partnerships model, with the secondary
schools providing the support, expertise, co-ordination and enthusiasm
to include the primary schools. The engagement of children in primary
schools in Sefton was exceptionally good, while the school sport
partnership model survived. I am afraid that it is a different story
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:38:24"></hs_TimeCode>, although
it has been instructive to listen to teachers and others involved in
making the best of the primary sports premium
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:38:37"></hs_TimeCode>, and to
see how they are achieving that, to a greater or lesser
degree<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000090">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:39:08"></hs_TimeCode>
is fair to say—I will return to this point—that there is
some patchy evidence. There are some good and not so good examples of
what is happening already with the primary money that is
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:38:58"></hs_TimeCode>. I
agree that, in times of financial restraint, primary is the place to
invest limited amounts of money. However, I regret—this point
was made in evidence—that the successful model had to be
completely dismantled first and that there was this gap. A number of
schemes have been completely stopped and then, some two or three years
later, the Government have brought back a reduced level of investment.
Building Schools for the Future is another example, in the education
sector, of a programme’s complete cancellation and a later
investment in school building.</hs_Para>

given for the cancellation of the school sport partnerships was largely
about the high level of investment; we heard the figure of £2.5
billion just now. However, if the criticism is that it was too much
money, why was a reduced level of investment not maintained, given the
success that had been achieved? I hope that some of those successes
will be re-instigated by the new programme.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000092">When we went
to Curwen primary school in east London, we heard evidence about some
of the challenges of the new model. The head teacher there told us how
he had been inundated with calls from commercial suppliers wanting him
to spend money on their coaching programmes. He adequately analysed how
that would be unsuitable, because the money was just not going to last
long, and there was no co-ordinated approach. What he was after was
advice, guidance, support and some kind of co-ordination, as we had
with SSPs, to make the most of the money.</hs_Para>

similar things in my own authority regarding some the ways in which the
money might be spent. I am afraid that some schools are using the money
in that way, and the money will not be as effective as it might be. I
understand that the Government are keen to allow schools to make their
own decisions and to provide them with the autonomy to do so. However,
I urge the Minister to ensure that guidance and co-ordination are a way
not only of getting good value for money, but of making the best of the
programme to the benefit of the children who are supposed to
benefit.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Calder Valley mentioned education, health and care
plans. The report indicates that physical activity should be part of
that, which was a comment made to us by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson. That

long-term funding, I do not know whether hon. Members have missed this,
but the Chancellor has today announced an extension of the funding for
a further year to 2016. That is of course to be welcomed, but it does
not get past our recommendation that funding should be on a long-term,
sustainable basis, which we need to move on to.</hs_Para>

not just about primary schools. While primaries are the right place in
which to put investment when one does not have much money, we need to
create a culture. That comes back to physical literacy, which was
mentioned by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:42:47"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness. If we want to create a culture
where people engage in sport of one sort or another and are physically
active, to the benefit of their health, their brain development, their
academic study, which is evidenced as well, their behaviour, their
concentration and the self-confidence that comes from physical
activity, we need to look at a longer-term strategy, whether that means
additional money or linking with the way in which the primary school
partnership system works.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000097">The programme
cannot end at 11. I know that secondary schools have greater resources
and that school sport is well established in secondary, but somehow
there needs to be a link, some co-ordination, a long-term approach and
a correctly balanced combination of physical
activity  
<?notus-xml column=366?>and sport. As someone who still does a lot of competitive
sport—or tries to; that is probably the right way to put it
these days—I am passionate about the role of competitive sport.
However, I recognise that, for a lot of people, it is not the be all
and end all. It does not excite them; in fact it can be quite
off-putting. Nevertheless, if we want people to be physically active,
our effort should not end in secondary school, but continue into
further education, higher education and the world of work. We need to
look at our longer-term culture. That links back to the Olympics
legacy. I hope that that is where the policy could end up. As a result
of the report, that is very much an opportunity. The Youth Sport Trust
said in its evidence that physical activity goes much wider than
participation in competitive sport. That point is well made, but I
understand the emphasis on competitive sport.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000098">Again, the
report was about the Olympic legacy. I agree that we want to see our
high fliers achieving. We had a fantastic Olympics. If we can maintain
that at Rio and beyond, in terms of Olympic and Paralympic medals, who
knows? We might even retain the Ashes—we can but hope—and
go to the World cup having discovered some new players who can do
reasonably well. That is the pinnacle of sport. That is the pinnacle of
what we are trying to achieve. It makes a huge contribution to our
national success, but it is about everyone, and it is important to have
an inclusive approach.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000099">We heard
about teenage girls’ reluctance to take part in competitive
sport. They are not the only group who are reluctant, but it is of
particular concern. I forget which witness it was—it was
probably more than one witness—but they talked about involving
teenage girls in some kind of physical activity, where they realise
that they can take part and that it is not the end of the world if they
have a hair out of place; I have to be careful, because my daughter
would have me in a lot of trouble if I say the wrong thing. There are
opportunities, and I think the evidence is that once teenage girls get
involved in some kind of physical activity, they go on to participate
in more and more, including competitive sport. I hope that our evidence
about girls in sport will be
considered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000100">I
have mentioned the other benefits, including benefits to health and
school work. Those are incredibly important. If we are looking to
improve education attainment, school work and a child’s life
chances, the value of physical activity is not just a value in itself,
incredibly important though that is. If we want successful young
people, the importance of physical activity and of sport should not be
underestimated. We saw evidence on our visits and we heard evidence in
some of the sessions of how important that is for many young people,
who otherwise can be excluded. However, once they get involved and find
something that they enjoy doing, the benefits for them in other parts
of their lives and studies are second to
none.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000101">The
report is excellent. It was one of the best inquiries I have been
involved in since I have been here. It tied into many other issues, not
least performance in school and qualifications. All the recommendations
are worth looking at.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120570000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000102">One point
that came out, which other hon. Members have touched on, was the lack
of PE training for primary teachers. The work force issue is important.
I remember hearing from one of the witnesses that many teachers go into
primary deliberately because they do not like 
<?notus-xml column=367?>sport. That is the reality in the primary sector. Therefore, support for
PE teachers is incredibly important. If the money can be used for
anything, perhaps it should be on that support. Again, at Curwen
primary, we saw the way in which the FA went in to create
self-sufficiency by producing a skills programme and trained the
teachers to run it over a longer time.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:49:39"></hs_TimeCode>I encourage the
Minister to consider how that money could be used to create
self-sufficiency, so that the importance of physical activity and sport
in primary schools is well understood and teachers in the primary
sector are in a position to deliver on the report’s
recommendations. I know the Government would like to

which, as the document recognises, improved school facilities, and the

death for two key elements of delivering sport in our schools. There is
no doubt that Building Schools for the Future improved facilities in
our schools; we could have used it to build a framework for delivering
excellent sport provision, both competitive and non-competitive, in our
schools. There was inconsistency between what the Government said

is also worth setting out what the school sport partnerships achieved,
because in 2002 the PE and school sport survey highlighted that only
one child in four was doing two hours of PE a week. Under the school
sport partnerships, by 2007-08, the figure had increased to 90%. In
fact, the success of school sport partnerships led in that year to
steps being taken to introduce a target of three hours of PE a week,
and the five-hour commitment meant that almost 55% of children were
doing at least three hours of PE a week and were moving towards the
five-hour
commitment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000113">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:56:26"></hs_TimeCode>

been pointed out, the funding has a limited time scale, which makes me
question whether it will exist in the long term. A consistent
criticism—of both the previous and current Governments, I
grant—is that what we need is some form of long-term planning.
If the Government are to produce figures for participation in
competitive sport, surely it follows that they should provide

point goes back to the intervention from the Chair of the Education

the decision to take money away from school sport partnerships on a
whim, there 
<?notus-xml column=370?>was a hue and cry from people involved in sport and school sport in
particular. If you check <I>Hansard</I>, Sir Alan, you will
find that I was one of those angry people. I am sure that a sense of
how shocked and angry I was at the sudden announcement just leaps out
of the page. The Secretary of State was forced to come back to
Parliament to make another announcement, in which he reinstated
£65 million—£32.5 million a year for two
years—for PE teacher release, whereby teachers would be released
for a day a week to co-ordinate sports in their area. Through a series
of freedom of information requests, I found out that that funding was
resulting in 60% less time being spent organising school sport than was
spent by school sport co-ordinators under school sport partnerships.
Despite attempts to back-fill the hole, the damage had been done. There
was a significant reduction in the amount of time being spent
organising sport<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:03:24"></hs_TimeCode>

addition—it really is a sorry pattern—the Government have
watered down protections for school playing fields in the national
planning framework. Schools are no longer required to provide a
specified amount of playing field space; they merely have to provide
suitable outdoor space. It also beggars belief that free schools can
open up with absolutely no sport provision whatever. That cannot be
right and is not consistent with the actions of a Government who value
school sport and consider it deserving of higher priority in the
curriculum. In August 2012, the Government abolished the two-hour
target; without any means of monitoring what is going on, it is
difficult to judge what the implications have
been.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0001.htm#13120570000127">The
announcement of the £150 million scheme was welcome, but as I
pointed out to the Chair of the Education Committee, it came after the
dismantling of the structures put in place for school sport. The
emphasis on primary schools has been welcomed, and I echo that to some
degree, and will return to the subject. The funding is ring-fenced,
which is another U-turn, because we have been told that ring-fencing
was out of favour under this Government, and that schools should use
money as they wish. How will the Government monitor the scheme? We

are also questions about Ofsted’s capability. Can we be sure

excuse to cover up the loss of school sport partnerships. That was an

have somehow abdicated responsibility for teaching PE because that
money is going into our primary schools. It is important for PE to be
part of the curriculum, and I support the Select Committee
recommendation that teacher training be altered to cover that. We also
want co-ordinators for PE in every primary school, as we have for maths

children feel inadequate, they may start to use avoidance tactics, so
that they do not get into a situation in which they feel challenged,

with points made earlier: this is not only about competition. It has to

need long-term planning. I have been all over the country, talking to
people involved at all levels of sport, including PE teachers and
co-ordinators, and they want long-term planning from Government. They
also want politicians to co-operate with one another. I would welcome
the opportunity to sit down and talk across Government about a
long-term plan for sport and recreational activity in our schools and
communities, so that we can give people the consistency and therefore
the confidence to plan ahead for the sorts of sports that they are
delivering in their communities. I look forward to hearing the

benefits from sport—as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:15:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

outside school and to compete against their peers. We are clear that
improving PE and sport provision in schools is a top priority—I

can all agree, as the Chair of the Committee said in his excellent

overarching strategy covers a wide range of areas, designed to provide
significant long-term benefits derived from instilling an early
enthusiasm for sport and physical activity. There was agreement during
the debate that we have to get in early, as with many other aspects of
children’s lives. I was interested in the points made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:16:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Eltham about pre-school, as well as where else in and around the
school environment we could improve opportunity and
participation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:17:05"></hs_TimeCode>.
In due course, it will be good to hear his views on extending the
school day or the role of schools in providing a wider range of

Timpson:</Member></B> Absolutely. As in other areas of a child’s
life—internet safety, for example—parental involvement
and responsibility have to form part of the solution, so that whether
children are in or out of school they get the same message. We have
heard about some recent cases of over-exuberance among parents on the
touchline, when perhaps they have taken that responsibility a little
too far, but we want to see parents more involved in holding schools to
account, as well as in helping the schools to deliver sport and PE, so
that their children get the best
opportunities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:18:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0002.htm#13120570000149">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:19:06"></hs_TimeCode>
is one of the reasons why, as part of the sport premium, schools have
to publish on their website how they are spending it and what impact it
is having, so that parents can see for themselves, form judgments and
ask questions about whether it is doing what it set out to do. In
answer to another question from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:18:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Eltham, that would include competitive and non-competitive sport in
that school—it is not only competitive sport that will be part

dwell on the history is always an interesting exercise when discussing
school sport. I do not wish to chastise the hon. Gentleman for wanting
to return to many of those issues, but it would be healthier for our
children if we concentrated on the future and on where we can find
joint enterprise to build on some fantastic work being done out there,
spreading it more widely and making it more sustainable. That is why
the cornerstone of our approach is the focus on improving provision in
primary  
<?notus-xml column=374?>schools. I welcome the broad support for that both in this debate and
more widely. Since September 2012, I have, with officials in the
Department, spent a lot of time talking to head teachers, national
governing bodies, Youth Sport Trust, Sport England, the Association for
Physical Education and others, so as to understand where the money
could have the greatest impact. The overwhelming consensus was that we
should channel our energies towards the primary level.</hs_Para>

from autumn this year primary head teachers across the country have
started to receive additional funding to improve the provision of PE
and sport in their schools. The money is ring-fenced. The hon. Member
for Eltham said that the Government’s philosophy is to give head
teachers the freedom to spend money in the way they think is best for
their pupils. This additional funding fulfils that objective, but the
ring-fencing makes it clear how high a priority we place on ensuring
that PE and sport in schools is of the highest possible
calibre.</hs_Para>

backed up by the fact that PE and sports provision is and will continue
to be inspected by Ofsted, which is briefing all its inspectors on how
to do that. There have also been changes to the school inspection
handbook. I have seen for myself some of the section 5 inspection
reports, in which far more prominence is already being given to the
evaluation of how the school sport premium is being spent. I saw a
report for a primary school in my own constituency that has clubbed
together with other schools to bring in a full-time specialist PE
teacher. The teacher spends one day a week in each of the four primary
schools and on the fifth day goes to those pupils who need extra
catch-up so that they can get to the level we all want to
see.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Craig Whittaker) reminded us that
the head teacher of a typical primary school will receive £9,250
to spend on sport provision between now and the summer term. The hon.
Member for Sefton Central astutely observed that the premium has now
been extended in the autumn statement to a third year, to include
2015-16. I do not for a minute want to suggest that my hon. Friend the
Chairman of the Education Committee has not had his eye on the ball: to
be absolutely fair to him, he attended the previous debate in this
Chamber and the extension is in paragraph 2.164 of the autumn
statement, so he is forgiven for failing on this occasion to have
spotted such a hugely important announcement.</hs_Para>

announcement is an unequivocal demonstration of the importance that we
attach to the embedding of school sport and PE in children’s
lives. I am happy to repeat what I told the Select Committee: I want to
keep pushing the issue within Government. Although it is often one of
the most difficult exercises across Government, an important aspect of
the cross-Government strategy on the issue has been pulling in funding
and ongoing commitment from three Departments. I chair a regular
ministerial group on school sport, which includes Youth Sport Trust,
Sport England, the Association for Physical Education, Ofsted and
others. There continues to be a joint commitment on funding and other
resources.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120570000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0002.htm#13120570000155"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Graham Stuart" PimsId="4814" UID="13120570000219" xid="803" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/halltext/131205h0002.htm#13120570000219">Mr

Timpson:</Member></B> That is an excellent point. We can see that in
the evolving role of health and wellbeing boards and the development of
joint strategic needs assessments across each local authority, with the
greater responsibilities local authorities now have for the physical as
well as mental health of their local population. To build on the
remarks of the hon. Member for Sefton Central on education, health and
care plans and also children with special education needs and the
requirement to improve access to sport for disabled children, we have a
real opportunity to push those issues up the agenda at a local level,
so that there is a clear objective coming from national Government
across a number of Departments that is replicated at local level. The
county sports partnerships will be an important conduit for providing
information, data and advice as to how we can best achieve that
aim.</hs_Para>

have been raised about some of the new providers coming into the market
and schools must be able to access the information they need to spend
the sport premium in the best way. I acknowledge that, and we have been
at pains to set out on the Department for Education’s gov.uk
website a host of best practice examples of schools that already have
superb ways of embedding sport in their schools, including ones that
work particularly with girls and with disabled children. I visited the
Marjorie McClure specialist school in Bromley to see how the Project
Ability programme that we support in about 50 special schools is making
a discernible difference to the quality and outcomes of the education
of young people with disabilities. The Youth Sport Trust and the
Association for Physical Education have provided excellent practical
guidance to primary schools so that they can learn to use the money as
effectively as possible.</hs_Para>

Member for Eltham pointed out, we are independently evaluating the
impact of the premium, and Ofsted is also doing some work on that. We
are tracking 40 schools all the way through, and about another 700 will
be visited and evaluated. I hope that by next summer we will have a
stronger evidence base for school performance. The continued
involvement of Ofsted is a key way of changing behaviour and culture on
the ground. The work we are doing on initial teacher training and on
bringing in high-quality specialist PE teachers—I have seen
their calibre for myself—is extremely encouraging. 
<?notus-xml column=376?>It is only a pilot at this stage but gives us a model that we can look

that the issue affects not just primary but secondary schools. That is
why the £1 billion youth sports strategy from the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport is so important. A satellite club will be set
up in every secondary school, and there will be large investment in
facilities. It was also announced today that DCMS is putting in an
extra £18 million to improve facilities in primary schools that
have a particular need to enhance their sports facilities. Those
schools are predominantly in inner-city areas, but there are also other
parts of the country where schools simply do not have the outdoor space
they need. That programme will run from next year, and some of the
facilities will be in place by next summer. That welcome move has come
about from the co-ordination of efforts by Departments to establish
where there are still gaps in provision across the country.</hs_Para>

years but beyond that. I welcome any support that the Opposition bring

that tax credit in the UK is reduced if foreign tax is repaid by a tax
authority to a person other than the person entitled to the credit. The

any detailed discussion will take place. However, should it be
required, any UK intervention will note that while UK welcomes the

reading—EM7999/13). If there is a debate, the UK will state that
while UK strongly supports the Commission’s overall objective to
support broadband roll-out by reducing the cost of deployment, we do
not think that the use of a regulation is the best way to achieve this,
reaffirming our view that a directive would be a more appropriate
instrument in that it would give member states more scope to implement

for electronic communications and to achieve a connected continent
(first reading—EM13562/13 and 13555/13 + ADDs 1-2). It asks
member states to indicate what actions contained in the proposal they
regard as priorities; and whether it is appropriate to carry out such
actions at EU or member state level. The main points of the UK
intervention will include: a view that while UK welcomes the objectives
of the proposal, we remain concerned that the link between the stated
aims and the constituent elements of the package remain unclear or
unproven in a number of circumstances; signal, our support for action
at EU level for the pro-consumer parts of that package; support for the
eventual reduction of the EU roaming rates to zero; and support for
proposals that could accelerate the roll-out of new technologies across
the EU. Finally, we will state that we do not support the proposals
laid out in the package that would give the Commission further
competency over spectrum management nor those that would result in the
introduction of regulation covering issues relating to net
neutrality.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13120551000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/wmstext/131205m0001.htm#13120551000034">The
second question considers the conclusions of the October European
Council that covered several aspects of the digital economy—for
example, cloud computing, big data and digital platforms—that
are currently either unregulated or rely on “soft”
regulation. In this question, the presidency asks if any regulatory
framework is required in these areas and, again, whether any regulation
should be at member state or EU level. The UK’s intervention
will state that while UK agrees fully with the conclusions in that the
digital economy has the potential to drive innovation, growth and jobs
across the EU, UK does not believe that the European Council
conclusions call for a new regulatory framework nor does UK consider
that one is
required.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13120551000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/wmstext/131205m0001.htm#13120551000035">There

in place under defence reform, a key part of which was the balancing
the MOD budget in 2012. The elimination of the inherited imbalance in

recommendations, has increased empowerment of the service chiefs and

Ireland enjoy low borrowing costs. If Scotland became an independent
country, the continuing UK's borrowing costs would not be expected to
change. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research have
estimated that Scotland's borrowing costs would rise following
independence, between 0.7 and 1.65 percentage points above
UK borrowing costs. (Independence would likely lead to an increase in
funding costs for mortgage lenders. A 1% cent rise in effective

Webb:</Member></B> The Department for Work and Pensions and the
Government more generally has concerns about the way in which payday
lenders can access money from their customers' bank accounts via
continuous payment authority (CPA). We recognise the serious distress
to consumers, particularly those in financial difficulty. DWP welcomes
the proposals from the new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority
(FCA), to limit the use of CPAs to two attempts. The FCA also proposes
to ban CPA part payment, so that a lender can only take payment if the
whole owed sum is available in the customer's account. Existing Office
of Fair Trading (OFT) guidance restricts lender's ability to use the
CPA where this would leave the customer without a subsistence balance
and this will become a binding rule under the FCA. This is particularly
important given the introduction of universal credit. The FCA has the
power to go further on CPAs in future if it deems necessary to protect
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13120589000034" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/text/131205w0001.htm#13120589000034">Social

published on 29 October 2013 sets out the business case for proceeding
with HS2. It shows that the Y-shaped network including the section

labelling has been introduced across the European Union. Wherever there
is a choice of tyres available with a new vehicle, retailers are
required to supply relevant information to consumers in a standardised
format to help make an informed decision in relation to tyres fitted to
their
vehicle.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13120589000047" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/text/131205w0001.htm#13120589000047">Tyres:

Government considers that it is for individual drivers to make
decisions about tyre choice rather than the Government intervening.
Tyres designed specifically for driving in snow and ice conditions are
available throughout the UK. However, the drivers decision to fit
special tyres is influenced by a number of factors including 
<?notus-xml column=773?>driving conditions, types of journeys undertaken, the cost of purchasing
season specific tyres, storing the original set of tyres and the
practicality of refitting them when conditions

committed to reserving part of the FM spectrum as a platform for local
and community radio stations, for as long as it is needed. DCMS
officials are also working with Ofcom to consider the potential options
for smaller local stations to migrate to digital in the lead up to and
after a future switchover. We are encouraged by the recent research

(Ecoantibio 2017), aimed at their livestock, animal health and
veterinary pharmaceutical sectors, are broadly similar to those
outlined within the UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)
Strategy; improving infection prevention and control practices;
promotion of antibiotic stewardship; developing alternatives to
antibiotic use; improving surveillance of antibiotic use and levels of
resistance; and strengthening international collaboration. However, the
UK takes a 'One Health' approach to slowing down the development and

recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological
Safety of Food (ACMSF), the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) has
collected, collated and published figures on UK sales volumes of active
antimicrobial ingredients in products authorised for use in animals.
The reports from 1998-2004 were based on sales data provided
voluntarily by the veterinary pharmaceutical companies marketing these
products, in the UK. However, from 2005, veterinary pharmaceutical
companies have been required by the Veterinary Medicine Regulations

is reasonable to assume that there is a correlation between the

of which has already been placed in the Library. The Department does
not set selling prices for generic medicines. Instead, competition in
the market is relied upon to keep prices down. Part VIII of the Drug
Tariff lists the most commonly prescribed products with a reimbursement
price that dispensing contractors will be paid. Setting a reimbursement
price encourages contractors to seek lower prices and procure in a
manner that is cost-effective for the
NHS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312062000654" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131205/text/131205w0002.htm#1312062000654">New

does not hold the information required to provide a definitive answer
to this question. ONS electoral statistics provide annual counts of the
number of people on the electoral register and cannot identify the
number of people added to the register in any particular year.
Therefore ONS is unable to provide information on (b) how many people

the number of attainers on the electoral register may provide some
information about the number of people aged 16 or 17 added to the
electoral register in each year. Attainers are persons who attain the
age of 18 during the currency of the register and are therefore
entitled to vote at an election held on or after their eighteenth
birthday. The total number of attainers registered to vote in UK
parliamentary elections, for each of the years 2003 to 2012, is shown
in the table. Data broken down by UK constituent country and
parliamentary constituency is available on the ONS website

is not possible to state that the attainer figures in the electoral
statistics exactly reflect the number of persons aged 16 or 17 who are
added to the register in each particular year. This is due to changes

people approaching 18 years of age.</hs_brev>

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.

offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
