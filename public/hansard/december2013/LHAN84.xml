Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Lord Hill of Oareford)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, 50 years ago, almost to the day, this
House met to pay tribute to a foreign statesman. Then, our tributes
were for President Kennedy, a man seen to embody hope and change but
whose life was cut short, his promise unfulfilled. Today, we pay
tribute to Nelson Mandela, another man who epitomised hope and change
but whose life was long and whose promise, towards the end of that long
life, was triumphantly fulfilled. Although we are here to pay tribute
to his achievements, I know that the whole House will want to send its
deepest condolences to Mr Mandela’s family and
friends, as well as to the people of South Africa, who have lost their
leading
light.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312093000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#1312093000010">The
story of Mr Mandela’s life—from herding cattle, to study,
to struggle, to setback, to imprisonment and finally to
victory—is so like a fable that it is easy to think that there
was always bound to be a happy ending. That was not so. For 27 long
years in prison, the struggle must have seemed endless and, at times,
without hope. However, Mr Mandela did not give up, nor did he
compromise his principles, even when release from prison was dangled in
front of him. In his resistance, he was supported by many in this
country and, indeed, in this House, most notably by the noble Lord,
Lord Joffe. To their great credit, trade unionists, academics,
journalists, politicians and people up and down the country campaigned
tirelessly for his release. That came in 1990. Elected president of the
ANC the following year, he, along with FW de Klerk, won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1993. Then, in South Africa’s first universal and
non-racial elections, he became president in 1994. Macmillan’s
winds of change had at last blown through South Africa.</hs_para>

first historic achievement was the moral leadership that he provided in
the overthrow of apartheid, his second was the extraordinary way in
which he brought about reconciliation and led his country away from
violence and civil war. On his release from prison, he was passionate,
not angry, and magnanimous, not bitter. How many of us, if we had been
kept in prison for 27 years and been prevented from attending the
funerals of our own mother and son, would have had the moral strength
and political wisdom to forgive our enemies? That South Africa at last
respected the political destinies of free men and did so without a
violent revolution was undoubtedly due in large part to Mr
Mandela’s extraordinary grace as a human being after his release
from prison.</hs_para>

Mr Mandela then stood down after just one term—a rarity among
leaders 
<?notus-xml column=566?>from any country. However, the end of his presidency did not signal the
end of his work to create a better South Africa. He campaigned
tirelessly for more research into HIV and AIDS and for better education
and treatment. He named his HIV and AIDS fundraising campaign after his
Robben Island prison number and made a huge impact by announcing to the
world that his own son had died of AIDS. He used his moral authority on
the world stage to persuade other leaders to take action on AIDS,
leaving a legacy that will be felt by generations to
come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312093000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#1312093000013">Mr

are few people of whom it can truly be said that their life had an
impact on the world, but such was the life of this brave man who,
through oppression, understood that evil must never be accommodated or
accepted; rather, it must be resisted and overcome. His belief in
democracy and a free society was so strong that he was prepared to die
for it. Since the announcement of his death, and, indeed, since he
guided the South African people to freedom and democracy, the world has
rightly revered Mandela, whose dignity, compassion, generosity and
power of forgiveness knew no bounds. However, in remembering the peace
and reconciliation which became a model for the world, we should not
forget the struggle which went before, when he was fighting for the
liberation of his people who lived with the evil of apartheid, which
crushed “non-violent struggle” with “naked
force”.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:44:15"></hs_TimeCode>

dignity—a rainbow nation at peace with itself in the world. The

of someone who had endured so much and subsequently achieved so much
for his people and his country; maybe it was his challenging

magnetic would barely start to describe the aura of the

on the one occasion in my political life when my responsibilities
brought me into Nelson Mandela’s orbit, I confess that I had to
dare to disagree. Although he had wished a court in a neutral country
with international judges to try the two men accused of the bombing of
Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, President Mandela’s initiative
eventually led to the handing over of the two men and their trial in
the Scottish court in the Netherlands. In 2002, he visited the one man
convicted, Abdelbaset al Megrahi, in Barlinnie prison. The BBC’s
“Reporting Scotland” that night had an interview with Mr
Mandela calling for Mr Megrahi’s removal to a prison in a Muslim
country such as Egypt or Tunisia to serve out his sentence. This was
followed by an interview with me, as Scottish Justice Minister, saying
that the Scottish Government’s view was that we should abide by
the UN resolution establishing the process, whereby any sentence would
be served in a Scottish prison. Watching the programme at home in
Orkney, my teenage daughter asked my wife, “So does that mean
Nelson Mandela’s criticising my dad?”. When Rosie
replied, “Probably, yes”, Clare thought for a moment and
said, “Now that’s
cool”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312093000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#1312093000029">That
underlines the point that Nelson Mandela’s legendary status was
understood and recognised across the generations as well as across
continents. Young people who could not possibly remember his walk from
prison, or the crowds waiting to vote in South Africa’s first
properly democratic elections, nevertheless recognise that they have
been alive during the lifetime of such a towering figure. And just as
we, today, revere names of past generations such as Lincoln,
Wilberforce, Gandhi, who championed the struggle for freedom, so too
will future generations revere the name of Nelson Mandela—a man
who transcended generations just as he bridged cultures and healed
divisions; and just as he did when he addressed us in 1996. He did not
shy away from reminding us of our colonial record or the dismissive
response given by our forebears in the early years of the last century,

Cross-Bench group, may I be associated with the moving and well earned
tributes to the life of Mr Nelson Mandela, who was such a towering
person? We send our condolences to his family. I did not have the
honour to meet Mr Mandela so, like many others, my regard for him and
all that he stood for stems from his speeches and writings and from the

is impossible even to attempt to record all that Mr Mandela gave, not
just to his country or to the continent of Africa, but indeed to the
whole world. That so many people from across the world, be they rich or
poor, powerful or weak, high or lowly, now hold him in such amazingly
high regard, even though he did not attain public office until he was
well into his 70s and was in office for only one term, speaks volumes
about his personal greatness. Others have portrayed the life of Mr
Mandela with greater eloquence than I can, but I will simply try to
highlight four qualities of his that I am sure will
endure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:55:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312093000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#1312093000034">First,
he demonstrated over and over again his faithfulness to his beliefs. He
had the courage, determination and discipline to stand firm, even if it
meant spending many years in prison and separation from his family. As
an aside, I suggest that Governments across the whole world should
learn from his life: while oppression may appear to succeed for a time,
the human spirit of brave people like Nelson Mandela will never be
crushed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:56:32"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, wherever he was, he accorded to each his genuine belief in
their unique, individual quality. He was always able to treat each one
of his fellow human beings as being on life’s journey, whatever
their role or
status<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:57:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Thirdly,
he conveyed an inner sincerity and humility that made him really want
to learn from others, even his jailers, irrespective of colour, creed
or nationality. He was at heart someone who loved and respected his
fellow human beings, and it showed. Fourthly, he had a lifetime
commitment to unity; we all know that conflict is commonplace and often
the easy option, whereas bridge-building, reconciliation and harmony
are very much harder won. Nelson Mandela was at heart a unifier. The
world needs more people with his special
qualities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:57:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

he has left for us and future generations? I suggest that over and
above his intellectual qualities, his legal skills and his political
instincts, he had one quality that found expression in everything and
that will remain a challenge to us all: his generosity of spirit that
he accorded to friend and foe alike. He had an inner generosity that
enabled him to treat everyone, whatever their beliefs, with a pervasive
dignity. We may not achieve the higher human qualities that
characterised Nelson Mandela, but surely it is no defence if we fail to
strive to emulate what he was able to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T14:59:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

repeated many times in the millions of words spoken about him: humility

lived out his faith by challenging unjust structures, and then through
public service, was an example to all of us. He believed in the old
African proverb that we are people through other people and that only

Nelson Mandela gave us was helping us to understand forgiveness and

brought up under such circumstances as he was maintained his humility

to believe that I could survive and remain as humble and as dignified

sounded and with that he took my hand and we mounted the steps of St
Stephen’s and into great Westminster Hall. He was then 78 years
old. After the ceremony he made straight for Margaret Thatcher, who was
in the audience, smiling happily, hand outstretched. She had branded
him and the African National Congress as terrorists and she had

Howe of Aberavon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, very briefly, perhaps I
may add to the impressive tributes that have been paid by noble Lords
on all sides of the House and reflect on the period, almost 30 years
ago, when the Commonwealth was taking action as widely as it could to
try to secure improvements in conditions in South Africa. It
commissioned a group of wise men, who were sent out there to see what
could be done at a time when Nelson Mandela had already spent 27 years
on Robben Island. When the two selected—Tony Barber, a former
Minister in this country, and Malcolm Fraser, a former Australian Prime
Minister—went in to see Nelson Mandela, his first, most
impressive, question was, “Can you tell me, is Don Bradman still
alive?”. What more could he have said, even there, to those two
in the prison and to the rest of us back here in Britain, to underline
his qualification as something more than a citizen of South
Africa—as 
<?notus-xml column=574?>a citizen of the world indeed? On that basis, I am sure that he deserved
the support that he was already enjoying at that
time.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1312093000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#1312093000230"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:13:08"></hs_TimeCode></I>3.13

Kinnock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, for 50 years since I first
campaigned against apartheid in the wake of the Sharpeville massacre,
Nelson Mandela has been a supreme inspiration to me. He showed
unsurpassed bravery and endurance in his fight against oppression and
unequalled humanity in his guidance to South Africa and the world. He
had the strength to be merciful, the wisdom to be gentle and generous.

Mandela never forgot the past of hatred and bigotry, of searing
injustice and violence, but from the outset his political life was
resolutely committed to plotting, planning and building for a different
future with his people. It was that which drove him to take up arms. It
was that which gave him the resilience to withstand captivity and its
dreadful indignities and tragedies. It was his fixation with the future
that could be created which, in the late 1980s, made him withstand the
proffered comforts of compromise and instead gain the courageous
agreement of FW de Klerk to release him unconditionally and to prepare
for non-racial democracy. It was Mandela’s dedication to the
future which, above all, made him exert his full authority as a
warrior, a convict and a leader to compel reconciliation when vengeful
reprisal could have brought remorseless racial civil war and desolated

not lecture the leadership of a 19 year-old democracy about its
conscience or its duty. I do not need to. In the most explicit terms,
Mandela himself charted the course that must be followed. At the
Rivonia trial, at which my noble friend Lord Joffe played a brave and
distinguished part, when Nelson and his comrades were faced with the
lethal probability of execution, he said in plain, provocative words

watching the march as he removed himself from the terrible, hellish
place in which he had been, and recognising that there was the sense

important is that one of the very closest friends that Nelson Mandela
had was the famous white South African, Helen Suzman. I mention her
because he was extremely close to her and because some of us remember
two things. First, there was never a month that passed in which she did
not visit Nelson Mandela on Robben Island, against all the opposition
that the Administration of white South Africa could produce. Secondly,
and at least as importantly, we should remember on this occasion that
from 1961 to 1974—13 bitter years—Helen Suzman was the
only opponent in that Parliament of every aspect of apartheid. That
meant that she was spurned, abused and, in some cases, threatened. Yet,
day after day, her courage did not fail and she matched that of her
dear friend and much beloved leader, Nelson Mandela. So on this
occasion, as we celebrate that great man, I hope that we will celebrate
also those men and women of all races who had the courage and strength

words of tribute as one who lived in South Africa for 28 years of the

know Nelson Mandela, known to us all as Madiba, over many occasions. I
shall remember him for his charming and engaging smile, his empathy and

is no doubt that Madiba will be remembered as one of the most important
and distinguished politicians of the past century. He will be
remembered as a universal icon for his lack of bitterness, after 27
years of incarceration, and for his incredible negotiating skills in
achieving peace and reconciliation in a country where most of us
believed that civil war would be inevitable. One of the most remarkable
achievements in South Africa was for him to persuade the Afrikaners to
agree to a peaceful settlement. It is well known that in his last five
years in prison, he had no fewer than 70 secret meetings
with Kobie Coetsee, the Minister of Justice, and Niel Barnard, the
national intelligence chief, to explore the possibility of a political
accommodation between blacks and whites.</hs_para>

1960s until the end of the 1980s, in the anti-apartheid movement we
struggled with the idea that apartheid could be overcome peacefully,
but we knew that it would eventually end as a political system, leaving
in its wake the misery and suffering that it had created. We watched
from afar those barricades of burning tyres and the street battles
fought in the townships by unarmed youngsters against a well armed and
brutal police force set upon destroying black opposition. In
desperation, Nelson Mandela advocated and engaged in the armed
resistance in the early 1960s, but it was he who insisted upon peace
and reconciliation when the white minority eased its grip on power

I joined the anti-apartheid movement in the 1960s and can confirm that
that wonderful solidarity movement, through every form of
persuasion—from letters to newspapers, mass picketing and
demonstrations to rugby and cricket pitch invasions—was able to
play a part in shifting public opinion and in exposing the apartheid
regime as an international pariah. It is, indeed, regrettable that the
anti-apartheid movement did not enjoy the support of the Government or
the Prime Minister of the day. However, I believe that the world is a
better place because of the solidarity that was shown in those dark
days, with South Africans seeking justice and freedom.

double-take. The conversation developed around the question of how we
could shape a political party on the basis of equity of all the
constituents—the people who matter. At that time, my party was
debating one person’s shortlist and how we could bring more
women within the context of our party’s leadership. John Smith
turned to Mandela and said, “Nelson, our research tells us that
within the ANC constitution there is equity. But we also researched
your office and we note that there is a preponderance of women against

tolerating one last speech. As a child of the 1960s, I was much
influenced by the events in South Africa, events that struck me at such
a tender age as being pivotal to my upbringing. Apartheid robbed
people, both black and white, of their humanity, because it damaged the
souls of those who inflicted it on others as much as it damaged those
men and women who suffered from it. It was extraordinary that although
many people feared that South Africa would be robbed of its humanity
for all time, apartheid did not rob Nelson
Mandela—Madiba—of his humanity. Throughout all the
stress, the strain and the pressure of those years, he remained
quintessentially human, kind and
loving.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312093000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#1312093000088">That

professionalism and human rights as an essential element of the work
they do is part and parcel of their training.  
<?notus-xml column=581?>The focus of our defence engagement in Burma is on adherence to the core
principles of democratic accountability, international law and human
rights. We have been delivering a course—a course which has been
delivered in many other parts of the world—that specifically

Chief of the Defence Staff visited Burma earlier this year to deepen
that engagement. I can assure the noble Baroness and other noble Lords
that we will not be involved in the sale or transfer of arms or
military equipment or play a part in military combat. We are involved
in the professionalisation and accountability that the Burmese army

Rohingya community and, indeed, against Muslims in other parts of
Burma, is a matter of huge concern. It was raised at the highest level
by the Prime Minister in discussions with President Thein Sein when he
visited earlier this year. It is important for us to respond to the
deteriorating humanitarian situation on the ground in relation to the
Rohingya community and to deal with the long-term issue of citizenship.
My noble friend has made an incredibly important point. The basis of
the argument used by the Minister who raised the issue with me was that
the Rohingya were not really members of the Burmese community because
they looked different, they had not been in the country long enough and
they were from a different religion. I am sure that the irony of that
was lost on the Burmese Minister when he was talking to
me.</hs_para>

There are concerns about the way in which the Government would like to

Some recommendations were made in the internal report that was done,

to access additional programme funding is set out in its framework

explain how she hopes the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which
is recognised by the UN as the independent watchdog for human rights in
Britain, will work with civil society to monitor our compliance with
the human rights treaties to which the Government are a signatory? Will
the Government, as they indicated in their application to the UN,
actively support the commission in this work and thereby reconsider the
decision not to allocate funds for capacity-building in NGOs around UN
treaty monitoring?</hs_para>

for the work that she has done in this area. As she knows, the EHRC has
its core funding for its core responsibilities and, obviously, in
relation to the UN Human Rights Council, that is part of what it is
doing. The grants that were rejected were rejected because they either
duplicated what others were doing or were regarded as poor value for
money. On building capacity for NGOs to contribute to UN treaty
monitoring, there was a concern about duplication because many of the
bid’s constituent parts may already be provided by others,
including the voluntary
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120912000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120912000004"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:49:59"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hussein-Ece" PimsId="5766" UID="13120912000032" xid="2040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120912000032">Baroness

disabled people and their organisations. As I said, the EHRC has some
core responsibilities; as regards those grants, we are talking about
additional 
<?notus-xml column=584?>areas for which the EHRC put in bids. I can assure my noble friend that
the EHRC plays an important part in the independent mechanism for
monitoring the convention. A number of the EHRC’s bids for
additional funding have not been approved in this instance
because of the concern about value for money.
However, that does not affect the EHRC’s core budget and its

Lea of Crondall (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we are told that core
funding is okay because that is a totally separate question. However,
one’s impression is that we passed legislation with a need to
implement it through secondary legislation, and the EHRC has many times
been given the responsibility to monitor and implement that secondary
legislation. Is the Minister saying that the core funding is keeping
pace with all the extra secondary legislation that we are asking the
EHRC to
implement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:51:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120912000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120912000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13120912000037" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120912000037">Baroness
Northover:</Member></B> I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Neill, will come and tell us one way or the other. However, my
understanding is that the Ministers responsible are working very
closely with the EHRC—I am very glad to see the noble Baroness,
Lady O’Neill, nodding—to ensure that it can focus on
those core responsibilities. There was, as the noble Lord will probably
remember, a previous concern—for example, from the National
Audit Office—that some of the extraneous activities around the
edge were taking away from those core responsibilities. The bids here
do not relate at all to the monitoring of how statutory instruments and
so on might operate. That would all be part of the core
responsibilities. To come back to the previous question, neither would
one assume that all bids would automatically be approved—to do
so would be fallacious. Just because the EHRC put in bids for the
amount up to the limit of what might have been available, that should
not indicate that it will all be allocated if all those bids do not
pass the same tests as those that were
accepted.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_09_PT_1/DF66717F8E5B5A9CD26CC90DCF97FE8EA2D48F69" __version__="1.12"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 December 2013">Monday,

Salix Finance public sector energy efficiency loan scheme provides
interest free loans to public sector organisations, including local
authorities in England, Scotland and Wales. Last week we announced an
additional £90 million of funding to help improve the

reply. However, we know that local authority budgets are being cut to
the bone and many local authorities are already struggling
to meet their statutory obligations to vulnerable people.

ruling out price freezes, households are faced with a double challenge
of rising energy prices at home and further cuts to vital local

course, control wholesale prices, in our announcement last week we put
forward a package of measures which should help local authorities and
consumers. The noble Lord will be aware that only today the OECD said
that if it were to follow the noble Lord’s party’s plans
on an energy price freeze, there would be underinvestment as investment
would be frightened off coming to the UK. I am sure that is not what
the noble Lord or his party want, but, sadly, that is what would
happen. The noble Lord will also be aware of the complete drop in share

if the leader of the Opposition were to have such an impact on the
share prices of energy companies 18 months away from a general

complacent if she thinks that making a statement would not have an
impact on share prices across the country. Of course, it undermines
investor confidence. We need to make sure that people wishing to invest
in the energy infrastructure of this country are confident that we will
have a stable set of measurements. That gives confidence to investors
rather than deters them from coming here.

We have done an awful lot to help consumers get through the difficult
period. Through ECO we have put in many measures to help 230,000 of our
most vulnerable households. There are cold weather payments and there
will be warm house discounts to help them see out cold winters. This

to the matter in hand, however, let me thank my noble friend Lady
Hamwee and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, for
helping me to understand the initially confusing issue of access to
intermediary services for the descendants of adopted people. There was
one debate in Committee in which I felt we were operating in two
completely parallel universes and there was also a moment in the debate
when I felt there was an anomaly which could not possibly be as simple
and straightforward as was being proposed. However, on investigation
afterwards and following an extremely helpful meeting with my noble
friend Lady Hamwee, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss,
and a number of people who are experts in the field, it became clear
that there was an anomaly that we needed to rectify. I am therefore
delighted to be putting forward an amendment today that addresses
this.</hs_para>

the current law as it applies to adoptions that took place before 30
December 2005, both the adopted person and the adopted person’s

facilitate contact between them, but the children of the adopted person
are not able to do so. My noble friend Lady Hamwee and the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, have set out very clearly that
this anomaly leaves a number of people in the dark about their family
history. The proposed new clause will correct this anomaly. It will
enable regulations to be 
<?notus-xml column=592?>made that will extend access to intermediary services to those who have
a prescribed relationship with the adopted person. I should be clear
that the reason that the proposed new clause does not apply to
adoptions that took place after 30<Sup> </Sup>December 2005 is because
information about these adoptions is held and accessible under a

considerations applying to the exercise of powers. The previous
Government had included subsection (5) as a separate subsection. It

of being one of a number of considerations, that was out front. The
result was that social workers, who were dealing with what is properly
called the “ethnicity question” up front, were refusing
to place 
<?notus-xml column=594?>children for adoption with parents who were not of the same colour, the
same persuasion or whatever, and this was impeding the very natural and

Matters which are of considerable importance to a child—their
religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and

not be permitted to frustrate a proper adoption if the circumstances of

certain characteristics of a child for whom adoption was sought should
not be highlighted as if they overrode everything else. Like the other

do not think we said this in Select Committee, but I am fearful about
this. England would not be in the same situation as Wales. Wales will
be keeping this wording. The fact that adoption is a devolved matter
does not answer the concerns that I have. It would be seen as a very
significant distinction. This swinging political pendulum has got to
end up in the middle. As the noble and learned Baroness has said, it is
not an overriding issue, nor something to be entirely discounted. In
Committee I said there had been oversensitivity to what some parts of
the media regard as political correctness. I know that the
Minister’s concern is that minority-ethnic children are being
short-changed. Sadly, the cohort that is being short-changed is the
many children from all sorts of backgrounds who are waiting for
adoption. The problem is the imbalance between their numbers and the
numbers of prospective adopters. To adopt, one needs to be
sensitive—to be understanding of the importance of religion, of
racial origin, of cultural and linguistic background. It is not a
matter of “being the same as”. People who are the same
may not understand, and may not be sensitive enough. But that
sensitivity, that openness, addressing issues which may
arise—that is the matching which is important, not the direct
same
characteristics.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312093000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#1312093000162">As
the Government were not been persuaded in Committee, a different
approach might appeal. My amendments would take out the references to
age and sex so that the court and the agency should have regard to the
child’s background and characteristics, because those cover
everything. The Minister has said that background and characteristics
must include ethnicity. He said that is a matter of plain English. Age

is very difficult to find a middle way. We are all agreed that it was
wrong that for a period of time there was too much emphasis given to a
child’s racial and religious background, as the noble and
learned Baroness has said. That has resulted in appalling waiting times
for children of some ethnic-minority backgrounds, who wait to be
adopted for three or four times longer than white children—their
contemporaries—do. That is not acceptable in our society. But we

Walmsley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, my name is attached to the
amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Our intention in paring
this down to background and characteristics is to force people to look
at the guidance. The Government tell us that they are strengthening the
guidance considerably and will emphasise the need to understand that a
child’s ethnicity is an important aspect of their identity. What
concerns me particularly about taking ethnicity out altogether is that
we will continue to have a large number of trans-racial adoptions.
Hurrah to that, I say, as long as the child is going to a family who
can love them, bring them up in a caring
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:32:10"></hs_TimeCode> and, if
there are differences in background, ethnicity, culture and so on,
understand how that affects the

through the Bill or in the guidance, we need to ensure that local
authorities, when dealing with prospective parents, are able to
investigate whether they are the kind of parents who would understand
the importance of that characteristic of the children. I fear that
taking “ethnicity” out will not fix the
problem.</hs_para>

my noble friend Lady Hamwee said, there is a mismatch between the

parents prepared to adopt them. There is also a difference in the
ethnicity of those two groups and that is why, until we can balance the
ethnicity of the one group and the other, there will continue to be
those trans-racial adoptions. That is why we need to make quite sure
that, among all the other wonderful characteristics of those prepared

worry that by being as prescriptive as putting something like this on

choose to remove this, it does not mean that social workers will not
look at each child’s background very fully; and not just the
backgrounds of children who are easily identified as from a minority.

add two points to that. The first is about perception. Throughout the
implementation of this Bill, one problem will be not so much with the
legislation but with how it is seen out there by people who have to
interpret it. This is about changing culture. As far as this matter is
concerned, the perception of people outside this Chamber is not that
there is wide agreement across the political spectrum about the need to
take these matters into account, but that this legislation intends to
move the position to the other end from where it has been in the past.
For me, the challenge is: how do we have something in law that clearly
gives the message that it is all right to take into account a
child’s ethnic background? Many people out there think that what
this legislation is about is that it is not all right to consider a
child’s ethnic and cultural background when making a decision on

the two alternatives available to us—statutory guidance or

unwise not to take the advice of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady

to come down on one side or the other, I will go for that of the noble

spin that the Government gave was that they were moving away from
taking into account a child’s ethnic, cultural and linguistic
background. That is where people in the wider world think they are. To
get the pendulum back to the middle, we clearly need something in the

adopted child. It is interesting that there has been a 20% increase in
the number of looked-after children since 2009. I suspect that there is
a 
<?notus-xml column=600?>perception that if you do not ethnically match, children will be hanging
around waiting for a loving, caring family. I am not sure that that is
the case. We all want the same thing, do we not? We all want to make

ways. I rarely disagree with my noble friend Lady Eaton, but if there
is statutory guidance—and there will be—it is hugely
important that the religious, heritage, cultural and ethnic issues are
clearly spelt out. Presumably it is called “statutory”

disagree with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss.
However, I think that social workers do take note, and will have to
take note, of that statutory guidance, given that it is enshrined in

list, the longer it is the more that considerations which are not on
the list are excluded. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius: if you
have a list of what must be done, the inference is that the rest does
not have to be done. Therefore, if you are going to have a list, let it
be
complete.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120919000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Benjamin" PimsId="5763" UID="13120919000596" xid="2043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000596">Baroness

guidance address identity, background and heritage issues that will
almost certainly need to be dealt with at different times in a
child’s life as, getting older, they grapple to understand their
identity? As we have heard, some find it very difficult if they are not
exposed to those issues. In short, how will adopters of a different
background and ethnicity access additional training and support to help
them understand issues their child might have to face, such as racism
and identity crisis as well as religious and cultural
differences?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120919000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000021">I
have spoken to both the NSPCC and CCS Adoption based in Bristol. I
declare an interest as I am a patron of the latter. Both believe that a
stronger case needs to be made before the removal of due consideration

why we cannot simply amend the welfare checklist specifically to
include ethnicity. Can the Minister explain the Government’s
reasoning behind the decision not to do
this?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120919000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000022">One of
CCS Adoption’s concerns is that guidance might be considered
discretionary and is more likely not to be adhered to or might even be
ignored. Just last week it was advised by its local authority that it
was not the authority’s policy to undertake life story work with
children or to produce a life story book for a child. In the local
authority’s view, these tasks should be done by the adopters.
Would statutory guidance make this clearly the responsibility of the
local authority, as it holds the child’s key information? The
life story workbook is key to any child coming through the care system
in helping to preserve and develop their identity. To try to delegate
these responsibilities to adopters when all the key information is held
by the local authority is unacceptable as it does not ensure that the
best interests of a child are met. Will this practice be addressed and
enshrined in statutory guidance?</hs_para>

we have heard, the NSPCC welcomes the updating of statutory guidance in
relation to this issue and is keen to work with the department to input
into this. However, it feels that this is work in progress and that at
this stage it cannot commit wholeheartedly to endorsing the guidance.
It and others have asked a number of questions to seek reassurance.
What impact will the statutory guidance have and how will it be
implemented? Aside from whether the guidance is statutory, as the
Government are proposing to remove “due consideration”
from primary legislation, do they think that stating this in guidance
is contradictory and could lead to confusion among social workers as to
whether it is a priority issue for consideration? How will the guidance
ensure that all families are given help to understand, appreciate and
engage with the background and culture of children placed with them?
How will the Government ensure that local authorities actively recruit
more adoptive parents from a range of ethnic
backgrounds?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120919000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000024">I
believe that when a child is adopted by a family of different race,
heritage or religion, that family must fully understand the
child’s background and help the child to cherish their birth
heritage. Adopters do not have to share the same ethnicity, but they
must be able to respect the child’s background. They must be
able 
<?notus-xml column=602?>to help the child to identify with their birth heritage and to be well
prepared for issues that may arise as the child develops into a
teenager and beyond. These adopters therefore need to be supported and
helped by appropriate training to strengthen their skills together with
their knowledge and understanding of the child's birth heritage, so
that they can meet these
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120919000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000025">This

child needs a loving and stable home, but they also need to be

that children must not suffer as a consequence of our decisions.
So if we end up with statutory guidance, we must all work
diligently to ensure that it is clear and understandable to all and not
open to misinterpretation. As I always say, childhood lasts a lifetime
and a child’s experiences shape their adulthood. So let us get
this one right. I am happy to work with the Minister to do just that.

Eccles (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, these are complicated matters. We
need to come down on one side of the fence. Can primary legislation
cope with these matters, or are there so many
variables that we have to rely on guidance? Guidance would
allow more judgment than could be exercised if faced with a section in
an Act of
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:59:25"></hs_TimeCode>. My
perception is that we would be better advised to rely on statutory
guidance. If we do not like it or do not think it deals adequately with
all the variations that have been talked about today, we can debate it
in Parliament and ask the Government to think again. However, trying to
cover what has been talked about today in a clause in a Bill which
becomes an Act of Parliament will not work. Therefore we have to rely
to a much greater extent on the development of confidence and judgment
within the system operated by the courts, local authorities, social
services and voluntary agencies. That is the way we should
go.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_09_PT_1/98B12B6DF72FC8BF476C277F4FE240689B548CD6" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 December 2013">Monday,

Committee will recall that we debated this in depth. It is fair to say
that there was widespread sympathy for the point of view that the noble
and learned Baroness has put forward this afternoon. There was a sense
that we wanted to get the balance right—not overstating their
importance, but recognising that ethnicity, culture, language and
heritage 
<?notus-xml column=603?>are all factors that make up a child’s identity, which any
prospective adopter should be able to respect and value. The challenge
for us is how to get it right and achieve

Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, explained that this issue was dealt with
in some detail by the adoption pre-legislative scrutiny committee last
year, which took evidence from a number of the major players in the
adoption sector, including Coram and Barnardo’s. We continue to
believe that that is an authoritative piece of work. While no one wants
children to be disadvantaged by delays being caused by the
search for the perfect match, the evidence of the adoption committee
seemed to show that while there are some pockets of poor practice, it
is no longer a widespread issue. For example, Barnardo’s
believed that the current legislation was adequate and Coram argued
that while this might have been a problem in the past, the situation
was improving rapidly. The committee also identified that there were
several other factors affecting the placement of BME children,
including having fewer prospective adopters and a failure by social
workers to promote their availability. The truth is that there remains
a paucity of evidence that BME children are waiting longer for
placements because of the current wording on ethnicity.</hs_para>

Committee, the Minister referred to two pieces of research, which I
have now had a chance to look at. The first is by Julie Selwyn and
commenced in 2005, which is some time ago. Even so, the study did not
find systematic bias or mishandling of minority ethnic children by
children’s services. The second piece of research, which was by
Professor Elaine Farmer, was also carried out some time ago. It
commenced in 2007. It was also interesting reading, but it covered a
limited sample and, as she acknowledged, it was impossible to draw
definitive findings because local authority practice was changing at
the very time that the research was taking place. I believe that the
latest research carried out by the adoption Select Committee is
probably a better reflection of what is currently happening in adoption
practice rather than research carried out six or seven years
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120919000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000032">While
there is, no doubt, scope for further definitive research, we should in
the mean time be cautious about driving major change in this area. This
is why we believe that putting these factors in the welfare checklist
along with other considerations strikes the right and proportionate
balance in addressing this issue. It would require agencies to have
regard to these factors, but they would not be paramount.</hs_para>

that, if references to ethnicity and culture were removed, they would
nevertheless remain as a silent, unspoken part of the children’s
characteristics and would still need to be taken into account. A
similar argument was put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in
her amendment. The Minister also referred to the fact that indicative
statutory guidance is being prepared, which we welcome. But putting
those two things together, I do not think they are good enough. By
removing the references to ethnicity, religion, culture and language
from the Bill, the Government plan to send a deliberate message to
courts and social workers. Why else would they do it?

have been paying tribute to probably the greatest force for racial
reconciliation ever, we are having a debate about a matter relating to
race. However, I am encouraged by today’s debate. It is
absolutely clear that we are really not very far apart; we are all
trying to achieve the same thing—the question is just how.
Perhaps I could try and outline, at some length if I may, how I and the
Government see the matter, our motivation, and where I believe there is
considerable common
ground.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120919000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000037">The
fact is that it takes two years and seven months for a child from
entering the care system to be formally adopted, but for a black child
it is 13 months longer—nearly four years. It takes one year and
seven months for a child to be placed with his or her proposed
adopters, but for a black child it takes 13 months, or 70%, longer. Of
course, this conceals the fact that many children never get adopted.
This is completely unacceptable and upsets me now as much as it did
when I first heard about it three and a half years ago. This is not a
question of the pendulum having swung too far. The pendulum has swung
off the scale.</hs_para>

working with children and young people felt very strongly that we need
to ensure not just that the life chances of all young children are
substantially improved but particularly those of the BME community, and
in particular the black community, because it seems to me that we need
more successful black people and more successful black role models. It
defines our society to have a balance of successful people. I look
forward greatly to the day when there are many more Baroness Youngs and
Baroness Benjamins. Although I was scribbling some of the time, I think
I agreed with everything the noble Baroness, Lady Benjamin, had to

unequivocal evidence on the negative impact of delay on
children’s development and well-being. Children need to form
secure and stable attachments,  
<?notus-xml column=605?>with one or two main carers in order to develop physically, emotionally
and intellectually. Therefore, what can we do about the appalling fact
that it takes black children, and other children from other minority
ethnic groups, so long to be adopted? First, we are taking great steps
on a number of fronts to improve the speed at which children are
adopted generally. Secondly, we must seek to recruit more adopters and
BME adopters and, as my noble friend Lady Hamwee said, we need to open
up the system on a more national basis so that there is more scope for
making the right matches. However, our research still reveals that in
too many cases social workers try for too long to make a perfect
match.</hs_para>

on this clause since Grand Committee. When children are being matched,
consideration of their background and heritage plays a critical part.
It is an integral part of a child’s identity and
their new parents must be able to support them as they grow up. In
Committee, there were moving testimonies from my noble friend Lady
Perry, who spoke about Marrianna, the little girl of the
Kindertransport, for whom her parents cared, ensuring that they learned
about Jewish religious tradition so they could help Marrianna cherish

Walmsley spoke about her granddaughter Cathryn, of Chinese heritage,

Clearly, with the right awareness and commitment, mixed-race adoptive
families can be very happy and successful ones. What is crucial to
making effective matching happen is good social work practice and
support for adoptive parents so they can support their children, not
just at the point of adoption but beyond, as the child grows into a
young adult. I do not think that the blunt wording of the Adoption and
Children Act—however well-intentioned and wherever it is
placed—can secure that.</hs_para>

Nash:</Member></B> I am grateful. I understand entirely the noble
Baroness’s position. The guidance will also state that adopters
of a different background/ethnicity may need additional training and
support to help them support their child. This will include how to
identify and deal with racism. On the matching process, it will ensure
that the adopters can engage with the cultural background, heritage and
ethnicity of the child. We will take my noble friend Lady
Benjamin’s point about the importance of the child’s life
story—the life book—and ensure that this point is in the
statutory guidance. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Eccles for

having ethnicity in guidance but not in legislation is confusing and we
are funding the British Association for Adoption and Fostering to
provide training seminars for all local authorities and voluntary
adoption agencies on this matter and the rest of the adoption reform
programme. Training to support ethnicity issues will be part of the
2014-15 sessions and places at these sessions are free. Of course, good
matching is important for all children and all adoptive families need
access to adoption support at different stages of childhood. We are
addressing these issues for all adoptive families and the guidance will
reflect that. We will also add other issues that may arise in our
discussions with the NSPCC and other experts. During the consultation I
will put a copy of the consultation document in the House Library and
send a copy to former members of the Select Committee. I hope that many

outcomes for black children is not only about adoption. For many,
fostering will be more appropriate: three-quarters of all looked-after
children are in foster care. For others, it will be special
guardianship with a relative or former foster carer. Where adoption is
the right outcome for black children, we must do better to find them
families as quickly as we do for other children. For those children for
whom adoption is the right permanent outcome we need action on several
fronts. This includes recruiting more adopters generally, including
from minority ethnic communities. This year we have given £150
million to local authorities through the adoption reform grant to 
<?notus-xml column=608?>help boost adopter recruitment and £16 million for the voluntary
adoption agencies to help recruit more adopters who can meet the needs
of children needing adoption. For example, Southwark has come up with
innovative ways of recruiting adopters from the black
community.</hs_para>

provide training on a range of issues, which next year will include
ethnicity. Places are free for all local authority and voluntary
adoption agencies. There will be better adoption support. We know how
important this is, not only when the child is first placed with the
family, but also later on, perhaps when they are dealing with the
trials of adolescence and maybe, as my noble friend Lady Benjamin
alluded to in one particularly moving case, questioning their identity.
In September 2013 we announced a new fund with a contribution of nearly
£20 million to help adoptive parents access the best possible
support to meet their children’s needs. This fund will be rolled
out nationally from 2015 but will be trialled from next year. The
investment will make a difference to adopters in providing the support
they need and better guidance, and I have explained the steps we are
taking here.</hs_para>

Lady Morris, said so incisively, we have, I believe, complete consensus
right up to, and including, the point of diagnosing the problem. The

now turn to the amendment in the names of my noble friends Lady Hamwee
and Lady Walmsley. I am grateful to my noble friends for their
innovative thinking on this matter, proposing to remove references to
age and sex from Section 1(4)(d) of the relevant Act. I understand the
thinking behind the amendment, which I believe is designed to remove
from legislation any of the specific characteristics about a child, and
rely wholly on the phrase,</hs_para>

reflection, I do not propose to follow this line of thinking at
present. This is because there is no evidence that there is an issue
with the way that the courts or adoption agencies are interpreting the
words 
<?notus-xml column=609?>“age and sex”. There is a fairly technical issue at play
here. Clause 2 seeks to remove subsection (5) of Section 1
of the 2002 Act. This is a requirement which applies only to adoption
agencies—that is, local authorities and voluntary adoption
agencies—when placing a child for adoption. Subsection (4) of
Section 1—what is known as “the welfare
checklist”—applies to the court as well as to adoption
agencies, so seeking to amend this suggests a change for the courts as
well as for adoption
agencies.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13120919000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000062">In
addition, this provision in the welfare checklist reflects an identical
requirement on the courts in Section 1 of the Children Act 1989 when
considering orders under that Act. Therefore, if we were to change the
wording in the Adoption and Children Act 2002 in the way suggested by
removing the reference to age and sex, that would send a strange signal
to the court as it would suggest a different decision-making process
under the Adoption and Children Act 2002 from that under the Children
Act
1989.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120919000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000063">However,
in the end I come back to the very serious issue we want to address:
the delay that black children and other ethnic minority children
experience while waiting for adoption. As I said at the beginning, we
have today paid tribute to one of the greatest advocates of racial
equality ever. I listen frequently to the wonderful speech given by the
other great advocate, Martin Luther King, which in my view is the
greatest speech ever made. It is not the “I Have a Dream”
speech, which everyone thinks of, but the one he made two months before
that at Cobo Hall in Detroit in June 1963, which was then the centre of
popular music, in which he used that wonderful musical analogy that all
God’s children, from base black to treble white, are equally
important in God’s world and on God’s keyboard. However,
that does not seem to be the result in terms of the outcomes for black
children in our adoption system, and this Government are determined to
change
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120919000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0001.htm#13120919000064">It is
the requirement on local authorities and other adoption agencies at
Section 1(5) in the Adoption and Children Act
which—albeit it was placed there with the best of
motives—I believe has contributed to the delays that
black children face, as I think all noble Lords have acknowledged. The
statutory guidance gives us the opportunity to provide much
more nuanced advice and guidelines which will benefit all children
being adopted, not just those who are visibly different from
prospective families. For this reason, I urge the noble and learned
Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

on what in my view is an important issue, although it may be, as
several have said, a question of balance and degree. I will start by
answering some of the Minister’s points. As a former judge who
tried adoption cases, I am well aware of the unacceptable delays that
there have been in adoptions of non-white children and children from
other cultural backgrounds. I believe that Section 1(5), requiring
social workers and the courts to pay particular regard to ethnicity,
was wrong and I am happy that the Government wish to remove Section
1(5) from the Adoption and Children

them coming from the important reports that have been published. I hope

take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Storey, about statutory

equally well go into statutory guidance. The checklist in Section 1(4)
of the Adoption and Children Act has six paragraphs, (a) to (e), and
three sub-paragraphs, (i) to (iii), and it is thought necessary to
include them in the checklist, not just in statutory guidance. So why
are the other factors in the 2002 Act so much more important than these
four points that I have just set out, which I propose should be slipped

it. One does not have to keep on regarding it. I certainly had no
problem in the Children Act and the Adoption Act in having regard to
something, then discarding it. There is nothing at all prescriptive
about “having regard”. However, a checklist is a reminder
to social workers and judges that they must not ignore it. To take it
out altogether, which the adoption agencies are concerned about, is to

jolt. What do “background” and
“characteristics” mean? They have to include certain
points that I am not certain every social worker, however senior, might
necessarily have in mind unless they were there. I say again that
statutory guidance is not quite as good as having a checklist in
primary legislation. The pendulum should be in the middle, and the

to Amendments 4 and 5, which variously attempt to circumscribe the
power that the Secretary of State is taking in Clause
3.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000002">Clause
3 grants the Secretary of State a new power to force local authorities
to franchise out adopter recruitment services, either to another local
authority or to a registered adoption agency, by amending
Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.
The new section inserted by Clause 3 provides the Secretary of State
with the power to direct the outsourcing of local authority adopter
recruitment functions, either from individual named authorities under
subsection (3)(a) or from classes or groups of local authorities under
subsection (3)(b) or from all local authorities at once under
subsection (3)(c). The important aspect is not the power to outsource
itself but the manner in which it would allow the Secretary of State to
make change on a large or even national scale at once through a
direction. The Secretary of State, in issuing a direction as opposed to
bringing forward primary or secondary legislation, would not obviously
have to subject himself to any parliamentary scrutiny, and Members in
either House would not have the opportunity to question or amend the
changes. This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:46:39"></hs_TimeCode> is
the nub of our
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000003">Our
Amendment 5 would have the effect of deleting subsections (3)(b) and
(3)(c) and therefore remove the power of the Secretary of State to
direct outsourcing from classes or groups of local authorities or from
all local authorities at
once<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:46:33"></hs_TimeCode>. We tabled
this amendment in Committee to probe the Government’s intentions
and 
<?notus-xml column=615?>we do not intend to press this amendment here. It was tabled at an early
stage following Grand Committee to signal our continued concern and
before we were able to see the Government’s response to that
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000004">At the
meeting last week, Edward Timpson said that there would be an amendment
to respond to those concerns and we wanted to see the terms of that
amendment before finalising our position. We were hoping that the
Government would address those concerns by amending the clause to make
subsections (3)(b) and (3)(c) subject to an affirmative resolution
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:47:18"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
unfortunately both the government amendment and the policy statement
that was issued alongside it really are a wholly inadequate response to
what noble Lords across the House have been saying. Government
Amendment 6 would simply delay the implementation of subsection (3)(c),
which provides the power to outsource to all local authorities at once.
Along with the government amendment, there was also a written
commitment to report that decision in some as yet unspecified
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:47:50"></hs_TimeCode>. Delaying
implementation is really neither here nor there—it is
irrelevant—and reporting to Parliament falls far short of
parliamentary
scrutiny.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000005">The
policy statement that was published does not explain why the Secretary
of State is seeking power through a direction rather than through
secondary legislation but simply restates the arguments about the need
to reshape the market in adopter recruitment. That is an argument with
which we would not necessarily disagree but in support of which the
Government have provided no evidence. These are important issues, but
they are wholly irrelevant to our point that taking powers to institute
major change to the national system of adopter recruitment by direction
is a completely unacceptable way to treat this House and the other
place. We cannot support the Government’s
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:48:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Amendment 4 would retain the powers in subsections (3)(b) and (3)(c)
but make their implementation subject to an order by affirmative
resolution in both Houses of Parliament. We all support efforts to
improve adopter recruitment if this will mean more children finding
good homes. The Government’s policy statement sets out why the
Government believes that major structural change may be necessary to
address the shortfall in adoptive parents despite the 34% increase in
the last two years, which is a very welcome improvement. However, even
here the statement is contradictory on the role of the powers in Clause
3 in reshaping that market. Paragraph 11 says that the
purpose of Clause 3 is to provide a powerful market-shaping lever to
help restructure fundamentally the adopter recruitment system, but
paragraph 12 says that, in moving towards the Government’s
vision for that restructured system, Clause 3 is not seen as
the sole or even the principal driver of reform—its role is to
drive change only if there is little or no progress in reshaping the
structure of the market and reducing the shortfall of adopters. That is
because, as the Minister admitted in Grand Committee, Clause
3 is not of itself a solution to the problem of the shortfall of
adopters that the Government have identified; Clause 3 itself cannot
change that market. Indeed, it 
<?notus-xml column=616?>can be deployed only if and when it has been demonstrated that adopters
can be recruited in sufficient numbers by different
arrangements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:50:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

goes on to outline the real levers for change which are happening now
on a voluntary basis and which do not need legislation—for
example, the consolidation in the local authority sector through
mergers such as that involving St Helens, Warrington and Wigan in my
region, the north-west, and the development of commissioning and
provider relationships between local authorities in adopter
recruitment. The adoption leadership board is encouraging and
facilitating these developments, as well as supporting partnerships
involving voluntary adoption agencies.</hs_para>

these developments were successful, one could envisage that the system
would have changed to such an extent that it reached a tipping point at
which the use of the power in, say, subsection (3)(c) might make sense.
However, if these developments were not successful, what would the
Secretary of State do? Would he outsource adopter recruitment from all
local authorities anyway when there was no credible alternative? That
would be wholly irresponsible and I cannot believe that the Government
would take such a risk. Either way, the point is that there really
ought to be parliamentary oversight at that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:51:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

mobilising the power in Clause 3 becomes necessary, and indeed possible
in practice, only if and when the developments between local
authorities and the voluntary sector reach a critical mass such that
wholesale change across the country is a viable option. That is my
concern with Amendments 4A, 4B, 4C and 4D. Together, they would have
the effect of applying the affirmative resolution procedure only in the
event of the Secretary of State wanting to outsource these adoption
functions from all local authorities simultaneously—that is,
using the power in subsection (3)(c). If these amendments were agreed,
the Secretary of State would still be able to direct significant
proportions of local authorities in groups under the power in
subsection (3)(b) and require them to outsource their adoption
functions. For instance, he might require that in respect of all shire
counties or all metropolitan authorities. Indeed, by announcing three
or four successive directions, each of which related to a large group
of authorities, the Secretary of State could effectively sweep the
country without any parliamentary scrutiny. In other words, by using a
few directions under subsection (3)(b), he could achieve what I think
we all agree we want to prevent, which is the use of subsection (3)(c)
without any scrutiny.</hs_para>

logical to try to apply the affirmative resolution to subsection (3)(c)
but not to do so also to subsection (3)(b). The effect of that would be
not to constrain the Government at all, because they could still use
the power in subsection (3)(b) successively to include all local
authorities. That is my big concern, and it is expressed and supported
by organisations in the sector such as Barnardo’s.</hs_para>

from in relation to individual named authorities under subsection
(3)(a), we should expect the Secretary of State to come to Parliament
and, via an affirmative order, outline the progress that has been made
and to answer the questions that Members 
<?notus-xml column=617?>would inevitably have—questions such as how secure the changes
are, what the national picture is in terms of the number of consortia
recruiting adopters, how many adopters are being recruited, and whether
the capacity of the voluntary sector has grown and what role it is
playing. The voluntary agencies and local authorities might have issues
that they would want us to pursue, as would be normal. There would be
many legitimate questions, and answers to them could be put on the
record.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000012">The
Government are right to address the problem of insufficient adopters.
If they wish to review the adopter recruitment system and propose
something radically different, they are entirely within their rights to
do so. However, they should not try to instigate radical change to a
national system on the judgment and pronouncement of an individual
Secretary of State. They should come to Parliament so that those
proposals could be properly debated and scrutinised in the normal way.

very normal. I beg to

understand that the intentions of the adoption clauses in the Bill are
to improve the adoption system and to tackle the shortage of adopters.
I am sure we all agree with that. Increasing the number of looked-after
children appropriately and successfully placed for adoption must of
course be a priority, and, again, I am sure we all agree with the
Government about that. The question is whether issuing ministerial
directions affecting adoption services across swathes of the country
without parliamentary scrutiny is a desirable way
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000016">If
local authorities were removed from the adoption roles, as envisaged in
Clause 3, the voluntary adoption agencies would need to increase their
capacity fivefold, as I understand it. We could expect severe
disruption of the system and a serious shortage of adopters for some
years in the local authority areas affected. We would feel content if
named authorities were dealt with in that way, because presumably there
would be very serious issues in those authorities, but the idea of
blanket shifts in this direction, using directions without any
parliamentary scrutiny, sounds disproportionate.</hs_para>

that Clause 3 risks fragmenting the system, as all councils would
remain responsible for placing children for adoption and matching them
with families. My understanding is that adopter families greatly value
having continuity of social workers through the entire system and that
they would not welcome changes simply because of alterations to the
system as envisaged under Clause 3.</hs_para>

amendment in relation to directions affecting all local authorities, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, said, but not in relation to
directions affecting one or more descriptions of local authorities,
which I understand could affect, for example, all boroughs throughout
the country. Perhaps the Minister can explain why it is right and
proper to have a statutory instrument laid before Parliament and
approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament in relation to
changes applying to all local authorities when the same principle is
apparently not acceptable for directions applying to all boroughs, for

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I have Amendments 4A, 4B, 4C,
4D and 6A in this group. They have already been trailed. When I first
became aware of a proposal for the Secretary of State to issue
directions about local authority adoption functions, I shared the alarm
which was expressed, because I am pretty unreconstructed when it comes
to local authority powers. On the other hand, having heard some of the
issues which seem to lie behind problems with recruiting adopters,
during the debates that took place during the work of the Select
Committee, at one point I wondered whether adoption services should be
nationalised. My pendulum has swung back to the
middle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000026">I am
reassured from what the Minister has said that the clause is not about
failure or the underperformance by individual local authorities; it
comes about because of concerns about the system, and systemic
underlying problems. The amendments in my name and those of the noble
Baroness, Lady Eaton, the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles—also
members of the Select Committee—and my noble friend Lord Storey,
flow from that. They are aimed at building on and improving what we are
presented with in the Bill. It has been voiced again today. What has
very much exercised noble Lords is ensuring that Parliament is not
sidelined. I realise that a direction under paragraph (c) would be very
different from directions under paragraphs (a) and (b) of new
subsection (3), and I will come back to that in a
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000027">Our

both Houses debating it with an order not to be made before March 2015.

that this is proposing a heavy hand. But if an order is proposed by the

confirm this—it would not be a lid, perhaps here a portcullis,
coming down. It would be a point in a sequence development of work, a
transitional point which could be, and I hope if necessary would be,
tailored as to which of the functions in new subsection (2)
was brought into play. It would not be necessary to make an order
dealing with all the functions

described to me as a quality improvement measure, with the possibility
of collaborative development of the detail of the direction before it

I remembered that something like 84% of adoptions last year were
carried out by local authorities and that, as we have heard, the
majority of them do a fantastic job. That is recognised by the
voluntary sector and, equally, the local authorities realise how
important the voluntary sector is. When the Bill first came to your
Lordships’ House, the 
<?notus-xml column=621?>voluntary sector, quite rightly, said, “Look, we could not cope

the time, it seemed right that the Government pointed to the fact that
some local authorities had an appalling track record. As I have said,
it is a very small number, but some had an appalling track record.
Indeed, the Local Government Association would be the first to
recognise that. So it seemed absolutely crucial that the Secretary of
State should have the power, if local authorities were underperforming
and were not prepared to work together and co-operate, to take that
responsibility away from them. I see the logic and the importance of
that because, at the end of the day, we are talking about the children.
However, I did not see the logic of having the power to take the
responsibility away from every local authority—that seemed plain
daft to me—given the expertise and commitment that local
authorities have and the amount of work that they do. I was therefore
delighted when the Minister tabled an amendment which ensured that
nothing could happen before March 2015. But that still means, unless I
have misunderstood it, that the Secretary of State could say in March
2015—although, as my noble friend Lady Hamwee said, it would be
two months off a general election—“We are going to do
this, and that is what we are doing”. That would not be in the
best interests of adoption and
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000037">If
in the mean time the Government work with local authorities and the
voluntary sector and different structures come together with different
ways of operating—and if it is decided that tri or quad groups
working together is the structure that we want—that is great.
Whatever structure is arrived at, the Secretary of State should come to
Parliament and both Houses should be able to say yes to it. I was not
used to the phrase “affirmative procedure” in the
amendment. If the Minister feels able to support Amendments 4A to 4C,
as his comments suggest, that would be a result with which we could all
be happy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000038">I do
not share the concern that the Secretary of State might use Amendment
4B to take away the responsibility from boroughs and metropolitan
bodies. That would not happen in the timescale because, as we have
heard, 84% of authorities carry out adoption. However, if some local
authorities are letting down children or the adoption service, in
extreme cases the Secretary of State would have that power. If these
clauses and amendments are accepted, it will mean that local
authorities have come to the table and discussed these matters even
more rapidly with the voluntary sector. I welcome the work that the

the absolute power at the end, if it is required, but the amendment
ensures that there is justification for anything that is taken before
both Houses of Parliament, and I am sure that we will all be more
comfortable about such scrutiny. The idea that, with the direction, the
Secretary of State merely has to give his reasoning but does not give

point was made by two earlier speakers that the Secretary of State
could use successive orders under new Section 3A(3)(b) to achieve what
new subsection (3)(c) provides for—in other words, to
wipe out all local authorities from these various functions. Given the
fact that new subsection (3)(c) is in the Bill, any Secretary of State
who were to try that would, I am sure, be challenged for an abuse of

I address Amendments 4 and 5 I remind noble Lords of the rationale of
the clause as set out in the recently published policy statement. The
clause is intended as a backstop should the current and significant
efforts of local government and voluntary agencies prove insufficient.
Unfortunately, we have to accept that this is a possibility as adoption
agencies have to work within a flawed system. The fundamental problems 
<?notus-xml column=623?>are the structure of provision, based around local boundaries, and the
unhelpful incentives associated with this structure. This constrains
the ability to recruit adoptive parents in sufficient numbers. As a
result, the system fails to deliver enough adopted parents to meet
national demand, as we have already
discussed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:19:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

quite clear: it is the system that is failing to meet national demand,
not the individual local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies
that make up the system. The distinction is important and can be
demonstrated by statistics. Recently published Ofsted data showed a 34%
increase in adopter approvals in 2012-13 compared to the previous year.
This is a huge achievement on the part of individual agencies. Local
authorities have delivered a 32% increase in adopters recruited and
approved and voluntary adoption agencies a 53% rise, and they should be
congratulated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:20:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000048">Impressive
though these numbers are, the sad truth is that this is still not
enough to meet the needs of the number of children waiting for a loving
home. At the end of March 2013, there were 6,000 children approved by
the courts for adoption, waiting to move in with a permanent family.
This is 15% higher than the year before. Furthermore, we estimate that
we need around 3,100 additional adopters to meet the existing demand of
the children who were already waiting with a placement
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000049">So we
face a real challenge to recruit more adoptive parents. To meet it, we
need to transform the system and tackle the underlying structural
problems. I feel that we are well placed to do so. After welcome and
constructive discussions with colleagues from local government and the
voluntary sector, we have an agreed proposition for a national adoption
leadership board. This is a significant milestone and demonstrates a
collective commitment to take nationally driven action to close the
adopter recruitment gap. The board’s members will be senior
figures from the core organisations within the adoption system in
England. I therefore see this board as the principal forum to deliver
significant improvements in the performance of the adoption
system.</hs_para>

the board’s leadership, we expect to see significant changes in
the shape and structure of the providers available, including
increasing consolidation and scale among local authority adoption
agencies; growth in the capacity of the voluntary sector and an

responsible; and more partnership working between local authorities and
voluntary adoption agencies, local authority employees, spinouts into

sorts of things are already happening. For example, I was pleased to
see from the recent Ofsted publication that, as my noble friend Lady
Hamwee referred to, 12 local authorities now provide adoption services
under joint arrangements. These are Bedford borough and Central
Bedfordshire; the west London tri-borough; Leicestershire and Rutland;
Shropshire and Telford; and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes,

also welcome the partnership arrangements that exist between local

3 therefore provides levers of last resort. It is the backstop to a
number of things that Government are doing to support local authorities
and voluntary adoption agencies. I have already mentioned the
Government’s support for the new national adoption board. We
have invested £150 million through the adoption reform grant to
support local authorities in 2013-14.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:24:51"></hs_TimeCode> are also
investing £16 million to build the capacity of the voluntary
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000054">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:23:09"></hs_TimeCode>
know that these investments are having an impact. We expect there to be
a number of new voluntary adoption agencies in the near future and we
know that many local authorities have made good use of the adoption
reform grant. For example, they have recruited additional staff,
provided staff training and development and funded a range of marketing
activities to recruit more adopters. I was particularly interested in
the work the Southwark area is doing, as I have already mentioned. It
used some of its funding to develop an innovative recruitment campaign
to target harder-to-reach prospective adopters using a reward scheme.
Southwark is also working with Lambeth to fund an outreach worker to
promote the recruitment of adopters from the BME
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000055">I
will now explain the government amendment, which tries to address some
of the concerns raised in Grand Committee. Amendment 6 delays the

the period prior to March 2015, the Secretary of State would retain the
capacity to issue directions under new subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b),
if absolutely 
<?notus-xml column=625?>necessary. As I set out in my policy statement, these directions would
follow due process. For example, they would be preceded by a letter
setting out the Secretary of State’s intention to issue a
direction. This would explain the underlying reasons and provide the
affected local authorities with an invitation to respond. Only then
would the Secretary of State take a final decision to issue the
direction. In considering the issuing of any direction, I expect the
new adoption leadership board to play a key advisory
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000062">Amendment
5 would largely reduce Clause 3 to an intervention power to tackle
individual local authorities. But this is not the purpose of Clause 3

to Amendment 4, the Government do not agree that directions to
“one or more descriptions” of local authorities under new
subsection (3)(b) should also be subject to the affirmative procedure.
New subsections (3)(b) and (3)(a) provide the Secretary of State with
the flexibility to take swift, decisive action if required. For
example, to answer the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher,
they could be used to direct a small number of local authorities who
were resisting a successful regional initiative, driven by other local
authorities, to collaborate and work more efficiently. A direction
given in this way would be the result of a dialogue with the affected
authorities. It would thus be an iterative process, not a unilateral
declaration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120925000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120925000065">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:28:32"></hs_TimeCode>

to use new subsection (3)(b) as a method of achieving the aim of new
subsection (3)(c) without the affirmative procedures. My noble friend
also asked whether the direction has to be about all the functions in
subsection (2), or merely some of them. She is right; it can be about
all or any of the three function in that paragraph.</hs_para>

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> I thank all Members who participated
in this debate. It is an important issue and it is right that it was
aired again on Report. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Sloss, characteristically put her finger on one reason why 
<?notus-xml column=626?>this is important: the danger of allowing any Government, now or in the

functions without parliamentary scrutiny. That is the key
issue.</hs_para>

Lady Hamwee, Lady Eaton and Lady Walmsley, and the noble Lord, Lord
Storey, all felt that there was no need for the affirmative resolution
in relation to new subsection (3)(b). The Minister’s statement
has just put on the record that the Government would not use new
subsection (3)(b) as a way of progressively working through local
authorities in this country, and thereby achieving new
subsection (3)(c) through successive application of new
subsection (3)(b). That was a very helpful statement to put on the
record and it gives some reassurance. However, I say to the noble Lord,
Lord Storey, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Hamwee, Lady Eaton and Lady
Walmsley, that the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, pinpointed the danger
of that. Although the Minister said that new subsection (3)(b) could be
used for small groups of local authorities, equally, it could be used
for large groups of them in exactly in the way that the noble Baroness
identified: all metropolitan districts or all boroughs, and so on. It
would take only two or three directions of that nature to encompass all
the local authorities in the country.</hs_para>

Minister’s statement putting it on the record that the
Government will not do that is helpful. With that, I think we have
consensus across the House; this was evident in Committee and in the
meetings that have taken place since. That consensus is on the
principle of parliamentary scrutiny—particularly when the
Government are implementing significant change in public services,
which they would be if they applied new subsection (3)(c)—and
that implementing change on that scale, involving all local authorities
at once, should have the affirmative resolution procedure. It is very
good that the Government have at last conceded the strength of feeling
in the House on that issue and agreed the affirmative procedure in
relation to new subsection (3)(c). Having achieved that, and with the
Minister’s statement in relation to new subsection
(3)(b), I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</hs_para>

further harm unless changes are made. Too many young people end up in a

problem, as laid out in that letter, is that the NSPCC conducted some
research a year or so ago and was horrified to find that half of young
people returning home from care were then returned to care fairly
shortly afterwards. The needs of the families were not being addressed.
They were still alcoholic or misusing drugs and those children were
being returned home to unsafe places. Furthermore, what one finds in
these circumstances is that children who are returned home, then taken
back into care, then sent home again and taken back into care are
damaged by that. In the worst cases, they lose all trust in adults and
become people who are dependent on the state. They may be in prison.

There are new measures, including that there should be a plan
established by each local authority for those children returning from
care. I am grateful for the fact that they have set up a working group,
which includes the NSPCC, to look at just this matter. There is one

That is the majority of children who return from care but a substantial
minority have either interim care orders or full care orders, and those
are not currently covered by the measures proposed by the consultation.
While local authorities have the power to ensure that young people
returning from care to their biological parents have

to the personal budgets we are giving to adopted children—the
equivalent of a guaranteed range of services to support those

responsibilities that local authorities have and the shortage of
resources, the concern is that many will not do that. Finally, there is
no consistent assessment of young people and their families before they

9 which stands in my name is on the subject of maintaining sibling
contact. The amendment would require local authorities to give specific
consideration to enabling children in care to remain in contact with
their siblings. Many noble Lords here today will remember that we had a
very good, if disturbing, discussion on that in Grand
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120930000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120930000011">First,
we were confronted with some stark statistics. Some 63% of children in
care whose siblings are also in the care system are separated from
them. Surprisingly, those living in children’s homes are much
more likely to be separated than those in foster care. What is more,
children care very deeply about this separation; 85% said that it was
important to keep siblings together and more than three-quarters said
that councils could do more to help brothers and sisters keep in touch
with each other. Secondly, we heard a number of moving individual
stories of the distress caused to children who were separated from and
unable to contact their siblings. For many, the relationship was more
important than that with their parents and was a particular bond when
they had been through a traumatic family break-up or protected each
other in an abusive family. Often the elder children felt a particular
responsibility for their younger siblings and were desperate when they
could not check that they were okay; they had almost a quasi-parental
concern for them. Although there will be occasions, of course, when
children need to be separated for very good reasons, it seems that in
the remaining majority of cases a lack of priority or perhaps just
practical issues have been allowed to develop as an excuse for contact
not happening on a regular basis. Our amendment would make that sibling
contact a priority in social work practice and would give the
requirement the additional weight of being in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120930000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120930000012">When we
debated this in Committee, and in subsequent discussions, the Minister
showed sympathy for the problem but resisted the need for primary
legislation. 
<?notus-xml column=630?>He drew our attention to the current requirement for children’s
individual care plans to set out the arrangements for sibling contact.
He has also drawn up updated guidance on sibling contact for children
in care. Of course, we are very grateful for that additional work.
However, the point is that the previous guidance had little effect on
practice on the ground, as the statistics have shown, so it is hard to
imagine that the updated guidance will be any more effective. That is
why we believe that emphasising the importance of this issue in the
Bill can send a stronger message to those who are currently routinely
failing to nurture sibling
contact.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120930000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120930000013">The
Minister also referred to the views of an expert group, which looked
into this issue and concluded that more needed to be done to improve
practice on the ground. Obviously, we agree that more can be done in
terms of advice, training and good practice dissemination. I do not
know when that group reported its findings, but, again, so far there
appears to be little evidence of a major improvement in sibling contact

we believe that our amendment could act as a catalyst for change and
help to drive the change in social work practice on the ground that we
all desire. We have to find the right balance between key principles
being set out in primary legislation and the detail that can be spelt
out in statutory guidance. This is becoming an ongoing theme of our
debates on the Bill. There may be a contradiction in the position
adopted by the Minister and the Government if we compare their views on
this to the position adopted on the ethnicity issue that we debated
only an hour or so ago. There the Government took the view that if it
was in the Bill people would take it very seriously and therefore they
needed to remove it from the Bill so that it would not be taken so
seriously. On the other hand, we are saying that people are not taking
it seriously because it is only in secondary legislation so we need to
put it in the Bill. However, the Government are very resistant to that,
even though they are sympathetic to our arguments. There is a dichotomy
about how we deliver that change on the ground.</hs_para>

I said in Grand Committee—there are people in the Chamber who
may not have heard this so forgive 
<?notus-xml column=631?>me for saying it again—children came to talk to us in the Select
Committee on Adoption Legislation. These children had been adopted or
looked after, who were or had been in care. Perhaps the most important
issue they raised with me and with another noble Lord on the Select
Committee was their relationship with their brothers and sisters. They
made absolutely clear the importance of those with whom they had
already shared a family life. One girl, who was aged about
15 or 16, said, “I don’t expect to see the
children born to my parents after I left home, but I really do need to
stay in touch with those I knew”. Another boy, aged about 10 or
11, said, “I looked after my younger brother and sister. I am so
worried about what is happening to them; nobody will tell me. I wake up
each night and think: are they all right? Why can’t I find out
what is happening and why can’t I see them?”. That was an
adopted child who was extremely happy in his adoption placement but who
remained extremely worried about the children who remained at
home.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120930000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120930000019">So this
is a really important point, and as the noble Baroness, Lady Jones,
said, if it is in primary legislation, it will have that added bit of
importance. Social workers do not always recognise this, and neither do
adopters. It is very important that the message is put forward: it is
not that children should see their former natural parents, which may be
totally inappropriate; but in certain cases there will be children who
should see those they have had to leave behind. It is that group of
children for whom the amendment has been tabled. It is a very important
point, particularly where the child has been adopted. The new adoptive
parents may well not appreciate the importance unless it is up front.
They are not going to read social work practice—that is the last
thing in the world they are going to read. They may not want any
relationship. However, for both the social workers and the adoptive
parents, this is an important factor in the welfare of the child about
whom we are talking. It really

Young of Hornsey:</Member></B> My Lords, in speaking to Amendment 10,
I, like other noble Lords this afternoon, place on record how grateful
I am for the help of the Minister and his officials in trying to get to
grips with this issue of access to records for care leavers, especially
as it was not originally part of the Bill. I understand why we needed
some considered negotiations around the subject. I found those very
useful, as did my colleagues from the access to records campaign group,
which comprises professionals from the Care Leavers’
Association, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, the
Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, the Child Care History Network, the
Post Care Forum and Barnardo’s. It is also supported by the
fostering and adoption charity,
TACT.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120930000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120930000021">Some of
the key issues that this amendment seeks to address are the lack of
consistency across the country’s local authorities in the way
they deal with giving access to records to care leavers, and also,
importantly, how they deal with the issue of redaction of those
records. A number of care leavers gave us evidence of how they received
notes from their past which were essentially incomprehensible because
of the amount of redaction that had taken place. Again, 
<?notus-xml column=632?>that seems to depend on whereabouts you live in the country. That should
obviously not be the case. In the amendment, we call for clear,
effective statutory guidance and the opportunity for care leavers to
access support once they have accessed their
records.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120930000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120930000022">That
is another important point. I am not sure that all noble Lords are
aware how difficult that experience can sometimes be for people. It
does not matter what age you are. This is not just for young people who
have recently left care. Many older people also have that experience.
At the moment, no kind of support is necessarily offered to them. Of
course, care records must be properly maintained and every effort made
to trace records from decades ago as well as more recent
ones. That ties in to my earlier point about the ages of people seeking
their records. In fact, colleagues at the Care Leavers’
Association say that the average age of those seeking its help in
looking for their records is around 35 and goes up to a 90
year-old—who found her records, triumphantly. Whatever age you
are when you eventually get your records, if you are fortunate enough
to do so, the experience can be
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120930000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120930000023">During
meetings with officials, it emerged that both the Minister—the
noble Lord, Lord Nash—and the Minister for Children and Families
agreed that the current wording on access to records in the care
planning statutory guidance could be strengthened. Colleagues from the
access to records campaign and I have worked with officials on that
particular subject. It is also my understanding that Ministers have
agreed to work with us on a programme to ensure that front-line
managers and staff are aware of the new guidance. Again, that was
raised earlier this afternoon in relation to how statutory guidance is
used and the extent to which people take it seriously. We need to
ensure that they do—once we have, as I hope, developed some new
guidance in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120930000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120930000024">That
activity will include supporting a round table for local authorities
and voluntary sector organisations, and sending messages via the
department’s various communication routes to relevant bodies
which can raise that issue with their local authorities and make sure
it is firmly on the agenda. We also understand that officials have
spoken to the National Care Advisory Service, which runs the National
Leaving Care Benchmarking Forum for managers. It said that it would be
happy to run a session where the managers talk about how to improve
their local practice, based on the
proposed revised guidance and best practice. Could the Minister confirm
my understanding of that? Also, would he be prepared to ensure that the
voice of older adult care leavers is heard during all consultation
processes and that an assessment of the effectiveness of strengthened
statutory guidelines is carried

consultation on permanence goes some way to ensuring that voluntarily
accommodated children receive the support they need, but, as was made
clear from the reference to the letter in the <I>Telegraph</I>, an
awful lot of important bodies in this area, as well as academics,
support the need for further action. As others have said, the
Government’s attempts to improve the adoption system should
undoubtedly be praised. However, adoption is not the outcome for the
majority of looked-after children. Instead, most children placed in
care return home to parents or carers. In 2012, 10,000 children went
home after a stay in care compared with just 3,440 who were
adopted.</hs_para>

go home without a proper assessment of their and their parents’
support needs prior to leaving care or after they have returned home.
For example, in cases where children were returned to households with a
high recurrence of drug and alcohol misuse, only 5% of parents were
provided with treatment to help them address their substance abuse. The
lack of these types of support services often results in children going
back home to face a significant risk of experiencing further abuse. In
fact, research by the NSPCC shows that around half the children who
came into care because of abuse or neglect suffered further abuse when
they returned home. Recent DfE statistics show that a third of children
who return home subsequently go in and out of care twice or more.
Suffering from or being at risk of further abuse, and moving in and out
of care, only compounds these children’s already traumatic
childhoods and can cause significant long-term
harm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120930000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120930000028">The

or generally poor parenting. Research shows that such an entitlement is
unlikely to place an additional burden on local authorities—it
could save them money, given the high financial cost of failed returns
home. In one case highlighted in the recent DfE data pack, the total
social care costs were £22,068 due to the child having frequent

Warner (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friend’s
Amendment 9, which puts contact between siblings in the Bill. I
apologise to the House that I was unable to take part in this
Bill’s proceedings in Committee because I was engaged on the
Care Bill. However, I was on the Select Committee on Adoption
Legislation and I echo the points made by the chairman of that

Butler-Sloss.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000002">On
the basis of my six years as a director of social services, I have a
general point about why the Minister should concede on Amendment 9.
While I was director, the Children Act 1989 was passed. That was a
classic example of Parliament saying in a Bill that decisions about
children should be taken on the basis of the best interests of the
child. In the overwhelming majority of cases where siblings are
separated, the best interests of the child are to maintain that
contact. Sibling contact is often a private child’s world, which
is not always well observed by adults, whether they are social workers
or other adults involved in that child’s life. Maintaining that
contact is overwhelmingly important to children. My noble friend has
shown that the option of putting it in guidance and relying on best
practice has had a good run for its money and it has not worked. We
should return to some of the ideas in the Children Act 1989 and put in
the Bill the obligation to help maintain contacts between siblings when
they are separated. These contacts are in the best interests of the
children and very important to them. It costs very little to put that
in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hamwee" PimsId="3737" UID="13120942000602" xid="1741" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000602">Baroness

children—she shared with the House some of their moving

social workers. When we talked about contact generally, not just with
siblings, several of them said that the problem lay in adopters not
wanting to know, preferring to see their children as part of the new
family and wanting to leave the past behind. Therefore I take very
seriously the point that she and other noble Lords have made about the
importance of having this in the legislation. Guidance has not been

Northover (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for putting
down these amendments and for their commitment in this area. We focus
here on three areas that greatly impact on the lives of children in
care and care leavers. I thank the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for his
thanks to my noble and honourable colleagues. Noble Lords will note
that my honourable friend, the Minister for Children and Families, is
at the Bar of the House. We appreciate his

start with the important issue of children who return home from care,
addressed by the amendment of the noble Earl. I thank him for his
acknowledgement that support for those returning home is a key priority
for the Government. We agree that much greater attention is required to
ensure that both the statutory framework and local practice are
improved significantly. We are working closely with an expert group,
including organisations such as the NSPCC, which are making an
invaluable contribution to this work. I hope noble Lords will be
reassured that we are strengthening the statutory framework for
voluntarily accommodated children since we believe this is particularly
weak. We are exploring whether the current statutory framework needs to
be strengthened for other children who return home, including those who
were previously on a care order and 16 and 17 year-old care leavers. We
are also working to improve practice for all children who return home,
whatever their legal status while they are in care or when they return
home.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000007">The
noble Earl raised the issue of children on interim care orders. We are

noble Earl and other noble Lords asked about personal budgets. The
current statutory framework provides sufficient flexibility for local
authorities to provide personal budgets if they think this is the best
way to meet a family’s needs. We do not think that it would be
appropriate to assume that this will be necessary in all circumstances.
Therefore, we believe that decisions about financial support and how
this is provided should be taken on a case-by-case basis. I hope that

difference, which is the crux, and which was highlighted by her noble
friend in earlier discussions. We will need to monitor the impact of
our revised guidance and our planned programme of work in the short and
long term. The noble Baroness is right about that. It must make a
difference. The revised Ofsted inspection framework includes specific

am fully conscious that many noble Lords have dedicated their life to
public service, whereas I am a relative newcomer to this. Indeed, up
until 10 years ago I spent my life in business focused, frankly, on
money. However, about 10 years ago some philanthropic juices started to
flow—better late than never you might think—which was
initially sparked by two events which happened, as so often
serendipitously occurs, in close proximity to each other that made a
profound impact on me. First, I visited an organisation which was
involved in looking after children in care who were particularly
challenged and had fallen out of many other placements or, as the noble
Earl, Lord Listowel, described it, had experienced a revolving door of
care. This organisation provided intensive care for these children. I
remember when visiting them being struck by how intensive this support
was.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000028">Shortly
thereafter I visited the charity Amber, which looks after young people,
many of whom have been in care and many of whom some years after
leaving care have become homeless or been in prison. Amber takes these
young people for an intensive residential course to rehabilitate them
into society, teach them how to apply for a job, be interviewed, how to
dress and show manners et cetera. The charity has a very high success
rate of getting them into jobs permanently. When visiting this charity
and talking to the young people, I was struck by the contrast between
the often very good care that they spoke about receiving—not
always but often it was very good care—and how, when they became
adults, society seemed to drop them like a hot brick. Following this, I
spent some considerable time understanding the plight of children
leaving care, and I am delighted to say that we have moved a long way
since then, thanks to the very good efforts of the previous Government

Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000029">Therefore,

Minister for Children and Families who—as the noble Baroness,
Lady Northover, said, I am delighted to see is in the
House—particularly following the latest disappointing figures
from the staying-put pilots, had absolutely no hesitation in feeling

benefit from staying put, who did not stay with their foster carers,
were more likely to have multiple changes in habitation immediately

cost to allow young people to stay in their children’s homes
past age 18. However, it has been suggested that there might be a
method of connecting young people in residential care with foster
carers towards the end of or early on in their stay in residential care
so that, if they chose, they could move on to a fostering
arrangement as they moved towards the ages of 18, 19 and 20. I hope

noble Earl, Lord Listowel, commented on care leavers who leave
residential care. In general, as noble Lords will know,
children’s homes do not seek to provide a permanent
“family-type” placement, and few placements in homes last
very long. However, there is nothing to stop local authorities from
providing staying-put arrangements. However, our proposed duty will
only apply to care leavers who leave foster care placements. As the
noble Earl said, it is a great deal more difficult and expensive to
provide staying-put arrangements in children’s homes. You would
have vulnerable adults in homes with much younger vulnerable children.
However, we are supporting Catch22 with a grant of £200,000 over
two years to help improve support and outcomes for young people who
leave residential care. The project is working with six providers in
the north-west of England and learning will be disseminated nationally.

essential medical treatment. They were later forced to hand over their
son to the gang that had loaned them the money. He was brought to the
UK and forced to cultivate cannabis to work off the debt to the
criminal gang that had brought him here. I will also tell the story of
the girl from Nigeria who was told that she was being brought to the UK
to go to school and receive an education. Instead, she was forced to do
work around the house where she was held captive. Her passport was
taken from her, she was not allowed to leave the house, and she was
even made to eat separately from the rest of the household. Not only
was she used as a domestic slave and violently beaten, but she was
sexually abused by the man of the house and by his friend, became
pregnant and was forced to have an
abortion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000056">These

set out in February 2012, and then consider the findings of <I>Still at

for the child trafficking guardian as set out in Amendment 13.
Sometimes we can get into a bit of a muddle when considering the
appointment of guardians, thinking that they conduct a role that an
existing body or agency should conduct. If the guardian proposal is
seen in this way, arguments in favour of it are inevitably seen as a
criticism of existing agencies. This, however, is to misunderstand
fundamentally the role of child trafficking guardians, which is
different from that of any existing actor or
agency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:42:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000060">The
child trafficking guardian model is based on the UNICEF guidelines and
international best practice because the problems that child victims of
trafficking experience have remarkable similarities from country to
country. Rescued victims are children in a foreign country who have to
engage with multiple state agencies such as the courts, the police,
local government, education and so on. In each agency they have to deal
with a different set of people. They have to retell their painful story
again and again. This is disorientating and distressing for the
children and in this context of being passed from pillar to post
children become alienated and particularly vulnerable to
retrafficking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:43:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

distinctly British problem. It is a problem of being a trafficked child
in a foreign country and having to engage with different state
agencies. The child trafficking guardian solution provides an entirely
new role that no existing agency provides. It does two things. First,
the child trafficking guardian, while regulated by law, is independent
from those state agencies that make decisions about the child’s
immigration status or which finance a child’s care. Trafficked
children are 
<?notus-xml column=647?>invariably afraid and tend to distrust authority figures representing
the state. A child trafficking guardian can speak to and for the child
without any other conflicting interest. Secondly, the child trafficking
guardian is not a new level of bureaucracy with which a rescued
trafficked child must engage to be processed by the state in addition
to the police, courts, local government and so on. Rather, their role
is to be a constant in an ever changing world and to accompany the
rescued trafficked child as they relate to all the different state
agencies. To enable the child trafficking guardian to do this, they
have legal recognition so that all the agencies are obliged to
recognise them, allowing them to accompany the child. They also have
the right to speak on behalf of the child if the child requests it so
that the child does not have to repeat their painful stories again and
again if they do not want
to.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13120942000316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000316">7.45

established the rationale for child trafficking guardians, I now turn
to the problem I highlighted in February 2012, which child trafficking
guardians are designed to address, and the findings of the resultant
research. I argued that we badly needed to make provision for child
trafficking guardians because of the extraordinarily large number of
rescued trafficked children who were being lost from local authority
care—301 out of 942 trafficked children looked after between
2005 and 2010. I pointed out that this national disgrace was hardly
surprising given that our child trafficking provisions did not and do
not comply with the international best practice set out by UNICEF. I
also examined each provision in the Children Act that the Government
have argued has the effect of providing a child trafficking guardian
function, explaining why it does not provide this function and I will
briefly recap, explaining why this is still very much the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:47:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000063">First,
independent advocates appointed under Section 26 of the Children Act
act only on the child’s behalf in relation to the care that a
child receives from a local authority. Quite apart from the obvious and
immediate problem that Section 26 advocates do not engage with a
child’s interaction with any other state agencies, a child is
not appointed an advocate from the moment they are identified as
possibly being a trafficked child, which is key requirement of the EU
anti-trafficking directive. The advocate is appointed only if the child
wishes to avail themselves of this opportunity. Moreover, there is
currently no guarantee that the advocate provided for a trafficked
child who requests one would have any knowledge or understanding of
human trafficking, even with the proposed new statutory
guidance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:48:03"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, independent visitors can be offered if a local authority
considers a child would benefit from such support but this is simply a
befriending role. Thirdly, independent reviewing officers do not
accompany or support the child in their interactions with all state
agencies. They meet them only to talk about their care

I made the same points in Grand Committee the Minister referred to each
of these roles without addressing my arguments that none of them
amounts to the provision of a child trafficking guardian. However, she
did refer to one additional role, that of the child social worker. I
have already explained that the child 
<?notus-xml column=648?>trafficking guardian is a unique, separate and complementary role to
that of other professionals caring for a trafficked child. It is not
appropriate to expect social workers to fulfil the role of a child
trafficking guardian, physically accompanying rescued children in all
their interactions with the state. A child trafficking guardian
alongside a trafficked child will enable social workers to provide the
best support for all the children in their

social workers but many other children had multiple social workers or

already defined the role of child trafficking guardian, I will pick up
on just two features of Amendment 13. First, the training, skills and
expertise of a child trafficking guardian are extremely important. The
strength of the system proposed by this amendment is in the specialist
care and support that these guardians would provide. Proposed new
subsection (8) of the amendment would require that guardians meet the
training requirements set out by the Secretary of State and that
appropriate structures for supervision of the child trafficking
guardians are put in place. Secondly, in the current economic climate,
the Government must rightly take into account the need to spend public
money wisely and most effectively. Amendment 13 seeks to give the
Government flexibility both now and in the future for how these
guardianship services are provided by enabling this to be done through
public sector employees or the employees or volunteers of recognisable
charitable organisations as designated by the Secretary of State.
Creating a new public sector agency to provide these services could be
expensive, but equipping and empowering charities and volunteers to
fulfil this role could be very cost effective. Some may have concerns
about the role of volunteers but I have already emphasised the
importance of training and supervision enshrined in the amendment. This
country has a long-standing system of volunteer magistrates and well
trained volunteer child trafficking guardians could provide similarly
excellent support to children who have been
trafficked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T19:52:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that child from the moment of identification of the child having been a

of Dulwich, said—I do not apologise for saying it
again—because English children who are slaves are dealt with
differently. The foreign child will probably speak no English and will
have been brought into this country and enslaved in a wide variety of
ways such as labour exploitation, prostitution or domestic servitude.
Whichever method is used, the child is identified and is then known to
be a victim. The child will not necessarily speak English and will not
have papers. It will be difficult to work out exactly how old the child
is and whether he or she is 15 or 18. Different arrangements apply
according to the child’s age. The child will almost certainly be
traumatised and, as the noble Lord, Lord McColl, said, frightened. He
or she will have been told that they must not talk to the police,
social services or to anybody else because they will put the child back
on a plane or a boat and send them back to the place where

for trafficked adults—or, indeed, other adults who come up

state authorities has been mentioned and it seems that retrafficking
happens because very often the trafficked child knows only his or her
traffickers. They have been taught to trust the traffickers, who have
said, “If there is a problem, here is the phone number. You
contact us”. Of course that leads to the child leaving whatever

a guardian has authority not just to hear but to speak for the

for instance, in dealing with immigration officers who are handling a
child’s asylum case, in the national referral mechanism, and in
instructing a solicitor. I say that from my experience; I have not
dealt with anyone who has been trafficked but as a solicitor taking
instructions you have to hear the instructions from the person who is
entitled to give them. I have been in this situation with clients in
many different fields where I am told, “That’s what
so-and-so wants”. I need to know it from that person. You cannot
assume it unless the person with clear authority gives the instruction.

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, this debate has made very clear the

powerful case once again. We recognise that not enough has been done
and that we must do more. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord McColl,
the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and others for their
determination to ensure that trafficked children, who are so very
vulnerable, are properly protected. Noble Lords have made their concern
extremely clear. We agree that these children are indeed among the most
vulnerable and it is clear from what noble Lords and others have said
that they are not being supported as they should be, so how is this
best
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:18:31"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000096">We
remain concerned that the introduction of guardians for trafficked
children, alongside those persons who should already be working in the
interests of the child, is not the most effective way to tackle the
local problems that are clearly manifest here. Where local systems are
not working as they should be to support the best interests of
trafficked children, we need to address the causes of those problems.
Others with extensive experience of the needs of trafficked children
agree. Children and Families Across Borders, an organisation with
considerable expertise in this area, has told us that introducing
guardians would not improve the inadequate service that some trafficked
children receive. Instead, they believe that a clear commitment to, and
strong focus on, professional development by local government employers
and others is required. This would help to improve practice and ensure
that social workers understand the particular needs faced by trafficked
children in their care. It is not clear that appointing another
individual to speak for a looked-after child or to help them navigate
the care system is the answer. Central to the role of a social worker
is ensuring that the child’s best interests are protected. If
that is not happening then that failure should be addressed.
Introducing guardians could actually result in making things worse,
with other professionals thinking they do not need to concern
themselves as much about a trafficked child because their guardian is
looking after
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:20:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000097">I
note that my noble friend Lord McColl mentioned the variability of
support and the best practice that can be seen among some social
workers. He pointed to other cases of very poor practice and we fully
agree that these must be tackled. We recognise that local authority
performance with regard to trafficked children is clearly inconsistent.
To address this inconsistency, we have proposed new regulations so
that, when a trafficked child comes into the care system, the crucial
information that they have been trafficked must be recorded on care
plans. Under these new regulations, local authorities would be
required, in planning and reviewing care for a trafficked child, to
consider the specific and complex needs that may result from the
experience of having been trafficked. This requirement would also
extend to pathway planning for a trafficked child when they cease to be
looked after. Social workers 
<?notus-xml column=656?>should support trafficked children to access mainstream and specialist
services and this should include accompanying them to meetings with
other professionals, as my noble friend Lord McColl highlighted. We
will make this clear in the proposed new statutory guidance. To
underpin the proposed new regulations regarding trafficked children, we
have, as I say, drafted new statutory guidance. This sets out our
expectations of how local authorities should go about providing the
required support and we would welcome noble Lords’ views on how
to make this draft guidance
stronger<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:22:00"></hs_TimeCode>. As
noble Lords will be well aware, statutory guidance is of course not

they first enter care, trafficked children are particularly vulnerable,
as noble Lords have made clear. They might not initially recognise that
they are victims of a crime, or might believe that their best interests
lie with their traffickers. The first hours and days are crucial in
protecting a trafficked child from going missing. The new statutory
guidance describes some of the steps that local authorities should take
to protect against this risk, such as temporarily removing their phones
to ensure that they are not in contact with those who can do them harm,
providing 24-hour supervision, or employing previously trafficked
children to assure the victim that they are safest in local authority
care. The guidance provides a clear definition of a trafficked child
and describes steps that should be taken when a child is identified as
having been trafficked. This vital role is one that local authorities,
with partners including the Home Office and police, fulfil—or
should fulfil—as part of their child protection
duties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000099">The

the issue of legal representation. However, independent reviewing
officers should already ensure that any child in their care has access
to the appropriate legal support. In our new statutory guidance, we

a suitably qualified solicitor or immigration adviser. Any immigration

required, they should be trained to understand the particular risks
faced by trafficked children. Helping children to overcome cultural or 
<?notus-xml column=657?>language barriers so that they can express their wishes and feelings is
a role that is already carried out by independent advocates. The new
statutory guidance notes the importance of commissioning specialist
advocacy services to provide this
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:25:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0002.htm#13120942000102">The
noble Baroness, Lady Lister, brought up the discussion that we had in
Committee about Scotland. I was very interested in the fact that
Scotland has guardians, and that is why I asked how it had worked out.
She probably knows that the Scottish guardianship system is much
smaller than would be required in England because it covers just 80
unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Scottish guardians essentially
fulfil the role played by independent advocates in the English system
but with specialist immigration skills. Our proposed statutory guidance
requires that, where a trafficked child requires specialist immigration
advice, it should, as I said, be provided by a solicitor or adviser
with the relevant
competences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:26:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

its letter, to which I shall be responding, and for its engagement in
this matter. It highlighted several aspects of the Scottish model for
consideration in England, as the noble Baroness noted, including
provision of support in relation to the asylum and immigration process,
support services and future planning, helping children to develop wider
social networks, and ensuring that children’s views
are heard in all proceedings that affect them. These are, indeed, very
important, and that is why each of them is addressed in our new
guidance. It is also why, where local practice is good, those aspects
are already provided through the existing care system without recourse
to the additional role of guardian for trafficked children. Of course,
we take very seriously the letter that the JCHR has written and, as I
said, I shall be writing in
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T20:27:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

emphasis in Committee and, to some extent, in the discussions this
evening on stability of care. We agree that these children need
stability and continuity. The new statutory guidance would require
local authorities to prioritise trafficked children so as to provide
the greatest likelihood of their building a sustained relationship with
their social worker. These are the most vulnerable children and they
are precisely those for whom social workers must do most in providing
understanding and support.</hs_para>

only a portion of our proposed new guidance, which covers a range of
issues to ensure that trafficked children receive the right care and
support. We would welcome suggestions from noble Lords on whether the
guidance should include other issues. It is hugely important that we
get the support for these children right, and we very much look forward
to continuing discussions with noble Lords about how best to do that.
We recently sent both the draft regulations and the guidance to noble
Lords and they are available on our website. In particular, we would
like to discuss with my noble friend Lord McColl, and with any other
noble Lord who might wish to join in, the opportunities offered by the
regulations. I am delighted that we have in the diary a meeting with my
noble friend Lord McColl later this week. Our discussions are clearly
very important for this group of children.</hs_para>

Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Deighton)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment brings forward the
timetable of the independent review to be held of ring-fencing. As the
House will recall, the Government previously amended the Bill to
provide for an independent review of ring-fencing, once the 
<?notus-xml column=661?>ring-fence has come into force. Following the recommendation of the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, our original amendment
provided that the review be conducted no later than four years after
the ring-fence had come into effect. This was to allow the ring-fence
time to bed down before being
reviewed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000114">The
Government have, however, listened to arguments from the Opposition
that the review should be held sooner. Two years is a long enough
period over which to observe the operation of the ring-fence, and
assess its effects. The knowledge that ring-fencing will soon be
reviewed may also be a further encouragement to banks to comply
faithfully with the
ring-fence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000115">This
amendment therefore requires that the independent review of the
ring-fence be held within two years of the ring-fencing taking effect,
rather than four years. This is a sensible change and one that we hope
illustrates the Government’s constructive approach to reasonable
suggestions from all
sides.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000116"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Eatwell" PimsId="3069" UID="13120942000630" xid="1203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000630">Lord
Eatwell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, everyone in the House has from
time to time expressed the view that this is a great experiment. We are
not quite sure how the ring-fence will work and therefore it is
appropriate that that it be monitored promptly and on a regular basis.
I think this is a very sensible amendment—I would do, since I
moved a version of it earlier—and I urge the House to support
the Government.</hs_para>

Lawson of Blaby (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
Lord Deighton for putting forward this amendment. As he said, it is
something which the banking commission, of which I had the honour to be
a member, has been calling for. It is extremely welcome and it is very
good that he has acceded to it. As the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, said,
the whole idea of ring-fencing is something of an experiment. We do not
know whether it is going to work and therefore it is necessary that
after an appropriate time it should be thoroughly investigated to see
whether it is working satisfactorily and, if it is not, to have a move
to full separation.</hs_para>

that full separation works; indeed, separation was the norm in this
country for most of our lifetimes. It is only during the past
25 years that there has not been separation. In the old
days, there were the so-called joint stock banks, which were to do with
the commercial banks and did retail lending and lending to small
businesses, which are now known as SMEs, and there was a completely
different group called the merchant banks, which were different people
and institutions. For a long time, most of them were partnerships and
had a different set-up altogether. They did what is now known as
investment banking and it worked extremely well. We know that
separation can work but we do not know whether this idea can work, so
it is right that there should be a review.</hs_para>

Government, and in particular my noble friend, for introducing this, I
hope that it will not be necessary. That is not because the ring-fence
will, as it were, be found to work. I have grave doubts about that if
it persists. However, there must be considerable doubt as to whether it
will persist. Some noble Lords may have seen the interesting report in 
<?notus-xml column=662?>today’s <I>Financial Times</I> that the HSBC is thinking
seriously of spinning off its UK retail and commercial banking
enterprise as a separate company, with outside shareholders taking up
to 30% in it. That is according to the <I>Financial Times</I>; we do
not know, but there is a good reason for that. If the requirements of
the ring-fence are really to be enforced toughly, they will make it so
difficult, complicated, burdensome and onerous that many banks should,
if they are rational, ask, “Is it actually worth staying
together? Might it not be better for us”—the
management—“and for our shareholders to separate and
release increased shareholder value for that purpose?”. I hope
that the institutional shareholders will also keep the banks up to the
mark. That would be the happiest conclusion—that we will not
even need the review because separation will happen of its own accord.
However, just in case it does not we will need the review and I am
grateful to my noble
friend.</hs_para>

years to that, it will be 2023 before this review takes place; so even

an assessment of whether it believes the tools it has to tackle
proprietary trading are appropriate, given the risks that may exist at
that time and in future. It must also consider whether restrictions
imposed on proprietary trading in other countries have been effective.
The experience of the United States in relation to the Volcker rule,
which banned proprietary trading by banks, will be particularly
relevant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000124">That

do that, the ring-fence must be in place for at least some time to

from proprietary trading on ring-fenced banks and whether the
safeguards in place are sufficient for the particular requirements for
the safety of ring-fenced banks. I know that members of the PCBS have

the PRA’s report to the Treasury and to Parliament, the Treasury

necessary.

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, once again I would like to
thank the Government and, in particular, my noble friend Lord Deighton,
for moving this amendment. It is in response to a strong recommendation
that was encapsulated in a specific report on this subject among the
five reports from the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000130">Just
as in the previous amendment, which concerned the review of the
ring-fence, initially the Government were prepared to look at it only
from the point of view of whether an individual banking institution had
been gaming the ring-fence. They have now agreed to look at the system
as a whole, and I am grateful for that. Again, initially the Government
said, “No way should there by a review of proprietary
trading”, but they have now come round to saying, “Yes,
the parliamentary commission was right and there should be a
review”. I am extremely grateful to my noble friend for that. He
said that there is no risk at the moment. That is because proprietary
trading has, for the time being, stopped to all intents and purposes.
Yet at its peak it was for many banks up to 30% of their total
business. One must imagine that that is quite likely to occur again in
future. I do not know whether it will but it is clearly possible. But
if I might say so to my noble friend, it is not simply a question of
risk—although risk is obviously an important
factor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000131">There
was an important debate on Thursday last week on the five reports of
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. Unfortunately, I was
unable to attend but I read the <I>Hansard</I> report. It was
introduced by a magisterial speech by the most reverend Primate the
Archbishop of Canterbury and there were a number of good
speeches—it read very well. In particular, I was impressed by
the speech by my noble friend Lord Deighton, in which he gave us a
little autobiographical counter. He spoke a little bit about his own
experience as a banker. One thing I noted in particular. He said he was
always conscious of the importance in banking of, 
<?notus-xml column=665?>“putting the customer first”. That is a very important
aspect of banking culture. Indeed, banking culture was one of the most
important things that the parliamentary commission was set up to look
into.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000132">However,
in proprietary trading there is of course no question of putting the
customer first—because there is no customer. It is the bank
trading on its own behalf. That involves a totally different culture
and mindset. If you want to preserve in banking—as I think we
should—the culture that my noble friend believes in, as he said
on Thursday, then you should ban proprietary trading by banks
altogether. It is fine for hedge funds. It is an excellent activity for
them and they can do it very well. I am not suggesting that it should
be made an illegal activity, but banks should not do it. Most of us on
the commission—though clearly not all—came to that
conclusion. We called for a review because we were unsure about the
practicalities. There is some difficulty in defining the sort of
proprietary trading that should be banned for banks because there is a
need for market-making. The line between market-making and proprietary
trading is very clear in the minds of those doing it, but whether it is
clear in law is another matter. We thought it useful to look at the
American
experience.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000133">Finally
on this, I say to my noble friend that we should look at the American
experience but not too much at the American legislation. The complexity
and detail of the American legislation was simply appalling. It is a
problem across the legislative system that they have in the United
States. My noble friend quite rightly referred to the Volcker rule
because Paul Volcker insists that there should be a ban—for
cultural reasons, above all. He also told us, when he gave evidence to
the commission, that the legislation introduced in Congress was
certainly not the sort he had in
mind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000134">Having
said that, I wish the Government well in this. It will be an important
review, for the reasons that I have outlined. I commend the Government
for repenting, if slightly belatedly—but as the right reverend
Prelates on the Bishops’ Benches will know, better “the
sinner that repenteth”, et cetera. Thank you very
much.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_09_PT_1/F8B3B64D02F802ECC03CF2526E4596397C9DB1CA" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 December 2013">Monday,

four new clauses add even greater length to the Bill in addition to the
amendments that have been made. The rate at which this Bill has been
growing has been quite extraordinary, and we shall have to wait and see
how it ends up. I remain rather concerned at the way in which drafting
has taken place. My noble friend might consider whether it would be
appropriate to have some form of consolidation Act bringing together
this and previous legislation. If the legislation is to be understood
by bankers, or indeed by anyone, it will be necessary to
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T21:02:36"></hs_TimeCode>correlate the

the American legislation may be in place. What are we doing to
co-ordinate the approach? This is an international matter. There are
British banks operating in America and American banks that

in one country to differ significantly from those in the other. A

they clarify the scope of the Treasury’s power to make an order

Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000143">Moving
to Schedule 2, minor amendments are made to new Section 44B. They
permit supplemental property transfer instruments to make special
bail-in provision. This is consistent with the situation for resolution
instruments and will further assist in combining bail-in with the
bridge bank stabilisation option. They amend new Section 48R which,
without this amendment, applies only to resolution instruments that do
not transfer securities. As special bail-in provision may relate to
things that are not transferred, it is appropriate that the new Section
48R power applies irrespective of whether securities are transferred.
By broadening the Section 48R power in this way, we can then remove the
amendment to Section 21, which makes similar provision, as no longer
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000144">Paragraph
15 of Schedule 2 is amended to address situations where a resolution
instrument does not transfer securities, such as shares. Paragraph 15
amends the power to make continuity provision conferred by

securities to make ancillary provision relating to an earlier transfer
of securities. There are also some minor amendments to the compensation

bail-in is combined with the bridge bank stabilisation option, the
Treasury needs to make a resolution fund order. Some minor amendments
are made to Section 52 and new Section 60A to ensure that the
compensation arrangements for special bail-in provision will work with
full effect in this context. Minor amendments are also made to Section
53 to ensure that the Treasury may make compensation orders under
Section 53 whenever any form of supplemental order or instrument is
made to effect a stabilisation option. Finally, we have brought the
compensation provisions for bail-in further into line with the other
stabilisation options by making it optional for the Treasury to make a
further compensation order following a supplemental resolution
instrument. I commend these amendments to the House.</hs_para>

brief, these amendments make explicit the requirement on banks to
certify staff and enforce banking standards in the first instance.
Amendment 12 delivers the commitment to require banks and PRA-regulated
investment firms to verify that people are fit and proper before
appointing them to functions in which they could do significant harm to
the firm. It also requires firms to review that assessment annually.
This gives effect to the commission’s recommendations in
paragraph 634 of its final report. Indeed, the Government have gone
further. Amendments 9 and 11 impose similar obligations on firms in
respect of senior managers and other persons who have been approved by
the regulators.</hs_para>

12 also imposes the obligation on these institutions to issue
certificates to persons performing functions in which they could cause
significant harm to the firm to confirm that the fitness and properness
checks have been carried out. As I explained on Report, it would not be
appropriate to describe these documents 
<?notus-xml column=671?>as licences—the commission’s preferred term—but it
is quite in order to call them certificates and they fulfil the same
function. The amendment also imposes obligations on banks and
PRA-regulated investment firms to maintain records of persons who have
been issued with certificates. It is not, of course, necessary to
require firms to keep lists of senior managers as their appointments
will have been approved by the regulators and they are included in the
financial services register kept by the
FCA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000150">Amendment
14 requires banks and PRA-regulated investment firms to notify the
regulators of disciplinary action that they take against any of their
staff, not just senior managers and persons who have been issued
certificates. I can assure the House that notifiable disciplinary
actions will not include verbal ticking-off, for example, for turning
up late to work. Only formal disciplinary action, such as a written
warning, need be notified and only if it is for reasons specified by
the regulators in their rules. This gives the regulators the
ability to check up on how firms are policing the conduct of
individuals and it delivers on the recommendations in paragraph 642 of
the commission’s
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120942000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#13120942000151">Amendment
13 requires banks and PRA-regulated investment firms to notify
individuals that banking standards rules apply to them. This delivers
on recommendations in paragraph 643 of the commission’s report.
Amendment 13 also requires banks and PRA-regulated investment firms to
ensure that the individuals concerned understand their obligations
under banking standards rules. This includes by providing suitable
training. Amendments 9 and 12 also provide that, in checking that
someone is fit and proper, firms must have regard to whether someone
has a qualification or has undergone training prescribed by the
regulator in its rules.</hs_para>

your Lordships would expect, the Government will seek to ensure that
Clause 15 is removed when the Bill returns to the other place. The
amendments I have just explained do, however, deliver what the
parliamentary commission recommended and, indeed, go further in some
places. Clause 15 would simply not deliver what the commission
recommended, or anything like it. As we will explain in the other
place, there are a number of areas in which Clause 15 is incompatible
with the recommendations of the PCBS. First, it would retain but
re-label the approved persons regime, which the PCBS sought as far as
possible to remove. Secondly, it would impose on the regulator an
obligation to check fit and properness annually, while the PCBS
emphasised that it should be the bank, first and foremost, that took
responsibility for maintaining standards. However, I hope the noble
Lord, Lord Eatwell, will feel that the inclusion of material on
training and professional qualifications in Amendments 9, 12 and 13
clearly shows that his underlying concerns on those points have been
met.</hs_para>

I turn to Amendments 17, 18 and 25. These amendments were tabled to
address an essentially consequential issue which arose from the other
amendments. Branches of foreign banks and investment firms operate in
London. Often international banks will have both branches and
subsidiaries. A branch is 
<?notus-xml column=672?>not a separate legal entity unlike a subsidiary company. However, it is
likely that there will be staff working in branches in the UK who
should be covered by the senior managers regime or the certification
regime and so be subject to banking standards rules.
Amendments 17 and 18 therefore give the Treasury the power
to extend the senior managers, certification and banking standards
regime to the UK branches of foreign banks and investment firms by
order, after undertaking appropriate consultation. This will mean that
branches and subsidiaries can be treated identically. Amendment 25
ensures that the order can be made only if approved by both Houses
under the affirmative procedure so any such order will benefit from
proper parliamentary scrutiny.</hs_para>

provisions made for the upper tier were broadly okay, although there

Flight (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, first, I declare an interest as a
commissioner of the Guernsey Financial Services Commission. I will
raise an issue which relates, as far as possible, to the territory
being addressed right now: what will be the position of the banks in
Crown dependencies of the UK under the new arrangements for ring-fenced
banks? I have made inquiries of the Financial Secretary and got an
answer. However, I have some reservations that the answer will not work
very well. An issue analogous to the comment about foreign banks in
London is that most of the banks in the Crown dependencies are not
branches but subsidiaries. The proposal is for branches to be within
the ring-fence and not subsidiaries. However, 
<?notus-xml column=673?>there is little incentive for banks to convert from subsidiaries to
branches to come within the ring-fence. At the heart of this is an
issue of UK interest in that those banks mostly effectively gather
deposits that are lent to London, and are in some senses merely a legal
fiction. Therefore if they will be within the ring-fence and will all
have to convert to being branches, there is a strong practical case for
including them within the UK deposit insurance scheme. If not, the
banks in the Crown dependencies will stay as subsidiaries in
the main, they will be outside the ring-fence, and there will be a
decline in the deposits they upstream to the UK partly for regulatory
reasons and partly because they will not be a subsidiary of the

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I am glad to see that the introduction
of Clause 15 on Report has at last seen the Government take the
recommendations of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards
seriously in this matter and introduce these amendments that capture
most, though not all, of the recommendations. What we have left, as the
noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, has pointed out, is something of a
tripartite muddle because we now have three different regimes affecting
persons working within banks. I am afraid that this is characteristic
of so many parts of this Bill and will need to be sorted out in

would like to ask some questions about Clause 17 which, as was pointed
out, brings branches into part of this aspect of regulation. As the
House will be aware, in recent months the Prime Minister has
significantly weakened Britain’s regulatory protections of its
banking system by encouraging the establishment of branches in this
country. Previously, the regulatory authorities had strongly
discouraged this because they are not then regulated by British
regulators but by their home regulator. The Prime Minister has chosen
to weaken this protection particularly by encouraging the establishment
of Chinese branch banks, which will be regulated by the Chinese
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T21:21:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

what is particularly interesting about Clause 17 is that it
brings some branches possibly within some British regulatory ambit. I
say possibly because according to this clause the Treasury may by order
provide that authorised persons falling within any of the descriptions
are relevant authorised persons. 
<?notus-xml column=674?>Relevant authorised persons, for those who have not participated in
these debates before, are actually banks. The Treasury can choose which
branches will be brought into the ambit. It is enormously important
that the branches should be. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, was absolutely
right in this respect. I hope the Prime Minister will not undermine
this legislation by instructing the Treasury to exclude particular
branches, perhaps those emanating from Chinese banks, from this

sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, and the tripartite system
of regulation which we now find ourselves with but the approved persons

for money-laundering. At some point we may want to see whether it is

regulator, “You have a look at all these people and make sure
that they are behaving in a responsible way and have the appropriate

duck out of that and that it is for directors and the board to ensure

apt that, in preparing for the debate, I came across a press release of
a court case held in London earlier today involving the imprisonment of
a former Goldman Sachs banker who was sentenced to four and a half
years for laundering £8 million on behalf of James Ibori, the
former governor of Nigeria’s oil-producing state of Delta. Mr
Ibori has himself been in prison since April of last year, having
received a 13-year sentence after pleading guilty to various counts of
fraud and money-laundering. He is the most senior Nigerian politician
to have been held to account for the corruption that has blighted that
large and very important African country. At the April 2012 court case,
it was stated by the prosecutor, no less, that Ibori and his associates
had used multiple accounts at Barclays, HSBC, Citibank and
Abbey National—now part of Santander—to launder funds.
Millions of pounds in total passed through these accounts,
some of which were used to purchase expensive
London property. The point is that there has been no
investigation into those four organisations following that case, which
leads me to ask your Lordships what disincentives there are for banks
not to continue with their somewhat lax approach to some very large
sums of money that are proffered to them. That is why it is important
that we deal with this issue by inserting a provision in the Bill
today, or at least when it returns to another
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000004">On

that the note that the FCA provided on Report about
anti-money-laundering, and the Treasury’s recent

regulators, demonstrate that the FCA is fully committed to dealing with
anti-money-laundering compliance

this misses the point. Whether the FCA is or is not fully
committed—and I am perfectly willing to give the benefit of the
doubt on that—the fact remains that its attempts and that of its
predecessor the FSA to enforce anti-money-laundering laws have been
largely unsuccessful. In advancing that argument, I refer noble Lords
to the FSA’s 2011 report, which found that in a review of banks,
75%—I repeat, 75%—of those banks were not meeting their
anti-money-laundering obligations. That report also highlighted that
banks were making the same mistakes as they did a decade earlier when
the regulator reviewed the banks that had taken £900 million

Abacha.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000010">The

would raise my concerns with the FCA about the note. I welcome that. In
this respect, I would also welcome reassurance that this will take the
form of a statement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer two weeks
after the Bill receives Royal Assent—or preferably

Brennan:</Member></B> My Lords, I support this amendment. The debate on
anti-money-laundering that we have undertaken during the course of this
Bill has led the Treasury and government Ministers to send colleagues
and me a number of letters and documents. This was extremely courteous
and informative—but legislatively useless. The noble and learned
Lord, Lord Steyn, once described this kind of material as an exercise
in

money-laundering is a major issue. Today is International
Anti-Corruption Day. It is also the anniversary of HSBC’s

thus far by the Government is that the FCA has the responsibility for
dealing with money-laundering and it is for it to do so. On our side,
we do not think that that is strong enough. If in today’s
Amendments 2 and 3 the Government feel robust enough to say that the
Treasury must take steps to review proprietary trading, why should it
not tell the FCA that it must take steps, always and actively, to
counter money-laundering. Why the diffidence? Why not put a plain
statement before Parliament, now or through the amendment, that
anti-money-laundering counts, that we are against it and that the FCA
must ensure that banks deal with it.</hs_para>

McFall of Alcluith (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the
amendment. In evidence from business people to the Treasury Committee
and the parliamentary commission it was said that good and
firm regulation is a competition issue. Given that we aspire for London
to be maintained as a global centre for financial products, it is
important to recognise that dirty money comes in and out. The example
was given of HSBC. It acquired a Mexican bank in 2001 in America. From
day one the board was told by the compliance officer that no decent
compliance functions were available. Notwithstanding that, the
situation continued for six or seven years in which drug money was

$4 billion by the US authorities. If that can happen to a UK-based
bank, it can be happening elsewhere. It is important that we ensure
that regulation in this country is firm.</hs_para>

General Abacha. In 2006 there was an investigation by the FSA that did
not go anywhere because the regulator did not have authority. It is
therefore important that in this legislation we underline the
regulator’s authority. The regulator did not have authority
because there was a tension—and there will still be a tension,
despite the new architecture—between the financial stability of
companies and conduct of business. If we are to make London an
attractive global centre, we have to understand the elephant in the
room—money-laundering. I am afraid that, if we do not give the
regulator an express duty and authority on money-laundering, we could
find the problems that happened with Nigeria in 2006 and elsewhere
being replicated. That case has still not been investigated
authoritatively enough. Having this anti-money-laundering element in
the Bill would be extremely important, and I support the

every Member of this House will agree with the noble Lords, Lord
Brennan, Lord Watson of Invergowrie, and Lord McFall of Alcluith, about
the importance of the fight against money-laundering and other
financial crime and about the importance of ensuring that the banks
discharge their responsibilities in this area
properly—absolutely no question. I hope therefore that the
statement that I am making now will reassure them, more than my letters
have done, that anti-money-laundering compliance in banks will be fully
covered in the new senior managers regime. I can assure noble Lords
that anti-money-laundering compliance in a bank will always ultimately
fall within the responsibilities of a senior manager in that bank. The
FCA will also have extensive powers to ensure that banks are clear
about where these responsibilities
lie.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000020">First,
under the new senior managers regime, the regulator will specify senior
management functions in its rules. These will cover such roles as the
chief executive and the finance director and may extend to any function
that involves an individual managing aspects of a firm’s
business that could have serious consequences for the firm or the wider
economy. The total number of individuals covered by the new regime is
likely to be smaller than those currently performing functions of
significant influence in banks. In line with the recommendations of the
PCBS, all the senior decision-takers—the most senior people in
banks who take important decisions—will be covered by the senior

senior managers regime provisions that are now in the Bill, there will
have to be statements of responsibility in respect of each senior

application to the regulator for approval of the appointment of a new
senior manager. The bank will have to update a statement whenever there
is a significant change in a senior manager’s responsibilities.
The regulators will also have the power to set out the form that the
statements should take. They will also be able to require banks to
verify the information in the statements in a way that they direct. As
a result, the regulators will be able to tell who is responsible for
anti-money-laundering compliance in a bank. They will also be able to
detect any gaps in the responsibilities 
<?notus-xml column=683?>by comparing the statements of the senior managers in a bank. Senior
management is always ultimately responsible for ensuring that the bank
complies with all applicable legal requirements, including
anti-money-laundering law. It is inconceivable that a senior manager
will not be responsible in this area. Beneath senior management level
there will, of course, be other staff involved in anti-money-laundering
compliance work and these will include money-laundering reporting
officers. In addition, the Government have deliberately retained the
power for the regulator to pre-approve individuals performing key roles
below senior management level, such as money-laundering reporting
officers, even if those roles are not senior management functions. I am
sure your Lordships would agree that this is a sensible

Banks will have to certify annually that people performing particular

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I turn to the Government’s
amendments on high-cost, short-term—or payday—lending.
The Government are committed to action to protect borrowers from the
harm that these lenders cause. We have already taken decisive action to
overhaul regulation of the payday lending sector, with the Financial
Conduct Authority taking on its broad new powers in relation to
consumer credit from April.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312108000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000027">The FCA has already set
out tough proposals to clamp down on the key causes of consumer
detriment, including capping the number of rollovers and curbing the
misuse of continuous payment authorities. However, the Government have
agreed to do more. We want to put an end to the unfair and extortionate
cost of borrowing from payday lenders and to prevent the spiralling
costs faced by those struggling to repay their
loans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000028">There is
a growing evidence base, including lessons from other countries, that a
cap on the costs is the right way forward for consumers. Of course, we
are not just talking about an interest rate cap, which evidence shows
is likely to be far less effective. A cap should include all fees and
charges which may be incurred in relation to a payday loan, including
default charges and rollover fees.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312108000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000029">FCA powers are already
sufficiently broad to ensure that charges of all kinds can be covered
in the cap. This Bill presents the ideal opportunity to ensure swift 
<?notus-xml column=685?>action to protect consumers from unfair and spiralling costs and to give
the FCA a definitive parliamentary mandate to act now. That is why the
Government are introducing this amendment to require the FCA to impose
a cap on the cost of payday loans. Under this new duty, the FCA must
use the powers given to it by the Government in the Financial Services
Act 2012 in relation to such loans.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312108000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000030">In Committee, noble
Lords asked about the framework within which the cap will be designed,
and I will explain a little how this amendment delivers that framework.
Designing a cap on the cost of credit is not a job for government; nor
is it right that the detail of a cap should be enshrined in primary
legislation, given that the industry it is intended to bind is so
fast-moving and innovative. That is why the cap must be set by the
independent and expert regulator, which has flexible powers to ensure
that the cap remains effective. The FCA must be allowed to design a cap
that works in UK consumers’ interests and fits the UK
market.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312108000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000031">However, the amendment
makes clear the FCA’s overarching objective in this endeavour:
it must make rules to impose a cap to protect consumers from excessive
charges imposed by high-cost, short-term lenders. This language echoes
the FCA’s consumer protection objective. The FCA must make rules
to advance one or more of its operational objectives—consumer
protection, market integrity and competition. This applies to the rules
to implement the cap, just as it does to all FCA rule-making. The
FCA’s competition duty also applies. It must consider how the
rules affect the ability of the market to serve consumers’
interests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T21:49:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000032">Introducing
a cap is not without risks or potential adverse consequences, including
reducing access to credit for some individuals who are in financial
difficulty. The FCA will not be able to eliminate those risks but it
will seek to manage them. It will be important that the FCA strikes the
right balance in designing and setting the cap. That is why it must
publish a cost-benefit analysis on the impact of its proposals and
undertake a consultation. The amendment specifically requires that the
FCA must consult the Treasury before it publishes and consults on any
draft rules. To reflect the importance of keeping the rules current and
effective, the FCA must report on any rules it makes under Section
137C, including rules imposing a cap on loan costs, in its annual
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000033">Finally,
I should point out why it is not worth defining payday lending in great
detail in primary legislation. Putting a narrow definition in primary
legislation could lead to unintended consequences. Lenders may just try
to circumvent the definition. The amendment therefore allows the FCA to
specify precisely which types of high-cost, short-term loans are
captured when it makes its rules to effect the
cap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000034">I now turn
to the matter of timing, which is the subject of the amendment proposed
by the noble Lords, Lords Eatwell and Mitchell, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Grey-Thompson, which proposes to bring the timetable for
implementing a cap forward to 1 October next year. I fully
support the intention to bring the cap into force as soon as possible
in order to protect consumers. That is precisely why the Government 
<?notus-xml column=686?>are taking this opportunity to bring forward legislation to require the
FCA to impose a cap, so that the FCA can get on with implementation as
quickly as possible. Introducing this new duty on the regulator ensures
its efforts are focused on implementing the cap rather than on having
to spend time and resources making the case for using its cost-capping
powers in the first
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000035">The
amendment provides a backstop date for implementation. The cap must be
in place by at least 2 January 2015. Noble Lords should be
in no doubt that, if the FCA can deliver sooner, it will. But there are
a number of steps that must be taken before the cap is to be
implemented. All of these are important. If rushed, they could put
consumer protection at risk for the sake of speed. As I have already
said, the risks of getting the cap wrong are also high—reducing
credits for individuals or potentially pushing them into the arms of
less regulated
lenders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000036">Perhaps
it would be helpful if I set out the FCA’s proposed timetable.
The FCA’s current timetable for implementing a cap is ambitious
but deliverable, and crucially allows the FCA to draw on the
Competition Commission’s rigorous investigation of the market,
which is currently underway. The FCA has already made good progress on
background research on capping the cost of credit. It will start its
detailed analysis phase in the new year, including drawing on the
evidence the Competition Commission has already collected, through
existing statutory information gateways between the two organisations,
and where necessary, seeking information from
firms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000037">The
Government are bringing forward secondary legislation to allow the FCA
to gather information from the industry as soon as possible to help it
design the cap. The FCA will consult in the spring on its draft
proposals, at around the same time as the Competition Commission is due
to publish its provisional findings. It will have to publish the
cost-benefit analysis when it consults. Consultation will take place
over the summer, and the FCA plans to make the rules in the autumn.
Again, this is likely to be around the same time as the Competition
Commission’s final report. Lenders will have the rest of the
year to update their systems and processes to ensure they comply with
the new requirements, and the cap will come into effect at the
beginning of
January.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000038">Were a
1 October implementation date adopted, the FCA would be so far out of
sync with the Competition Commission’s work that it would not
get the full value from the Competition Commission’s insight
into the market to ensure the cap helps to secure the best outcomes for
consumers. Such an early date would mean that important components of
the FCA’s rule-making processes would need to be jettisoned, be
that evidence-gathering in preparation of a cost-benefit analysis,
consultation with interested parties on the proposals, or preparation
time for the lenders to get their systems and processes in order to
meet the new requirements and become responsible, compliant lenders.
Noble Lords opposite may laugh at this, but if we were not proposing to
do this, they would be the first to criticise the Government for not
properly doing every single phase of what I have just
described.</hs_para>

to ensuring that the cap works in the best interests of consumers and
avoids the risks and unintended consequences I described earlier.
Difficult though this choice is, the Government are not prepared to
compromise the process, and I hope that noble Lords will agree. I am
grateful to noble Lords for putting the spotlight on the timetable, but
I hope that I have been able to persuade them that the risk to
borrowers of rushing the design and implementation of a cost cap is
simply too great and that the FCA is committed to implementing the cap
as quickly as is reasonably possible. This, I trust, provides
sufficient reassurance to convince them not to move the
amendment.</hs_para>

turn now to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, who has
spoken so passionately during the Bill about the lessons we can learn
from the way in which the state of Florida has approached regulation of
payday lenders. His amendment aims to ensure that the FCA must impose
restrictions on the number of loans an individual may have and the
times a loan may be rolled over at the same time as it makes rules
imposing a cap on the cost of payday loans. The Government fully agree
that regulatory action is necessary to tackle both of these issues. The
FCA has already proposed to curb rollovers. The noble Lord is, I know,
convinced of the need for an outright ban, as in Florida. I have
considerable sympathy with that conviction, but I have not seen robust
evidence to show that a ban is the right approach for UK consumers. The
ability to roll over a loan—for instance, if an unexpected
expense crops up one month—offers a flexibility which is valued
by some
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000041">In
its consultation published on 3 October, the FCA has suggested a limit
of two rollovers but has specifically also sought views on permitting
one rollover only. This is a significant advance on the
industry’s own codes of practice—which limit rollovers to
three—with which, sadly, far too few lenders comply. The
consultation period has just closed and the FCA is currently
considering responses. Legislating to ban rollovers now could prejudge
that consultation and evidence-gathering exercise. I am sure the noble

course, a cap on the cost of payday loans, which will include rollover
charges, will be a key factor in undercutting lenders’ reliance
on rollovers as a generator of profits. I am confident that a cap on
the cost of the loan and a cap on the number of rollovers, as the FCA
has proposed, should help stop the cost of rolled over loans spiralling

noble Lord also proposes that the FCA must curb multiply sourced

but in this case, too, the FCA is committed to taking action. The FCA
is approaching the solution differently from the noble Lord but the
effect is the same. Rather than limiting irresponsible borrowing, as
the noble Lord proposes—particularly as this could have the
side-effect of restricting choice and flexibility for consumers who are
able to repay—the FCA has focused on restrictions to tackle
irresponsible lending. It has proposed to put strict new requirements
on firms to undertake affordability 
<?notus-xml column=688?>assessments to ensure that a borrower can afford to make sustainable
repayments. This will include looking at other loans a borrower has

the FCA is not stopping there. The quality and value of lenders’
affordability assessments clearly relies to a significant degree on the
nature of the data available on an individual’s borrowing. The
Government and the FCA have real concerns that data sharing is not
working to support responsible lending and consumers’ interests.
The FCA has already warned the industry that it must improve and that,
if it fails to improve, the regulator will take action. The FCA has
committed to exploring the best way to improve data sharing and thereby
lending decisions. I will ask the FCA to keep noble Lords updated on
this work.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312108000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000045">I

taking decisive action to curb rollovers and multiply sourced

include these areas. I am very grateful to him, however, for drawing

perhaps I may remind him that earlier this year the noble Lord, Lord
Borrie, and I tabled an amendment to a previous financial Bill. A
long-sought clarification, which is very important in these payday
loans, is that the consumer should know not only in percentage terms
but also in money terms how much it is going to cost them. Will the
Minister therefore remind the FCA that there is a new EU directive,
effective from 1 January 2013, wherein the very difficult and confusing
equation is to be replaced by an actual amount in money? The only bad
thing about this is that it has to be printed in a smaller print than
the actual interest amount. Please will the Minister make sure that the
FCA is knowledgeable about this and that it will see that it is brought
to the attention of consumers as early as possible in the loan

speak to Amendment 20. I congratulate the Government on bringing
forward their amendment to cap the total cost of payday loans. I am
grateful to the Minister and to his officials for meeting me to discuss
the issue and for providing us with copies of the letters between the
Financial Secretary and the

20 clearly has the right intent but it raises several important
questions as do the letters between the Treasury and the FCA. Nowhere
in the Government’s amendment or in their correspondence with
the FCA is there any mention of the problem 
<?notus-xml column=689?>now discussed by the Minister of multiply sourced simultaneous loans.
The Financial Secretary says in his letter to the FCA that the main aim
of the cap is to ensure that PDL customers do not pay excessive charges
for borrowing and to minimise the risk to those borrowers who struggle
to repay and to protect them from spiralling costs, which make their
debt problem worse. In short, far fewer payday loan customers should
get into debt
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T22:01:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000049">Simply
imposing a cap, as I think the Minister was acknowledging, will not
produce this result if borrowers can take out multiply sourced
simultaneous loans. If borrowers can do this, any cap will be
ineffective in controlling indebtedness. My amendment, as the Minister
has said, proposes a ban on these multiply sourced loans, as is the
case in Florida. I think I heard the Minister say that the FCA will
consider the problem caused by multiply sourced simultaneous loans when
he considers the mechanism of the cap. I see the Minister is nodding in
agreement that that is the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T22:02:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000050">My
amendment also proposes a ban on rollovers, as the Minister has said.
That is also the case in Florida. I remind noble Lords that in Florida
no loan may be taken out until all previous loans have been settled in
full and then only after a 24-hour cooling off period. Rollovers are
banned in Florida because they are the chief way of luring borrowers
into a spiral of increasing debt. Here in the United Kingdom, 28% of
all payday loans are rolled over and 50% of payday loan revenue,
according to the OFT, comes from these loans. The FCA does not appear
to understand the problem with rollovers. In its October proposals it
suggested that rollovers be limited to two. It provided no evidence to
suggest that this would have the desired effect and it is pretty
obvious, I think, that it would
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T22:03:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Five days
ago, the financial services consumer panel recommended in evidence to
the FCA that rollovers be limited to one. I think the case for
rollovers being banned is very strong. Will the FCA explicitly consider
banning rollovers and will it publish its cost benefit
analysis—the one the Minister talked about—of the
relative merits of banning rollovers and limiting them to one or two

consumers within the electronic commerce directive. He went on to say
that this is not something that the FCA can mitigate. What does that
mean? Does it mean that the FCA cannot cap such transactions and, if it
does, what is the point of the Government’s Amendment 20? The

the amendment or in the correspondence to define
“excessive” or to give guidance about how a judgment of
what is excessive is to be arrived at. This seems an important and,
perhaps, critical defect in the amendment. Surely the FCA must be given
some guidelines in defining excessive for the purpose of fulfilling its
duty. For example, we already know that payday loan borrowers in
Florida pay, at most, one-third of the costs that such borrowers pay
here in the United Kingdom. Will the FCA consider this kind of
disparity in its definition of “excessive”? Will the
Government set out in writing and publish the guidelines that the FCA
must follow, and the factors it must consider, in reaching a definition
of what may count as “excessive”?</hs_parafo>

is not an obvious guarantee that any such draft rules will be what is
required under the Government’s amendment. For its October
publication of the draft rules, which the Minister has referred to, the
FCA considered all the available evidence and proposed to allow two
rollovers but no cost cap of any kind. A month later, the Treasury
considered the same evidence and decided that it was sufficient to
require the imposition of a cap. In other words, the Treasury appears
to believe that the FCA got it wrong, which does not inspire confidence

The amendment refers to “charges” and to
“high-cost credit”. However, the words
“interest” or “the rate of interest” appear
nowhere in the amendment. I would have thought that there was some case

disbelief since the introduction of this Government’s

the Business Secretary were resolute in their opposition to any form of
capping of interest rates offered by payday lending companies and other
suppliers of short-term credit; yet here we are today, legislating for
just such a cap. We are stating to the FCA that what was previously
defined as a “may” now will become a
“must”. That is a good outcome and I, for one, applaud
the Government for this massive U-turn. It could not have been easy for
them to eat their words, but politics is politics and if the heat has

I knew about loan sharks and the terrible misery that they cause; but I

debt and playing on their vulnerabilities. Any way you cut

<?notus-xml column=692?>decided that it was not yet persuaded that these

we are all very grateful to my noble friend Lord Mitchell for his
tireless efforts in bringing the payday lenders under regulation. I am
sure that that is the best result for everybody. I also
support his remarks about how we actually need payday lenders. They
fill a gap that no one else fills. If you have no food in the house or
your car needs repairing in order for you to get to work, and if your
family and friends cannot help, there is nobody but the payday lenders.
They are colossally efficient—as my noble friend Lord Mitchell
found out when he bravely took out a payday loan. They will get you the

need something to be done they can get it done. The idea that somehow
the whole process is so darn elaborate that they cannot do it in a
period of time which saves 90 days on their side is, in the true
meaning of the word, incredible. On the other hand, for the borrower 90
days includes Christmas Day 2014. That is a big issue, because this is
the period when short-term borrowing is at its peak. That is why it is
incumbent on this Government to take swift action. They have been

Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, discussed
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T22:23:35"></hs_TimeCode>the way in which
the total cost of the loan, as opposed to the interest rate, is
portrayed, and of course many people do not understand interest rates.
The Government are discussing with the European Commission the relative
prominence of the total cost of the loan. This discussion is taking
place in the context of the Commission’s review of the consumer
credit directive, so I hope we are well on top of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T22:24:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000078">My
noble friend Lord Sharkey asked a raft of questions. I hope that I
managed to write them all down. He asked whether the FCA understood the
particular problems of multiply sourced simultaneous loans. I can
assure him that that is within its remit. My noble friend talked
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T22:24:04"></hs_TimeCode> rollovers
and asked whether the FCA would look at one or none as part of this
review. I can give him that assurance. He asked whether he could see a
draft regulation in a timely manner. We will try to do that. Of course,
if we are going to consult on draft regulations, things such as the odd
90 days here and there make a lot of difference. Our ability
to consult properly at any point in this process 
<?notus-xml column=695?>requires us to follow something like the timetable that I set out
earlier. He asked whether data sharing is being considered as part of

for a definition of “excessive” and why it was not in the
Bill. The FCA will be looking at existing definitions of excessive,
including that in Florida. Different people in different places who cap
payday loans have different definitions of excessive. There is no
single definition that is uniquely right. It has to be taken in the
context of all the other factors and the overall design of the scheme.
The FCA will be looking at international definitions as part of that
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000080">My noble
friend asked whether there will be an opportunity and time in
Parliament for debate on the publication of the draft rules. That
partly goes to the speed with which we do that. If, as I set out, the
FCA publishes a consultation paper by the end of May, it will be
perfectly possible for Parliament to debate it. There are a number of
ways in which that could be done. In your Lordships’ House, it
is now very easy for individual Members to get a debate on an issue
within a very few weeks, even if no other formal debate was allowed. I
would be very happy to raise that issue in the usual channels. Finally,
my noble friend asked whether the FCA will consider the limit to cover
both the amount and the term of the loan. I can give him that
assurance.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312108000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000081">The

really happening in the market and helping everyone involved in the

can confirm that the government amendment does what it says in that the
FCA will not have any option but to make rules. It has to do it. The
“must” is a real “must”. In terms of the
powers that the Treasury will have, the purpose here is to ensure that
the Treasury has an input into the consultation and development of the
policy by the FCA. However, we have been very clear that the primary
responsibility must rest with one body and that the appropriate body is
the FCA. I will come back to the noble Lord’s point on timing in

in place no later than the beginning of January. If it proves possible
to do it do it earlier, certainly if it were possible to do it before
Christmas, I know that the FCA will do so, and will use its best
endeavours to bring forward these proposals as quickly as possible.
Certainly, if we are going to include within the system features such
as a real-time database, I am afraid that this cannot be done very
quickly. Everybody has seen the success and failure both of Governments
and other organisations to introduce IT systems very quickly. The
thought that one can do this within a matter of weeks prior to

end by saying—because I think a number of noble Lords slightly
question this—that the Government and the FCA are absolutely
committed to getting this system in place as soon as they possibly can.
The FCA has said it is going to do it. It has already set a very tight
timetable. I understand that when the system was introduced in Florida
it took longer or at least as long as we are proposing to do it here.
There is no lack of commitment to do it but we want to do it right. We
want it to work. We do not want to have to change it as soon as we have
implemented it because we found we rushed it and it has not worked.
That is why the FCA has come forward with a speedy but deliberative
approach. We think that makes absolute sense. That is why the deadline
is in our amendment. I commend our amendment to the

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I now turn to an amendment which will
better position the PRA to take account of consumer interests by
drawing on the views of the FCA’s Consumer Panel. This follows
the debate at Lords Report stage where the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell,
proposed amendments which would have created a role for the Consumer
Panel by creating a duty on the PRA to consider representations made to
it by the panel and to publish its responses, equivalent to
the duty on the
FCA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000094">We have
considered the issues carefully, as I said we would on Report, and have
proposed alternative arrangements which are more proportionate to the
PRA’s prudential remit, but deliver, we believe, the essence of
the noble Lord’s amendment. Our amendment will confer a role on
the panel by allowing it to raise issues it is considering with the
PRA; for example, through meetings or in correspondence. It will also
enable the PRA to meet the expenses of the Consumer Panel when the
Consumer Panel discharges this function. 
<?notus-xml column=700?>This will ensure that the PRA can benefit from the expertise of the
panel without the undue burden on either the PRA or the Consumer Panel
of a binding requirement on the PRA to consult the panel each time the
PRA changes its rules or

Deighton:</Member></B> We now turn to the proposal to put in the Bill
new requirements on regulators to meet the auditors of banks. This
issue has been subject to extensive debate. The Government have been
clear throughout that the regulators should carry the full
responsibility for managing an effective relationship with the auditors
of banks they supervise, and be held to account for how well they
deliver
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000098">The
reasons for this are strong. Before the crisis, regulators neglected
their engagement with auditors while the auditors themselves signed off
on the accounts of banks which we now know were, in some cases, in dire
straits. The Government took action. There is now a requirement in the
Financial Services and Markets Act for the PRA to lay its code of
practice on auditor engagement before Parliament, meaning that the
regulators will be held accountable for how well they deliver on the
requirement to engage with the auditors of
banks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000099">However,
it has become clear how strongly the PCBS valued the opportunity to go
further and specify the number of meetings in statute, to ensure
auditors’ insights are used. For those reasons the PCBS is clear
that, over time, this dialogue between auditors and regulators must not
be allowed to lapse. The proposed amendment therefore includes two
provisions to ensure that this crucial dialogue is
preserved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000100">First,
the regulators must disclose in their annual report the number of
meetings they have held with the auditors. This allows Parliament to
hold the regulators to account for the frequency of meetings. Secondly,
the regulators must meet at least once per year with the auditors of
firms that the PRA, the leading prudential regulator, considers to be
important to the stability of the United Kingdom economy. This is a
minimum requirement. The Government believe that it is right to place
the duty on the regulator to determine how many more meetings are
required with the auditors of firms of particular types, consistent
with its risk-based, judgment-led approach. This allows the regulators
to focus their resources where the risks are
highest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000101">Some
noble Lords may argue that the minimum requirement should be higher.
The Government do not agree. The Government have said that the
regulators must meet with any firm that may be important to the
financial system at least once per year, but within this group, there
will be firms of major and firms of minor significance.</hs_para>

significance, once may be too little; for firms of minor significance,
once may be sufficient. For example, under the PRA’s current
code, for banks that could have the most significant impact on
financial stability, the PRA code mandates at least three meetings a
year. For other firms whose failure could still materially impact the
UK financial system, the PRA code mandates at least one bilateral a
year. The FCA meets at least twice per year with the auditors of the
most significant banks and at least once per year with those in the
next largest
category.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000103">The
Government believe that it is right that Parliament does not seek to
specify this level of detail in legislation. To do so would risk
misaligning the PRA’s resources with the risks the financial
system faces. The Government therefore believe that this amendment
arrives at a suitable compromise between the desire to specify in the
Bill a minimum number of meetings, to prevent meetings between auditors
and regulators from lapsing entirely, and an approach that requires
regulators to take responsibility for pursuing proportionate and
high-quality engagement, and enhanced mechanisms for accountability. I

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, once again, I am extremely
grateful to my noble friend Lord Deighton and his colleagues in the

out, it is in response to a recommendation of the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards. Hitherto the Treasury has been

this was also a recommendation of your Lordships’ Economic
Affairs Committee, in its report on the auditors a little while back.
This provision is needed in the Bill is because we have been here
before. The Banking Act 1987—I introduced the Bill that led to
that—enabled these meetings to take place, and for a number of
years they did. However, in the run-up to the great banking crisis and
meltdown they had ceased. That is why we on the commission felt that
this time it was necessary to have this provision in the Bill, and I am
grateful to my noble friend for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T22:55:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

getting late but I should mention another matter that relates to a
recommendation of the commission. There was lamentable failure of these
meetings to take place and the fact that the auditors were in front of
the crisis—the dog that never barked—was partly because
of the lack of meetings and was largely the fault of the regulators at
the time. It was their responsibility above all to seek such meetings.
However, there was also the lamentable inadequacy of the accounting
system at the time, IFRS. It is probably an inadequate system in
general but it is particularly flawed when it comes to the auditing of
banks. That is increasingly recognised within the accountancy
profession. It is too late for me to go into the details, and I have

addressed this issue it said that since we cannot change IFRS because

McFall of Alcluith:</Member></B> My Lords, I will be very brief in
supporting the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson. I have been
interested in the relationship between the auditors and the regulator
ever since Northern Rock went down in 2007. The question
that the regulator should be keeping in mind in discussions with
auditors on a yearly basis is, what is the point of an audit? The
auditors tell us that it is to have a backward look at what has
happened in a company, but there is a need to have a forward look at
the risks that are happening, to issues like low risk and low
probability, low risk and high probability, high risk and low
probability, or high risk and high probability. These scenarios need to
be included, because the auditors came to all the committees, the
Treasury Committee in the past and the Treasury Committee now, and said
that it was their business to look at the audit at that particular
time. That is insufficient and there needs to be a greater engagement
between the regulator and the
auditors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000109">I
reminded the Minister that previously the regulator did not look at the
business models of companies. They had nothing to do with them.
Thankfully, the new chief executive, Martin Wheatley, has said that the
business models are very appropriate for regulators to look at because
the business models that were ignored let the PPI mis-selling scandal
go for 18 years. There is a lot of work to do between the auditor and
the regulator—and the question that I repeat again is for the
regulator to say, what is the point of an audit? Auditors can come up
to the mark and not just have a backward look or even a present look at
the business model of a company but can ensure that there is also a
forward
look.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000110"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="1312108000543" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000543">Lord

PRA getting the information

out of the capital requirement directive IV, just to make sure that it
is consistent. I am not aware of a particular constraint, but I am

I fully accept the observation from the noble Lord, Lord McFall, that
an audit needs to have the context of the business model behind it to
have a proper understanding of where the business is going. We will
certainly encourage the regulator to ensure that the dialogue with the
auditor takes into account what is really happening in the business and
does not just look at the numbers in
isolation.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="1312108000594" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0003.htm#1312108000594">Amendment

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I turn finally to the amendments that
deal with claims management companies and the Office for Legal
Complaints. It is essential that a new route of redress is available to
consumers who feel that they have received a poor service from those
providing claims management services, commonly referred to as claims
management companies, or CMCs. It is also right that the claims
management industry bears the cost of providing this new route of
redress. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter of Kentish Town, for
raising this issue at Report stage and I am delighted that she has put
her name to this amendment.</hs_para>

Services Act 2007 already makes provision for bringing complaints about
regulated CMCs under the jurisdiction of the Office for Legal
Complaints. Once commenced, this will give consumers greater scope for
redress against regulated CMCs, including awards for financial
compensation. Before Section 161 can be commenced, however, the correct
mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure that the costs incurred by
the OLC in relation to complaints about CMCs can be recouped. It is
also necessary to ensure that these costs are borne by the claims
management industry. It is right that costs associated with complaints
about CMCs are paid for by the industry which creates them. It is also
right to prevent the legal profession having to foot the bill for these
costs or benefit from any income generated from recouping these
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0004.htm#1312108000115">Turning
to the detail of the amendments, it is usual practice for the
designated regulator to recoup the costs of redress from those it
regulates. In this case, the Claims Management Regulator, or CMR, is
the designated regulator. The Legal Services Board, or LSB, will then
levy the regulator for the OLC’s costs and reimburse the OLC. To
ensure that the Claims Management Regulator can recoup the OLC’s
costs, these amendments change the Compensation Act 2006 to enable the
Secretary of State to make regulations to allow the 
<?notus-xml column=706?>Claims Management Regulator to charge CMCs, as part of their fees, for
the OLC’s costs associated with CMC complaint-handling. The
Legal Services Act 2007 already provides for a levy on the
Claims Management Regulator, if one is designated. This enables the LSB
to levy the regulator for costs incurred by the OLC in relation to
claims management
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0004.htm#1312108000116">That
mechanism is applicable only when there is a designated person as the
Claims Management Regulator. When no person is designated as the Claims
Management Regulator, as is currently the case, this role falls to the
Secretary of State. The mechanism does not operate in this situation as
the Secretary of State cannot be levied. To address this, amendments to
the 2007 Act are needed. They will change the Act to give the Lord
Chancellor a new power to make regulations to allow him to recover the
OLC’s costs associated with CMCs. These powers allow the Lord
Chancellor to charge a periodic fee on regulated CMCs.</hs_para>

situation further amendments are needed to address cross-subsidisation.
The amendments will change the levy mechanism in the Legal Services Act
2007 to ensure that the calculation of the OLC’s expenditure
which is leviable on the legal profession excludes both its costs and
its income in relation to CMCs.</hs_para>

House at 30 pages long. With today’s amendments, it is going to
be about 200 pages long, with about 150 clauses. I suggest to the House
that it is incumbent on all of us—but on the Government, in
particular—to assist public understanding of where the Bill is
now at. It is going back to the Commons, where most of it will not have
been debated, and the strain on people in this House over the past few
weeks has been immense. Therefore, I suggest to the Government two
measures that they might consider taking.</hs_para>

first—although it sounds remarkable, it is of utility—is
to prepare a set of Explanatory Notes on the Bill as it now is when it
goes back to the Commons and when it is considered, as it will be, by
the City of London in general and by the banking community and the
lawyers in particular. The second point is that, from page 50 onwards,
the Government’s response to the commission’s report of
July 2013 very helpfully sets out 114 proposals with notes against them
and proposed action. The Government have taken different positions on
some of those, and there are additions to that list. It would be a
great help if the list were revised, bringing it up to date to reflect
what has actually happened.</hs_para>

Amendment 26, which stands in the names of the noble Lord, Lord
Deighton, and of my noble friend Lady Hayter of Kentish Town. She is
very sorry she cannot be in her place this evening to say this herself,
but she is very grateful to the Government not only for accepting the
essence of her amendment, moved at Report, but also for turning in some
far better drafting than she could have done. This was done under some
tight time pressures, for which we are grateful to both of the
Ministers concerned and to their staff. My noble friend cannot be here
to thank the Government herself because she is at a Labour Party
fundraising event to help fund the campaign to expel the Government
from office, but in the mean time she does sincerely want her
appreciation for the help to be
recorded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0004.htm#1312108000124">The
impact of the amendment is that, in future, consumers with complaints
against claims management companies will be able to take these to the
Legal Services Ombudsman to be resolved. They will therefore get
redress when there is judgment in their favour. This will also help to
drive up standards. By reporting repeat offenders to the regulator, it
will help to get some of the CMC sharks out of the business. So

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, I know it is getting late,
but as this group of amendments draws to a close, I hope you
will permit me to spend a few moments reflecting on the changes that
this Bill has undergone since it first arrived in this House, and to
thank all those who have contributed to it in that time. On
Second Reading in July, my noble friend Lord Newby remarked that the
great strength of this legislation was due in no small part to the
intense degree of scrutiny that it had undergone on its journey to this
House, and the constructive spirit in which those of all political
colours had contributed to it. This is surely even more true of the
Bill that leaves this House
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0004.htm#1312108000126">My first
thanks must go to the members of the Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards, represented in this House by the noble Lords, Lord
Turnbull, Lord McFall and Lord Lawson, the noble Baroness,
Lady Kramer, and the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of
Canterbury. The central role that they have played in shaping this
legislation is one of the things that has made this Bill so
unique; indeed, the great majority of the amendments that it has
undergone in this House directly implement the
recommendations of the Commission’s final report on professional
standards and culture in the banking industry. These measures are not
only the crowning achievements of this piece of legislation, but the
final piece in this Government’s ambitious four-stage programme
of reform for the banking
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312108000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-0004.htm#1312108000127">Many of
the noble Lords in this Chamber today will have contributed to the
first stage of that reform, the Financial Services Act 2012, which
recast the regulatory architecture for financial services. This
Bill, as it was introduced in another
place, made 
<?notus-xml column=708?>provision for the second stage of that reform, the implementation of Sir
John Vickers’s recommendations on structural reform of the
banking sector, and the Bill that leaves this House today puts in place
the two final pillars of that legislative programme,
overhauling the culture of the banking industry,
and driving out competition to improve outcomes for consumers. Of
course, the Government’s commitment to implement the
recommendations of the Commission’s final report
through this Bill has meant that the task of scrutinising these
incredibly important measures has fallen largely to this

which noble Lords have been asked to absorb so much information. In
particular I must thank the opposition Front Bench, led by the noble
Lord, Lord Eatwell, for its thoughtful and constructive contributions
to the debate. I thank my noble friend Lord Newby for his support,
without which it would not have been possible to provide the House with

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, it is incumbent on us to
respond to the very kind words of my noble friend Lord Deighton. As he
said, the Bill has been completely transformed. I have been a Member of
this House for a very long time now but I cannot recall a
Bill—let alone a Bill as important as this one—to have
been so totally transformed for the better. It is not only a great deal
bigger but also a great deal better as a result of its passage through
your Lordships’
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T23:15:54"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
extremely grateful and the nation will be extremely

has been a lot of nonsense talked about the excessive size of the
banking sector in this country. Some people have been even as foolish
as to talk about a monocrop economy. The fact of the matter is that
banking accounts for a little over 5% of this country’s GDP; it
is nothing like a monocrop economy. However, it is a supremely
important sector and one in which we are world class.</hs_para>

is a size problem—I have not got time to go into it now and it
would not be proper to do so—with individual institutions. As
the former Governor of the Bank of England said, if an institution is
too big to fail, it is too
big<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T23:16:54"></hs_TimeCode>. The size of
the sector is a great strength of this country. As the present
governor, Mr Carney, said recently, it is a great strength of the
United Kingdom that we are prominent and world class in this growing
and supremely important industry. We want it to grow further, which I
hope it will. It is our great strength. It is what economists call the
law of comparative advantage—you should do what you are best
at—and this is a sector in which we are very good. However, if
it is going to get bigger and bigger, which I think it will and should,
it has to be both clean and robust.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T23:17:36"></hs_TimeCode> purpose of

really, and we have just been catching up through these various stages.
I hope that when we next have a financial services Bill that, instead

statutory instruments before us today provide the detail of the
transition to and operation of individual electoral registration, which
replaces the current household registration system. The description of
electoral registers and amendment regulations also make changes
relating to the edited versions of the electoral register and to
elements of the conduct of elections.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, to this long-running saga. We
considered first what become the Electoral Registration and
Administration Act, and then the numerous statutory instruments that
followed. The Bill team assures me that there are no more than 29 to
come. The good news that we have today is that the data-matching
exercise has turned up around 78% of voters being matched through the
system. The query attached to that is that the data matching is much
higher in areas that have a static population than in areas that have
either a mobile population or a large number of second homes. That is
why Argyll and Bute comes 20th in the list of lowest matching areas but
urban areas and areas with a high number of students are also among
those where the percentage of data matching comes out much lower than
in other
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312096000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000005">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:31:58"></hs_TimeCode>
ensure that as many existing electors as possible remain on the
register during the transition, the Government announced in their
official response to pre-legislative scrutiny on IER that part of the
transition would involve a data-matching stage where all electoral
registers in Britain would be matched against trusted public data sets.
Where a positive match is made between an entry on the register and
information in the data set, that person may be confirmed. The dry 
<?notus-xml column=108?>run, as I have already said, found that about 78% on average of those
submitted to the Department for Work and Pensions could be confirmed by
data matching. The results were better than we originally
anticipated.</hs_para>

combination of national and local data could lead to an even greater
overall average match rate of as much as 85%. This high rate means that
fewer electors will need to make IER applications during the
transition. EROs will then be able to focus their resources on
unconfirmed electors and those eligible citizens who were not on the
register already. As we have discussed before, we already have an
existing problem in that the number of voters who are not on the
existing register has steadily grown over the past 10
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312096000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000007">Cabinet
Office officials have recently written to each local authority, giving
them their indicative funding for implementing IER next year. Each
allocation is based in part on the results of the confirmation dry run
to ensure that sufficient funding is provided for the work required of
each ERO to produce as complete and accurate an electoral register as
possible as we move to the new system. The Government expect the
allocation to cover all the costs in the majority of authorities but
will consider funding additional costs in individual cases if they are
precisely and strongly supported by evidence and have not already been
recognised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312096000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000008">Each
of the instruments before us today relates wholly or partly to IER. The
transitional provisions order sets out the activities unique to the
transition—due to begin in June 2014 in England and Wales and
after the referendum of September 2014 in Scotland. Many of the
regulations in the description of electoral registers and amendment
regulations set out the operation of IER from that date, through
transition and into the period of business as usual. Under these
regulations, each ERO will still be required each year to carry out a
full annual canvass of households, sending out a canvass form to every
residential property.</hs_para>

the household registration system, completing this form will not get a
new elector on to the register. A household inquiry form will be used
to find out who is resident. If people have not moved, they will be
retained without further action being required beyond returning the
form or informing the ERO that there has been no change, just as under
the current system. However, if the residents recorded on the returned
form have changed, any new electors will need to apply individually to

is currently the case, there will be a duty on EROs to follow up where
they get no response to these canvass forms: the household inquiry
forms. If no information is forthcoming, a further form will be sent.
If necessary, a third form will be sent and a canvasser must visit the
property. The occupier or the person responsible for the property will

ERO finds out about a person who appears to be eligible, whether
through the household inquiry form or through other information, they
must invite that person to register. As with the household inquiry
form, the ERO must also follow up any non-response to an individual
invitation to register 
<?notus-xml column=109?>and may require the person to make an application. In addition to the
criminal offence of failing to respond to a household inquiry form, the

application to register is a key part of IER. It is central to the

the information required and in its
design<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:36:35"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Electoral Commission is currently working on the forms for IER, which
include the new household inquiry form, the letter inviting a person to

working closely with the EC on the development of these forms, which

online registration will be enabled, thus modernising the registration
process and making it more accessible, especially for those registering

feature of the new application forms and of the online application
portal also enabled by these regulations is that applicants must
provide personal identifiers—namely, their date of birth and
national insurance number. These will be used to verify their identity
through data matching against records held by the Department for Work
and Pensions. Electoral Commission research shows that 95% of people

identity. For these situations, the regulations set out a robust but

most acute around postal voting, only those who are individually

register is published in December 2014 in England and Wales, and on 28

elector in the ERO’s area. In other words, someone who casts a
proxy vote for someone else has herself or himself to be on the UK
electoral register. In the 2015 canvass period, EROs will send a

remaining on the register at that point will be out of date or
inaccurate. The Minister of the day will have to lay, and Parliament
approve, an order in the summer of 2015 to enable the end of the

the 2016 canvass. The decision will be for the Minister and the
Parliament of the day after the 2015 general election, but I am

mention my next point straight after warning against “rushing
through”, but just last week, one expected deadline for
electoral registration was missed. The Commons Library note, dated only
a couple of months ago, said that the Government expected to make a
firm decision by the end of November on whether to proceed with
individual registration for the 2015 election. When Greg Clark was
answering a Question on 26 November in another place, he did not say
that the Government had decided to proceed; he said simply that they
were on track for individual electoral registration to come in in 2014.
I do not think there has been a critical slippage yet; but the more the
Minister can say to persuade the Committee that they will be giving the
go-ahead and that there is still time to have registration fully in
place by the summer of 2014—even if it falls short of an

we say it is “on track”, it is worth reviewing one or two
issues that have come up on that track. One about which all Members of
the House should be very pleased is the decision to retain the civic
penalty. I have no doubt whatever that it was the threat of
a civic penalty—even though it is not much used—that
prevented a serious slump in registration, particularly among younger
people, which would have been damaging. I give the
Government absolute credit for that: they listened, they thought about
it and they decided to retain the civic penalty. That is greatly to be
welcomed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:48:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

been resolved, but where I personally regret the resolution—as
indeed does the Electoral Commission—is the question of the open
register. Here, there is a straight conflict. This should be a register
for voting purposes only; that is to say, it should not be sent out to
anybody who wants to use it for marketing or any other purposes.
Frankly, the ability of a voter to contract out is not a sufficient
protection, because most of them have better things to do than to think
about whether they want to contract out of the electoral
register.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312096000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000029">We
understand that the marketing industry has brought huge pressure on the
Government to continue to make the register available for its purposes.
We hear that some local authorities that were going to give priority to
putting in a box that could be ticked to say, “I want to
contract out”—the tick could then be removed—have
been threatened with judicial review by the marketing
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:49:32"></hs_TimeCode>. I must
say that in my guts I find it very distasteful when our electoral
process is taking second place to the lowest commercial considerations,
but I am sure that the marketers have their case; it just has not
persuaded me. I ask the Minister to agree, though, that after the first
use of IER the Government will review this provision and any evidence
there may be as to whether it has damaged the integrity of the register

make mistakes—it can be resolved next

issue that has been largely resolved, I think, is that EROs themselves
were very worried about the resources that were being devoted to this.
We have had progress in two regards here. The Government have told them
what resources they are 
<?notus-xml column=113?>going to get, and have also said that they are prepared to consider a
request for more resources in cases where there are particular
difficulties in given areas. Nobody is dancing on the rooftops about
this, but it is clearly good progress, and EROs are less unhappy than
they were.</hs_para>

particular problem, which we need to go on worrying about, with the
universities. I will cite
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:54:37"></hs_TimeCode>one case. There
is a ward in Lancaster, I am told, which is nearly always all
student-inhabited and where registration is around the 10% mark at the
moment. In Sheffield, which has several universities, the universities
themselves are putting resources into campaigning to get a fuller
register. That is not really what university money is for: it should
come from the budget provided for IER. I would welcome any reassurances
that are forthcoming on those issues—particularly the university
point, which is a chilling worry. Whether the Lib Dems worry about it
in quite the way they used to, I do not know. They used to rely
considerably on the student vote, but of course that may not be so
certain at the next election. The Minister, is, of course, perfectly
placed to give both a party as well as a ministerial
opinion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:51:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312096000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000032">The
one thing that is not resolved is an IT issue. The Government are quite
frank about this in the memoranda: we do not yet know whether the IT to
do the verification matching will work. We do not expect to know that
until February or March, when it has been properly trialled. If it does
not work, it will cause serious difficulties at least for the
scheme—and maybe more than that. The probability is that it will
work, by the way, but we ought to think about contingency planning if
it does not. There is a particular problem—which came out in the
Minister’s remark—about postal voters, because unless
they are individually registered, they cannot vote at all. There is no
way around that, so postal voters could lose their vote if this does
not work—and even those moving shortly before the election might
find it difficult, if this does not work, to exercise their vote. This
is of concern to the Electoral Commission, as I am sure it is to the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:53:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312096000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000033">I
do not want or expect the Government to delay making the announcement
that they intend to go ahead until they are certain that these things
work. If you do not take any risks in life, you tend not to make much
progress. However, my father used to say to me when I was a young man,
“David, always leave room for the big back-out”. I think
he had girls in mind, rather than electoral registration at the
time—but I think that, on this, Ministers ought to leave room
for the big back-out. That is to say, if it turns out that this IT
simply does not work—and my expectation is that it
will—they will have to be in a position where they can find the
words that they have used to show that they were concerned about this
issue. If that means that fundamental decisions have to be reviewed,

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312096000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000034">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T15:54:32"></hs_TimeCode>

as Liberal Democrats, we are glad that registration is now compulsory,
not voluntary, as was suggested in the beginning. That would have led
to very different registration levels in various constituencies.
Secondly, we have waited a long time for this: the Electoral Commission

again at the format of the registration forms. I declare an interest as
president of Bite the Ballot, the youth movement to encourage young
people to take part in the electoral process and influence
manifesto commitments. Perhaps the Government will look at the form. We
are replacing the 400 different forms that were used in various
constituencies and electoral areas with one form. It will be a national
form, which is used in every constituency. Of course, in Wales it will
be bilingual. Even in Scotland we will have the element of the language
up there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312096000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000038">The
civil penalty for not registering comes in an accompanying letter. I
get lots of correspondence—we all do—and we might look at
the report we are sent, but we put the accompanying letter to one side.
Can we not have the penalty note on the form itself, saying that if
people do not register there is the possibility of a penalty? In
addition, can the second and third forms be distinguishable, so that
they look different—perhaps printed in a different
colour—so that people know that this is not the original form
but the second or third
form?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312096000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000039">On postal
voting, what do the Government believe is the ideal moment to send out
postal votes in the UK? Over the years, with the late Lord Garden, who
of course was a distinguished military person, I tried to ensure that
those who were on military service in places such as
Afghanistan—this has been mentioned already—were able to
receive their postal vote forms in sufficient time to enable those
votes to be completed, returned and included in the count. It is
difficult. I remember we had quite a debate on it when the Labour
Government were in post. Is there some way we can ensure that those who
are ready to sacrifice their lives for us will at least have the
opportunity of casting a vote, wherever they are? That is very
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312096000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#1312096000040">The
regulations are acceptable, I am sure, but other initiatives are not
here—of course, we would say that—such as engaging young
people to register and take part in political debate. I go back to the
Bite the Ballot proposals for a national registration day—5
February 2014—in every area; I think the superstores and the
large shops are going to have tables where people can register, and
young people in particular will be able to 
<?notus-xml column=115?>register. Will the Government support this Bite the Ballot initiative?

register while they are at school, aged 16, they will be able to vote
by the time the next election comes—probably; it will depend on
various dates. Let us get the schools and the young people involved,

think the Minister will be surprised to hear that I still have concerns
about this legislation, but he will, I hope, be pleased that I do not

have already heard; people with learning disabilities; people with
disabilities generally; 
<?notus-xml column=116?>people living in areas of high social and economic deprivation; and
ethnic minorities. These concerns were extensively rehearsed during the
passage of the Bill and were brushed aside by the Government, who have

worry is that, as other noble Lords mentioned, it will be students,
people living in private rented accommodation, service men and women

am sure that the noble Lord is well aware of the importance of the
register that will be published in December 2015, as it relates to the
next parliamentary redistribution of seats. I think that I am right in
saying this will be the base figure that the Boundary Commission will
take. If there is a drop in the number of people registered to vote,
that will have very serious consequences for how seats are redrawn and
could create a gross injustice and unfairness. How will the noble Lord

to the other regulations before the Grand Committee. Changing the name
of the edited register to the open register is a very sensible move and
I fully support it. The Government are a bit obsessed with the
retention of data and I have some concerns about losing the ability to
detect fraud that their keenness to destroy records could create. Where
someone has failed to be matched and cannot produce documents that
satisfy the ERO, they will need to have their application attested by
an elector who is registered in the same local authority—someone
of good standing. Can the noble Lord tell the Grand Committee who is a
person 
<?notus-xml column=119?>of “good standing” and how many applications they will be
able to sign per year: one, two, 10 or 100? When do alarm bells start

he not accept that in many places EROs will have to go much further

do only in exceptional circumstances, or is it something he would
encourage them to do much more frequently than that to improve the

document and put that day’s date on the form. That would be an
understandable mistake, but it would mean that their vote was not

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for almost
everything that has been said in this debate. We all agree, as the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said, that it is extremely important, first,
to get maximum registration, and then to get maximum turnout. We also
accept that both of these are difficult and have become more difficult;
and that the question of the legitimacy of government is, of course,
caught up in this. We are all well aware that we might possibly elect a
Labour Government at the next election with 35% of the votes cast on a
very low turnout. I can imagine what the <I>Daily Mail</I> would say
about the legitimacy of that
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:15:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

interest across all parties, first, to make sure that we maximise
registration and then—this is something on which we need to have
some active cross-party conversations—persuade our deeply
alienated electorate, let alone our deeply hostile media, that politics
is an honourable profession; that voting is important; and that
maximising the turnout at the next election has to be seen as a civic
duty and not as something that, as some newspaper columnists tend to
suggest, will only encourage the

Wills:</Member></B> I am very grateful for what the Minister has just
said and want to associate myself with those remarks profoundly. I
would like to “mark his card” with a particular potential
problem on which I hope the parties could collaborate. That is the
problem about funding for electoral registration in this context. As
the Minister will know, it is not ring-fenced—although I
personally believe that it should be. However, because it is not
ring-fenced, local authorities under a lot of 
<?notus-xml column=120?>pressure might well be tempted to skimp, shall we say, on some of the
efforts made. The problem could arise, therefore—and it is only
a potential problem at the moment—that local authorities with a
particular political complexion will not necessarily see it as in their
interests to canvass areas that support the other parties. I am sure
that the Minister can imagine the sort of scenarios that could
occur<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:16:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000004">At
the moment, there is no protection against that happening. I am not
saying that it will happen. Most local authorities in my experience as
a Minister were extremely diligent and took their democratic duties
extremely seriously. I would be very surprised if it was a widespread
problem, but it could be a problem. I welcome the comments just made by
the Minister and his reassurance that he will at least explore what
might be done to protect against that sort of
eventuality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13120911000062" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000062">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I hesitate to get into a
discussion on ring-fencing, which the noble Lord and I have debated
several times before. The good news is that the data matching so far
has come up with a much higher proportion than we originally
anticipated. That will enable us to focus funding on those vulnerable
groups and particular areas that we now know to be the most difficult.
We all understand which those groups are. They are young men above
all—young men who tend not to open letters and who move around
very rapidly—students, young black voters, and other challenging
groups of one sort or another. That is the area on which we are
currently concentrating. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, and
others that the Government are
co-operating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:18:05"></hs_TimeCode>
actively with Bite the Ballot, Operation Black Vote and other
organisations that are working to increase the intention and
willingness to register within their own communities. We are also
working with universities and students to ensure that they, too, are
able to raise interest and maximise the registration of those groups in
their areas. We are well aware of this and we are doing everything we
can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000006">The
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, asked whether we were going ahead for 2015. So
far, things are going better than anticipated. We have not completely
gone snap on it, but the IT has demonstrated more resilience than we
feared might be the case, so it is on track. I am grateful for the
noble Lord’s comments on the open register. There are some wider
considerations here, as we all understand, such as the questions of
credit references and identity verification for mortgages, and other
such things. There is also an issue about overseas voters, since they
will be asked to demonstrate that they have been, within the past 15
years, resident somewhere in a particular
constituency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>All of these
things fit in with maintaining an accurate register, let alone the
question of longer historical research, which relates to the future of

more detail
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000007">Yes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:20:45"></hs_TimeCode>,
of course we will review the situation after 2015, and we will be
absolutely concerned to do whatever we can about service registration.
The question of service voting and registration is becoming a little
less difficult than it has been, because as troops return from
Afghanistan and from Germany, the proportion of our serviceman living
outside this country is going through a relatively rapid decline. Of
course they will 
<?notus-xml column=121?>continue to move around, but arrangements for Armed Forces voters and
their spouses will be maintained in as strong a form as we possibly
can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000008">We
are absolutely concerned to get good young people’s registration
forms. I have already mentioned our work with universities and other
groups. The noble Lord, Lord Wills, talked about access to the
Government’s risk register. Again, we have discussed this before
and I have reiterated that the Government work through a risk register
as a matter of course but do not publish it. We have just all agreed
where we know the risks are in this shift in registration, but I have
to reiterate that we knew where many of these risks were already. It is
relevant that we have already had increasing problems with young men,
people living in rented accommodation and ethnic minority voters. Those
existed already; we simply have to work harder to get through to all of
them; that is why we are targeting our
efforts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:22:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wills" PimsId="5791" UID="13120911000063" xid="2061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000063">Lord
Wills:</Member></B> Very briefly, everyone knew where the risks were
with the current system of registration. The question I have been
trying to get the Government to address is: does the way in which they
are proceeding to introduce individual registration increase those
risks, maintain the same level of risk or decrease the risks? Which is

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, our efforts are intended to
mitigate a risk that was already increasing and is likely to increase
further. We will continue to need to look at a range of issues. I am
well aware that a Labour Private Member’s Bill, which has been
presented two or three times in the House of Commons, suggests, for
example, that benefit seekers should not be able to receive their
benefits unless they are on the electoral register. This provision is
not included in the Bill. It is something that the noble Lord may wish
to pursue further. There is a range of questions that we still need to
consider, but he and I know how difficult this is: first, getting these
people on the register and then persuading many of them to
vote<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:23:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000011">The
noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, asked how aware we were of the importance of
the register for December 2015, because it is likely to be the basis on
which the redistribution of seats next time around will be drawn.
Again, this is not a new problem. We are already aware that there has
been underregistration in a number of cities—a number of safe
Labour seats, one has to say. To the extent to which we have managed to
raise the level of registration, we will raise it on a much fairer
basis for the next redistribution of seats. Again, we all recognise, on
a cross-party basis, that these things go together, and that we share
an interest in making sure that as many of these vulnerable groups as
possible are persuaded to

Gould of Potternewton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a tragedy but
a reality that violence against women and girls, be it sexual assault,
domestic violence, FGM or forced marriage, is seen by far too many
women as part of normal existence. In discussing the question of rape
as a weapon of war, I want to concentrate on sexual violence in
conflict, although the other issues around violence against women are
extremely
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000018">The
United Nations Security Council has declared that the use of rape and
sexual violence as a weapon of warfare is a threat to international
peace and security and it has passed several resolutions mandating
states to take specific measures to end impunity for war rape and to
address gender inequality. The question that must be discussed today is
what the result of these initiatives is. At this point, I must declare
an interest as co-chair of the UK branch of the Global Justice
Center.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000019">Rape
as a particularly serious form of sexual violence qualifies in
international law as a form of torture designed to destroy communities
through terror and humiliation. As a weapon it is used more than any
other prohibited weapon of war, including starvation, herbicides or
dum-dum bullets, yet somehow the degradation and sexual assault of
women are not seen as such a significant crime and worthy of
prosecution. It can be extremely violent and dangerous. It is
psychological warfare designed to humiliate and it is used
systematically as a tactic of
war.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000020">Girls and
women are now at a high risk of physical, sexual and emotional violence
from regular soldiers, non-regular army groups and militia, and
non-combatants. This risk is compounded by the breakdown of structures
of authority, displacement, and the rupture of 
<?notus-xml column=124?>communities and their coping strategies. Women and girls are often the
most vulnerable when humanitarian emergencies occur, but they are often
not accorded enough priority by donors at the onset of a humanitarian
crisis. It must also be understood that women are not a homogeneous
group. Attention has to be given to the fate of the large number of
widows, for instance, and their children, as well as all women at
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000021">Sexual
violence has wide-ranging negative consequences: physical trauma,
disease, HIV/AIDS, psychological trauma, unwanted pregnancy, maternal
mortality and the risks of resorting to non-sterile or unsafe methods
of abortion, thus perpetuating the physical and psychological effects
of the injury. The horror of rape can lead to severe health
implications or death. In many societies, the shame of rape is a burden
for the survivor, causing the woman to become a social outcast and
frequently obliging her to leave her family and community, which may
lead to poverty and often to
prostitution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000022">Whether
it is in the iconic square in Cairo, or during the 100 days of the
Rwandan genocide, when it is alleged that 400,000 women were raped, or
in Bosnia, where it is estimated that 200,000 to 250,000 women were
raped—with only perhaps 50 prosecutions, I should add—or
in the Central African Republic, where campaigning militia and
government forces alike continue to rain terror over the population by
the systematic use of rape, even though a hearing is being conducted
against a military commander, the war rape continues, and women and
girls made pregnant by such rape are denied access to abortion due,
directly or indirectly, to the US abortion ban on humanitarian aid.
There is evidence that in Libya, in 2011, Gaddafi deliberately used
rape as a punishment. Today, in Colombia, sexual violence is
perpetrated by armed actors, both state and non-state, but it is the
state security forces’ involvement in sexual violence that has a
particularly devastating effect since those forces are mandated to
protect the Colombian population. A woman from Colombia said to me,
“Their uniforms should symbolise security, discipline and public
service, but instead they symbolise the fear of rape”. Amnesty
International reported the terrible situation of women in Syria in fear
of sexually based violence fleeing to camps where they cannot go out at
night because of that continuing fear of sexual violence, when they
thought that they were going to
safety.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000023">Girls
and women raped in situations of armed conflict are considered the
wounded and sick. That means that they have absolute rights to
non-discriminatory medical care and attention under Common Article 3 of
the Geneva Conventions, which states that no adverse distinction should
be made on any grounds other than medical ones. However, because of the
restrictions placed on the use of aid for the purpose of abortion,
non-discrimination might signify that the outcome for each gender must
be the same, but the treatment is not and should not be identical.
Consequences—most notably pregnancy—necessitate distinct
medical care, including the option of abortion. Denying abortion to
female victims of war rape who are forced to bear the children of their
rapists violates Common Article 3, the prohibition against torture and
cruel treatment.</hs_para>

of choice for humanitarian aid to persons wounded or sick in armed
conflict is the International Committee of the Red Cross. Despite the
UK’s explicit policies on safe abortion and gender equality, the
ICRC, which receives more than 20% of its annual budget from the United
States, operates under the US abortion ban, stating in its internal
operational guidelines
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13120911000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000046">“the

ICRC further advises that such medical care is governed by domestic
abortion laws, not the medical needs of the patient as required by the
Geneva Convention. Nearly all of the UK’s humanitarian aid for
victims of armed conflict is given to humanitarian aid entities that
discriminate against female rape victims by denying them medically
needed abortions.</hs_parafo>

January this year that the option of abortion is a necessary component
of medical care for women and girls impregnated by war rape. This
resolution represents a step forward in recognising the rights of
female victims of war, so my question to the Minister has to be whether
this policy has now been incorporated into relevant DfID policies. Has
there been a revision of the safe and unsafe abortion practice paper
that limits the provision of DfID support for abortion services
strictly to situations where abortion is legal under national laws?
Those actions are vital if we are to make change happen.</hs_parafo>

that might be followed by the Government are to remove any barriers to
the implementation of the important Security Council Resolution 2106 by
the UK making a bilateral request for the US to remove its abortion ban
on humanitarian aid and publicly to support access to safe abortions

the recommendation of the House of Commons Select Committee
on International Development that all UK aid partners should inform
girls and women raped and impregnated in armed conflict of their rights
under international humanitarian

Hodgson of Abinger (Con):</Member></B> I congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Gould, on raising this subject for debate today, because
the situation of women in conflict is so often overlooked. For most
people in the UK, war is viewed through the media with images of young
men—soldiers, rebels, fundamentalist groups, freedom fighters.
What is hardly ever shown are the pictures of the women in these
countries who die as civilians, or those who are raped violently and
repeatedly as a strategy of modern warfare. Over the past century, wars
have shifted from battlefields to communities, and today it is
estimated that 90% of casualties are civilians, mostly women and
children. In terror, women often flee, trying to take their families to
a safer place, sometimes making themselves even more
vulnerable.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120911000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000032">Of the 42 million
refugees and internally displaced people today, 80% are women and
children. These stark figures do not reveal the suffering that lies
behind them. What happens to families when a mother is killed? What
about the heartbreak of leaving your home with nothing, to ensure your
family’s survival? This anguish was very much brought home to me
when I met Syrian refugees in Lebanon in May. Being the poorest in
these countries makes women especially vulnerable in conflict, not only
because they are less physically able to defend themselves but because
their cultural norms and status in society often put them at particular
risk. The destruction of services and infrastructure during conflict
means that there is no support to turn to, and it is not just by the
enemy that women will be attacked. When a conflict starts, levels of
domestic violence spiral out of
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120911000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000033">As
the noble Baroness has highlighted, women frequently become prime
targets. Too often today, rape is used as a weapon of war; raping a
woman in front of her family effectively disarms the men. UN special
representative Zainab Bangura describes it as “History’s
greatest silence”. Accurate data from conflict countries are
hard to obtain but the estimates are truly terrible: 50,000 women
systematically raped in the camps in Bosnia; around 400,000 women raped
in Rwanda; 400,000 women raped in the DRC in the years 2006 and 2007
alone; 500,000 women raped in Colombia. One could go on—Sudan,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Haiti, Nicaragua, Mexico, women being
gang-raped in Tahrir Square in Cairo, and it is happening right now in
Syria today. In spite of this, the conviction rates up to now have been
pitifully small: none after World War II, 29 in Bosnia, 11 in Rwanda
and six in Sierra Leone.</hs_para>

pay enormous tribute to the Foreign Secretary for his initiative to
prevent sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict countries, which
was launched in May 2012, and I am enormously proud to be on the
steering board. There has been outstanding progress, and I am sure we
will hear more on this from the Minister: 137 countries have

United Nations. In the words of the Foreign

the noble Baroness said, women are not a homogeneous group. No data
exist on the millions of widows and wives of the disappeared, who are
particularly vulnerable and may be targeted within their families and
the wider community. According to Widows for Peace through Democracy,
it is suggested that there are over 2 million widows in Iraq; more than
50% of all women in eastern Congo are widows, and there are 2.5 million
in Afghanistan, with around 80,000 in Kabul alone, often having to
resort to begging on the streets to support their families.</hs_para>

Michelle Bachelet, the former head of UN Women. Women are hit hardest
by war, yet it is an irony that they are excluded from national peace
talks and plans. Over the past 25 years, only one in 40 peace treaty
signatories have been women, and between 1990 and 2010 only 12 out of
585 peace accords referred to women’s needs in rehabilitation or

the different experiences of women and men threatens to erode
women’s rights and puts them at increased risk. For women,
violence continues after the fighting stops, when there will be many
armed men and usually fragile or non-existent transitional justice
systems. In post-conflict countries, a culture of normalised sexual
violence can continue. When I visited Liberia, we were told that girls
had to engage in “transactional” sex to survive, with
even the girls in the university having to exchange sex for
grades.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120911000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120911000037">There
has been little real progress on including women at the peace table in
spite of seven UN resolutions, starting with 1325 and ending with 2122,
to address this, through lack of global implementation. Over the past
few years, one only has to look at the way in which Afghan women have
been excluded from the London Conference, the Bonn II
Conference—where a woman from civil society was allowed to speak
for three minutes—and the Chicago NATO summit.</hs_para>

and lasting peace without considering and including women, who are half
the population, and it is certainly not peace for the women if domestic
and sexual violence is raging unabated and there are no institutions to
deal with this. Surely it is just as much a right for women to help to
decide the future of their country and that their diverse experiences
are integrated into all peacebuilding, peacemaking and reconstruction
processes. When that happens, peace is more likely to last. I
particularly ask the Minister to ensure that, where the UK is involved
in peace negotiations, women in civil society are
included.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_09_PT_1/0B9A8B36B96D629DE8BA79C4EC1D8618B11D02D9" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 December 2013">Monday,

conflict is a security, development and human rights challenge. It is

as a part of efforts to destabilise their communities. It is also
important to recognise that, as the excellent NGO, Womankind, points

in such conditions it is often the case that women suffer violence from

tragedy is that too often violence against women is tolerated,
justified and overlooked, and there is an unwillingness to acknowledge

of course, but if they are not translated into action, we will not see
real change for hundreds of thousands of women, men, girls and boys
whose life chances are so threatened by sexual and gender-based
violence. Furthermore, even with that solid framework of UN resolutions
already in place, we see that Mary Robinson is the first and only lead

occurs to me that as the number of resolutions increases, and while the
focus on protecting women from sexual violence is welcome, it seems
that little is being done to plan for more women’s participation
in decision-making. Resolution 2122, agreed in October, represents some
progress but there is still a long way to go. Surely it is time to
recognise that there is an urgent need to support women’s
efforts to address their own security needs, and that they should have
a central role in efforts to respond to conflict—and indeed to
help with the prevention of conflict.</hs_para>

sexual violence initiative, the priority has to be preventing violence
in the first place. Focusing simply on prosecution fails to acknowledge
the daunting barriers to justice that women face. Indeed, a World Bank
report found that apart from lack of education and a limited awareness
of their rights, the main reason that women do not seek help is the
perception that violence is normal and somehow justified, and that it
remains the case that women are too embarrassed and stigmatised to seek
redress. We identify the fact that there are grave problems with
impunity in conflict-affected states. This reinforces and reflects the
widespread social convention that serves to marginalise women. Is it
not time to shift the balance of shame from the survivors to the
perpetrators? Will the Minister confirm that the planned PSVI

Hussain (LD):</Member></B> I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Gould,
for raising this important issue. We often hear about violence and rape
against women from many parts of the world, and we all stand united in
condemning those acts. However, we very rarely discuss such issues
taking place in many countries that are more friendly to the United
Kingdom, such as India. Recently some cases in the capital and other
areas have been reported widely in the press, but the case of gang rape
in the Indian capital has remained the focus 
<?notus-xml column=130?>for almost all the print and electronic media in the country. This has
been followed by violent and angry protests at India Gate in the heart
of New Delhi<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:51:43"></hs_TimeCode>.
Not only the residents of Delhi but also the whole of India has
condemned these crimes.
Living<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:54:44"></hs_TimeCode> their own
life of peace, far from turbulent Kashmir, the young generation of the
city have rarely witnessed such protests, yet they arose in anger to
protest against this brutal incident. People all over India have
condemned the brutality of the crime and demanded a harsh punishment
for the culprits. Cries of justice for the victim have echoed in many
quarters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000012">However,
this has<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:54:44"></hs_TimeCode> also
exposed the duality of attitude of the majority of Indians. If an
incident of gang rape against a medical student on a moving bus in the
capital is a matter of grief and sorrow for India, provoking it to
demand justice, what about Kashmir, where many such cases of rape
against innocent girls involving forces have come to the fore? These
have been overlooked by the majority of Indians and the rest of the
world. Why has not the rest of India demanded justice for these girls?
The residents of Kashmir, which is claimed by India as an integral part
and is still considered the most militarised part of the world, where
the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act gives extraordinary powers to the
military forces and where protests against alleged human rights
violations take place on a daily basis, have cried themselves hoarse
demanding justice in a number of rape cases against innocent daughters
of the
state.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000013">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T16:54:44"></hs_TimeCode>
major rape case in the history of Kashmir and indeed the whole of India
is the Kunan Poshpora mass rape incident. On 23 February 1991, Kunan
Poshpora, a village in the Kupwara district of north Kashmir, witnessed
incidents of the alleged mass rape of 20 women by army
troops in one night. The incident drew the attention of national and
international media. However, this was soon forgotten and the womenfolk
of the village landed in unending troubles. Women who deserved the
respect and honour of society were not secure any more from the cruel
face of the armed forces. A number of other cases of rape and enforced
disappearances have come to the fore in the past three decades. Another
case that shook the region was the 2009 Shopian rape and murder case,
which resulted in protests that rocked the whole valley, with several
families losing their loved ones in the
agitation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000014">Shutdowns,
curfews and protests, unimaginable for Indians, are not new to
Kashmiris. Importantly, womenfolk have become the victims of sexual
abuse in the state. Several decades have passed but Kashmir is still
fighting to restore its internal peace by achieving justice for its
loved ones, who have been subjected to enforced disappearances, and its
womenfolk, who have been subjected to senseless violations of their
dignity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000015">The

Coussins (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity
to contribute to this debate, and will focus my remarks on Colombia and
Peru. I declare my interests as president of the Peru Support Group and
as a volunteer with VSO’s parliamentary volunteering programme
in Peru two years ago, where I worked with various NGOs concerned with
sexual violence and held meetings with members of the then new
Government, as well as the police, judiciary and British companies
operating in Peru. I am also associated with the ABColombia Group in
the UK and a few days ago chaired its conference on Women,
Conflict-Related Violence and the Peace Process in Colombia, which was

understand the social and cultural context of sexual violence in
conflict zones. Women face historical, ingrained attitudes of gender
discrimination and economic, social and political marginalisation, as
we have already heard. This creates a permissive context for violence
against women, which is exacerbated by conflict. We see this today in
Colombia, and it was a major issue in the Peruvian conflict between
1980 and 2000. Both conflicts have made widespread and systematic use
of women’s bodies as a weapon of war, particularly affecting
poor, indigenous and Afro-descendent women.</hs_para>

is almost total impunity for this type of violence. One survey covering
a nine-year period from 2000 estimated that nearly 13,000 women were
victims 
<?notus-xml column=132?>of conflict rape; more than 1,500 were forced into prostitution; and
there were more than 4,000 forced pregnancies and nearly 2,000 forced
abortions. Yet only 18% of Colombian women actually report this crime,
and there is very little hope of that improving, given the dangers that
they face, the social stigma and the involvement of the security
forces.</hs_para>

we know, UN Security Council Resolution 1325 states that
conflict-related sexual violence should be on the peace process agenda
from day one; yet it is still not on the Colombian agenda, despite
peace talks having started there in November 2012. In Peru, we have
also seen the systematic nature of sexual violence committed by both
state forces and Shining Path rebels during the internal conflict. The
perpetrators could have been tried for crimes against humanity, but
instead the judicial system has chosen to treat it as a common crime.
Although the Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that
military commanders were responsible for the majority of
conflict-related sexual violence, these crimes remain

of the 538 cases documented by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
has reached trial. The military refuses to release information that
could be used as evidence, while the police and judiciary are
inefficient and underresourced. Impunity for conflict crimes
contributes to the sustained high levels of violence against women
today. Most of the victims were members of marginalised indigenous
communities, indicating the links between violence, poverty and racial
discrimination. These same groups were also the main victims of a mass
programme of sterilisation without consent during the 1990s. As yet,

I, too, welcome the Government’s Preventing Sexual Violence

and  non-discriminatory health services seeks to end this wrong
against those victims. I am aware that the Government have made their
policy position clear on the provision of safe abortions, but will the
Minister make strong representations to those Governments that, as we
have heard, continue to make aid and support conditional, urging them
to adopt the same approach as

had an excellent debate recently in this Room in Grand Committee on
women in Afghanistan post-2014, initiated by the noble Baroness, Lady
Hodgson. The debate highlighted that over 4,000 incidents of violence
against women in just six months this year were documented by the
independent Afghan Human Rights Commission. I am aware of the
substantial funds allocated to development aid in Afghanistan by DfID,
but what training is being given to the Afghan army so that,
particularly post-2014, it sees protecting women from sexual and other
forms of violence as part of its role? What protection is being given

Bates (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I join all noble Lords in paying
tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, for securing this debate and
for the way in which she introduced it. I will preface my remarks by
making two points. The first is to pay tribute to her and other Members
who have spoken today, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock,
and my noble friend Lady Hodgson, for the tremendous work that they
have done in this field to bring light to a subject that has often been
swept under the carpet. The declaration, now on the international
agenda, that violence against women and girls is no longer acceptable
is surely something that we want to
hear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000036">Secondly,
contributions to the debate have been helpful in crystallising matters.
We heard the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, refer to Colombia and Latin
America and the noble Lord, Lord Hussain, talk  
<?notus-xml column=135?>about India and Kashmir. We heard my noble friend Lady Hodgson and the
noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock, talk about Africa and the Middle East.
The noble Lord, Lord Collins, spoke about Bosnia. This reminds us that
this is not something that is restricted to a particular place or
geography. It is endemic in warfare and needs to be tackled with the
utmost severity. In response, finally, to the noble Baroness, Lady
Kinnock, who understands well the briefings that one might receive
ahead of debates like this, I can say that there will be no
complacency. Of course we will seek to inform Members about what the
Government are doing, but in no way are we saying that it is enough: it
is simply the start of taking action in this important
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000037">The
Government have put women and girls at the heart of their international
development work. Our vision is set out in our strategy on delaying
first pregnancy, support for safe childbirth and preventing violence
against women and girls. We recognise that such violence is widespread,
highly prevalent and has devastating consequences. It has been hidden
and accepted for far too long. My right honourable friend the Secretary
of State for International Development has made it clear that tackling
violence against women and girls is a central part of the UK’s
development policy. My honourable friend Lynne Featherstone continues
her active efforts to be a champion for combating violence against
women. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, as a number of
noble Lords and noble Baronesses have mentioned, has made prevention of
sexual violence in conflict-affected countries a
priority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000038">Violence
affects about one-third of women and girls in the course of their
lifetime. Preventing violence against women is a development goal in
its own right and is a key to achieving other development outcomes,
including educational attainment, maternal health and economic
activity. The impact of violence and rape does so much to erode and
destroy those in the human lives concerned. Evidence shows that in
emergency situations, including times of conflict, the risk of violence
to women and girls is exacerbated. Existing social structures and
networks that can protect women are often weakened or destroyed.
Inadequate facilities and limited resources reduce women’s
options and increase the risk of economic and sexual exploitation. The
violence perpetrated is not always sexual violence—evidence
shows that in times of conflict, the incidence of domestic violence
also increases. The use of sexual violence against women and girls in
wartime is well documented. It is used for many reasons: to inflict
injury, to degrade, to intimidate and to force a population to flee.
Estimates of the scale of violence against women and girls during
conflicts in the 1990s demonstrate large-scale targeted abuses, which
have been placed on record here this
afternoon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000039">The
consequences of violence against women and girls in conflict situations
are stark. Sexual violence causes physical and psychological damage to
thousands of women and girls, and in the worst cases results in the
loss of life. Some survivors will be faced with an unwanted pregnancy,
and the choices they face are often limited and harsh. They risk death
from an  
<?notus-xml column=136?>unsafe abortion or face social exclusion and destitution. Every year,
47,000 women and girls die as a result of unsafe abortions and millions
more are permanently injured. Improving access to safe abortion is
challenging, and I am proud that the UK is one of only a handful of
donors willing to take on the challenge. Given the scale of the
problem, it is important that the international community works to
ensure that the needs of women and girls are prioritised and that
action is taken to protect and support women and girls affected by
violence in conflict zones.</hs_para>

reassure noble Lords that the Government have been leading the
international community in addressing the challenges of violence
against women and girls in conflict situations. Just last month, my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International
Development hosted Keep Her Safe, a high-level event attended by senior
representatives from the Government, the UN, NGOs and civil society.
The point has been made from across the humanitarian system, and that
will continue in future meetings. They agreed a fundamental new
approach to protecting girls and women in emergency situations. They
recognised the need for comprehensive services for sexual reproductive
health, psychological health and mental health for women and girls
affected by crisis. The event secured £40 million in pledges
from the international community to support this work in emergencies.
We will track the progress of these commitments, working very closely
with the US, which takes the lead on this initiative in
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000041">In
another major step, the Foreign Secretary launched the preventing
sexual violence initiative in May 2012. It aims to address the culture
of impunity by increasing the number of perpetrators brought to justice
both internationally and nationally, strengthening international
efforts and co-operation, and supporting states to build their national
capacity to deliver justice and services. In April this year, G8
Foreign Ministers adopted a historic declaration on preventing sexual
violence which committed countries to use all
measures—political, practical and legal—to ensure that
there are no safe havens for the perpetrators of sexual violence in
conflict. Last week, the Foreign Secretary announced that he would
co-chair an international summit in the UK which would aim to take
further the commitments already made.</hs_para>

I will address as many of the questions raised as possible. The noble
Baroness, Lady Gould, asked what actions were being taken following the
UNGA ministerial meeting in 2013, when the Foreign Secretary launched
the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. I
will refer to some specific elements. The first is eroding impunity, to
which the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, referred. The 137 endorsing
countries have agreed that no peace agreements should give amnesty to
people who have ordered or carried out rape. The second is protecting
civilians. Every UN peacekeeping mission should now automatically
include provisions for the protection of civilians from sexual violence
in conflict. The third is eradicating safe havens for the perpetrators
of sexual violence in armed conflict. Suspects wanted for war-zone rape
can now be arrested in any of the  
<?notus-xml column=137?>countries that have signed up—a number that is growing. We need
to see an increase in the number of prosecutions, something referred to
by my noble friend Lady Hodgson and the noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock.
Only that will really underscore the determination of the international
community to stamp out this wicked and heinous
crime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000043">A new
international protocol will be launched next year which will improve
global standards for documenting and investigating conflict-zone sexual
violence and improve accountability. There will be new global efforts
to ensure support and justice for survivors of rape. A number of

victims and the need to ensure that that is squarely put on the
shoulders of the
perpetrators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000044">The

G8 and UN General Assembly declarations on the subject. One additional
element is that we will not hesitate to arrest and transfer

that this is something that the Government take with the utmost
seriousness. We believe that progress is being made on it in the
international community. We acknowledge that it has been referred to as
“history’s greatest silence”. Along with the

Knight of Weymouth (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this debate follows
the decision by Natural England at the end of last month to prematurely
halt the extended licence to cull badgers in Gloucestershire. I believe
that this decision indicates that the overwhelming view of the
independent scientists on badger culls was correct: that a cull is
costly and impractical and that continuing for the remaining years of
the licensed cull risks exacerbating the serious problem of TB in
cattle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000049">The
problem has been growing over recent decades. I live in the south-west
of England, where dairy farmers have been particularly badly hit. It
has cost the taxpayer as much as £0.5 billion over the past
decade in testing, compensation and research, with further sums borne
by the agricultural industry. It therefore follows that urgent action
must be taken. There is a logic in thinking that killing badgers should
be a part of that. Badgers are undoubtedly involved in transmitting TB
to cattle and it therefore seems obvious that fewer diseased badgers
will lead to less disease in cattle. However, infection is also passed
from cattle to cattle, from cattle to badgers and between badgers. The
Government are therefore right to pursue other measures as part of
their eradication plan for bovine TB, such as pre- and post-movement
testing for
cattle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000050">However,
in continuing with culling, the Government ignore the most important
part of the science: that the social behaviour of badgers produces a
much more unpredictable effect due to the effects of perturbation. I am
very happy to stand corrected by the real experts in this
debate—the noble Lords, Lord Krebs and Lord Trees—but in
layman’s terms, perturbation is brought about by the territorial
behaviour of badgers. A group of badgers will stick to a territory
around a sett if they detect other badgers at their boundary but will
extend their range in the absence of other
badgers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000051">The
randomised badger culling trials carried out by the previous
Government, devised by the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, who I am delighted
to see in his place, had clear and undisputed findings. First,
localised small-scale culling of badgers in the RBCT increased bovine
TB. Secondly, 100 square-kilometre areas receiving widespread culling
had lower cattle TB rates than those with no culling. The benefits took
several years to emerge but persisted four years after culling ended.
Thirdly, land adjoining the widespread culling areas experienced rapid
increases in cattle TB. These detrimental effects faded over time but
never turned into benefits. The trials, as with the current pilot
culls, tried to reduce these effects using natural impermeable
boundaries such as rivers.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=139?><hs_para UID="13120920000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000052">These findings informed
the current government policy. The licensing criteria are intended to
produce large-scale, long-term, rapid and efficient culls, as the
trials agreed that small-scale, short-term, slow and inefficient culls
will increase cattle TB. By extrapolating the RBCT effects to a 150
square-kilometre circle, it followed that Government-led cage-trapping
of badgers could reduce local cattle TB over a nine-year period by 12%
to 16% below what it would have been with no culling. However, because
background TB levels are rising, this 12% to 16% relative reduction
over nine years actually represents a slowing of the rate of increase
of cattle TB, not an absolute fall. On average, farmers would probably
experience as much TB as they do today, or more. Farmers on adjoining
land would almost certainly experience increased TB risks. To get this
limited impact, the licence required 80% confidence of culling 70% of
the badger population in the area.</hs_para>

these criteria entails substantial challenges, both for government and
for farmers and, as a result, beneficial effects on cattle TB cannot be
guaranteed. For example, licensees will be required to cull a minimum
number of badgers (to avoid net increases in cattle TB) without
exceeding a maximum number (to avoid causing local extinction, which
would breach the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European
Wildlife and Natural Habitats). Setting such minimum and maximum

do we now know about how the pilots have gone? In Somerset, 65% of the
estimated population of badgers was culled in the pilot area. In
Gloucestershire, it was just 39%. Based on the science that the
Government used to design these pilots, this means that the cull was
not sufficiently effective to reduce cattle TB, and in Gloucestershire
is likely to have caused more harm than good. Will the Minister
therefore tell us when we will get any statement on the record from the
Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Defra’s chief
scientist and the Chief Veterinary Officer, and their analysis of
whether the pilot culls have increased or decreased the incidence of
bovine TB in Gloucestershire, Somerset and neighbouring

take this opportunity to explain one other curiosity? The licensing is
for trapping and shooting and for free shooting. The data show a sudden
increase in the more expensive trapping and shooting halfway through
the initial six-week pilot. The extension was stopped at the same time
as the cage-shooting season ended, with three more weeks to run for
free shooting. This suggests that those carrying out the cull voted
with their feet and abandoned free shooting. Is this true? Do the
Government expect free shooting to be widespread if they push ahead
with a cull over the next few years? Will he publish a new cost-benefit
analysis
accordingly?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000058">It
looks like an effective farmer-led cull is very difficult, due to
weather and protesters, as scientists predicted, and due to badgers
moving the goal posts, which no one predicted. If an ineffective cull
is what we have ended up with, it will make matters worse, so what
should we do? The answer appears to be vaccination of badgers. Thanks
to FERA trials on the safety of an injected vaccine, we know that it
reduces the transmission of the disease among badgers. We do not yet
know the effect on cattle, but we could, through the evaluation of
vaccination
pilots.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000059">The
case for piloting vaccination is profound. It plays to the perturbation
effect, not against it. Vaccinating an area reduces disease in the
badger population in that area while keeping badgers alive. Those
badgers then keep out other potentially diseased badgers, thus creating
an area where the situation is improving, which also blocks further
spread of the disease in
badgers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000060">There
are normally three broad arguments against badger vaccination. The
first is cost. This objection is because it needs cage-trapping. Given
that that is what culling now seems to favour, that element is
cost-neutral. Unlike culling, there is negligible policing cost. The
pilot culls have cost considerably more to police in Gloucestershire
than expected, for example. The remaining element is the cost of the
vaccine, offset against the cost of disposing of badger corpses. It is
also clear from voluntary vaccination programmes that there is
considerable public support. Many come forward to volunteer and some
are funding
vaccination.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000061">Secondly,
people say that we cannot wait for a vaccine to take effect; that it is
too slow, with no effect on animals already infected. To that I say:
ask the scientists. The annual mortality of badgers is 25% to 35%.
Hence, vaccination would work pretty quickly compared to the cull
impact of 16% over nine
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000062">The
final argument is that vaccination does not remove infected badgers.
The evidence is that, with culling, the reduction in infected badgers
is much slower than the overall reduction in the badger population due
to perturbation. We know that culling will not reduce the overall level
of infection because the overall level of reduction is offset by
background levels of rising TB. However, vaccination would at least
reduce transmission between badgers without the increase in
transmission created by the perturbation effect induced by
culling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000063">To
summarise, I am assuming that we mean vaccination by injection; I think
there are issues attached to oral vaccine that have to be addressed.
There is long-term 
<?notus-xml column=141?>potential attached to a cattle vaccine, but that is more complex and not
something that we can proceed with as quickly as we need to. The
Government should look closely at the pilots that they have carried out
and then be led by science. This will tell them that culling is
impractical, due to perturbation. It may have worked against non-native
invasive possums in New Zealand with very different social behaviour,
or in Ireland, where much lower badger density leads to much less of a
perturbation effect. But the evidence from England is great and
consistently shows that it does not work. The efforts and resources
spent on culling badgers should be replaced by a vaccination pilot. I
look forward to other contributions and to the Minister’s
response.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_09_PT_1/F3467ED670EBD2D6605BB24D7C6DBCE9292AC6DD" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 December 2013">Monday,

Parminter (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend for
introducing this debate and his speedy overview of the issue. I also
welcome the Government’s commitment to eradicate this terrible
disease and its impact on our wildlife, our farmed animals and our
farming community. I want to focus on the cull pilots, which were
introduced nearly two years ago to the day. They were set up to test
three things: first, the effectiveness of removing the target
percentage of badgers; secondly, the safety of culling by free
shooting; and thirdly, the humaneness. Let us remind ourselves that
free shooting has not been trialled anywhere else in the world for
badgers, and therefore I understand the decision by the Government at
that time to introduce those
pilots<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:46:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:46:55"></hs_TimeCode>—although
even before we had the changes in the pilots, with the introduction of
cage-trapping and the extension periods to both, I certainly had some
sympathy with the view that the boundaries of the pilots were beyond
the parameters of the randomised badger culling trials and therefore
could not be used as a gauge for the likely outcome of the pilots in
analysing the impact of reducing the incidence of TB in
cattle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:47:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000065">Given
the evidence that we have had of those pilots, it is hard to conclude

the period of the two pilots, both of the cull periods were extended:
in Somerset, from 42 to 63 days and in Gloucestershire, from
42 to 93 days, with a week intervening in between. Cage trapping has
been introduced to supplement free shooting and of course the initial
number of badgers has been revised and brought down by the Government.
Even with those changes, though, it was still impossible for the cull
to reach that 70% of the population that the cull licence required it
to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:48:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000067">It
has clearly been the right decision for the Government to set up an
independent panel to assess the outcome of the two pilots, particularly
in the light of their commitment to support evidence-led policy. We all
therefore eagerly await the outcome of the IEP. In advance of that,
however, I have three questions for the Minister. First, what is the
expected time for the delivery of the report from the independent
expert 
<?notus-xml column=142?>panel, given the extension to the pilots and any impact that that might
have on the subsequent decision by the Secretary of State about whether
to roll out culling in up to 10 further
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:49:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000068">Secondly,
it is critical that we have confidence that the assessment of the
humanity of these pilots has been done on the basis of the badgers that
were killed by free shooting as opposed to those killed by
cage-trapping. Will the Minister therefore confirm that there will be
full disclosure of how the data were collected and assessed at the time
of release, so that we can be assured of the methods used to kill the
badgers?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000069">Thirdly,
given that the costs of cage-trapping are significantly higher than
those for free shooting, and that the duration of the cull has
increased the costs for policing, does the Minister now accept that a
new impact assessment is necessary prior to the Secretary of State
deciding whether or not to allow the rollout of these culls, so that we
know what the net cost/benefit is, both to the taxpayer and the farming
community?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000070">The
Government have made it clear that they will not do nothing on this
important issue, and I applaud them for that. As we await the reports
from the IEP, and as the future of licensed shooting is in doubt, I
urge the Government to redouble their support for the vaccination
programme and to set up a high-level working group to take leadership
on this issue and bring together the key players of the NFU, the
Wildlife Trusts and the National Trust in order to give best-practice
guidance to those in the farming community and landowners who want to
take forward voluntary vaccination as a means to tackle this appalling
disease.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_09_PT_1/CCEF3A1EEBFFD5A421EED59B2FF04D35F7DB13AE" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 December 2013">Monday,

Krebs (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Knight of Weymouth, for bringing forward this debate. As noble Lords
will be aware, I have an interest in this topic, having been involved
in the debate about badgers and TB in cattle since my 1997 report on
the subject, which led to the establishment of the randomised badger

noble Lord, Lord Knight, said, the randomised badger culling trials
showed that large-scale, persistent culling of badgers—removing
a large proportion of the population—had a modest effect in
reducing TB in cattle. The best estimate, which is only a rough
guide—confirmed recently by Professor Charles Godfray and 10 top
expert scientists in a paper published in the <I>Proceedings of the
Royal Society</I>—is that the reduction expected after nine
years could be 16%. Of course, as the noble Lord, Lord Knight, said,
the evidence from the randomised badger culling trial was that it made
things worse in the early years, and worse for farmers around the edges
of the cull
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000073">Nevertheless,
the Government decided to go ahead with pilot culls in Gloucestershire
and Somerset. It is worth reminding ourselves of the purpose of the
pilot culls. As the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, said, it was not to
test whether killing badgers controls TB in cattle but to test whether
or not it is possible to kill enough badgers by free shooting, as
opposed to cage-trapping, and to kill them humanely and safely.
This was

now know that the pilots have been a complete fiasco. As has been said,
there was confusion about the number of badgers in each area, as well
as the target proportion to be shot, and the farmers completely failed
to meet the target numbers in the allotted time period. Back in October
2012, just before the pilot was due to start, the number of badgers
estimated to be in each area went up by a massive 400%. In October
2013, during the cull, the number shot down by
35%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000077">We know
that the Secretary of State accused the badgers of moving the goal
posts, but there is another possible interpretation: it might just be
that Defra did not have a clue about how many badgers there were in
those areas. As has been said, the target of the pilot was to remove
more than 70% of the badgers but less than 100%. The 70% target was set
because in the randomised badger culling trials this was the proportion
that had to be removed to achieve the modest positive benefit to
farmers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120920000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000078">Part
of the way through the pilots, when it was clear that the target of 70%
would be missed, it was magically changed to 53%. Those badgers seem to
have moved the goal posts again. Could the Minister please explain to
us why the target was changed part of the way through the pilots, and
on what scientific basis? Furthermore, why was the maximum proportion
to be killed in Gloucestershire lowered from 90% at the start of the
pilot to 70% part of the way through? Does the Minister agree that this
change means that any farmer who was efficient enough to meet the
initial target would have ended up breaking the law by the end of the
pilot?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120920000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000079">I was
quoted some months ago in the press as saying that the pilot cull was a
“crazy scheme”. It seems to have got even crazier.
However—now I come to my key point—as the noble Baroness,
Lady Parminter, said, Defra has established an independent expert
panel, chaired by Professor Ranald Munro, which will advise it on the
effectiveness, humaneness and safety of controlled shooting. I
understand that the panel is due to report very soon. If it concludes
that controlled shooting is not effective or humane, will Defra
abandon  
<?notus-xml column=144?>its plans to roll out further controlled shooting?
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T17:56:36"></hs_TimeCode> have one
further question, which has already been alluded to by the noble Lord,
Lord Knight, and the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter: in the light of

could seek answers to many more puzzling questions about Defra’s
plans for shooting badgers to control TB in cattle, but I would be very
pleased if the Minister would give direct answers to the questions that
I have already posed: what is the purpose of the pilots; why was the
70% target changed; will Defra follow the advice of its independent

of its experience of the

concluding, I emphasise that the focus on killing badgers is misplaced.
We all agree that TB is a dreadful problem for farmers, particularly in
the south-west, and that something has to be done to bring it under
control. However, there is no point in doing something if it is the
wrong thing. The sad fact is that there are more effective and cheaper
ways of controlling TB in cattle. We have already heard from the noble
Lord, Lord Knight, and the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, about the
idea of vaccination. However, in the short term, before vaccines became
effective, putting in place rigorous measures to prevent transmission
of the disease between badgers and cattle, and among cattle, would be a
more effective policy in achieving a 60% reduction than trying to kill
badgers. If Defra were to turn its attention to this solution, farmers,
scientists and conservationists would all be relieved, and badgers
would be able to take a rest from their task of moving the goal
posts.</hs_para>

Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire have never had TB.
There may be a clue in trying to understand why those 25% have never
had TB. Surely that could give us an indication of what those farms are
doing differently that helps to prevent their cattle from getting the
disease. That would be a more fruitful approach than the pointless
exercise of trying to kill
badgers.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_09_PT_1/15F04AE261104A203259B538D1BCA080013D53B0" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 December 2013">Monday,

Trees (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Knight, for bringing this subject forward for debate. I want to try to
look at the problem rather holistically, which is a challenge in under
10 minutes, but I will try. Let us be under no illusions: bovine
tuberculosis is a major threat to the health of domestic animals and
wildlife in Britain today. This is a disease that was almost eradicated
from Britain 40 to 50 years ago by means, directed at cattle, that were
essentially the same as those we use now—TB testing of cattle
and the removal of reactors, although a good many other measures have
been put in place that mean that the controls on cattle are even
tighter than they were then. A key factor that has changed in the past
few decades is the emergence of badgers as a major wildlife reservoir
of this infection. There is epidemiological evidence that something
like 50% of outbreaks in cattle are related to badger
infections.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=145?><hs_para UID="13120920000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000084">We are faced now with a
problem of infection in badgers and in cattle on a substantial and
increasing scale. If I could show the Committee maps of the spread of
the infection, noble Lords would see that there has been a relentless
spread in the geographical distribution of bovine infection from the
original hotspot in the south-west of England, when it was nearly
eradicated, to the current situation where bovine TB is threatening the
dense cattle populations of Cheshire and
Lancashire.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000085">Although
there is an understandable focus on the adverse impact on cattle and
badger health and welfare, we should not forget that there is another
victim of this disease—the cattle farmer who suffers huge stress
and distress every time their herd is tested and animals are removed
from the herds that they have built up over many years. We do not
concern ourselves enough with the human toll that this disease is
having. It is a fact that the suicide rate in farmers is the highest of
any professional group. Although one certainly cannot claim that this
is all due to TB, the fact is that an already vulnerable group of
people is being subjected to excessive anxiety and uncertainty. That is
the situation that we are facing. When the average city dweller pours
their milk over their cornflakes each morning, they may not understand
the hard work, worry and commitment that go into producing that daily
milk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000086">What are
the options to deal with this disease? Ideally, an effective vaccine
for cattle is the solution but for various reasons, which have been
made clear most recently by a letter from the EU Commissioner Tonio
Borg, it is likely to be some 10 years before a vaccine is accepted and
licensed in the EU to be deployed in the UK.
Experience<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:02:29"></hs_TimeCode> shows
that in the absence of a vaccine for the target domestic
species—in this case, cattle—and where there is a
wildlife reservoir of infection, control measures need to address the
wildlife reservoir as well as the domestic animal. In the case of
bovine TB, there is a wildlife host, the badger, that is present in
very high numbers—10 to 15 setts on a farm is not
unusual—is in close direct and indirect contact with cattle on
grazing areas, in forage crops such as maize and indeed in farm
buildings, has no natural predators and is excreting substantial
amounts of Mycobacterium bovis into the environment. In this situation,
and in the absence of a cattle vaccine, measures directed at the
wildlife host, as noble Lords who spoke earlier accepted, are essential
as well as stringent measures directed towards
cattle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000087">What
are the options vis-à-vis badgers? As your Lordships are aware
and as has been mentioned, a vaccine for badgers is licensed for use by
injection. It has various limitations, including the fact that a high
coverage of the population is necessary to reduce infection and
transmission. Something over 40% has been suggested, which is feasible
but difficult in a wild animal population compared with a controlled
domestic animal population. Animals that are already infected will not
be stopped by vaccination from excreting bacteria, and susceptible
young animals are constantly being born into the population. Moreover,
the animals have to be cage-trapped and restrained to allow
injection—itself a stressful procedure for a wild animal. This
is one rational approach, and it was advocated by 
<?notus-xml column=146?>noble Lords who spoke earlier, but it has to be said that the effect on
bovine TB incidence is unproven. It is also a very costly measure, as
things stand. The current vaccination trial in Wales, which has
completed two years, shows that it costs more than £600 to
vaccinate each badger. With a population of probably 250,000 to 300,000
badgers in Britain, you need only do the mathematics to determine the
cost of vaccinating at least even a proportion of that
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000088">Still,
if interested parties could work together effectively and economically
to deliver a vaccine, that would be hugely helpful and doubtless the
cost could be reduced. It would require a co-ordinated approach by many
different groups, including those working in conservation. In that
context, the Welsh Government have offered grant support to private
groups to subsidise the cost of vaccination by 50%, and certain
conservation groups are seriously considering that option. It is
regrettable, however, that so far neither the RSPCA nor the Badger
Trust has taken up the invitation to commit funds to achieve badger
vaccination<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-09T18:05:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000089"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Duke of Montrose" PimsId="1961" UID="13120920000145" xid="1166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000145">The

dynamics of infectious disease in general show that reducing the
density of the population will reduce infection transmission. This does
not require the complete elimination of a population—far from
it. However, if the population density is lowered so that the rate at
which a primary infection creates secondary infections falls below 1,
the so- called parameter R<Sub>0</Sub>—the reproductive
rate—the infection will subside. We know that in a number of
areas the R<Sub>0</Sub> for bovine TB is only fractionally greater than
1; in fact, estimates range between 1 and 1.2. Reducing that to less
than 1 may be achievable with modest reductions in the badger
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000092">The
use of contraception is a possibility to reduce badger-population
density and would be a humane way of doing so, but research is at an
early stage. I am told that it will be some years before we might have
a deployable contraceptive method. As well as contributing to the
control of bovine TB, a reduction in the badger population would
benefit other species that appear to be adversely affected by predation
by badgers, such as hedgehogs, ground-nesting birds and some rare
species of
bumblebee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000093">That
brings me to culling. This has been used to reduce many wild animal
populations, including badgers, in various circumstances. We currently
cull deer, foxes, grey squirrels, seals, magpies and rodents, among
others. No one likes killing animals—I certainly do
not—but the majority of us accept that culling animals in
certain circumstances is justified, provided always that it is done
humanely. Members of this House are complicit in the extermination of
rodents within these very walls.</hs_para>

badgers can be done humanely and with a sound scientific basis, ruling
it out at this stage as one of the tools in the control of bovine TB is
premature. As the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, has said, we need to
see the report of the independent expert panel on the current trials to
evaluate their humaneness and safety, and to understand why the culling
rate was less than intended and what factors were responsible for it.
As the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, mentioned, a key meeting of experts in
2011 accepted that a reduction in TB incidence of around 16% could be
achieved by culling badgers under certain circumstances, and that
included allowing for the perturbation effect. One may think that 16%
may not sound a huge amount, but if the infection rates from badger to
badger, badgers to cattle and cattle to cattle can be reduced by just a
relatively small amount so that the infection parameter R<Sub>0</Sub>
can be tipped below 1, the disease will be driven to extinction, which
is a goal that we all
seek.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_09_PT_1/A32C0E48F4C99CFF7D66FC9C02C2C9B15F95D3E9" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 December 2013">Monday,

King of Bridgwater (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to have
the opportunity to follow the noble Lord, Lord Trees, and what I
thought was the most interesting contribution to this debate so far,
with great respect to other noble Lords who have spoken. The fact that
the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, published his report 16 years ago and now
stands up and says that actually 75% of the farms in the south-west of
England have got problems with TB indicates something that the noble
Lord, Lord Trees, brought out so
clearly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000096">I
declare an interest as a minority partner in a small farm which has
been affected, where we have had to face the problems of very
inadequate science. The tests produce false positives or false
negatives, and perfectly good cattle have gone for slaughter, having
given the impression that they had TB when they did not. This is a
closed herd and I am in absolutely no doubt that the TB comes from the
badgers and that the badgers have led to the increase in the problems
with TB. Only on Thursday our neighbour had a reactor and that is a
frequent event. The noble Lord, Lord Trees, brought out well the
appalling pressure that is on so many farming communities and the
number of people who are going out of dairy, some for economic reasons,
but others because the problems of TB are so great for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000097">I
declare another interest, because the first culling area is in my old
constituency of Bridgwater and West Somerset. I recall that it was not
so bad in west Somerset for a time and then there was an exercise in
Devon, which had a particular problem with TB. There was trapping of
badgers and testing them for TB, and some very misguided animal rights
activists got hold of the trapped badgers and transported them to west
Somerset and released them there. I am in no doubt that that
significantly contributed to the serious aggravation that they now
face.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000098">The
other thing is that there is certainly no shortage of badgers. The
problem that my noble friend the Minister has to face is how well we
can actually count the badger population, but there is absolutely no
doubt in my own observation of the number of setts, 
<?notus-xml column=148?>that there has been a significant explosion. I have to say, as the
Minister who took through the Wildlife and Countryside Act back in the
early 1980s, that when one sees how the populations of animals that
have no natural predator and which are protected have exploded, to the
detriment of a lot of other wildlife species, it is necessary to find
some way of controlling numbers in these
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000099">There
is one point about vaccination that did not come out. I was
told—I do not know if this is right—that there has to be
annual vaccination. If true, that just adds to the extraordinary
difficulties. The noble Lord, Lord Knight, suggested that the solution
was vaccination. I think he will concede, having listened to the noble
Lord, Lord Trees, and the comments he made from his own professional
background, that the idea that vaccination is the solution to the
problem seems highly unlikely. Obviously we await the findings of this
report with great interest—I as much as anybody, because of west
Somerset.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000100">If I
might dare to presume to advise my noble friend who will be answering
this debate, I would suggest that he does not answer any of the
questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, at this stage. He should
give no guarantees or undertakings from the ministerial Bench at this
stage, when he has not even seen the report and what possibilities and
qualifications there may be in it. It would be much fairer not to
answer those questions at this stage, but to say that the report will
be looked at absolutely objectively, that it is a very important report
and everybody will need to study it. He should not be asked
pre-emptively for assurances of one sort and another in advance. I hope
the noble Lord does not think that that is an aggressive
remark—I understand his concern—but that seems to me to
be the fair answer for the Minister to
give.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120920000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120920000101">This is
an issue from which nobody can take any pleasure. There are a lot of
people around the country listening to discussion of these issues who
are desperate. There has, so far, been no successful progress on

Krebs (CB):</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord, Lord King, for those

panel finds that these conditions have not been met and that free
shooting is not effective and not humane, will Defra continue with the
policy? It is not a matter of prejudging the outcome of the
panel’s results but of asking a conditional question. If the
answer is, “We would go ahead even if the panel says that free

to know. It is surely something that Defra must have thought about

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (Lord De Mauley) (Con):</Member></B>
My Lords, we must not underestimate the scale of the
devastation wrought on our farming industry and rural communities by
the worsening bovine tuberculosis epidemic; I think most noble Lords
who have spoken today have acknowledged that. It is unacceptable that
in the 10 years to 31 December 2012, more than 305,000 cattle were
compulsorily slaughtered as reactors or direct contacts in Great
Britain. Moreover, a further 22,512 cattle have been slaughtered up to
August this year solely because of bovine TB. As the noble Lord, Lord
Knight, said, over the past 10 years the disease alone has cost the
taxpayer more than £500 million. It is estimated that it will
cost another £1 billion in the next decade unless we can use all
the available tools to intensify the action that needs to be
taken.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120938000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000002">In the
face of such a grave problem, difficult decisions must be made. There
is no single solution—no silver bullet—so we must use
every possible means at our disposal. As the noble Lord, Lord Krebs,
said, strict controls on cattle movement must be applied, loopholes
closed and measures tightened, a point I will come back to later.
However, that alone will not reverse the inexorable spread of this
devastating disease. The wildlife reservoir in the high-risk areas
cannot be ignored, and it needs addressing urgently. That is why the
Government have developed an ambitious and comprehensive strategy for
combating the disease, with the aim of achieving bTB-free status for
England within 25 years while maintaining a sustainable livestock
industry. I thank my noble friend Lady Parminter for her comments on
our intention to eradicate the
disease.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120938000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000003">The
strategy emphasises that robust cattle controls must be combined with
tackling the reservoir of disease in badgers, drawing on demonstrably
successful approaches from around the world. It includes a
comprehensive set of controls focused on the different disease risks in
different areas of the country. The strategy also covers the
development of new tools to control bTB such as diagnostic tests,
alternative badger controls and, indeed, vaccination. Tackling the
reservoir of disease in badgers is a key element of the strategy and we
are committed to making it work. In this matter we must be guided by
the experience of other countries which have successfully rid
themselves of this terrible disease.</hs_para>

from the randomised badger culling trial on the role of badgers in the
spread of the disease in endemic areas. Work by Professor Christl
Donnelly, to which the noble Lord, Lord Trees, referred, suggests that
up to half of all cattle herds found to have TB in the high-risk area
of England contracted the disease directly or indirectly from infected
badgers. The evidence also shows that, carried out in the right way,
badger culling will make a significant difference 
<?notus-xml column=150?>in reducing the incidence of TB in cattle. Other countries, such as the
Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, have
eradicated or greatly reduced the levels of bTB by culling infected
wildlife in combination with tight cattle
controls.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120938000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000005">The
results of the RBCT have been used to estimate that culling over an
area of 150 square kilometres could reduce new herd incidence of bTB by
an average of 16% over nine years: enough to stop the incidence of bTB
continuing to increase and even begin decreasing it. We proceeded with
pilots this summer to test the assumption that controlled shooting is a
safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers. These
four-year pilots are closely managed and monitored by the licensing
authority, Natural England. The independent panel of experts is now
considering the information collected during the pilots. Its report to
the Government in the New Year—to answer my noble friend Lady
Parminter—will inform the decision on the wider rollout of
badger control in those parts of England most severely affected by this
disease. The report will be made available to Parliament and the
general public. We have always been clear that these were pilots from
which we will learn lessons in advance of taking any decisions. We
expect to be in a position to take such a decision by the end of
February.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120938000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000006">Turning
to questions raised by noble Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Knight, asked
why the cull had been cut short in Gloucestershire. The decision that
the licence for the extension should end was taken following
discussions between the cull company in west Gloucestershire, Natural
England and the NFU. The end of the cage-trapping season was agreed by
the cull company and Natural England as a sensible point to stop
activity. The decision was based on the decreasing number of badgers
seen by contractors over the preceding weeks, which made achieving a
further significant reduction in future weeks unlikely. Given that this
was the first year of controlled shooting of badgers, it was uncertain
how the winter would affect badger behaviour, but it was deemed likely
that even fewer badgers would be seen due to the onset of cold weather,
when they tend to stay underground for longer.</hs_para>

Knight and Lord Krebs, referred to perturbation. The RBCTs concluded
that larger areas would offer greater benefits. The Gloucestershire
area is 311 square kilometres and the Somerset one is 256 square
kilometres. These are very substantially larger than those in the
RBCTs. In the pilot culls, we were able to emphasise hard boundaries
around the cull areas: sea, significant rivers and dual carriageways,
each of which produces a significant challenge for badgers to cross. We
are also conducting biosecurity measures, including vaccination, in the
buffer zone around the cull areas. These are some of the lessons of the
RBCTs on which we have been able to capitalise.</hs_para>

Knight and Lord Krebs, and my noble friend Lord King referred to
population estimates in the context of a prospective rollout of culling
in future years. Estimating badger populations is difficult, as is the
case for all wildlife populations. However, the fact that it is
difficult does not mean that we should avoid tackling disease in
wildlife. When 
<?notus-xml column=151?>looking at lessons learnt in the pilots, we will look at how the
efficacy of culling could be best assessed in future. In the RBCTs, as
many badgers were removed as possible rather than having a fixed
target. This approach, repeated each year for a number of years,
resulted in an estimated 70% removal rate. This was not based on an
estimate of the badger population in the area; instead, an estimate of
the reduction of the badger population was made based on field signs
and road kill over four years.</hs_para>

Knight, said that in Gloucestershire, the proportion of badgers killed
was not more than 40%. It is worth saying that the most effective culls
during the RBCTs had removal rates of between 64% and 76%, with an
average of 70%. However, three areas had initial culls of lower
effectiveness, with removal rates of below 40%. Those areas with low
reductions caught up in subsequent years so that the reduction in
population at the end of culling was comparable to those areas with
good initial culls.</hs_para>

Knight, asked about the advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer. That
advice was that a further increase in the number of badgers culled over
the initial six-week period would improve the disease-control benefits
achieved even further and enable them to accrue earlier. It was his
view that a further significant reduction of the badger population in
the first year would increase the likelihood of disease benefits in
cattle over the full four years of the cull. A copy of his advice to
the Secretary of State on the case for extending the culls
in both Somerset and Gloucestershire was made public on 18
October.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120938000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000011">The
noble Lord, Lord Knight, asked about costs. The costs of the pilots
must be put in the overall context of tackling the disease. Each TB
outbreak costs an average of £34,000 and if left unchecked the
disease will cost the taxpayer, as I said earlier, approximately
£1 billion over the next 10 years. We must start tackling TB in
wildlife to bring the disease under control and begin reducing the bill
to taxpayers. We will know more about the costs of the pilots once the
final figures have been disclosed and
scrutinised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120938000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000012">The
costs of the police efforts in Gloucestershire, for example, are likely
to have been higher than expected. However, the uncertainty around
costs provided an additional reason for the decision to proceed
cautiously with two pilots before considering wider roll-out, where
many of the current costs will not apply. The pilots will enable us to
test our and the farming industry’s cost assumptions for areas
where there is uncertainty, such as policing, and take these into
account in a decision to roll out the policy more widely. As planned,
costs will be reviewed after the conclusion of the pilots when all the
information is
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120938000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000013">The
noble Lord, Lord Knight, asked about vaccination. As noble Lords know,
there are practical difficulties in using the injectable badger
vaccine, including the cost and the fact that each badger must be
trapped by a trained and licensed operator. Crucially, the vaccination
does not cure already infected badgers and provides only limited
protection to a proportion of uninfected badgers. Furthermore, unlike
culling, we do not know what effect vaccinating badgers has on TB in
cattle. Developing an oral badger vaccine remains a top 
<?notus-xml column=152?>priority for the Government. It is still at research stage and we cannot
say when it will be deployable in the field, but we are progressing
with this work as fast as possible and any additional spending will not
speed the process
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120938000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000014">My noble
friend Lady Parminter and the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, asked what we
will do with the independent expert panel’s advice. The
independent panel was established to provide a robust scientific peer
review of the analysis of the data gathered during the pilot culls to
support an assessment of the humaneness and efficacy of controlled
shooting. When the panel has finished reviewing the output of this
monitoring, it will submit its assessment and conclusions to Ministers.
The panel will not be making recommendations about the humaneness of
controlled shooting, but its conclusions about the robustness of the
data will enable Ministers to make informed decisions about its use as
a culling method in future years.</hs_para>

to ensure that the evidence base resulting from the pilots is robust.
This is the first time a cull of this nature has been carried out and
there are lessons that we can learn from the pilots. The panel’s
report will be published in due course after it has been submitted to
Ministers, along with the supporting evidence, and in deciding how to

have a number of other answers that I would like to have given noble
Lords and I undertake to write with various answers. The noble Lord,
Lord Trees, spoke about the Welsh Government providing funding for
vaccination. We are providing the same amount of funding as the Welsh
Government to help start-up vaccination in the annual TB testing area,
and the fund will also be used to subsidise training and competence
certification for staff and volunteers of voluntary and community
sector organisations wishing to become lay badger
vaccinators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120938000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000017">Although
we have much to learn from this year’s experience, conducting
two pilots has been a significant achievement and is another major step
towards halting the spread of bovine TB. In helping us to achieve this,
local farmers and landowners have undertaken the pilots in both areas,
often in difficult terrain and weather, and in the face of a sustained
campaign of harassment, intimidation and widespread criminal activity.
I pay tribute to those undertaking the pilots for not wilting in the
face of this and for showing commendable restraint in the manner in
which they have conducted themselves
throughout.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120938000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000018">Controlling
the disease in wildlife has to remain a key part of our TB strategy. No
country has successfully dealt with TB without tackling the disease in
both wildlife and cattle. Unless we tackle bovine TB in badgers, I fear
that not only will we never eradicate it in cattle and free our
livestock farmers of a huge burden but that we will see the disease in
cattle and that accompanying burden continue to grow and spread until
the disease is endemic throughout the whole of England. This Government
are resolved to prevent this happening and to achieve freedom from TB
in 25
years.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13120938000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-gc0001.htm#13120938000021">Committee

Government is increasingly concerned about the deteriorating security

Republic. We are working with international partners, and through
international organisations, to end the violence, deliver humanitarian
support, and re-establish stability and security. As the Central
African Republic is surrounded by countries that are still recovering
or suffering from recent conflicts, engagement by the international
community is vital to prevent a repetition of previous crises in the
region. The scale of this challenge means that we must use all means at
our disposal: our diplomatic networks, aid and trade, our political
relations, and our military and security
co-operation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312097001287" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-wms0002.htm#1312097001287">The
Government has worked closely with France and other Security Council
partners to agree a United Nations Security Council Resolution on the
Central African Republic; Resolution 2127 was adopted on 5
December. UNSCR 2127 marks a critical step in restoring security and
authorises the deployment of the African-led International Support
Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA). MISCA will contribute
to: the protection of civilians; the vital restoration of security and
public order; the stabilisation of the country; the restoration of
State authority over the whole country; and the creation of conditions
to enable the provision of humanitarian assistance. It also authorises
French forces to take all necessary measures to support MISCA in the
discharge of its mandate and, recognising the severity of the
situation, imposes an arms embargo and encourages progress on the
transitional arrangements initiated in Libreville on 11 January
2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312097001288" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131209-wms0002.htm#1312097001288">Shortly
after UNSCR 2127 was adopted, President Hollande announced that France
would be launching Operation Sangaris immediately, in conjunction with
Africans and with the support of European partners. On 6 December,
following this announcement and in response to a request from the
Government of France to provide logistical support
to their operation, the United Kingdom deployed a RAF C-17 transport 
<?notus-xml column=56?>aircraft to move French equipment to the Central African Republic. In
the spirit of our strong bilateral relationship with France and in line
with the undertakings of the Lancaster House Treaty of 2010, the United
Kingdom will provide a further two RAF C-17 flights between now and
mid-December to help the rapid deployment of equipment for French
forces in support of MISCA. The Government has no intention to deploy
UK troops in a combat role and has therefore clearly defined the level
of support that we will provide to France.</hs_para>
