Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Philip Hammond):</Member></B>
With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a
statement on the Government’s plans for reform of defence
procurement. The 2010 strategic defence and security review set out the
Government’s vision of an agile armed forces designed to face
the challenges of the 21st century. Central to delivering and
sustaining that vision is the ability to procure and support the
equipment the armed forces need. There is widespread acceptance that
the present defence acquisition process is not good enough. While there
have been notable successes, there have also been many examples of poor
performance and sub-optimal outcomes for the armed forces
and the taxpayer. Bernard Gray’s report for the previous
Government identified three root causes of those problems: an
overheated programme; a weak interface between Defence Equipment and
Support and the rest of the MOD, too often leading to repeated changes
to the requirement; and a lack of business skills in DE&amp;S. This
Government have moved to address all three.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121055000345" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000345">In May 2012,
I announced that we had resolved the £38 billion black hole we
inherited and balanced the defence budget, with more than £4
billion of centrally held contingency to address risks as they
crystallised and a much more disciplined and formalised approach to
investment approval, committing funding only when project proposals
were properly mature. As a consequence, DE&amp;S effectiveness is no
longer undermined by an overheated programme. We have also strengthened
and improved the interface between DE&amp;S and its MOD customers. We
have accepted and implemented the recommendations of Lord
Levene’s report on defence reform more clearly to define the
customers of DE&amp;S as the front line commands, and to give them
substantial responsibility for managing their own budgets and
prioritising their requirements. We still have further to go, but we
can already see an improvement, and with a substantial reduction in the
number of changes to requirements, that is already becoming less of a
negative factor in DE&amp;S performance.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121055000346" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000346">We have also
started to address the business skills gap within DE&amp;S, through the
appointment of Bernard Gray as the Chief of Defence Matériel,
and by the recruitment of new senior finance and commercial staff from
the private sector. We are beginning to see evidence of progress, and
while I do not want to pre-empt the major projects review report that
the National Audit Office will publish in the new year, I am confident
that it will show significant improvement in respect of the period
since we balanced the budget in May
2012.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000347" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000347">We
recognise, however, that there is still a long way to go. The reforms
we have already instituted are only a start, and the challenge of
recruiting and retaining the necessary business skills in
DE&amp;S is growing, not diminishing, and is likely to get bigger still
as the economic recovery gathers pace. A more radical reform of
DE&amp;S is necessary if it is to sustain the skills it requires to
support our armed forces effectively. That is why we developed the
matériel strategy
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000348" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000348">To
address the skills challenge and improve delivery of complex
programmes, DE&amp;S needs the freedom to shape its work force to be
world class and to engage effectively with the best of the private
sector.</hs_Para>

matériel strategy is about removing the obstacles to bringing in
critical skills and exploiting the capabilities of the private sector,
by exploring alternative models for DE&amp;S. I announced in April that
the Government had concluded that a Government-owned,
contractor-operated model, a GoCo, might well be best placed to deliver
the changes required in DE&amp;S, but that we needed to test the
market’s appetite for that model and confirm that it would,
indeed, deliver value for money, through a competition. In parallel, I
announced that we would work up a public sector comparator,
exploring the maximum extent of flexibility that could be achieved
within the public sector—a model that we have called DE&amp;S
plus. The Government have maintained an open mind as to which option
would prove, overall, to deliver the best balance of risk and potential
reward once bids are
received.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000350" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000350">On
19 November, I informed the House that we had reached the detailed
proposals stage of the competition, with only one proposal being
received from the two consortia remaining in the process. That proposal
was from the Bechtel-led Materiel Acquisition Partners. I further
informed the House that the Government would consider carefully how
best to proceed in the light of this development. I can confirm to the
House today that I have decided not to continue the present
competition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000351" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000351">The
heart of our approach was to test the market’s appetite for
delivering a GoCo along the lines we had set out, using the competitive
process to drive innovation and value. We have always recognised that
there are risks inherent in the GoCo approach. With only one bidder
remaining in the competition at this stage, I have had to make a
judgment about whether the public sector comparator alone would
generate sufficient competitive tension to ensure an effective outcome
for the armed forces and value for money for the
taxpayer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000352">I
wish to place on record that Materiel Acquisition Partners has engaged
effectively with the very challenging brief we set out. It has
presented us with a credible and detailed bid, but we do not have a
competitive process. I have therefore concluded that the risks of
proceeding with a single bidder are too great to be
acceptable.</hs_Para>

gained many valuable insights from bringing the proposition this far
and understanding the issues raised by both bidders and potential
bidders. My conclusion is that a GoCo remains a potential future
solution to the challenge of transforming DE&amp;S, but that further
work is necessary to develop DE&amp;S financial control and management
information systems to provide a more robust baseline from which to
contract with a risk-taking GoCo
partner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000354" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000354">We
are clear that the only realistic prospect of resolving the challenges
facing DE&amp;S in an acceptable time scale is through a significant
injection of private sector skills. I have therefore decided to build
on the DE&amp;S plus proposition, transforming DE&amp;S further within
the public sector, supported by the injection of additional private
sector resource, thus ensuring that the organisation becomes
“match-fit” as the public sector comparator for a future
market testing of the GoCo
proposition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000355" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000355">To
do this, we will recognise the unique nature and characteristics of
DE&amp;S as a commercially facing organisation by setting it up as a
bespoke central Government trading entity from April 2014; we will give
the new entity a hard boundary with the rest of MOD, a separate
governance and oversight structure with a strong board under an
independent chairman, 
<?notus-xml column=148?>and a chief executive who will be an accounting
officer, accountable to Parliament for the performance of
the organisation—delivering another of Levene’s
recommendations; and, crucially, we will permit the new organisation
significant freedoms and flexibilities, agreed with the Treasury and
Cabinet Office, around how it recruits, rewards, retains and manages
staff along more commercial lines, to reflect its role of running some
of the most complex procurement activity in the world. We will of
course consult trade unions on the practical arrangements for
implementation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000356" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0001.htm#13121055000356">These
changes will reinforce the customer-supplier interface between the
military command customers and DE&amp;S, facilitating a more
business-like approach, allowing us to move earlier to a hard-charging
regime and thus further addressing one of the weaknesses identified in
the 2009 Gray report. They will allow DE&amp;S to procure crucial
private sector input through a series of support contracts to deliver
key changes to systems and processes, and to strengthen programme
management while organic capabilities are built. They will also permit
the recruitment into DE&amp;S of key commercial and technical staff at
market rates and with minimum
bureaucracy.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_10_PT_1/E4B73A47B5E92D7AE0DE969C03DA5AD8677E41EB" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="10 December 2013">Tuesday

Alongside the changes to DE&amp;S, we will continue with the reform of

DE&amp;S.</hs_Para>

re-test the market’s appetite for continuing the DE&amp;S
evolution into a GoCo, and its ability to deliver value for money
against a significantly enhanced public sector comparator. On both
counts, this course of action represents the best way forward, both for

hon. Gentleman asked some specific questions. He asked me when the
decision was taken. He says that we knew three weeks ago that we had
received only one bid, and later asked me what the role of the Treasury
had been. Since we received notification that we would not get a bid
from the alternative consortium, we have been engaged in discussions
with the Cabinet Office team, the Treasury team and my own senior
officials to look not only at the risks inherent in trying to continue
a contracting process with a single bidder, but how we can reinforce
the DE&amp;S plus proposition and the best way to go forward. I am
sorry if he would have liked a decision more quickly, but I have to
tell him that three weeks was the period it took to arrive at a robust
conclusion on where we are and where we need to go. We have learned
from the process. Talking to bidders and potential bidders has
identified some of the challenges and issues we will be able to address
to construct the DE&amp;S plus process that I have set out today and,
crucially, import private sector skills.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman mentioned Lord Levene’s report, but omitted to
tell the House that the report gives the Department an excellent result
overall for the delivery of the transformation process. He will
know—I am sure he has studied this diligently—that Lord
Levene explicitly had no remit to address DE&amp;S plus, because it
was being dealt with through a separate process driven from
the Gray report. It is no secret, however, that Lord Levene,
who once ran defence procurement, has always been a sceptic of the GoCo
process. It is no secret that Lord Levene believes that only if
DE&amp;S plus has total freedom to hire, fire and remunerate on a fully
private sector model can it succeed inside the public
sector. As the hon. Gentleman and other Members with experience of
Government will know, however, there are all sorts of public
accountability reasons, relating to managing public money, why that is
simply not possible to deliver in its purest form.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman asked me about GoCo as a potential future solution. All
the evidence from this competition tells us that GoCo can deliver a
value for money proposition for the taxpayer. To make it contractible,
we will have to develop the DE&amp;S proposition significantly so that
it has a better and stronger baseline against which potential
contractors can measure their return, and so the Department can be
confident that we are not giving away public money in any contract we
enter into. It remains a possibility for the MOD, once DE&amp;S-plus is
match fit, to consider running the GoCo competition again to test the
proposition, in the interests of the armed forces and the taxpayers,
and to challenge the private sector to come forward with a proposal
that will deliver value for money against the match-fit
DE&amp;S.</hs_Para>

Gentlemanasked me what discussions had been held with Bechtel. He will
appreciate that until the formal announcement was made to the House a
few moments ago, what I could have said to, and discussed with, Bechtel
was heavily constrained. In the interests of propriety, I have had no
direct communication with Bechtel, but my officials have been in
contact. The indication we have is that it is interested in being
considered for the provision of support to the public sector DE&amp;S
plus entity through one of the support contracts that we will be
letting. The invitation to negotiate that we issued for this
competition made it clear that the Government could terminate the
process at any point and that bidders would not be entitled to
compensation or reimbursement of bid costs. The legal advice I have had
is that if any such claim was received, we would be in a very strong
position to resist it, and I would intend to do

GoCo company, because at that stage we could not see how it could be
made to work. The process that the right hon. Gentleman has been
through has shown the difficulties with moving to that kind of model,
but rather than taking it off the table, he says it could be
enacted at some time in the future. What kind of reaction does he
expect to get to that from industry and DE&amp;S staff themselves? The
Chairman of the Defence Committee just raised the importance of getting
the right skills into this area. With the uncertainty that his
announcement today leaves hanging over the future of the organisation,
will that be enhanced or made more difficult? What kind of a reaction

be talking about a system where private sector skills sets are employed
to advise but civil servants make decisions. Those private sector
participants will be paid flat fees; they will not be “at
risk” in the structure. That does not fundamentally change the
culture. It is an open question whether we can get far enough through
that construct or whether, once we have made DE&amp;S as lean and fit
as it can be within the public sector, we will need to test again what
additional value for the taxpayer could be generated by making the

Friend is absolutely right to point out that for a customer-supplier

upskilling DE&amp;S; simultaneously, we are also carrying out a project
within the MOD that will continue to upskill the customer side to
ensure that we can be an intelligent customer. On accountability, of
course Ministers will be accountable to Parliament for
DE&amp;S’s activity, but as I have announced, the chief

the Secretary of State had little choice but to make the announcement
that he has made today to the House, I am sure that he will share my
deep sense of regret that we cannot move more rapidly to the greater
savings and performance improvements that a GoCo would have delivered.
Can he reassure me a little about the private sector’s role in
this new organisation? Can he unpack for me a little how the private
sector will operate within the GoCo model and the DE&amp;S plus model,
and particularly reassure me that this is not just a recipe for more
contractors?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000401" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000401"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Philip Hammond" PimsId="3733" UID="13121055001914" xid="251" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055001914">Mr
Hammond:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend—someone
who, again, knows something about this from his long service in the
Department. The key distinction is between a model that puts the
private sector in day-to-day leadership of the
organisation—working on an incentivised fee that places it at
risk—and a model where the private sector provides specific
skill sets to civil service decision makers. That is the distinction.
What we envisage in the DE&amp;S plus model is probably three separate
contracts; one to provide us with programme management support, a spine
for the organisation; one to provide us with HR support, an area of
particular weakness in DE&amp;S; and a task-and-finish project to
install some additional financial control systems within the
organisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000402" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000402"><Member ContinuationText="John McDonnell" PimsId="1799" UID="13121055001915" xid="379" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055001915"><B>John

Reading of the Defence Reform Bill that having one bidder stretched the

vulnerable following the Secretary of State’s statement. May I
suggest that it is not just about bringing in expertise; it is about

this model will create for employees in DE&amp;S. The core
DE&amp;S—that is to say the part of the organisation that is
responsible for procurement —has about 9,500 people. The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right to say that one of the big challenges at
the moment is retaining the highly skilled people. We are losing people
to the private sector; worse, we are losing people

They will of course continue to rotate as part of a career development

specialist skills from the commercial sector and that will not alter or

the ability to retain senior civil servants in role as senior
responsible owners over the lifetime of projects and on the ability to

which is long held and loudly expressed, but DE&amp;S is, if not
unique, a very unusual organisation within the civil service. It is
almost wholly commercial in what it does. Most of its interaction is
with the commercial sector and it is competing directly for skills with
the private sector marketplace. It is not like a policy making
department. It is absurd that we are constrained to deal 
<?notus-xml column=157?>with civil servants whose job is commercial in nature in the same way as
we deal with policy making civil servants in a central Whitehall policy
Department. The freedoms and flexibilities that the Treasury and the
Cabinet Office have agreed for DE&amp;S plus will free us from that
constraint, which will make DE&amp;S plus a much more credible and
commercially focused proposition. However, as I have said, I would not
like to rule out the possibility of challenging it in the future with a
GoCo competition to keep it on its toes. Let us try everything and make

made substantial progress on the mindset by devolving budgets to the
front-line commands, which now control their own budgets and have
significant autonomy in prioritising their requirements. Front-line
commands are therefore managing their own requirements, rather than
having somebody else tell them what their priorities are. That has had
a significant impact on the culture among the senior military cadre. As
for <hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T14:01:05"></hs_TimeCode>skills, we

this issue by introducing a much more disciplined boundary between
DE&amp;S and the customers, but the intention of setting up the body as
a central Government trading entity is that there will be a hard
boundary between it and its customers. We will be able to
move—much more quickly, in fact, than we would with a
GoCo—to a hard-charging regime, where the customer pays for the
cost of the changes he is imposing. In my judgment, when front-line
commands hold their own budgets and have to pay the cost of making a
change, there is nothing more likely to cause them to think twice about
making such

about designing what we required in DE&amp;S and looking at how the
interface would work with the devolved customer—the devolution
of budgets to the front-line commands is also a new step that we have
introduced. We have also resourced the work on developing the DE&amp;S
plus model since we launched the MatStrat—matériel
strategy—competition earlier this year, so that work has had
proper resourcing. Although the proposal that has been put forward is
nowhere near as detailed as that put forward by the private sector

is actually slightly over £4 billion—remains intact. As I
told the House when I made the aircraft carrier statement, we
originally provided a larger sum of contingency. We allocated part of
that specifically to the anticipated cost increase in the aircraft
carrier—that was fully provided at the time of the May 2012
statement—but we have not had to make any further call on that
contingency. We will wait and see what the major projects review report
says, but as I see it at the moment, I do not anticipate any call on

material contained in the Bechtel bid is “commercial in
confidence”, and Bechtel will have spent a considerable amount
of money generating the bid, and would naturally not expect the

broader process, the work we have done on DE&amp;S plus and the
preliminary discussions we have had with bidders and potential bidders
have pointed the way to the future development of DE&amp;S in a way

was evidence to show that free-of-tie pubs close in greater numbers

Peter Bone</B> (Wellingborough) (Con):</Member> I was rather surprised
to hear what the Leader of the House said in his closing
remarks—that the Chairman of Ways and Means was entirely happy
with this. Earlier today, I recall the Chairman of Ways and Means
standing up and announcing that opposed private business would be taken
at 4 o’clock today, in accordance with Standing Order No. 20.
Nothing that the Leader of the House has said affects the ability of
the House to sit after that. The point of the Standing Order is that
there is a specific time for opposed business—between 4 pm and 7
pm. That allows those involved in the consideration of the private
business to know what time the House is going to debate it.</hs_Para>

have heard an enormous number of complaints, and I am sure that the
Leader of House will have heard them, about sitting late to discuss
opposed private business. That is entirely because the Government
continue to take Standing Orders, rip them apart and say that they are
not going to abide by them. What should have happened today is that the
debate on Government business should have continued to 4 o’clock
and then stopped so that the opposed private business could be dealt
with. After finishing the debate on private business, we should then
have gone back to the previous debate. That is what should have
happened; this Government are not being fair to those who are
interested in listening to, and hearing about, opposed private
business. People 
<?notus-xml column=163?>who are interested in those Bills do not know what time they will be
debated, which is completely the wrong attitude. That is why we have
Standing Orders; they are there to help the House.</hs_Para>

the guardian of the Standing Orders in this place, how important they
are to the effective running of House business. We had an interesting
debate—I think it was on Monday last week—about the
amendment of certain Standing Orders. I am not aware that the

other Committee—with a view to amending Standing Order No.

issue crops up again and again with opposed private business. If the
Government are not happy with the rule that allows us to debate these

this debate at this time on this afternoon, were it not for one or two

this item was on the Order Paper and it was not possible to have debate

must be very good reasons, laid down in “Erskine May” or
other House publications, to explain why Standing Order No. 20 is in

have been substantial debate about the merits and demerits of this
Standing Order when it was drawn up. The House, in its wisdom, has
decided that opposed private business should be debated between the
hours of 4 pm and 7 pm on any given day, and I suggest that
Members’ minds may be fresher at that time than later in the
evening.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T14:20:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) is an exemplar in that regard.
However, when he tries to do a service to the House by scrutinising
such detailed legislation, what he is faced with, again and again, is
criticism from other Members who resent having to debate such detailed
items well into the evening, and well past the time at which they had
expected to be able to go home.</hs_Para>

reason such legislation is not debated between 4 pm and 7 pm

Gauke:</Member></B> New clause 3 brings forward an important initiative
announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in
his autumn statement of last week. He announced that employers
employing workers under the age of 21 would no longer have to pay
employers’ class 1 national insurance contributions. Proposed
new section 9A of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act
1992 and its Northern Ireland equivalent bring this into effect by
introducing a zero rate of secondary class 1 NICs for all employers on
the earnings of employees under the age of 21. As my right hon. Friend
the Chancellor made clear, the Government believe this measure will,
alongside other initiatives on apprenticeships and work experience
placements, help to address the problem of youth unemployment in the
United Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T14:39:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
The measure will apply both to new and existing employees aged under 21
and is not time

The details of the costings can be seen in the autumn statement
document published last week. The initial cost is £460 million
and that then increases beyond that. All those working who are under
the age of 21 will be able to benefit from it, although there is one

is a step in the right direction. It is striking that this Government
came to office inheriting an increase in NICs and we have not only
increased the thresholds for paying employers’ NICs, but we have
introduced the employment allowance which gives £2,000 off for
businesses in respect of employers’ NICs, and now we are
exempting those under the age of 21. All this will help to create

earlier, in 2014, would increase the administrative costs to business,
and rushing the measure through in that way would be likely to lead to
cost confusion and the failure of many employers to take it up. Such a
tight time frame would not give employers, payroll software developers
and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs enough time to update
their IT systems. It would also not give HMRC enough time to ensure
that the policy could be implemented in a way that did not disrupt its
other important IT systems. Given that the policy cannot be delivered
in April 2014, it would not be a good use of Government time and
resources to attempt to estimate the impact of something that we do not

the Government’s new proposal, announced in the autumn statement
last week, will hopefully encourage employers to take on more young
people under the age of 21. With youth unemployment so high—it
is nearly 1 million—and long-term youth unemployment
a real concern, some action is welcome but, as the Minister has
anticipated and as our amendment suggests, we have some concerns about
how the Government are going about dealing with the
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000765" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000765"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T14:49:55"></hs_TimeCode>I
will deal first with some practical points relating to new clause 3
before moving on to our more substantive concerns about the
Government’s approach. I have briefly discussed the impact of
the measures with various stakeholders who have been scrutinising the
new clause since the Government tabled it. Given that we were unable to
scrutinise it in Committee, because of when it was tabled, it would be
helpful if the Minister could at least give the House the benefit of
his thoughts on the 
<?notus-xml column=173?>issues I am about to raise. Members of the other place can then take

impact does the Minister think the new measure will have on young
people who are employed part time? As he will know, we have seen a huge
rise in part-time employment and insecure employment, for example
through the growth of zero-hours contracts, something the House has
debated a great deal in this Parliament. My understanding is that many
young people who work part time will not be caught by the measure
because they earn far beneath the primary threshold. What
consideration has he given to the impact on young people who are
employed part time, given that for so many of them their first job is
part time? As many Members will know, it is now not unusual for young
people on the Work programme to be offered only part-time employment of
zero-hours contracts, so it would be helpful if he could explain the
Government’s thinking on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000767" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000767"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T14:51:52"></hs_TimeCode>I
would also welcome the Minister’s view on how the measure might
interact with the willingness of employers to take on graduates and the
impact it might have on graduate employment. That is not about passing
a value judgment on whether someone is taken on when they are 18 or
whether employers decide to employ a graduate, but the Minister knows
that the other announcements made in the autumn statement in relation
to young people were about an increase in student numbers of 30,000 and
a removal of student number controls to enable universities to take on
as many students as they like. The number of 18-year-olds, in
particular, participating in higher education is likely to
increase.</hs_Para>

would therefore be helpful if the Minister could outline the
Government’s thinking on how those two changes will interact and
how they will ensure that they work in a complementary way, rather than
skewing one type of recruitment practice ahead of another. Those issues
are worthy of much greater deliberation than we will have the
opportunity for today, so we might need to return to them, depending on
what happens as the Bill makes

have two other points to make on the practicalities of new clause 3.
First, we need to ensure that it is promoted properly to employers,
particularly micro-businesses and even one-man bands, which might be
encouraged to take on a young person, perhaps a family member. How will
we ensure that they know exactly how that will operate and how it will
interact with the employment allowance? That is important to ensure
that micro-businesses, in particular, are well aware of how the two
things align and that there is no confusion that could lead to a
decrease in
take-up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T14:53:50"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, my understanding is that no new funding has been announced to
pay for the proposal, so it would be helpful if the Minister could set
out where the money will come from and how the costs are expected to
increase, and not only in the first or second years, but in future
years.</hs_Para>

every day in my constituency who are themselves the children of people
who found themselves unemployed in the last great recession in the
1980s. They are having the same problems that their parents’
generation had. Every day that a young person tries hard but fails to
get a job increases their desperation and depression. I recently held a

consider taking much

the absence of such action, my point to the Minister is that we hope
the new clause will stimulate more employment for young people and
encourage employers to consider taking on a young person, and that it
therefore helps to get to grips with some of the problems. It is a good
proposal. It does not go as far as we would like and perhaps it will
not have the impact that a compulsory jobs guarantee would have, but on
its own terms it is a good proposal, so why not do it now? Nothing the
Minister mentioned seemed to be an insurmountable problem. He said that
the IT situation would be a little difficult, but we should not let IT
difficulties at HMRC stop us getting to grips with the scourge of youth
unemployment. He has failed to introduce the employment allowance as
soon as we believe it should have been introduced. He also decided not
to scrap the regional national insurance employers holiday, so letting
it run for three years, yet he knows that it fell far short of the
targets that were set for it at the beginning.</hs_Para>

However, I have interrogated others on this point, and it was
apparently not impossible or too difficult for the Government to amend
the IT situation so as to enable the employment allowance to be brought
in earlier than April next year. I am afraid that the same point
applies to the proposal on national insurance for under-21s. The

relative ease. I hope that the Minister has had sight of the submission
by Mr Holloway of the Learn Centre to the National Insurance
Contributions Bill Committee, which was submitted after the Committee
had disbanded but was still made available to all its members, because
it contains concerns about the delay in getting proper clarification
and explanation to software developers on what they need to do in
relation to the employment allowance. Given that it is December and
they have to get ready for the employment allowance to come online in
April 2014, they will not have a huge amount of time to get everything
in place and ready. If that is the position on the employment
allowance, then why not add in the proposal on NICs for under-21s and

the impact that introducing the measure in April 2014 would have had on
the level of youth unemployment as it stands today. That is because the

Gauke:</Member></B> First, I thank hon. Members for welcoming the
proposal. I am grateful to the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:15:57"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Member for
Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood) for describing it as a good one.
I will respond to some of her specific questions and then deal, as she
did, with the area of contention, to the extent that one
exists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:16:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000803" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000803">On
part-time workers, it is right to say that employers of staff earning
below the secondary threshold of £148 per week—which
applies to a lot of part-time staff—will not be affected
directly by this change. It is worth pointing out, however, that some
employers may at present be discouraged from increasing the hours of an
under 21-year-old because they may then have to pay employers’
national insurance contributions. To that extent, the proposal may well
help those part-time workers who want to extend their hours, because it
will increase the incentives for their employers to do so. That will
also enable an employer with both part-time and full-time employees to
connect the work of the two
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:17:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000804" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000804">Similarly,
there is no direct interaction with the employment allowance.
Obviously, the measure will reduce the national insurance contributions
bill of a number of employers, which may allow the employer’s
allowance to spread further: the £2,000 would be just as
valuable to the employer, but it would contribute more to reducing
their total NICs bill. I think that is a fair point to
make<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:18:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000805" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000805">The
hon. Lady asked about the interaction with university numbers, which we
have said we will increase. Again, I do not think there is a direct
interaction. The Government are trying to do everything we can for
young people with regard to increasing choices, providing more
university places and creating a good environment with more jobs for
them. If the hon. Lady is worried about graduates over the age of 21
hitting the labour market, the point I would make is that extending the
policy to those under 22 or 23 would be significantly more expensive,
which must be taken into consideration in the light of the pressures on
the public finances. Overall, we think the package is a good
one.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:19:01"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000806" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000806">On

Friend the Member for Braintree for his work on the Million Jobs

turn to the areas of contention,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:20:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller) referred to a certain pattern:
first, the Labour party goes into the general election advocating an
increase in employer’s national insurance contributions and
then, following the election, every time this Government come forward
with policies to reduce employer’s national insurance
contributions, it complains that we are not bold enough 
<?notus-xml column=180?>and that we should go further and faster. I must say that his
characterisation of that as a flip-flop is entirely
accurate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:20:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000809" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000809">In
relation to our not making the change now, I have set out the reasons
for that. Attempting to deliver it a year earlier, in April 2014, would
increase the administrative cost not just to HMRC, but to business.
Rushing the measure through in that manner would be likely to lead to
cost, confusion and the failure of many employers to take it up.
Payroll companies need time to update their software and employers need
time to download it, and such a time frame would put the policy at
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:21:20"></hs_TimeCode>. Does
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:21:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Birmingham, Ladywood really think that, with 18 months to run in
this Parliament, the Government prefer to introduce the measure in
April 2015, rather than in April 2014? If we could possibly introduce
it safely in April 2014, we would, but we can do it in April 2015. That
is absolutely the right thing to do, and we will not jeopardise that
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000810" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000810">Finally,
the hon. Lady asked about progress on the employment allowance. HMRC
has been in discussions with various interested parties over many
months. There is ongoing engagement with relevant groups, including
software providers, on the draft employer guidance, with a view to
making it available on the HMRC website in the new year.
HMRC will also target communications to key interested groups, and use
its publications and products to build further awareness in February
and March. We believe that that is all on
track<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:22:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055000811" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055000811">I
welcome the support for the policy. I understand why the hon. Lady asks
why we should not make the change in April 2014, although given that
her party has at no point advocated getting rid of employer’s
NICs for under-21s, it would be slightly strange for her to push the
matter to a vote. There are good practical reasons why we cannot do it,
much though we would like to, so I will be disappointed if she presses
her amendment to a Division. None the less, I welcome the support given
to the measure, and I am proud that the Government are taking real
steps to deal with youth

Gauke:</Member></B> New clause 4 is needed as it addresses a tax issue
arising under existing partnership tax rules where the immediate
entitlement to partnership profits is restricted by the alternative
investment fund managers directive—AIFMD. HMRC received further
information about this during the partnerships review consultation.
Following their discussions with the funds sector representatives and
the Financial Conduct Authority with responsibility for the AIFMD
implementation in the United Kingdom, the Government intend to put in
place a statutory mechanism to address the issue, subject to
parliamentary
approval<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121055001350" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055001350">It is
important to note that the vast majority of fund managers would not be
affected; only those who operate through a partnership would be
affected. Under existing partnership tax rules, tax is charged on
profits as they are earned, rather than when they are received. An
unfunded tax charge can therefore arise on profits that are allocated
to an individual partner of an AIFM partnership and which are then
deferred in line with the regulatory requirements of the AIFMD. That is
because the partner cannot access the deferred profits in the year when
they
arise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:39:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001351" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055001351">The
new mechanism that the Government propose is designed in such a way as
to meet the Government objective of a partnership review to achieve
fairer taxation by stopping tax-motivated allocation of profits in
mixed membership partnerships that typically include individual and
corporate members. The new power introduced under new clause 4 will
support the introduction of the mechanism and will be used to change
the relevant national insurance contributions legislation by
regulation, once the related Finance Bill 2014 legislation becomes law.
It will also allow NICs legislation to be amended in 
<?notus-xml column=186?>future to reflect any subsequent changes to income tax legislation in
that area, to maintain symmetry between tax and NICs
positions.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121055001352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055001352">New clause 5
and amendment 2 replace clause 13, which would have removed limits on
the Treasury categorising members of limited liability partnerships who
satisfy certain conditions as employed earners for the purposes of
NICs, rather than self-employed earners. New clause 2 provides an
express power to treat LLP members who meet certain conditions as
employed earners for NICs purposes. Those conditions will be set out in
regulations and will follow income tax legislation introduced in the
Finance Bill 2014. Broadly, it will mean that the individual member of
the LLP has no or little real economic interest or risk in the LLP, and
instead will be rewarded by a fixed salary. Those conditions will be
based on proposals on which HMRC has consulted, as part of the public
consultation on changes to partnership tax and NICs rules. HMRC has
been advised that in response to those proposals, structures with only
corporate members were being promoted as a way around the proposed
legislation. The schemes involved the individual establishing a
personal service company or other intermediary, with that intermediary
becoming a member of the LLP in place of the individual in order to
avoid those
provisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001353" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0002.htm#13121055001353">New
clause 5 provides power to make regulations to achieve the policy
objective of the measure, and counteract the artificial imposition of a
company or intermediary to avoid the impact of the measure. Regulations
will follow new income tax legislation in the Finance Bill
2014. That power will enable the reclassification by regulation of
certain LLP members as employed earners for NICs purposes, even when
they hide behind a company or intermediary.</hs_Para>

of members of LLPs as self-employed was designed to replicate the
position of traditional partnerships. The new clause will ensure that
those tax rules are not used to create a tax advantage, and it creates
a level playing field between partnerships that have not sought to
misuse tax rules for LLPs and those that have done so. I appreciate
that that was a rather technical explanation for rather technical new
clauses, but I hope it was of use and that the House will agree that
new clauses 4 and 5 be added to the Bill, instead of clauses 12 and
13.</hs_Para>

Mahmood:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful
explanation of new clauses 4 and 5, and particularly the technical
points and why the Government are no longer proceeding with clauses 12
and 13. I had some concerns in Committee about the impact of
clause 13 in disapplying section 4(4) of the Social Security
Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. That seemed to be possibly going
too far and was ripe for lawyers to have fun with—I was one in
my former life. I note that the Government have got rid of that problem
and clarified their intention for LLPs by tabling new clause
5.</hs_Para>

deal with their more technical aspects. Will there be an opportunity

was the subject of some debate in Committee, and I felt it was worth

the information on the geographical location of those taking up the
employment allowance will probably be available on a regional basis. I
hope that he will clarify that point when he responds to the debate.
The Minister said that he would put information on both elements in the
Library so that Members can raise questions about the effectiveness of
the employment allowance and its take-up levels. We have in mind the
previous regional national insurance employers’ holiday, which
had difficulties from the start. We have made the point that those

purpose of the review is not to put the employment allowance at risk.
The regional national insurance employers’ holiday scheme had
problems with take-up from the start. They were raised with Ministers
in this House at every available opportunity—in oral and written
questions—yet we had to wait for the full three years of the
scheme to run before the Government brought forward a proposal without
the same problems. That is the context for tabling new clause 1. We
want employment allowance to succeed and not suffer from low
take-up—we want it to be taken up. The Government say that it
will be taken up by 90% of eligible employers. I am sure that all
Members want to see 100% take-up, and there seems to be no real reason
why 10% should be missed off. We want to ensure that take-up is not
affected by any unforeseen issues during

more employees. There was also the hope that employers would be

innovative practices to help productivity. It is worth trying to
measure the impact of employment allowance on job levels and wage
levels. I take on board the point made in Committee by the 
<?notus-xml column=191?>Minister, and by members of the Committee on both sides of the House,
that the decision to either increase wages or take on new workers is,
for any business owner, based on a number of factors, and that

introduced in a vacuum. There is a clear intent and desire for it to
stimulate employment and, hopefully, an increase in
wages.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_10_PT_1/1E7F32FFD3CC2AD7070F62794358F9A6A36420E1" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="10 December 2013">Tuesday

Mahmood:</Member></B> In evidence to the Committee, the FSB said it
would survey its members again anyway. The Government could look at
that survey and work with the FSB to see how it surveys its members.
They might want to take a representative cohort of people who have
taken up the employment allowance; discuss with them its impact on
their businesses; and then extrapolate lessons for national take-up. I
do not seek to prescribe exactly how they should carry out the
review—I am sure there are clever bods in the
Treasury whose job it is to think of these things—but given what
has happened already in this Parliament on national insurance, it is
important that we concentrate the mind of the Government. The House
expects and wants this policy to succeed and not to suffer the problems
of the previous policy. It also wishes to continue pressing the
Government on this point.</hs_Para>

last element of new clause 1 concerns the effective promotion of the
employment allowance to all who are eligible. In particular, I have in
mind the FSB’s evidence to the Committee about the effectiveness
of that communication. It is worth considering that in a review,
particularly if there is a problem, such as a geographical inequality,
with overall levels of take-up. How the allowance is promoted will
clearly have an effect. Charities and sports clubs are rightly eligible
for this £2,000 reduction in their national insurance bill, but
there is a risk that they might miss out and that we promote the
allowance to businesses more effectively just because they have more
stakeholders and larger bodies getting the message out. The new clause
seeks to ensure that we keep across that concern and that not only
eligible businesses but other groups that rightly fall within its scope
take up the employment allowance.</hs_Para>

clause 2 seeks a short administrative and compliance costs review six

Studies and others—we heard this in the Committee evidence
session—have asked about the other 10%. The system for claiming

running of it to be smooth. However, one wonders why 10 per cent. are
always assumed to miss out.</hs_Para>

other driver behind the new clause was the evidence from Mr Holloway,
which was received after the Committee concluded its deliberations. I
thought it illuminating nonetheless, partly because it gave me an
opportunity to get to grips with the details of payroll software; an
expertise that I have not previously had the pleasure of enjoying in
this House. Mr Holloway’s evidence, which was made available to
the Committee and to the Minister, suggested that there were problems
about the guidance not being available in sufficient time for
developers to get their software ready. He indicated that, normally,
three to six months is required for systems to be developed, including
time for specification and documentation of the changes, development,
testing and release to clients.</hs_Para>

3, the Minister said that the guidance was going to be available in
January, which seems to put at risk the availability of the software
being ready or, at least, software developers will be up against it in
getting everything tested and working on time before the employment
allowance comes into force. The purpose of the new clause is that, six
months in, we will have an opportunity to make sure that software-type
issues have been ironed out and that businesses are not reporting
compliance or other administrative costs that we will not know about
until it is rolled out. If they are, that gives an opportunity for MPs
and the Government very early in the life of the allowance to consider
what changes might be made to remove those
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001384" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001384">Both

Gauke:</Member></B> The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana
Mahmood) said that she is not yet suffering from review fatigue; I wish
I could say the same. I note that much of this debate also took place
in Committee and I am tempted simply to refer the House to my speech on
21 November. However, I think that that would not be quite the
appropriate thing to do, so let me address the points on the new
clauses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001386" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001386">Let
me make the case, as I did in Committee, for why new clause 1 is
unnecessary. The tax information impact note already commits the
Government to keep the scheme under review through ongoing
communication with taxpayers groups affected by the measure. Moreover,
in Committee on 21 November, I agreed that the Government should
publish information twice a year about the overall take-up of the
employment allowance, including by geographical location. I am happy to
repeat that commitment today.</hs_Para>

as with the hon. Lady’s previous amendment in Committee, this
new clause focuses in particular on the number of jobs created by the
employment 
<?notus-xml column=193?>allowance. As I made clear on Second Reading on 4 November,
and in the evidence session on 19 November, although the employment
allowance will clearly reduce the cost of taking on new staff for small
businesses and charities, it will be up to those businesses and
charities to decide how they use the resulting national insurance
contribution savings.</hs_Para>

will also recall the comments made by both the Institute for Fiscal
Studies and the Federation of Small Businesses at the evidence session
on 19 November that it is impossible to get precise numbers. We cannot
conduct the equivalent of a randomised trial of tax policy to determine
the number of jobs created because of the allowance because, as the IFS
pointed out, there is no counterfactual, as there are a number of
factors in the economy influencing the number of jobs at the same time.
The Government have not set a target for the number of jobs we expect
to be created, although as we have previously noted, survey evidence
from the Federation of Small Businesses suggests that 28% of such
businesses will use the savings to employ additional staff. Therefore,
as I made clear in Committee, it would not be possible to provide
information about the number of jobs created as a direct result of this
measure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:04:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

will release substantial amounts of money and a considerable amount of
revenue will be forgone. We believe that taking less from employers is
likely to have an impact on employment, wages or investment, or a
combination of the three, all of which will be welcomed. However,
tempting though it might be to call for a particular number of jobs to
be created from the measure, I do not believe, for the reasons I have
outlined—because there are so many factors in play—that
we could give such a number with the necessary degree of robustness.
Some 28% of the businesses surveyed by the FSB said they would use the
savings to employ additional staff, while 29% would use the NICs
savings to boost staff wages. Again, it would be difficult to quantify
the precise effect, given that wage levels are subject to many
different pressures, which vary from business to business.</hs_Para>

is a much easier policy for employers to implement; in fact, it is
largely automatic. Those with an up-to-date payroll—that

I shall give the House only a brief reminder of the five main measures
in the Bill. The first is a measure to help both to remove barriers to
growth for businesses and to equip the United Kingdom to compete in the
global race. In this year’s Budget, my right hon. Friend the
Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the creation of a new
£2,000 employment allowance, which will come into effect on 6
April 2014. The objective is to help businesses with the cost of
employing their staff. The allowance will help thousands of small
businesses that aspire to grow, and is set to benefit more than 1
million
employers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:15:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001414" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001414">The
second measure was introduced this afternoon. In last week’s
autumn statement, the Chancellor announced our proposal, in effect, to
abolish employers’ secondary class 1 national insurance
contributions on the earnings of any employee under the age of 21 up to
the level of the upper earnings limit on 6 April 2015. That will
substantially reduce the fiscal burden of secondary class 1 NICs, and
thus support youth employment. As the figures in the autumn statement
made clear, we estimate that about 340,000 employers could benefit to
the tune of more than £450 million in 2015-16, and that the
figure could rise to about £530 million in 2018-19. This is
another measure that will make it cheaper and easier for businesses to
employ young people, and I am sure that it will be welcomed, as a
latecomer, by Members in all parts of the House. I appreciate the
support that it has received this

have introduced provisions relating to the general
anti-abuse rule, or GAAR. We announced in last year’s Budget
that we had accepted the recommendations of the Aaronson review, and
would introduce a GAAR targeted at abusive tax avoidance schemes. The
GAAR was introduced in part 5 of the Finance Act 2013, and has been in
force since July. The Bill ensures that it will apply to NICs. While
the extension to NICs is a relatively simple measure, it is an
important step because it makes it harder for individuals and
businesses to avoid paying what they

fourth main provision concerns oil and gas workers on the UK
continental shelf. In this year’s Budget, the Chancellor
announced that the Government would strengthen legislation in respect
of offshore employment intermediaries. The measure, which has been
subject to consultation, is specifically intended to address the
non-payment of employers’ national insurance in the oil and gas
industry, involving the placement of employers of oil and gas workers

and finally, the Bill contains provisions relating to HMRC’s
partnership review. The Government propose two sets of changes. The
first is intended to address an issue that can arise from the
interaction of the alternative investment fund managers directive and
the existing partnership tax rules. The second reclassifies certain
limited liability partnership members as employed earners for tax and
national insurance purposes to tackle the disguising of employment
relationships through LLPs. Together, those changes will ensure that
the correct NIC consequences follow the planned changes in the taxation

Government say this Bill is about helping our country compete in the

have to start getting out of the starting-blocks more quickly. I
therefore say to the Minister that the Government should have acted
more swiftly on national insurance. If the Government had changed
course sooner, we may have been well into the take-up of the EA by now

year, and the country might already be enjoying all the good effects

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001422" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001422">In
last week’s autumn statement the Government introduced a new
measure that we have also supported today: the abolition of
employers’ NICs for all employees under 21 years of age. I
repeat what I said to the Minister in our earlier debate, however: we
would have liked bolder action from the Government in their autumn
statement to help deal with the problems of youth unemployment. We do
not think this measure, which will come into force only in 2015, goes
far enough, nor will it stimulate higher levels of youth employment as
quickly as we would like. The real bone of contention, which I fear we
will continue to debate until this measure finally comes into force in
2015, is the delay. None of the reasons the Minister gave in his
winding-up of the debate on new clause 3 for waiting until 2015 sounded
sensible to me. He said that if the Government could have done so, they
would, of course, have wanted to bring the measure forward in 2014. But
the Government could also have got rid of the regional national
insurance employers’ holiday scheme earlier when it was clearly
failing, but they did not do so. I do not understand why it is
impossible to introduce this measure earlier. I am sure we will examine
that issue further when the Bill is debated in the other place and
through oral and written parliamentary
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:24:33"></hs_TimeCode>. The

courtesy in responding to my persistent and somewhat repetitive
questions about her party’s commitment to the proposals on
employment allowance, and on its continuing commitment to it in the
lead-up to the next election. The reason for my persistence is that I
think it is an absolutely fantastic measure. It will have a positive
impact on employment, on wages and on the economy, and it should be
embraced by all parties across the House, now and in the lead-up to
2015. I wish the hon. Lady every courage in talking to her colleagues

small measure is so important because it has shone a light on a much
broader and deeper issue—namely, the extent of Government
intervention in the wages and living standards of people on low
incomes. I should like to give the House some figures. Let us take the
example of someone on the minimum wage earning £13,000 a year,
and assume that they are the only earner in the household and have two
children. Taking into account the impact of the tax and national
insurance paid and the benefits received, that person’s
take-home pay will be £25,000. Their wages will be
£13,000, but their take-home pay including benefits will be
£25,000, which is nearly twice as much. The difference will not
be so significant for people without children, but even someone who is
single and earning the minimum wage will see an increase on the
£13,000 being paid by their employer to a total of
£17,600 in pay and
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:27:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

to question the level of Government intervention in the labour market,
other than to say that a better outcome could be achieved if it were
the employers who were paying the higher levels of wages that people
need to achieve an adequate living standard. That outcome can be
achieved in a number of ways. There will be uplift in the economy
thanks to the measures that this Government are taking to encourage
growth and boost the economy, and wages should increase over time as a
result. It can be achieved through measures to increase the skills of
our employees, to ensure that people can aspire to take on more complex
tasks and earn higher wages as a result.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:28:46"></hs_TimeCode>It can also be

Wilson:</Member></B> I want to make a short contribution to the debate,
because I think that the Government are introducing an important
measure. In this House we often discuss the macro-economic steps that
can be taken, such as huge injections of money for infrastructure
development and so on, but often—we have certainly found this in
Northern Ireland—micro-interventions can be very effective in
creating employment, improving conditions for employers and giving them
greater confidence to invest. I believe that the measure will have
that
impact.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001433" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001433">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:31:07"></hs_TimeCode>,
too, am a little disappointed that the measure’s full impact
will be delayed until 2015, because I believe that unemployment among
young people, especially in Northern Ireland, is a huge problem that we
are trying to tackle. Once the measure is fully in place by 2015, I
think that it will have a dramatic impact and will provide a big
incentive for employers to take on younger people.</hs_Para>

underestimate the importance of even small amounts of
money—£2,000, for instance—in influencing the
decisions of some employers. One measure that was introduced back home
in Northern Ireland was a 20% business rate relief for employers with a
net annual value of less that £15,000. The maximum amount of
money any one business received was probably £3,000, yet the
feedback from employers on the impact was quite encouraging. Therefore,
although some people might say that it is a small amount of money per
employer initially, nevertheless I think that it will have that
positive
impact.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001435" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001435">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:31:56"></hs_TimeCode>
take the Minister’s point about the difficulty in measuring how
many extra jobs and how many new businesses the measure will create,
but it is bound to encourage employers to hold on to existing
employees, to take on an extra employee, to have a better cash flow
situation, which might get them over a particular difficulty, or to
invest some more money in improving their business. That is the
important
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:32:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

thing I am concerned about, because the national insurance holiday did
not have the impact we had expected, certainly in Northern Ireland.
Indeed, uptake was very low. I take the point that at least the process
has now been simplified, which means that it will be much easier for
employers to access it. Of course, the more universal we make these
things, the wider their impact. However, I hope that the
measure’s effectiveness will be monitored constantly and that,

because people are finding that it is a worthwhile form of

3 of the Terrorism Act 2000 provides a power for the Home Secretary to
proscribe an organisation if she believes it is currently concerned in

the test is met, the Home Secretary may then exercise her discretion to
proscribe the organisation. In considering whether to exercise this
discretion the Home Secretary takes into account a number of factors,
namely the nature and scale of an organisation’s activities; the

British nationals overseas; the organisation’s presence in the
UK; and the need to support other members of the international

the wide-ranging impact of proscription, the Home Secretary exercises
her power to proscribe only after a thorough review of the available

enforcement agencies. The Home Secretary is supported in her
decision-making process by the cross-Whitehall proscription review

I want to raise the issue of de-proscription and time limits. The

the Government how a group can be de-proscribed. The only group ever to

proceedings. The Select Committee has been pushing the Government for
some time to put a proper structure in place for making such decisions.
Time-limiting proscription was recommended by the independent reviewer
of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC. He felt that a
proscription order should be subject to a review after a fixed period,
following which it could be renewed or it would lapse.

enhanced and taken forward through the extremism taskforce, and he will

issue that we are examining further is whether there should be a
requirement for banning orders that sit underneath
proscription—in other words, proscription is focused on those
who are actively engaged in terrorism, but we are considering carefully
whether there should be a further order aimed at any group that
undertakes extremist behaviour that is counter to our fundamental
values. Following that reflection, we will bring further proposals

in the first place, so it is right to take a precautionary approach
when considering any removal of groups from the list. As allowed by
legislation, de-proscription should be considered on receipt of an
application, which should set out the grounds on which it is contended
that the group is no longer concerned in terrorism. The Home Secretary
is required to determine the application within 90 days, and if she
agrees to de-proscribe the organisation, she will lay an order before
Parliament removing the organisation from the list of proscribed
organisations. The order is subject to the affirmative procedure, as is
the order being debated this afternoon. We believe, therefore, that
there is an effective process for the Home Secretary to consider
de-proscription on application from groups, and there is a right of

Second Reading by my hon. Friends that the “reasonable
suspicion” test was too subjective and laid too low and narrow a
bar as a test. The requirement for reasonable suspicion that a person
has committed a street trading offence has therefore been amended to
one of reasonable belief. The new test will narrow the circumstances in
which that power can be exercised, and will make it easier to claim
compensation when proceedings are not brought or fail to result in a
conviction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001492" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001492">On

entitlement in paragraph (a) of that subsection, as presented on Second

fit. As presented, the power of sale arose when the court made an award

Second Reading, my hon. Friends also raised new section 16B(6), which
provides exceptions to the requirement for a seized ice cream van to be

exceptions—first, where the owner is being prosecuted for a
previous alleged street trading offence, and secondly, where the
vehicle has been used for a previous or alleged offence—as they
were felt to conflict with the presumption of innocence. In recognition
of that heartfelt concern, both those exceptions have been removed from
the Bill. There is now only one exception—which the hon. Member

if an ice-cream van is seized it will contain some perishables.

such a case, the Government bring those concerns to the House. In
February, I raised such concerns on behalf of the Government, including
in particular whether the draft Bill was compatible with the
requirements of the European services directive. That concern related
to clause 9, which seeks to allow only those with business premises
engaged in the production and distribution of food to sell ice-cream
from a receptacle outside those premises. It was the
Government’s view that the clause failed to comply with the
services directive by appearing to discriminate indirectly against
non-UK nationals without
justification.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001502" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001502">Since
that debate, I am delighted to be able to tell the House that my
officials have engaged with the City of London to better understand the
basis of the drafting of the clause, and to consider the issue and the
policy justifications in more detail. In the light of that, we have
concluded that clause 9 is not discriminatory from the point of view of
nationality. This conclusion rests on two grounds. The first is public
health, because persons having food premises are more likely to comply
with good hygiene practices and regulations, and the second is
protection of the urban environment because sites not adjacent to such
premises are more likely to be in locations that could cause
pedestrians to be put at risk. On balance, these justifications appear
to meet the requirements in article 16(3) of the directive, so we are
now satisfied that the Bill is compliant with the directive and should
be allowed to proceed.</hs_Para>

UK co-operative, the Co-op Group. I welcome the progress the group

addressing the problems the Co-op bank faces. There are, no doubt,
long-term lessons to be drawn, not least on the checks necessary for

Neville Chamberlain’s efforts to get the Co-op divis axed in the
1930s; and, more latterly, the Thatcherite demutualisation of building
societies and friendly insurers, the majority of which have not turned
out well. The movement survived all those challenges and continued to

current challenges.</hs_Para>

initiative has created co-operatively and community-owned renewable
energy, the revenues from which stay within the local community. It is
an innovative energy solution leading the way in generating sustainable
sources of energy and it is jointly owned and operated by people in the
community for their mutual benefit. As democratic enterprises, they
operate with a one member, one vote policy and are surely a great
example of the kind of mixed economy of energy ownership that we need

Minister and the House might also draw inspiration from the success of
credit unions, which in many of our communities are increasingly taking
on the Wongas of this world. They provide affordable credit, empowering
many of the poorest people in our communities and helping to retain
funds in the local economy. In Leeds, for example, Salford university
found a £10 benefit for the local economy for every £1
invested in the credit union, and indeed the Department for Work and
Pensions independent evaluation of the financial inclusion growth fund
established by the previous Government found that the total loans made
by credit unions under the scheme between 2006 and 2011 totalled
£175 million and saved loan recipients between £119

what I have seen in Cardiff, whether in the work of the credit union or
organisations such as the Wales Co-operative Centre, which is doing
much to support the growth of co-operatives and mutuals across Wales.

Federal Credit Union, the credit union for the American military. It
has 4 million members and over $55 billion in assets. I gently suggest
to the House that it is surely time to consider again how a British
armed forces credit union could be made a reality to help our soldiers,
sailors and air force personnel in our own communities. A British

been established and are running well thanks to their support include
from Bristol—the Minister may be aware of this—Bristol

boardroom, and Portsmouth more recently, down to local clubs in north

What further support might the Government offer to encourage the growth
of energy co-operatives? Will he seek to emulate the US, where 12% of
the population get their energy from a co-operative, or Germany, where
the figure is one in three people? How about a target to push the level
of community energy ownership a stage further? What steps will he or
other Ministers take to encourage local economic partnerships to
support and develop co-operative, mutual or social enterprise
businesses, creating local employment and growth in their communities,
perhaps as part of future regional growth fund

to support growth, as I am sure the Minister is aware. Considering the

crucially, to small and medium-sized businesses is particularly bad. I
offer the Minister the example of Thamesmead in south London, which is
an area of 55,000 households with no bank. Indeed, the
nearest branch is some 35 to 45 minutes away by bus. Not surprisingly,
there are high levels of payday loan usage and a high take-up of

Shannon</B> (Strangford) (DUP):</Member> Thank you, Mr
Deputy Speaker. I asked for your indulgence and appreciate the
opportunity to contribute to the debate. I congratulate
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:30:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harrow West (Mr Thomas) on making such a valuable
contribution on the importance of co-operatives and mutuals.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121055001535" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001535"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>I
would like to make a few quick points—they will be
quick—about co-operatives in Northern Ireland.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:31:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harrow West outlined the importance of co-operatives for England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, so I shall follow that up in
respect of the benefits for Northern Ireland. The benefits of
co-operatives could be seen to happen when workers in Northern Ireland
decided it was time to do something and they got the expertise they
needed. The Belfast Cleaning Society was set up by six cleaners, and
the company, established as a social co-operative, is now winning
contracts, including from local councils. That happened after help from
the co-operative enterprise hub with legal and business
advice—the very advice to which the hon. Gentleman referred
earlier. That is what led to this 
<?notus-xml column=217?>company starting up with just six workers. The success of the Belfast
Cleaning Society has been tracked by other groups of
cleaners, frustrated by an industry that typically pays the people who
do this work only the minimum wage. That illustrates why it
is important to have a co-operative that works for the people and
benefits the people and all involved.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121055001536" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001536"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:32:05"></hs_TimeCode>Many
more examples could be cited. The hon. Gentleman referred to some
examples in England and Scotland. I am aware of one example in Clevedon
in Somerset, where the town’s bookshop was threatened with
closure. A community share issue was raised, and the 600 people
participating raised the £20,000 needed to buy the shop. The
“Clevedon Community Bookshop” has since gone on to advise
other communities about how to keep vital local businesses going. There
are two examples—one in Belfast and one in Clevedon,
Somerset—and the hon. Gentleman put forward many other examples
of where co-operatives can be of great benefit.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121055001537" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001537"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:32:44"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me deal briefly with a new initiative for Northern Ireland that is
coming off the backs of the co-operatives and the mutuals. I refer to
the Building Change Trust and the Co-Operative Alternatives, which are
leading the way in developing a community shares programme in Northern
Ireland. This project is the first initiative of this kind, proposing
to make community shares more known and understood in Northern Ireland
and identifying and selecting a sample of local enterprises and
initiatives with community investment potential to help them to become
community share investment ready. These are the very businesses to
which the hon. Gentleman referred in respect of ferries, for example.
These community shares will enable people who collectively want to
ensure that co-operatives and mutuals can happen to initiate business
opportunities.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121055001538" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001538">Community
shares are a unique form of share called a
“withdrawable share”, which can be issued by
co-operatives and community benefit societies. A withdrawable share is
very different from an ordinary share. A withdrawable share can be
cashed in or withdrawn, subject to the rules of the society, and is not
tradable on the stock exchange. The co-operative societies are for the
mutual benefit of all their members, while community benefit societies
are for the broader benefit of the community. Both legal structures
uphold the principles and values of
co-operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:33:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121055001539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001539">I
believe that these community shares provide long-term risk capital that
can leverage further funding. Societies can use community shares to
raise finance, but also to recruit members and to initiate business
opportunities for collectives across the whole of Northern Ireland. I
believe that these opportunities will support the social aims of the
community enterprise concerned by investing the money, purchasing these
shares, making the community investor a part owner in the community
initiative, able to have a democratic say and further social aims, as
the principle of one vote per shareholder implies.</hs_Para>

have given just a small synopsis of what is happening in Northern
Ireland, but I wanted to put it on record and ensure that it appeared
in <I>Hansard. </I>I think that this evening we should concentrate on
the pluses, for there are many pluses involved in what co-operatives do
throughout the United Kingdom. They provide an opportunity for those
who might not have had it in the 
<?notus-xml column=218?>past to start businesses and to come together and benefit the community
as a whole, which is what many people want to do. All that is needed is
a wee push, a wee nudge, a wee bit of legal advice and a wee
bit of support—and then, hopefully, co-operatives and mutuals
throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
will be able to continue to
grow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:35:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13121055001640" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/debtext/131210-0003.htm#13121055001640">5.35

Government are committed to opening up and transforming public services
and giving communities an opportunity to take control of the places in
which they live and which they may well love. Localism is fundamental
to that, and the powers and opportunities that we have introduced to
support it are already demonstrating their value. When I entered my
Department and discovered the range of responsibilities that I would be
taking on, I was, as a Liberal, genuinely excited by the whole localism
agenda. This morning I visited Poplar—in the constituency of

course, this Government did not invent community action. As the hon.
Gentleman rightly acknowledged, the co-operative movement has a long
history in this country. He mentioned pioneers in Rochdale, but given
his first name and surname I think that he must have some Welsh
antecedents, and in that context I should mention Robert Owen. All
those pioneers, whether they 
<?notus-xml column=219?>were in Montgomeryshire or in Rochdale, would have had in their hearts a
vision in which they were made stronger by working together, and could
achieve more together than they could individually. Together, they
could raise their own aspirations and those of their communities. Let
me put that into 21st-century language that may sound familiar to some
people: it is not just about building a stronger economy, but about
building a fairer society and enabling every person to get on in
life.</hs_Para>

flats. It has now purchased the pub, using the right to bid introduced
under that Act. That is the first co-operative pub in London. If we are
feeling the Christmas spirit, as we have plenty of time we did not know

22 now, and half of them opened their doors this year. My Department is

example of where community shares are helping industrial and provident
societies to save assets is the first co-operative football club, FC

used, too, to set up several renewable power generation projects.

Cumbria. There are also schemes in my constituency in Bristol, such as

would not have to discuss the Co-operative party and the recent
events—fun though that might be. A lot of us, myself included,
would regard ourselves as fully supportive of the co-operative model,
of mutuals and of social enterprises, and we have spent a large part of
our political careers doing a great deal to encourage that agenda. We
are now spending time in Government pushing that agenda forward. For
some reason, the Co-operative party chooses to fund only candidates who
are associated with the Labour party, and that is a shame. I am going
slightly off topic here, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I was led astray. I
wish that the Co-operative party would use its resources to fund
candidates from any party, be they Labour, Liberal Democrat or even
some of our coalition partners who are genuinely interested in pushing
forward co-operative ideals. The people who founded the co-operative
movement in the 19th century might be surprised to find that the
Co-operative party in the 21st century is now allied solely to a Labour
party and not to a Liberal party, because many of them would have been
Liberals at that

virus has so far infected 58 million people, become the sixth biggest
killer in the world and left 1.6 million people dead in the past year
alone. However, it is not just the scale of the epidemic that makes it
a human rights issue. It is a human rights issue because its effect on
a country is dependent on that country’s wealth, and an
individual’s social status still determines their risk of being
infected and their ability to access treatment if they
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000011">HIV
is the sixth biggest cause of death in the world, but it is the second
biggest in low-income countries and does not even feature in the top 10
causes of death in high-income countries. The 1.6 million people did
not die of AIDS last year because treatment does not exist; they died
because the medicines were too expensive for them to buy, or because
the stigma was too much for them to seek help in time. AIDS and poverty
are now mutually reinforcing negative forces in many developing
countries. We are 30 years into the epidemic, and AIDS is sadly still a
major health and human rights issue, despite the leaps and bounds in
progress we have made on prevention, testing and treatment.</hs_Para>

main barriers to fighting the epidemic, which stubbornly remains, is
stigma. Last year, I took part in a Voluntary Service Overseas
placement in Kenya to help parliamentarians and civil society there to
strengthen their own all-party group on HIV and AIDS in the Kenyan
Parliament. As part of that, I was lucky to work closely with Llina
Kilimo MP, a much respected politician and campaigner on HIV and
women’s rights. I remember her telling me that no one dies of
AIDS. I was confused for a few seconds, but then realised that she
meant that no one talks about dying of AIDS. When someone dies of AIDS
in Kenya, the family will usually announce the cause of death as the
secondary illness that was brought on by AIDS. Owing to the stigma
attached, they keep their status
quiet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000013">The
best known example of that comes from Nelson Mandela’s own
family. When his daughter-in-law passed away at the age of just 46, it
was announced that she had died of pneumonia. It was not until her
husband, Mandela’s son, died just a couple of years later that
Mandela took the brave decision to announce to the world that his son
had died of AIDS. In the midst of huge personal tragedy, burying his
own son, he decided to use the occasion to show leadership on an issue
that he feared would destabilise his country and damage the progress he
had made in South Africa. He said at the
time:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13121045000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000068">“That
is why I have announced that my son has died of AIDS…Let us give
publicity to HIV/AIDS and not hide it, because the only way to make it
appear like a normal illness like TB, like cancer, is always to come
out and say somebody has died because of HIV/AIDS, and people will stop
regarding it as something extraordinary for which people go to hell and
not to
heaven.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13121045000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000014">Mandela
had already established his well known campaign 46664—named
after his prisoner number on Robben island—a couple of years
before he knew of his son’s HIV status. The campaign aimed to
raise not just money but awareness, to get people talking about HIV and
AIDS and to attempt to alleviate the stigma that too often stops people
from seeking the treatment they need. Although there has been progress
since Mandela’s landmark press conference in his garden
following his son’s death in 2005, I fear that the stigma
attached to HIV still prevails in Africa and across the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000015">Mandela’s
great work is not over. People are still dying from a
preventable disease, and there are still 16 million people living with
HIV without access to the treatment they require. We know that women,
children and socially excluded groups are the people most affected by
HIV, but one of the reasons for that is that they are least likely to
have a political voice and are therefore not paid enough
attention.</hs_Para>

seem an odd statement, given the attention paid to the issue on world
AIDS day recently, and the fact that many non-governmental
organisations and some of the biggest ever global campaigns and
organisations now provide treatment. However, we are fighting a losing
battle for the political will to end AIDS in some of the countries most
at risk, because of the stigma attached—not to being
HIV-positive, but to talking about the matter at all.</hs_Para>

in Kenya that I have mentioned was a follow-up to one carried out by my
predecessor as chair of the all-party group, David Cairns, in Kenya two
years previously. He helped the National Empowerment 
<?notus-xml column=3?>Network of People living with HIV/AIDS in Kenya— an
umbrella organisation for HIV support groups—to set up an
all-party group on HIV with Kenyan parliamentarians. However, that
all-party group had not quite taken off.</hs_Para>

asked to go, I was concerned about the impact I could make; if David
could not make a difference and set that group up, I did not see how I
could. Surely, in a country as badly affected by HIV as Kenya, MPs
would be falling over themselves to join a group that campaigned on it;
it must be one of the biggest issues for their constituents. However, I
found that HIV was not far up the political agenda—even just
before the general election, when I was there.</hs_Para>

saying is not a criticism of the Kenyan Government, who have in many
ways been at the forefront of the AIDS response, but politicians were
not discussing HIV as a major issue for Kenya or talking about the next
steps of their response to it as part of the general election campaign.
With a few notable and brave exceptions, candidates and politicians
told me privately that they did not feel they could speak about HIV.
They were worried that the sensitive issues of HIV prevention would put
voters off. A couple said that they were worried that voters would
think that they were HIV-positive, and that that would damage their
chances of being
elected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000020"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Peter Bottomley" PimsId="4087" UID="13121045000076" xid="58" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000076"><B>Sir

became possible for a number of people in representative positions to
be rather more open. There are also HIV choirs in townships around Cape
Town. Those developments show that a way is beginning to be found of
getting what everyone knows into the open. If things are brought out
from behind the curtain, it is easier for people to take the action
that will reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS, and there can be greater

Kenya. In fact, I spoke at last year’s international AIDS

who is a member of the Japanese House of Councillors. I believe that he
is the first politician elected while openly being HIV-positive; I know
that some have revealed their status later, but he was elected having
already revealed his status. At last year’s event, he spoke
passionately about his hope that he would be the first of many and that
others would follow in his footsteps to try to relieve the stigma
around HIV. It is clear that we need more public figures to reveal
their status, but it is a big

fight against HIV. I do not want to bore or bamboozle Westminster Hall
with stats, but four recent figures from UNAIDS highlight the success
so far. There has a been 33% decrease in new HIV infections since 2001,
a 29% decrease in AIDs-related deaths since 2005, a 52% decrease in new
HIV infections among children since 2001 and a fortyfold increase in
access to antiretroviral therapy between 2002 and 2012.

pay tribute to David Cairns, who did a huge amount of work in the House
on the subject, and huge tribute to Nelson Mandela for his leadership
in this area, as in so many others. It is vital that we continue the
battle. I lived in Tanzania for 11 years and remember, as the hon. Lady

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T09:53:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Airdrie and Shotts has mentioned the important work of the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which we cannot stress
enough, and I am delighted that the Minister has decided to increase
its funding substantially. The hon. Lady quoted the statistics on the
29% fall in AIDS-related deaths since 2005; it is no coincidence that
that is roughly the time during which the Global Fund has been
operating. We see the same in malaria; I do not know the statistics for
TB, but I am sure the same is true. Certainly, the number of deaths
from malaria has fallen by a similar percentage during the time when
the Global Fund has been
operating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T09:54:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000045">The
Global Fund is a hugely important multilateral fund, which has received
very good ratings, for example in the multilateral aid review of the UK
Government in 2010 and 2011. It is vital that we continue to support
it. Certain issues have been brought up in recent weeks, and last year,
but the current chief executive, Mark Dybul, is excellent and is
tackling them. He is visiting the House next week and I hope to have
the honour of entertaining him. I encourage other Members and
colleagues to meet
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T09:55:33"></hs_TimeCode>. We must
continue with the emphasis on maintaining and increasing funding. The
Global Fund has not yet reached its target of $15 billion
for replenishment. We need to encourage our colleagues internationally,
in particular in Europe—Germany, France and other
countries—to step up to the plate and ensure that the UK and the
US can fulfil their commitments, because part of our commitment was
conditional on others making
commitments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T09:56:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000046">Secondly,
we need to concentrate on the strengthening of health
systems—the shadow Minister and I have discussed this on a
number of occasions. Only through proper health systems in developing
countries will we achieve the universal access to diagnosis, treatment
and indeed prevention that is so vital. I am delighted that one of
DFID’s new priorities is to reduce new infections in women and
girls, which is only possible if we have strong health systems
throughout the world. I want to hear from the Minister what DFID
intends in this particular area—the Select Committee on
International Development certainly hopes to launch an inquiry in the
coming
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T09:56:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000047">Thirdly,
as the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T09:56:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Airdrie and Shotts rightly mentioned, we have to work with
local groups. I am proud to say that I am an honorary member of the
Kilimanjaro women’s campaign to fight against AIDS, which was
launched in the early ’90s and has achieved a huge amount
locally in the Kilimanjaro region of northern Tanzania and beyond,
often on limited resources. The group is led by women and it works in
education in support of families and the education of AIDS orphans. It
did work that many other, much more substantially funded organisations
were not able to do, because its work was mainly run by very committed
volunteers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000048">DFID<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T09:57:44"></hs_TimeCode>
has an important role to play in support of such groups, not
necessarily with massive amounts  of funding, because sometimes
the effectiveness of such 
<?notus-xml column=8?>groups is in inverse proportion to the amount of funding that they get.
I remember one particular official group, which was substantially
funded, that collapsed six months after the funding stopped, simply
because it had become so reliant on it and was not prepared to continue
the work once the funding stopped. It is vital that we support those
groups, but sensitively, so that they are led perhaps not by
expatriates going in, but by local people, supported by
DFID<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T09:58:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000049">Finally,
there is the link made by the hon. Lady between HIV/AIDS and domestic
violence and the broader issue of human rights—such as the fact
that homosexuality is criminalised in, I believe, 42 out of  52
Commonwealth countries. We have to tackle such matters. Whatever might
be said about us in the UK, we must take a lead. I am glad to see that
the Government are doing

will conclude by putting on record how important I believe it is to
continue the fight. There is the tendency, as we saw with malaria in
the 1950s and ’60s, once a battle seems to be largely won, to
stop and relax, but it can come back with a vengeance to bite us, as
with malaria in the’70s, ’80s and ’90s. We cannot
give up on this. We must maintain our support, and I congratulate the

focus on access to medicine and the  human rights injustice
that too many people still face  in that regard. Hon. Members
are already aware of  the figures, but they are worth
repeating: at the end  of 2012, 9.7 million people worldwide
had access to antiretroviral therapy in low and middle-income
countries, compared with just 300,000 10 years earlier. We should
recognise that achievement, but should guard against the complacency
that the hon. Member for Stafford  identified so
poignantly.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121045000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000055">Antiretroviral
drugs have changed the way that HIV is viewed, from being a death
sentence to being an illness. That achievement was propelled by a surge
in donor funding and by the drastic reduction in the costs of
first-line antiretroviral treatments, from $10,000 per patient 10 years
ago to around $100 today. My hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and
Shotts referred to the Government’s recent review of their
position paper 
<?notus-xml column=9?>on HIV and AIDS, “Towards Zero Infections”. I want to
bring a few issues that remain of concern to the
Minister’s
attention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000056">Although
remarkable progress has clearly been made in ensuring access to
treatment for many, the World Health Organisation estimates that
another 16 million people out of a total of 26 million are eligible for
HIV treatment but lack access to it. Added to that is the fact that by
2050 it is estimated that over 50 million people will need HIV
treatment. The situation is described powerfully in the excellent
report by the all-party group on HIV and AIDS, “The Treatment
Timebomb”. Millions of people who will need treatment in future
will need more expensive medicines, as they will have become resistant
to the basic HIV combination therapy; also—and this is
welcome—people with HIV are living longer. Second and third-line
treatments currently cost at least seven times more, and when the basic
treatment stops working, getting access to them is a matter of life or
death. That combination—more people needing more complex
treatment—needs to be addressed now to avoid a potential crisis
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000057">The
all-party group’s report gives a cogent argument as to how it is
possible to make those medicines more accessible. Ten years ago, the
basic HIV treatment cost $10,000 per person per year; today, thanks to
generic production, the same medicines are available for $87 per
person, enabling 3 million people to access treatment across the world.
To avoid a treatment crisis, those kinds of price reductions need to
happen again with newer HIV medicines. The report therefore urges
pharmaceutical companies to co-operate by allowing generic
manufacturers to produce HIV medicines cheaply specifically for
developing countries, asking them to put their medicines into a patent
pool for that purpose. That would also allow researchers to work on
making HIV medicines suited to the developing world. Currently many HIV
medicines are designed for a developed country market, and issues such
as what happens when a patient needs to take HIV medicines in
combination with TB medicines have not been considered—I know
hon. Members have looked at that matter closely. There are also not
many special HIV drugs for children because, thank goodness, not many
children in the developed world have developed
HIV.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000058">At
the request of the international community, the medicines patent pool
was created. It negotiates with the patent holders of priority HIV
medicines to sub-license their products to generic manufacturers to
manufacture and sell them at a lower cost. Since last year we have seen
a more encouraging uptake from pharmaceutical companies, from
GlaxoSmithKline to Roche and Gilead Sciences, but there is still
clearly a long way to go. Will the Minister outline what steps the
Government are taking to ensure a much greater take-up by
pharmaceutical companies? In the meantime, what alternative strategies
are the Government pursuing to ensure that global access to medicines
is being fully
considered?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121045000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000059">Although
that issue was touched on in the Government’s review, it is a
major challenge facing us. What steps are the Government taking to
ensure that intellectual property rights and patent protections do not,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts aptly put it,
prevent necessary treatments being accessed by the millions around the
world who are currently without the drugs they need and the millions
who will need those drugs in the future?</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=10?><hs_Para UID="13121045000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000060">The final
issue I want to highlight concerns middle-income
countries. “Towards Zero Infections” outlined plans to
focus bilateral HIV funding on a narrower range of countries, in line
with the Department for International Development’s 2011
bilateral aid review. It concluded that the UK should end bilateral
programmes in 16 countries, many of them middle-income countries. That
shift is based on the view that aid should be focused on low-income and
fragile countries that are not able to eradicate poverty
themselves.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121045000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000061">The
Government have decided to end their bilateral relationships with South
Africa and India. But the fact is that three quarters of the
world’s poorest people currently live in middle-income
countries, as do 58% of people living with HIV; the projection is that
that figure will rise to 70% by 2020. Three of the top five countries
with the highest HIV burdens globally are middle-income countries, as
are eight of the 10 countries with the highest tuberculosis
burdens.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121045000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000062">Middle-income
countries also have far lower rates of antiretroviral coverage for
people living with HIV than low-income countries, and much higher rates
of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. The concern has been expressed
that withdrawing funding to middle-income countries too quickly could
undermine the gains that have been made through scaling up access to
reach key populations, which so far have prevented a global HIV
pandemic. Will the Minister comment on the extent to which a more
transitional approach has been considered—one that recognises
the need to build countries’ capacities for the longer
term?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121045000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121045000063">Médecins
Sans Frontières has warned of the consequences for middle-income
countries of tiered pricing—the practice of selling drugs to
different countries at different rates according to their
socio-economic status. That is another reason why the middle-income
label must be used with caution: it must not hide the fact that the
majority of the poor live in those countries. MSF has voiced strong
concerns about the potential consequences of those countries being
locked into bad deals. I will highlight one example. Although generic
competition brought the price of first-line HIV drugs down by close to
99%, from over $10,000 per person per year a decade ago to $120 today,
tiered pricing leaves middle-income countries paying as much as $740
per person per year for the second-line drug combination
lopinavir/ritonavir. That is over 60% more than what pharmaceutical
company Abbott is charging low-income countries. What are the
Government doing to address those concerns and ensure that we do not
create a ticking time bomb?</hs_Para>

is good to make a contribution on such an important issue because MPs
and parliamentarians have a role to play not just here at home, but
internationally. The debate is about the international response to HIV

also to look at home. HIV is prevalent in other parts of the world but,
unfortunately, it is also an issue at home: during the past 12 years,
there has been a 384% increase in Northern Ireland, which is a large
increase. When focusing on the issue internationally, we must always

groups such as the Elim church mission in Newtownards in my

house building, business, farming and orphans. It addresses such issues
in Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Malawi, three countries where there has,
unfortunately, been a large increase in the diagnosis of AIDS. In the
last couple of years, I have had the opportunity to meet some young
people from Swaziland who have AIDS, or are orphans because their mums
and dads died of it. No one could be other than impressed by the smiles
of those young people and their zest for life, which was a result the
Elim church mission and many other groups and individuals from other

such people and to give them hope and a chance in life.

expectations of many years ago—there was almost a sense that it
was impossible to counter the disease, and futile to try—lead to
any sense of complacency. Progress will not move along on the wheels of
inevitability. We should not assume that the momentum that is to be
celebrated will be sufficient to take all else in its path; nor should
we neglect the fact that some of the choices that can be made now and
in the coming years could compromise some of that
progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121046000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000017">Rightly,

Sustaining that fund is hugely important. Yes, there are issues such as

referred to the approach to, and emphasis placed on, the banding of
countries by DFID and others. On one level, DFID’s
categorisation of middle-income countries can be understood in terms of
its rationale for prioritisation; but on another, it can condemn the
many poor people in those countries to neglect, to their not getting
the support they need. They are left facing higher prices than those
faced by their counterparts in low-income countries, which is simply
irrational. DFID has justified the rationale of prioritisation on the
basis that the review would be all about buying results. We should not
be in the business of buying a result that is bad for poor people in
middle-income countries in the context of dealing with
HIV/AIDS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121046000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000019">Many
people have made the point that we should treat AIDS not just as a
disease but as a human rights issue. That raises questions about not
only health delivery 
<?notus-xml column=14?>and support, but other policies. The point was made that in many
countries where there is a political difficulty in marshalling support
for talking about HIV/AIDS, the criminal law on homosexuality is very
regressive. As we talk to people in those countries—whether
through the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association or the
Inter-Parliamentary Union—we need address the AIDS question in
the context of that debate,

recall that when I visited Malawi a number of years ago, a
politician—the then vice-president—was trying to talk
about AIDS. He had broken a taboo, even by using the euphemism
“the disease of the mattress”. He had to talk in very
coded terms, but even that brought its own serious and adverse
reaction. We have to support those who are trying to tackle the problem
in those countries. We will not do that by saying, “Right, we
have created enough momentum. That will look after
itself.”</hs_Para>

has been progress on the patent pool, and I commend the leadership of
companies such as Gilead and others. That poses a challenge to policy
makers: how we make the most of those opportunities; how we encourage
other companies to do more; how we encourage Gilead and others to make
sure that more drugs go into the patent pool a lot earlier? As we deal
with drugs that are needed for HIV/AIDS and other diseases such as TB
and malaria, we also need to recognise that one of the major challenges
is not only the supply of drugs but, in many of the developing
countries, ensuring proper adherence. Systems are needed for that, but
we also need to ensure that, as new and more specialised drugs capable
of helping the young and the frail are targeted there, they are priced
accordingly, so that there is no excuse for using anything else.

1985, I was on a staff exchange programme and worked for a number of
months in Senator Teddy Kennedy’s office. The previous year, he
had introduced and successfully passed in the Senate the first
legislation that mentioned HIV/AIDS. However, even that had been a
difficult and sensitive issue. It was time-limited legislation that
provided research funding for one year. His challenge in 1985 was how
to provide a second such piece of legislation. Even that was
controversial. I remember sitting in meetings with him and his staff as
they discussed how to frame a Bill that could also be subject to Senate
hearings. The question was, how could they even conduct Senate
hearings, because people did not want to talk about these issues? What
would happen if there was discussion about prevention and condoms, for
example? It was a highly sensitive issue.

then, Norman Fowler—now Lord Fowler—provided great
leadership at Government level, and I was very pleased to see him
presiding at events last week on world AIDS day, as he does so often.
It is right that we recognise the quality of leadership that was shown
here back then, but no less a quality of leadership is needed now as we
face big issues and challenges. We need to address the questions that
arise concerning the UN Special Assembly in 2016. There is the danger
of complacency, and that mistakes might be made that will set back some
of the work and progress that has been achieved.

reflected on different aspects of the issue, whether it was the shift
in focus from both low and middle-income countries or the range of

driving sense that there is still much more to do. I am sure the

the scale of the global crisis that HIV/AIDS represents, it is vital
that we continually examine the effectiveness of the action being
taken, at home and abroad, both to ensure that there is treatment for
those who need it and to slow and halt the spread of the disease.
However, as other hon. Members have mentioned, today’s debate
feels especially timely, for two reasons. First, and I suspect that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T10:32:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Airdrie and Shotts had this in mind when she applied for
the debate, last week we marked world AIDS day, when we remember the 35
million people who have died from HIV/AIDS since the start of the
epidemic; when we stand with those who live with the disease; and when
we re-pledge our determination to end this
scourge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T10:32:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121046000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000028">Secondly,
today is the day when the world is coming together to remember the life
of Nelson Mandela, so this debate seems particularly appropriate.
Nelson Mandela had a particularly interesting interpretation of the
word “retirement”. During his retirement, he campaigned
tirelessly to stem the tide of HIV/AIDS, which he saw destroying lives
and communities in his own country. On world AIDS day in 2000, he
described it in this
way:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13121046000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000124">“Our

against the prevailing attitudes and the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS,
which resisted calls to fund antiretroviral drugs or to educate people
on the need for safer sexual practices. He saw that HIV/AIDS was not
only shortening lives and destroying families; the economic impact was
also consigning many more people to poverty than would otherwise have
been the case. The hollowing out of a generation placed a brake on
economic development that could have reached across the country in the

visited South Africa, only the big corporations such as SABMiller and
Anglo American provided facilities for their own employees, and they
did so to stop them dying, not from pure altruism. Many hon. Members
have spoken of the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. I went into a
hospital built by Anglo American where people came forward and declared
their HIV-positive status in front of other members of staff. That gave
those members of staff, who were afraid of the associated stigma, the
courage to declare themselves and ask for testing. That was one of the
most moving experiences of my life. I say to all who take MPs on trips
to enlarge, inform and develop them that that trip, eight
years  ago, may have been a reason why I made HIV/AIDS one of
my priorities when I came into office. In addition, I grew up in an era
when HIV/AIDS first became  an issue. Being terrified by the
AIDS prevention  adverts and having many friends who died of
HIV/AIDS long before there was any treatment for it, left its mark on
me.</hs_Para>

address the points that have been raised as I go along, after which I
will try to address any that are not in my speech. There is much to
celebrate. The latest UNAIDS figures show an unprecedented pace of
progress in the global AIDS response. There are 1 million fewer new HIV
infections each year across the world than there were a decade ago,
especially among newborn children. We do a lot of work on preventing
mother-to-child transmission, which is an obvious stop point, and that
work is delivering results. Nearly 10 million people now have access to
treatment. Although international assistance remained flat, low and
middle-income countries increased funding for HIV, accounting for 53%
of all HIV-related spending in 2012. That shows that we are moving
towards a lasting
response.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121046000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000046">That
is all excellent news, but, as we debated in Washington last week, we
need to put renewed efforts into going the extra mile and achieving an
AIDS-free generation. We cannot take our foot off the pedal. Risks
remain that might seriously jeopardise the incredible progress we have
made. Too many people are still getting infected; 2.3 million were
infected last year. As many hon. Members have said, girls and women
remain disproportionately affected by the virus. Infection rates in
young women are twice as high as young men. Although tremendous
progress has been made on treatment scale-up with the change in the
World Health Organisation treatment guidelines in 2013, at least 16
million people who are in need of treatment are not currently receiving
it. Stigma and discrimination continue to drive key affected
populations underground, which inhibits prevention efforts and
increases the vulnerability of those populations to HIV. In 60% of
countries there are laws, regulations 
<?notus-xml column=19?>or policies that block effective HIV services for key populations and
vulnerable groups. I will return to that point.</hs_Para>

replenishment in Washington last week. The UK pledge alone will save a

life-saving antiretroviral therapy for 750,000 people living with HIV.
The hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon), who is not in his place

leverage. The UK contribution helped to leverage, and contributed
towards, an unprecedented $12 billion replenishment total. That is 30%

The contribution from one country—I believe it was Switzerland,

Members mentioned the shift in funding from bilateral to multilateral.
Over the past two years, we have been sharpening our focus and working
more to our comparative advantage in our bilateral programmes. As the
2011 position paper predicted, the balance between multilateral and
bilateral funding has shifted and our bilateral efforts are focused on
fewer countries where the need is greatest. The hon. Member for
Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell) asked what we were
doing in the programmes where we are shifting the balance of our
funding. We now have some exciting new programmes in southern Africa,
which is the region hardest hit by the epidemic. Given the urgent need
to reduce new infections, we have prioritised critical prevention gaps
and we are moving towards complementary work to deal with those gaps.
As hon. Members have said, civil society has been, and remains, an
essential partner for DFID in addressing those gaps. We are proud to
support other multilateral organisations, such as UNAIDS, 
<?notus-xml column=20?>to ramp up their efforts in the global HIV response. That will reach

I have announced, we will increase our annual core contribution to
UNAIDS by 50% to £15 million in 2013-14 and 2014-15. That will
give the organisation  an extra £5 million a year to
support its critical role  in co-ordinating the world response

decline is not as rapid as we would like and it is a critical area for
renewed UK and global efforts. Gender equality and women and
girls’ empowerment lies at the heart of DFID’s
development agenda. Since 2011, each of our bilateral programmes has
seen a greater focus on HIV prevention addressing the needs of women
and girls. We are supporting research to improve outcomes for women and

prevention and treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted

often ignored in humanitarian responses. That is why DFID is currently
developing a new programme on sexual and reproductive health in

TB-related deaths among people living with HIV by 2015. A

Members mentioned access to medicines, which is vital. The access to
medicines index, last published in November 2012 and supported by DFID,
shows that companies have their own strategies for managing their
intellectual property and supporting access to medicines. The medicines
patent pool currently has agreements with the US National Institutes of
Health, Gilead Sciences, ViiV Healthcare and Roche. The UK will
continue to support actively that collaborative initiative to enhance
access to more affordable treatment and to promote the development of
appropriate treatment for children. The UK strongly encourages other
companies that have patents for the new first-line treatment for HIV to
consider beginning formal negotiations to enter the pool. The medicines
patent pool idea was endorsed by the G8 and the UN General Assembly
session on HIV and AIDS, to support the availability and development of
new first-line treatments for HIV and AIDS.</hs_Para>

to funding for antiretroviral drugs through the global health fund,
UNITAID and other agencies, DFID also works to make markets for
antiretrovirals work better to reduce prices, increase the number of
quality suppliers and enhance access. Our partnership with the Clinton
Health Access Initiative has already contributed to secure price
reductions of almost 50% on both first and second-line
therapies for HIV, saving African Governments more than £500
million. That is sufficient to put an extra 500,000 people on AIDS
treatment for three years. As has been said, that fall in price from
$100,000 per treatment to $100 is the most incredible result. We need
to keep pushing down those prices for as long as we can. In terms of

roots through our civil society programme partnership arrangements and
other DFID civil society grant awarding schemes.</hs_Para>

truth of the HIV epidemic is that it is often women and girls who are

improving road safety. Last year, there were fewer fatalities in the UK
than in most other countries in Europe and the rest of the world, and
in 2012, one third as many people were killed on our roads as
20 years ago, but more can and should be done to reduce harm
to road users. In November is road safety week, which since 1997 has

hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Gareth Johnson) pointed out.
According to a reply to my recent parliamentary questions, Government
figures show that in 2012, 42% of offenders sentenced for driving while
disqualified had received a conviction for the same offence within the
previous 10 years, and 72% of offenders who received a custodial
sentence had been convicted for the same offence within the past
decade. As with drink-driving, the maximum sentence for driving while
disqualified is six months’ imprisonment or a level 5 fine. The
Magistrates’ Association has raised the issue with me, saying
that its members are concerned by the many instances of the offence,
sometimes repeated many times, and are frustrated that their powers of
imprisonment are
insufficient.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121046000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000078">Last
week, I introduced two Bills to strengthen the law on driving while
disqualified. The first would increase the maximum sentence that a
driver can receive for causing death while disqualified from the
current two years’ imprisonment to 14 years, in line with the
current penalty for causing death by dangerous driving. The second
would increase the maximum jail sentence to two years for repeat
offenders who continue to drive even after having been
banned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121046000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000079">My
fourth question to the Minister is: will the Government consider
increasing the maximum sentence for disqualified drivers and support my
Bills? Fifthly, will they consider reverting driving while disqualified
to 
<?notus-xml column=25?>an either-way offence, as it was prior to 1988? I understand that such
issues are dealt with predominantly by the Ministry
of Justice, but their implications for road safety
are immense.</hs_Para>

existing measures’ contribution to reducing drink-driving seems
to have decreased due to a hard core of heavy drinkers who are not
susceptible to them. We therefore need to consider new ways to reduce
drinking and driving. Several EU countries, including Sweden, France
and Holland, have introduced alcohol ignition interlocks, commonly
referred to as alcolocks, which are alcohol testers connected to the
car’s start-up mechanism. They have been found to help reduce
repeat offending, especially when used as part of a rehabilitation
programme. Various international studies have shown that alcolock users
had 65% to 95% fewer repeat offences than drivers whose driving licence
was suspended or revoked. The previous Government conducted a trial
programme in 2005, but there was never any
follow-up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121046000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000081">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:09:23"></hs_TimeCode>
North report in 2010 discussed the use of alcolocks and said that
trials had shown that there are merits in such initiatives, because
when alcolocks are in use they prevent people from drink-driving. There
are also existing powers in place, although not in force, under the
Road Safety Act 2006, for offenders to be referred to an alcohol
ignition programme.</hs_Para>

enforcement strategy, which could include making use of alcolocks in
certain cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:09:45"></hs_TimeCode>.
So, my sixth question to the Minister is this: what recent assessment
have the Government made of the effectiveness of introducing alcolocks
in the UK? Seventhly, will the Minister consider the evidence from
other European countries on the potential benefits of introducing
alcolocks? Eighthly, what discussions have been taking place to
introduce alcolocks across the European Union?</hs_Para>

move on to the next category that I wish to discuss. This year, the
Government made a welcome move to tighten up the rules for high-risk
offenders—those offenders who have been caught more than
two-and-a-half times over the legal limit, who have two or more
convictions for drink-driving within two years or who refuse to provide
a sample. The rule changes mean that high-risk offenders must pass a
medical examination to prove that they are fit to drive before they can
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:10:56"></hs_TimeCode>do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:10:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121046000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000084">Although
the scheme has been shown to help reduce reoffending, there are
concerns that a fifth of high-risk offenders have been on the register
before. Evidence shows that a driver at two times the legal limit is at
least 50 times more likely to be involved in a fatal accident. So my
ninth question to the Minister is this: what consideration has been
given to lowering the level for high-risk offenders to two times the
alcohol limit? Tenthly, how effective has the scheme been in ensuring
that those people who should not be driving are not on the
road<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:11:32"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121046000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0001.htm#13121046000085">I
move on to my final category, which is distractions. The theme for this
year’s road safety week was, “Tune in”, asking
people to “tune in” to road safety and give it their full
attention. Driver distraction is a major cause of deaths and serious
injuries on our roads. Research shows that although it is now illegal
to use mobile phones at the wheel, around a third of drivers continue
to flout the law.</hs_Para>

distractions can include eating and smoking at the wheel, which have
been shown to increase the risk of a crash. Furthermore,
evidence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:12:04"></hs_TimeCode>
suggests that talking on 
<?notus-xml column=26?>a phone while driving can be worse than drinking alcohol, with reaction
times 30% slower for people using a hands-free phone than for those
driving with a blood alcohol level of 80 mg per 100 ml of blood. So, my
final question to the Minister is this: will he review the evidence on
the dangers of hands-free mobile phone use when
driving?</hs_Para>

wish to add a few words that go beyond the law and away from
enforcement. I had responsibility for road casualty reduction from 1986
to 1989. We set out a plan to reduce the fatalities and serious
injuries by mistake and slight injuries by a third by the year 2000.
Since then, successive generations—both of Ministers and of road
users—have reduced the deaths from about 5,600 a year to about
1,750 a year. The numbers will fluctuate: the year before last, there
was a slight increase, then last year there was a significant
reduction. Part of that fluctuation is due to chance; part of it is due
to factors beyond what we actually do.</hs_Para>

is clear is that it is what road users themselves do that makes the
biggest difference. Safer roads, yes; safer vehicles, yes; better
medicine, yes. However, the biggest change, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:14:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
has mentioned, has been in the consequences of over-the-limit
drink-driving. Deaths in that category have come down from 1,200 a year
to about 200 a year; there has been a reduction of more than
four-fifths in the number of deaths caused by people driving after
drinking the equivalent of a bottle of wine or more.</hs_Para>

reduction was not achieved by enforcement—there has been no
change of law, no change of sentencing and no change of penalties. It
has come about because more hosts have provided alcohol-free drinks and
expected people to take them; because more passengers have picked
alcohol-free drivers; and because more people, like me, decide in
advance, “Is it going to be drinking tonight or is it going to
be driving?”</hs_Para>

limits of alcohol in their bodies. However, those are not the prime
people we are discussing today; as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:15:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gillingham and Rainham rightly said, it is the people
who are at twice the legal

driving, which they will get back if they are not caught reoffending by
drink-driving during, say, the next five years. Instead of suddenly
trying to impose a fine on them at the end of a period, there would be
money in the bank that they would get back if they showed that their
alcoholism, or other behaviour, could be controlled.</hs_Para>

10, 20 or 30 years ago. Well, 10, 20 or 30 years ago, we
were not aware of the dangers of pelican crossings compared with puffin
crossings. The Safer Roads Foundation, with Michael Woodford, which has
the support of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety,
has raised this issue. It has used research from the Transport Research
Laboratory, and I think that it is time that we in Parliament put
pressure on local highway authorities, through the Minister, and say to
them, “No more pelican crossings, and those that do exist should
not be renewed as pelican crossings. And if you intend to put in a
pelican crossing, explain why you think that it is going to be safer
than putting in a puffin crossing.” It is time that we took this
automatic way of reducing risks and reducing the casualties associated
with those
risks.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_10_PT_1/92083E87B31FFCE4402B19317BEF332637811CC5" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="10 December 2013">Tuesday

hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham and Rainham (Rehman Chishti) on
securing this debate. Road safety is an issue that has long been close
to my heart. The UK is a world leader in road safety. Our statistics
show fewer road deaths per million population than in almost any other
EU country. Road deaths in the UK are lower by almost a factor of four
than in the United States, and they are also lower than in Germany or
France. From 2011 to 2012, the number of people killed in road
accidents reported to the police 
<?notus-xml column=28?>decreased by 7.7% to 1,754, which is the lowest figure on
record<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:17:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
number of casualties also fell by 4%, including a reduction in the

Friend the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley) outlined his
own involvement in dealing with this issue. I must admit that I have
not thought about it for very long, but his idea of a surety that could
be built up before being returned to a driver if they are successful in
not drinking and in meeting the medical requirements imposed on them
seems—at the outset—to be a sensible idea.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:19:04"></hs_TimeCode> also note the

campaigns and communication, just last week I launched the Think!
drink-drive campaign, highlighting the snowball effect that a
drink-driving conviction can have on one’s future job prospects.
Up to 1 million people work in jobs that they could lose as a result of
a drink-drive conviction, and almost a third of people would have to
give up their job as a result of such a conviction because they rely on
a car to get to work. Additionally, it could affect a person’s
chance of getting another job, because any employer can ask to see
unspent criminal convictions. Drink-driving is a criminal offence.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:22:40"></hs_TimeCode> drink-driving

entitled  to have their breath sample replaced by a specimen of
blood or urine. This measure has been in place since 1981 and was
included due to concerns about the reliability of evidential
breath-testing devices at the time. But the process can lead to delays
in obtaining the specimen where there is not a resident health care

Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T11:24:49"></hs_TimeCode> measure

drink-driving, which prevent operation of the vehicle engine if the
driver provides a breath sample that is above a specified alcohol

Safety Act 2006. These devices are used in some countries to manage
some people with drink-driving convictions. Experience suggests that
they are effective while in use, but that drivers revert to offending

that background, I offer eight observations on areas of the report. The
first is a particular bête noire of mine: the lack of attention
to defence. The report is strangely silent on the wider security and
national resilience issues caused by a shortage of British engineering
talent. Defence and security face the greatest threats, as they often
cannot use non-British labour on national security grounds. It is true
that the bigger companies, such as BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce, have 
<?notus-xml column=36?>no problem recruiting as they are so well-known. They are now
over-recruiting to their apprenticeship programmes to feed apprentices
into their supply chains, which is welcome and good of them. Smaller
companies, however, face huge challenges in finding the right skills.

findings were striking. Of the young people who could recall no contact
with employers while at school, 26.1% went on to become NEETs. That
reduced significantly to 4.3% for those who had taken part in four or
more activities involving employers such as career insights, mentoring,

the report underlines, the action taken by engineers to remedy that
market failure has been to create “a wealth of
initiatives” and therefore a “complex” and
“confusing landscape”. The engineering community’s
lack of engagement with marketing professionals to develop a targeted
marketing programme has inevitably led to this ineffective but
well-intentioned, if costly, muddle. In the report, we read that we
need a “high profile media campaign”. Intriguingly, the
word “media” is dropped in the summary of
recommendations, and rightly so. What is needed is not a media campaign
but a well-considered marketing programme, which will include as only
one part of it an engagement with all types of media that reach eight
to 14-year-olds, speaking to them in their language and not the
language of engineers. Such a programme must
emphatically<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T14:55:59"></hs_TimeCode> not
rely on only one “annual event”. Many events can be part
of such a campaign, including Tomorrow’s Engineers week and the
excellent Big Bang fair. A campaign is not an event or even a

of the “Top Gear” programme, when it held that fantastic
event in the Mall, to present Vauxhall Motors as one of the great
British engineering success stories. The griffin motor corporation
started just down the road over in Vauxhall, but is now making cars in

make my second point to both the Front-Bench spokesmen: this is not
about the party political game, but about the future of a critical part
of British infrastructure. We could all talk about a number of good
news stories, but we must be mature and also reflect on some of the
problems that we are facing.</hs_Para>

Member for Mid Worcestershire reflected on the work of LEPs. We could
have a long ideological debate on LEPs versus regional development
agencies, but that would not be constructive. Some LEPs are starting to
move positively in the right direction, including my own one in
Cheshire, which is chaired by Christine Gaskell from Bentley. More
importantly, a number of the major companies in the broader north-west
are starting to pull together a solid science and engineering policy
for the region, reflecting the collaboration by LEPs across boundaries.
Some might say that that is reinventing the RDA, but I do not want to
go down that track today. Those companies are presenting a coherent,
joined-up policy in the way that we need.</hs_Para>

has been working closely with his colleague the Under-Secretary of
State for Education, the hon. Member for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth

have to say this bluntly: it is vital that we break down the ridiculous
barrier that still exists in the minds of the many people who think
there is a brick wall between skills that are traditionally called
vocational and skills that are traditionally called academic.
Personally, I do not like the word “vocational”—it
seems reflective of training to be a priest or the like. Nor do I like
using the word “practical” for such skills, because
chartered engineers such as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle

to be a continuum across engineering, so that people who join the
profession, perhaps as technician apprentices, have the opportunity to
move forward through higher level apprenticeships to develop to their
maximum potential. We need to open that door. The failure at the moment
is that we have a structure that does not allow that flexibility and is
too segmented, based as it is on the roles of the sector skills
councils, the further education colleges and the universities as three
separate groups of organisations instead of as a continuum providing

recommend the visit to everyone in this room: it is an exemplar of what
can happen if the mix is right. I left there saying to Xameerah,
“I want to go back to school.” It really is an exciting
place to learn. Very cleverly, the academy has
created an environment where people get inside problems—address
technical education as well as other more academic and broader subjects
by getting inside them, in a way that neither traditional secondary

have three points. First, on status and culture, there has been
something unique about the status of engineering in Britain, although
that is perhaps truer of England than of Britain.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:12:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) talked about engineers in
Germany; I used to work in Norway a lot, where, again, 
<?notus-xml column=44?>people referred to engineers in the same way as they would to doctors.
We do not do that in this country, and we have never really got close
to doing it. Clearly, it does not matter that much, but it is an
indicator of the way society regards the profession.</hs_Para>

indicator—I have often reflected on this—is when an
engineer was last on “Desert Island Discs” or
“Woman’s Hour” talking about what they do and how
they have made a difference. One of this country’s big success
stories over the past few years has been Range Rover. It cannot make
enough of its new aluminium cars, given how many it sells all over the
world, but how many people in our country could even come close to
naming the cars’ chief designer? Would that be the same in
Germany, France and Holland? I suggest not, and we need to be cognisant
of that. Things have got better recently—and they need to, given
the shortage of engineers.</hs_Para>

would depart slightly from some of the remarks made by the two previous
speakers. There can be a danger of confusing technicians with
engineers. I do not say that in a snobby way, but there can
be an assumption that people have to be practical to study
engineering—that those who would study engineering at Oxford,
Cambridge or Imperial would be the sort of people who enjoy stripping
down a car. That is not true, and having such an assumption at the
heart of the discipline of engineering can be a problem. That is not to
say that places such as the JCB academy are not brilliant—we
absolutely need more of them, and they have a role to play—but
we must be careful about our language.</hs_Para>

the time I became a chartered accountant—it was 30 years ago,
although I suspect this is still happening—we saw fit to
incentivise people in a certain way. The guy who joined with me was
making a commercial decision about his career, and he thought, rightly
or wrongly, that he could do better and progress more quickly by taking
the route he did. As a result, however, there was a penalty to be paid

development is the latest report by the Institute of Physics, which was
launched only yesterday. It contains important information on subject
choices in secondary schools. Entitled “Closing Doors,”
it shows the individual consequences to young people of choosing
particular subjects for A-level—in particular, the decision not
to study physics closes doors to a wide range of engineering roles.
Importantly, the research is undertaken 
<?notus-xml column=46?>on a wide range of subjects: three that are predominantly studied by
girls at A-level and identified as such, and three predominantly
studied by boys and identified as boys’ subjects. The research
shows that is not just in physics that there is a significant failure
to challenge gender
stereotyping.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121048000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121048000112">Simply

stereotyping, and we need more research to understand how they do that

Perkins argues in recommendation 5 that we should be aiming to inspire
11 to 14-year-olds to become tomorrow’s engineers. However, like
the hon. Member for Mid Worcestershire, I contend that our efforts to
broaden young people’s views of where science can take them must
begin at the very least at primary school, if not earlier. Most
children form an early view about the kind of careers that are open to
them, so focusing on secondary school children is likely to be too
little, too
late.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121048000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121048000115">We
should ensure that all nursery, primary and secondary education is free
from gender bias in the roles presented to children. A previous report
by the Institute of Physics, “It’s Different for
Girls,” outlined how single-sex schools are significantly better
than co-educational schools at getting girls into non-traditional
subjects. That confirms the vital importance of role models to the
young when they are considering careers, as well as the real benefit of
someone not feeling like the odd one out if they decide to study a
particular subject. At a co-educational school, a girl choosing physics
is likely to be in a minority; in a single-sex school that is clearly
not a problem. I do not advocate single-sex schools at all, but we must
learn why they are getting more girls to study physics than
co-educational
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121048000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121048000116">Role

crucial role in ensuring that young people have the necessary skills to

local schools offer only a generic GCSE, so students are prevented from

education sector, including 
<?notus-xml column=47?>academies and free schools, should not seek league table success by
opting for so-called easier subjects at GCSE. All must offer and
promote the three individual sciences and maths. That should be coupled
with an embedded model of careers education in which curriculum
learning is linked to a wide range of real-life careers. I do not have
time today to cover the woeful state of our careers advice service, but
it must be tackled if we are to have any chance of achieving the

course, a traditional academic approach is not the only way
to develop tomorrow’s engineers. Recommendation 10 of the
Perkins review rightly stresses the importance of providing
élite vocational provision. We have seen the success of that in
Sheffield. The university of Sheffield advanced manufacturing research
centre with Boeing is focusing on recruiting more female apprentices,
with a new cohort joining in April. Sheffield Hallam
university’s women in science, engineering and technology team
is providing advice and support on how to make that ambition a reality.
Furthermore, our brand new university technical college boasts 14%

co-ordinate better, but I think it was a mistake for the Government to
withdraw all funding from the UK Resource Centre for Women in Science,

supporters of our new university technical

girls and women into these areas is not enough if the culture in the
workplace does not change. The Perkins review rightly contends that
employers must do much more to support people returning to engineering
following a career break. Adopting measures such as flexible working
and better managed career breaks for maternity leave also benefits
employers. For example, Mott MacDonald, an engineering firm in
Sheffield, benefited when it allowed Cathy Travers, its most senior
female engineer, to work during term time only when her children were
young. That adaptability rewarded the firm with loyalty, and it
retained a talented and experienced
employee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121048000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121048000129">The
best performing companies are often those with diversity high on their
agenda. Organisations with a strong diversity and inclusion culture
reduce average employee turnover by half, quadruple work force
innovation and double customer engagement. The Perkins review tells us
that to fuel the long-term pipeline for skilled engineers, we must
ensure that all state-funded schools actively promote engineering as a
career option for women, but we should not stop there. We need an
environment in the engineering sector that welcomes women. Only when
all our young people have the opportunity to realise their potential
can we ensure that Britain develops the very best of tomorrow’s
engineers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:40:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121048000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121048000130"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Dai Havard (in the Chair)" InTheChair="True" PimsId="886" UID="13121048000239" xid="259" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121048000239">Mr

nation of James Watt, Richard Arkwright, Isambard Kingdom Brunel and
Frank Whittle, but I fear that this country does not value
the status of engineers. It is deeply dispiriting that, when people are
asked to name an engineer, the most recognisable
in our country is Kevin Webster from “Coronation Street”.
That sort of view reinforces stereotypes and prejudices that
engineering and manufacturing are often literally backstreet, low

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:48:09"></hs_TimeCode> certainly
would like to. My hon. Friend mentioned an important point. It should
not be about this Government or this Parliament; it
should be about looking at how Britain will make
its money in the next 30 or 40 years. How can we transcend Parliament

I would suggest, is ensuring that industrial strategy is at the heart
of business policy. A moment ago, I mentioned Sir John’s
comments that industrial strategy should give the right signals to
society. I also suggest that a successful industrial strategy should
give the right signals across Government. Business policy and
engineering policy should not only reside in the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills, but be aligned right across Whitehall

interests.</hs_Para>

have to say—it has been hinted at strongly during today’s
debate—that there is a lack of joined-up thinking between
industrial strategy and education and skills policy. Schools are not
encouraged to prioritise engineering and science, and there is a
failure to ensure that engineering is considered at a sufficiently
early stage in a child’s education. As a result, as we have
heard, many pupils are disillusioned by the time they get to the age of
14 and do not continue science-based subjects that could lead to a
career in engineering. Science GCSE has dropped from third place in
2012 to fourth this year; design and technology has slipped from sixth
place to
ninth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121048000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121048000152">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:49:57"></hs_TimeCode>

somehow engineering is second rate. The Royal Academy of Engineering

recommendations in the Perkins review. I join other Members in paying
tribute to John Perkins for the excellent work he has done and the
considered and reasonable way in which he took forward the review,
consulting extremely widely. The review has gone down very well in the
engineering profession and beyond, and in the education establishment,
which is important too. However, one of the most important things about
the implementation of the review is that it is a review to be
implemented by all, not just by Government. The Government have a very
big role to play in doing that, and we will take forward all those
recommendations that refer to the Government, but it is not a matter
only for them. It is also necessary for the engineering profession to

me respond to a couple of specific questions that were raised. John
Perkins did base his report on discussions with marketing and
communication experts. He consulted people in the marketing world.
Indeed, the argument that a marketing programme is needed and the
recommendations that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Worcestershire
pointed to, which he thinks need strengthening, were based on
discussions with marketing and communication professionals. I just
wanted to put 
<?notus-xml column=54?>that on the
record<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:58:39"></hs_TimeCode>. On the
point my hon. Friend made about the defence industries, the report
chose to be cross-sector rather than sector-specific, so that is

me deal with a couple of other specific points that were made.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T15:59:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn) referred to the “Closing
Doors” report, which is also an extremely important report. The
Institute of Physics has produced a very good piece of work. The
figures are stark. There are a record number of applications for and
entries to GCSE physics by girls in 2013. There has been a 32% increase
in GCSE entries for physics over the last three years, and there are a
record 73,000 entries by girls. However, of those who get an A*,
49% of boys go on to study physics at A-level but only 19%
of girls do so. There is a huge missed opportunity, which can be
realised by changing the culture, as the hon. Lady has said, so that
physics A-level is seen as a qualification for everybody. The record
number taking GCSE is good news, but we must keep driving that progress
up the age range so that we get a commensurate increase in A-levels and
university applications from girls. We must ensure that the work done
to increase applications at GCSE does not tail off.</hs_Para>

constituency. I join him in paying tribute to Matthew Harrison at the
Royal Academy of Engineering for his excellent work in the area. My
hon. Friend the Member for Warrington South (David Mowat) argued in
favour of improving the status and cultural position of engineers in
our society. We should articulate as often as possible the point that
pay for engineers is rising and that engineering is one of the most
lucrative career options. To those who are considering what career to
go into and who read <I>Hansard—</I>as I am sure they

cross-party approach taken by the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr

problem, which has improved in the past few years but needs a long-term

engineering can do someone proud, and I will not repeat what he has
said. I would, however, add computer science and the high-tech end,
which is extremely exciting. Developments in that area are moving
apace. I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman took a cross-party
approach, because he came slightly unstuck when he tried to score a
couple of political points. He said that there had been a decline in
GCSE science, but that is because there has been a sharp rise in the
number of people taking three sciences as separate subjects, which is a
more rigorous approach to science. I would not use that statistic in
future, if I were him.</hs_Para>

importance of inspirational teachers. To help him avoid slipping into
partisan language, does he agree that his comments about GCSE physics

The example of medicine is important for engineering, because 30 years
ago medicine was almost entirely male dominated, but the culture was
changed and the majority of those who go into medicine are now women.
We need to have the same sort of cultural change in engineering, so
medicine is a valid example. Not least as a result of the success of
Tomorrow’s Engineers week, which the Government sponsor, the

engineering qualifications for those aged 
<?notus-xml column=56?>14 to 16, the introduction of tech levels and the tech bacc for 16 to

apprenticeships, not only at level 2 and the technician end but all the
way up through higher apprenticeships. Members will have heard the

for your guidance on the debate. I am extremely grateful for the
opportunity to speak about UK relations with Ukraine. I requested the
debate in the aftermath of a decision by the Ukrainian Government not
to proceed with the signing of the association agreement, but the topic
has become much more urgent in the past few days. A large number of
Ukrainians are in Parliament square as I speak, but they are small in
number compared with the thousands taking part in the Euromaidan
demonstration in Independence square. At the weekend, something
approaching 1 million people in Ukraine demonstrated their unhappiness
at the turn of events most recently. We have watched the events with
growing
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000027">Yesterday<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:12:49"></hs_TimeCode>,
there were reports that the Ukrainian Government had taken a decision
to use force to disperse the protesters; happily, that has not
happened. However, there have been raids on the offices of the
opposition and there is no doubt that the situation remains tense and
unstable. I hope that the Minister in his response will be able to say
something about the latest information we have; I understand that talks
have now started between opposition groups, civil society and the
Ukrainian Government, which must be welcome, but we are by no means
away from the danger that force might be used. I want to return to that
later in my
remarks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000028">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:13:40"></hs_TimeCode>

declare an interest: I am the chairman of the British-Ukraine all-party

the conference, which took place only 12 weeks ago, representatives of
all major parties in Ukraine were present. I heard both President
Yanukovych and Prime Minister Azarov speak and state very clearly the
absolute determination of Ukraine to go down the European path and to
sign an association agreement at Vilnius. That strategy had the support
of all the parties of Ukraine with the exception of the Communist
party.

course there were always going to be obstacles. We are aware that Yulia
Tymoshenko is still in prison, which was a serious issue that needed to
be resolved. There were concerns about the way in which the judicial
process had operated in imprisoning her and the claim that it was
“selective justice”. There were wider concerns about the
level of corruption that still exists in Ukraine and the abuse of
monopoly power. But there appeared to be a real determination to make
necessary changes. Measures were being tabled in the Rada to meet the
requirements of signing that association agreement. It appeared that
there might be a way forward whereby Mrs Tymoshenko could perhaps go
for medical treatment abroad, and she herself had said that she did not
want her situation to prevent the signature of the association
agreement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000031">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:15:40"></hs_TimeCode>
always knew that the one obstacle, the biggest opponent, would be
Russia. I was in Yerevan, a little while before Yalta, just after the
decision had been taken by Armenia not to proceed with the signature of
an association agreement. Without question, that decision was taken
because of the enormous pressure that was put on the Armenian
Government by Russia, in particular over the security problems that the
Armenians face and the threat to withdraw security guarantees. But it
appeared that Ukraine would stand up to the pressure, despite the
economic measures being taken by Russia—import controls and
tariff barriers. At Yalta, Ukraine expressed an absolute determination
that it would proceed with the agreement. It was therefore a real
surprise and a great sadness when the President came back and announced
that instead of signing the association agreement in Vilnius, Ukraine
would seek closer relations with Russia. I suspect that he cannot have
anticipated the reaction to that announcement.</hs_Para>

the hon. Lady that those are desirable objectives, but there is a more
immediate, pressing concern about how the protesters are treated. Their
human rights are important at this time. We must not see a repetition
of the kind of violence that has been committed by special forces
against people. The scenes of people lying on the ground being beaten
with batons by 50 or more riot policemen as they ran past were wholly
unacceptable. Concerns have been expressed that provocateurs have been
placed among the protesters, and that that may precipitate a decision
to declare some kind of state of emergency. All of that would mean that
Ukraine would  
<?notus-xml column=60?>slip backwards. I want to hear from the Minister a strong message from

may know that I have tried to raise awareness of the Ukrainian
Holodomor and spoken on several occasions on behalf of the Ukrainian
people in this country, who also asked me to speak in this debate.
Given my friendship with the local community, it goes without saying
that I was shocked by the unfolding of the current social and political
situation in Ukraine. Like many others, I was optimistic when it was
announced that the Yanukovych Administration was to sign the
association and deep and comprehensive free trade agreements with the
EU. I thought that it might herald 
<?notus-xml column=62?>a new era of greater respect for human rights in the country. Although I
do not presume to pre-empt the Ukrainian Government’s rationale
for their U-turn in signing the agreements, I cannot ignore the
Yanukovych Administration’s draconian response to the peaceful
protests in
Kiev.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000050">On
24 November, British television news was full of images of peaceful
protesters on Independence square, holding aloft the Ukrainian flag
alongside that of the European Union. Those people were out not to
cause trouble but gently to persuade their Government to change their
mind about signing the agreement. Western media outlets have shown in
their coverage of events that the Government’s response to those
peaceful demonstrators was to deploy tear gas and truncheons against
them. In clashes between protesters and the police on 1 December, an
estimated seven were
hospitalised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000052">Coupled
with the 35 arrests that took place that day, it indicates a Government
who are prepared when threatened to use inhumane and draconian forms of
repression to quell dissent. That response seems to have exacerbated
the situation. The protesters, who were initially keen to resolve their
differences with the Government peacefully, have now resorted to acts
of violence, including the felling of a statue of Lenin in the capital.
It is clear from such actions that a section of the
population in Ukraine is keen to turn away from the influence of Moscow
and towards a future in the European
Union.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000053">Last
night’s events have also made it plain that relations between
the police, the Government and the demonstrators have continued to
deteriorate. The headquarters of the country’s Fatherland party,
the opposition party of ousted and imprisoned former President
Tymoshenko, were reportedly stormed by riot police, and protesters in
Kiev were encircled by police.</hs_Para>

a broad range of international issues and multilateral forums, and more
so in the light of Ukraine’s chairmanship in office of the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. In fact, the
Minister for Europe, my right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr

we have been watching recent developments in Ukraine with deep and
genuine concern. Several hundred thousand Ukrainian
citizens—perhaps more—have taken to the streets to
express their views on Ukraine’s future. Also, troubling reports
have emerged: of police violence in response to peaceful
demonstrations; of journalists being beaten and possibly being
deliberately targeted by security forces; and of disproportionate force
being used. These things are completely unacceptable.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:30:01"></hs_TimeCode>for Europe

On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:30:22"></hs_TimeCode> 3 December,
my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, together with his NATO
counterparts, issued a statement condemning the excessive use of force
in Ukraine, and he called on all parties to refrain from provocations
and violence. NATO members also stressed that a sovereign, independent

have made it clear that, particularly as the chairman-in-office of the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe is Ukrainian, it
is essential that the Ukrainian Government demonstrate—through
actions as well as words—their deep commitment to OSCE norms and

opposition to enter into early discussions. When my right hon. Friend
the Minister for Europe visited Kiev on 5 December, he visited Maidan,

protests. He also met opposition leaders and encouraged them to engage

a new and fundamentally different phase following signature of the

Partnership summit in Vilnius on 28 and 29 November.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:33:00"></hs_TimeCode> we have
made a study of is the benefit that the agreement would bring to
Ukraine and Ukrainian companies. It would give Ukrainian companies
access to a market of 500 million consumers. Reliable studies have
shown that GDP and wages would rise, and closer economic integration

However, does the Minister accept that there is some understandable
nervousness—I can see it in the Government of
Ukraine—that to suddenly change the relationship with the EU to
one where there are much more open trading agreements could force
tariffs in relation to the trade with Russia, and that therefore the

continuing with the reforms that are already under way, and ensuring

Ruane</B> (Vale of Clwyd) (Lab):</Member> Mindfulness is a form of
meditation. I first came across meditation in 1987, when I was a
schoolteacher. The school was about to be examined and the staff were
highly stressed, so the head teacher called in the school nurse and she
gave meditation lessons to the whole staff, including the support
staff. It worked wonders. I then took the lessons I had learned from
meditation to my classroom in a primary school and taught it to
children in classes of up to 39. In fact, on occasions, I would use it
in front of 300 children in the school assembly. I have maintained my
interest over the years. More recently, I came across the mindfulness
form of
meditation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000077">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:49:31"></hs_TimeCode>

Auden described the age we live in as the age of anxiety. What are the

child will, in their 18 years of childhood, look at 180,000 adverts.

past 40 years. He visited London in March 2013 and spoke to No. 10
advisers about mindfulness, creativity and enterprise. He addressed

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:56:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) on securing this debate. His speech,
drawing on his experience as a teacher, was interesting and informative
and he highlighted some worrying facts about the mental health of our
children and young people. He painted a vivid picture of the age of
anxiety in which we live, whether that is as a result of the constant
pummelling of modern media such as Twitter and Facebook and
advertising, or the sheer pace of modern life that we all experience.
He talked about the Red Queen from “Alice’s Adventures in
Wonderland,” and I think many of us often feel like the White
Rabbit, rushing around from one thing to
another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:57:39"></hs_TimeCode>. I

Department for Education certainly agrees that children learn better
and achieve more when they are thinking clearly, and the ability to
focus on the matter in hand and to ignore potential distractions is an
important factor in being able to learn and focus. The hon. Gentleman
talked about the ability to sit still, be curious and be willing to
learn, which we need at every stage of our education system. I

also agree with the hon. Gentleman’s comments on the number of
exams, particularly external exams, that students are sitting. We have
moved to a linear course for A-level to remove the necessity for
students to sit another exam at 17. We have moved to linear exams for
GCSEs, too, because children were taking external exams every term. We
want young people to have an opportunity to learn in depth, to think
about what they are studying and to enjoy it. Rather than the end
always being the exam, the end should be learning in
school<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:59:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000109">I
challenge what the hon. Gentleman said about the PISA results, which
varied between the countries of the United Kingdom. Wales did
significantly worse than England. England’s results have
stagnated over the past 15 years. We do not think that is good, which
is why the Government are reforming the education system and
considering examples such as Poland and Germany, where results have
successfully been improved.

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T16:59:36"></hs_TimeCode>him about the

is worth briefly discussing the new curriculum, which is being
introduced in September 2014. It is a lot slimmer than its predecessor,
which means more time for teachers to teach in different ways and to
introduce concepts such as mindfulness to their students if that is the
best way of getting messages across. I like to say that the Government
have put the trellises and pathways in the garden, but it is for the
teachers to plant the seeds and grow the plants. That is not something
we can do from
Whitehall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000111">Students’

Mindfulness has been 
<?notus-xml column=71?>used in schools and is often taught in combination with other relaxation
and self-management techniques. Some early indications suggest that
such approaches can help pupils to control stress and anxiety, pay
attention and develop social skills, and can improve teacher-pupil
interactions and enhance academic performance. I support the sharing of
good practice and ideas that help pupils to achieve more. I also
believe that the best way for schools to find out about what works is
from the successes of other schools in similar circumstances. I would
like to hear from the hon. Gentleman and interested colleagues about
positive examples of schools that are using mindfulness and finding it
a successful
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000112"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Ruane" PimsId="488" UID="13121059000171" xid="515" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000171">Chris

I mentioned, we have given schools the freedom to decide which external
programmes they use to deliver their curriculum. I am keen to get
across the point that, while the curriculum is being implemented by
schools over the next six months, they do have the freedom to try new

beneficial for their

has made it clear that it expects schools to look at the whole child,
and will focus inspections on outcomes. Together with a slimmed-down
curriculum, that gives schools more freedom to add skill and
character-building activities, promoting children’s wider
well-being. If a school thinks that the mindfulness programme is
suitable, it has the ability to make that
choice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:02:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000116">Many
schools commission their own pastoral and counselling support for their
students, and school counselling to support young people is already
widespread. 
<?notus-xml column=72?>A recent survey estimated that between 60% and 85% of English secondary
schools provide access to counselling, which equates to between 50,000
and 70,000 sessions a year. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Department
of Health, which issued in July 2012 a document entitled, “No
health without mental health: implementation framework”, which
described the role of schools and FE colleges as understanding the link
between emotional well-being and achieving good educational and life
outcomes. Teachers are not expected to stand in for mental health
professionals, but schools should have a whole-school approach to
developing pupils’ well-being and
resilience.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000117">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>

The hon. Gentleman’s referred to the fact that the abilities to
sit still, be curious and be willing to learn are often developed at an
early age. We need better co-operation between the Department for
Education and the Department of Health. Children’s centres,
where health and education professionals are on the same site providing
guidance to parents and helping young children, work well to help to
develop such
skills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-10T17:04:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121059000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/halltext/131210h0002.htm#13121059000118">The

to advise on the monitoring protocols and to carry out a scientific

advantages in continuing the humaneness monitoring for a longer period

field observations and the associated 120 post-mortems for
rifle shooting would have added little to the robustness of the planned

Rogerson:</Member></B> The quality of drinking water in the UK is
published each year by the independent drinking water regulators for
England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Together the reports
from these regulators describe the quality all of the public and
private water supplies in the UK in terms of the testing that is
carried out by water suppliers (public supplies) and local authorities
(private supplies). The regulators also publish details of the action
taken to require a particular water supply to be improved whenever
testing has shown that it is not wholesome or fails to comply with one
or more of the standards set down in the EU Drinking Water Directive.

Swinson:</Member></B> At present only 198 out of a total of 3,378
employees in BIS are shown as having declared their ethnic background
on the new online HR system. This includes 15 employees that have
declared they are from an ‘Asian’ background, 23 staff
from a ‘Black’ background, nine employees from a
‘Mixed’ background, and 151 employees from a
‘White’ background. Three members of staff have responded
but have preferred ‘not to say’. When broken down by
grade and ethnic background, the numbers will be so low that they will
not provide meaningful
comparison.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312114000520" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/text/131210w0001.htm#1312114000520">Although

Baker:</Member></B> The Government has introduced a range of measures
to help tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder. It has radically
reformed the Licensing Act 2003 to rebalance it in favour of local
communities. Key measures implemented in 2012 include the new early
morning alcohol restriction orders and the late night levy powers.
These allow local authorities to restrict the sale of alcohol at night,
including off-licence sales, and to allow local authorities to require
premises selling alcohol late at night to contribute to the costs of
policing the late night economy. Other recent reforms have increased
local powers and made it easier to review, close down or impose
conditions on problem premises. The Government will legislate by April
2014 to tackle the worst excesses of heavily discounted alcohol by
banning sales below the level of duty plus VAT. Through the Anti-social
Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, currently before Parliament, the
Government aims to simplify and increase the flexibility of tools and
powers available to local communities to tackle antisocial
behaviour.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1312114000071" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/text/131210w0001.htm#1312114000071">Entry

Simmonds:</Member></B> An inclusive Consultative Conference should have
been held within 30 days of the conclusion of the Eastern Sudan Peace
Agreement in October 2006, to build consensus on the arrangements for
its implementation. The failure by the Government of Sudan to implement
this and many other aspects of the agreement has contributed to growing
disillusionment with the peace process and rising tensions in the east
that could lead to a return to conflict if left unaddressed. We have
regularly pressed the Government of Sudan to honour their
commitments under the agreement, most recently during a visit to
Eastern Sudan by the British ambassador in October 2013 when he
encouraged government and other parties to address the development
needs of the region as a matter of
urgency.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_10_PT_1/A2990938C2A284E2162D1B467D584537E5C0E434" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="10 December 2013">Tuesday

provided by general practice, and will support transparency for
patients and the public. They will also help evaluate the impact of
retiring these indicators and help inform future decisions about the

Growth in allocation is over the opening baselines. Opening baselines
for some years differ from the previous year’s allocation due to
central budgets devolved to PCTs and the transfer of responsibilities

local authorities in
2011-12.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table>

2002 are currently under review as part of the implementation of the

Maritime Labour Convention, we propose to take the opportunity to give
seafarers access to an employment tribunal (industrial tribunal in
Northern Ireland) to enforce their entitlement to paid leave, in line
with the position of workers ashore, inland waterways workers and
sea-fishermen, and to provide seafarers with the same protection and

other workers exercising similar

Hammond:</Member></B> The Department is aware of the Danish MAIB safety
report into the pirate attack on the Danish vessel Leopard in 2011,
which was published on 29 October 2013. The Department for Transport
(DFT) and Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) officials have been
considering the content of the report and whether there are any
implications for our policies. However, it is worth noting that the
anti-piracy measures that the report refers to are part of industry-led
Best Management Practices (BMP) for protection against Somalia based
piracy, specifically to assist ships to avoid, deter or delay piracy
attacks in the High Risk Area (latter defined in BMP). DFT officials
will be referring to the Danish report at this month's meeting of the
National Maritime Security Committee, which includes industry
representatives, in order to seek views from industry before any formal
conclusions or recommendations are made about potential implications or
not for DFT
policies.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1312114000159" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/text/131210w0003.htm#1312114000159">Recruitment</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="1312114002947" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/text/131210w0003.htm#1312114002947"><B><Member PimsId="4742" UID="1312114004911" xid="842" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/text/131210w0003.htm#1312114004911">Mrs

Soubry</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 17 October 2013]:</I> The life
threatening risks of malaria are extremely serious. Mefloquine is one
of a number of effective antimalarials used by the military in many
parts of the world where British troops deploy. The drug is licensed in
the UK by the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency, based on
the expert guidance of the Advisory Committee for Malaria Prevention
(ACMP) of Public Health England (PHE), which advises on malaria
prevention for all travellers from the UK. Mefloquine is also used by
other countries around the world including the wider European
Union.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312114003423" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/text/131210w0004.htm#1312114003423">The
Ministry of Defence (MOD) is aware of recent calls for it to review its
use of mefloquine. There is currently no evidence that members of the
UK armed forces are at an increased risk from adverse drug events
related to mefloquine when used for chemoprophylaxis. If compelling
evidence is produced from the body of global scientific evidence
regarding the toxicity of mefloquine, then it is likely that the UK
license would be reviewed and advice from the ACMP may change. The MOD
will continue to keep under review its use of all antimalarial drugs
and follow the best advice as provided by
PHE.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1312114000175" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/text/131210w0004.htm#1312114000175">Defence

Fallon:</Member></B> The UK has a robust, comprehensive and safe
regulatory regime in place for shale gas exploration. The Environment
Agency's shale gas environmental risk assessment has found that the
risks to the environment of hydraulic fracturing can be mitigated
effectively through appropriate planning and permitting conditions and
do not justify them objecting to any permitting or planning
applications on the basis of the precautionary principle. Much of the
activity proposed (e.g. flaring, borehole drilling and casing, surface
run-off management) is not new and is commonly used in conventional
onshore oil and gas exploration. However, the assessment of
environmental risk in the case of hydraulic fracturing to explore for
shale gas is site-specific and depending on local geological conditions
the Environment Agency may object to future permitting or planning
applications.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312114003572" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131210/text/131210w0004.htm#1312114003572">Since
minerals extraction does have an environmental impact, it is important
that every planning decision should be made only after very careful
consideration of all the relevant planning issues, including the likely
effects of the proposed development on the surrounding area, and taking
into account the views of local residents. In addition, applications
for new shale gas sites in England, whether for exploratory drilling or
full production, may be subject to an environmental impact assessment
if there are deemed to be any significant environmental
effects.</hs_Para>

survivors of SGBV including, for example, by providing clinical care

Development Secretary recently held a Call to Action to protect Women
