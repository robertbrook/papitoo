that because there was no proper monitoring. We believe, however, that
in May 2010 in the region of 250 civil servants were full-time officers
of their trade union and doing no work on behalf of the taxpayer.
Several of them had been promoted in post while doing no work as a
civil servant—and one of them had been promoted twice, which

benefit to the employer in having union representatives in the
workplace. What is not acceptable, however, is having those
representatives uncontrolled, unmonitored and growing like Topsy, to
the extent that they were costing the taxpayer £36 million a
year at a time of financial stringency caused by the grotesque budget
deficit we inherited from the Labour party. That is completely
unacceptable.</hs_Para>

unions or for trade union representatives having paid time off in the

in the ability to have disputes resolved quickly, effectively and at
local level. What was going on in the civil service, however, was way
out of line with any other workplace, even in the public sector. The

Government gave us the biggest budget deficit virtually anywhere in the

a giant mess that this Government are clearing up. That is the truth.

biggest hit to living standards would be if we let spending and
borrowing get out of control and interest rates went up. That is what
we want to avoid, which is why we got the deficit down, and we must
continue with our difficult spending decisions. That has enabled us to
cut the taxes of people working and living in Basildon. By next year,
with the first £10,000 of income coming out of tax, people on

David Davis</B> (Haltemprice and Howden) (Con):</Member> On a point of
order, Mr Speaker. In a named day question on 5 December this year, I
asked the Attorney-General how many libel settlements, and of what
value, the Crown Prosecution Service had made in each year between 2007
and 2012. I was given the answer that the CPS had made no libel
settlements in that period. Unfortunately, in May 2008, in a case
adjudicated by Master Eyre between Hardcash Productions and the
Director of Public Prosecutions and the chief constable of West
Midlands police, there was a settlement of £50,000 between the
two defendants. I am certain, because I know him well, that there is
nobody less likely to mislead the House than the Attorney-General.
Therefore, he must be depending upon information given to him by the
Crown Prosecution Service. If this House cannot depend on the
organisation that is supposedly committed to promoting justice in this
country to give us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth, what can you do to defend

If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T12:45:56"></hs_TimeCode> my Bill does
not reach the statute book, I hope nevertheless that post-legislative
scrutiny of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 will now be
undertaken as a matter of urgency, because we need to answer some of
these essential
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T12:46:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121177000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0001.htm#13121177000034">Parliamentary
scrutiny is critical. I salute the work done by the Intelligence and
Security Committee, particularly the announcement of its forthcoming
inquiry into these matters. How much stronger would it be, however,
were it to be more properly constituted as a Select Committee chosen by
this House and given the resource to do its job properly? That is
something I advocated in government and I renew my plea now. I do not
believe it is impossible to achieve the security clearances needed to
ensure that information is not inappropriately shared while also
following the selection procedures of this House. Other legislatures do
it. The Americans do it. Why on earth are we incapable of following
their example? I see no obvious
reason<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T12:47:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121177000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0001.htm#13121177000035">Finally,
the Investigatory Powers Tribunal should be reformed to make its
operation more transparent and the basis for its decisions more open.
There are very good reasons—I understand that—for not
revealing every detail of a strand of investigation or a technique that
is at the disposal of the authorities, but a total lack of transparency
and accountability for decision making is not the answer. I believe we
can do
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T12:47:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121177000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0001.htm#13121177000036">As
I briefly alluded to earlier, other countries are taking these matters
very seriously indeed. I am struck by the work being undertaken by the
Senate Committee led by Senator Feinstein in the United States. Its
legislature is leading a very public debate on where the
limits—the boundaries—ought to be set. We are not having
that same debate in this country and I think that is because we in
Parliament are not taking the lead that we should. I believe that we
have a duty to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T12:48:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121177000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0001.htm#13121177000037">If
we do not do that, I believe we will be failing our citizens and,
incidentally, our security services. If we simply close our eyes to
what are real issues with difficult answers, we will be letting down
not only the public, but the people we ask to do these terribly
difficult jobs. They cannot police themselves. They cannot do
everything through better training or through being given better
information because, at the end of the day, their focus is on doing the
best possible job, not on setting the boundaries for their work, which
is the proper job of
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T12:49:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121177000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0001.htm#13121177000038">I
believe that we owe it to all those with intelligence interests not
just to visit, but to revisit the legislative framework regularly,
because unless we do so it will

Bill will at least allow us to debate the matter properly. I hope that
it will also enable us to amend the law appropriately and to do the job
that our electorate expect us to do, which is not just to give the
security services the ability to ensure our protection, but to provide
people with the security of knowing that there are boundaries provided
by a framework of regulation and that those who necessarily work in a

change to criminal sanctions is that they would apply if a senior
manager took part in any reckless action—there is a very strong
test, as we have just heard—that led to the failure of a bank.
It would not be appropriate to perform a legal analysis of what has
happened in the past because we do not have the full facts before us,
but if a board full of senior managers makes a decision on, let us say,
a potential acquisition and they fail to carry out proper due diligence
or they deliberately ignore certain risk factors, and that eventually
leads to a failure and collapse of that bank, that will be an example
of the situation that the new offence tries to capture. It is
reasonable to say that, as those senior managers will be aware of the
new criminal sanction, which did not exist before, it will bear on
their minds

would be remiss of me not to say a few words about how we have arrived
where we are today—considering a vast number of Lords amendments
at this stage. The concerns about that have been well rehearsed during
discussion of the Bill and how it has been brought forward and
considered. The Government commissioned the Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards to ensure that recommendations could be added to the
Bill, but we had a very thin Bill for Second Reading and in Committee.
The commission recommended a three-month gap between the publication of
the Bill and the commencement of the Committee stage, but the
Government rejected that idea. Instead, this House had to consider the
partial Bill before the final report on standards and culture had been
published. It is pertinent to reflect on that, given some of the
comments made by the Minister. Many of the issues that will be taken
forward when the legislation is enacted will still depend on judgments
being made and on getting the message across that the culture of

know that the culture of banking will change; that we have given the
Bill thorough scrutiny; and that we have considered and put in place 
<?notus-xml column=255?>every possible method to limit bad judgments and errors in the future.
In the end, however, it will be down to individuals, and from my
experience of various pieces of legislation I would always guard
against the notion that any individual piece of legislation will
guarantee that nothing will go wrong in the future. That always depends
on individuals making judgments. It is important that we get the
culture right so that individuals within it make judgments not just
because they fear that they will be prosecuted and go to jail, but
because they believe they are doing the right thing by their customers

been a Member of Parliament for a relatively short time, and others

many amendments at this stage of a Bill. External bodies have made
significant representations at this stage, which is also unusual and
shows the strength of feeling about the issue of banking and its
culture. It also shows that people have been thinking about how to
future-proof the Bill, not simply to repair damage done in the past,
but to ensure that we do all we can for the future. Some people may
feel that this has been a tick-box exercise and a part of the process

Minister on the recent issues on forex, and we have also had the sad
events at the Co-operative bank and the outcome of investigations into
the LIBOR rigging. Those all show that more issues may arise that will

In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T13:33:12"></hs_TimeCode> discussing
these issues, however, we need to think about those in the
banking industry who are not making the big decisions at the top but

products incorrectly. On a wider issue, of course, we also need to
protect the taxpayer from ever again having to bail out the

should bear it in mind, however, that the banks were only partly
responsible for all these problems, and that the commission’s

<?notus-xml column=261?>the solution. On the first point, responsibility for the problem also
lies with regulators, central banks, Governments, auditors, risk-rating
agencies and consumers, both retail and wholesale, who over-borrowed.

the second point—finding the solutions—the Banking
Commission’s proposals need to be set alongside both reforms to
the regulatory structure, such as the creation of the Prudential

reform of the banks, as proposed by Sir John Vickers.</hs_Para>

doubt whether the Government or the man who led the regulatory changes,
Sir John Vickers—or indeed any member of the Banking

we have put forward, we can solve everything. In any case, many on the
commission were sceptical about the extent to which culture can be
changed by legislation—a point made from the Front Bench earlier
this afternoon. Legislation can, however, play an important role by
incentivising good behaviour and penalising bad. Nevertheless,

recommendations on prop trading, which we just discussed, have, for the

I thank them heartily. Let me also record my appreciation of the

is more, and equally important, the Government have made clear their

brings me to the statute itself, and to the amendments that are before
us. The first major change that is proposed is the introduction of a
senior managers regime. One of the commission’s central
objectives was to make a reality of individual responsibility,
particularly at senior levels. I lost count of the number of witnesses
from failed institutions who were not prepared to take personal
responsibility for what was going on in their firms. In principle this
should have been the task of the approved persons regime, but it was a
disaster. It failed both at ensuring that competent people were
appointed and at checking up on their subsequent performance.</hs_Para>

commission concluded that the APR was a complex and confused mess that
did not perform any of its supposed roles adequately. It had become
little more than a bureaucratic, box-ticking exercise. Its
unsuitability has been illustrated by the fact that it seemed to pass
the recently departed chairman of the Co-op bank as fit and proper to
run a bank<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:00:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
Another indication of its irrelevance was the fact that most of those

banks had failed. The APR gave us the worst of all worlds: the

essential task, therefore, has to be the abolition of the APR. To
replace it, we recommended a much more judgment-based and proactive
supervisory approach for the most senior people in banks, a much
smaller group than under the APR regime. Specific responsibilities
should be allocated to named individuals at the very top of firms.
Secondly, for the much wider group of all those whose behaviour could
seriously harm a bank, its reputation or its customers, we proposed a
licensing system that in the legislation is now called certification. I

the senior persons regime, both the Government and the regulators
accepted our proposals for the most part, but for reasons beyond
everybody they have not accepted the name. Instead they have replaced
the phrase “senior persons” with “senior
managers”. I think that is guaranteed to confuse because some at
the top of banks who clearly should qualify for supervision of this
type will not be managing anybody. A non-executive chairman of a large
bank does not have a management responsibility. For much of his time at
Barclays, Bob Diamond did not have a direct management responsibility.
This scheme should, therefore, have been called the senior persons
regime. I have not heard any reason why it cannot be called that. That
is a relatively minor nomenclature quibble, however, and we are

Although the Government response to the commission initially promised

purpose of licensing, or certification, is to ensure that banks
themselves have identified those employees—whether traders,
senior salespersons, financial managers or whatever— who can do
serious harm to the bank or to markets. One of the shocking discoveries
of this crisis—including the LIBOR scandal—has been that
in many cases the banks did not know who these people were. They
certainly should. For them not to do so should constitute a regulatory
breach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:03:28"></hs_TimeCode>. It
should also be a breach to add staff to the certification regime who do
not satisfy the harm test—to add staff who cannot do serious
harm to an institution. That would defeat the purpose of
certification<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:03:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000075">It
should be the responsibility of banks, using methods that best fit
their organisation, to maintain a certification system, and it should
be the responsibility of regulators—using periodic
checks—to ensure that they do. Just to be clear, it should
certainly not be the job of the regulators to try to identify all these
staff themselves. That would guarantee the return of the very
bureaucratic box-ticking that we want to leave behind with the
abolition of the
APR<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:04:18"></hs_TimeCode>. Those in
such jobs should know that their bank may withdraw their certificate,
and therefore possibly their ability to earn a living performing that
function, and inform the regulator, who may in turn inform other
regulators in other jurisdictions, should there be misconduct. It can
be a great opportunity for many young staff to sit in front of a
computer screen and trade LIBOR and earn a considerable amount of
money, but that opportunity should also carry with it responsibility.

should not in any way exculpate the institution from its own
responsibilities. On the other hand, a key recommendation of the
Banking Commission was to restore individual responsibility. To return
to a situation where it is primarily the institution that carries the
can for what had been a series of individual pieces of bad behaviour
would be a profound mistake. There is a lot behind the exchange we have
just had that I am not going to go into now, but which we thought about
quite deeply on the commission. I shall now move on as there are a few
more remarks I want to make about this group of
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:07:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000082">Everyone
now seems to be agreed that the APR adds little or nothing, yet over
the past few weeks we have discovered that the discredited APR will
survive in legislation. In doing that, the regulators are perpetuating
a myth that the APR affords any real protection. It will continue to
apply to several groups. First, about 20,000 people in the financial
services industry outside banking will still be covered, mainly in fund
management and insurance.</hs_Para>

unfinished business. The Banking Commission had the remit to look only
at banking. It would be absurd to retain a system for one part of
financial services that has so clearly failed in another. The
Government and Parliament both need to encourage the regulator to look
at this and do what is necessary to extend the coverage of the new
regime and to remove the APR from other parts of financial services. To
rely on the APR is asking for
trouble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:08:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000084">It
is also regrettable that the APR will remain in a few isolated pockets
within the banking industry. This is because the APR will continue to
apply to firms’ LIBOR submitters and to persons with anti-money
laundering responsibilities in banks. This amounts, I gather, to only a
few dozen people, but I think it would be far better if we removed what
amounts to “triple running”. We will have three layers:
the senior persons regime, now called the senior managers regime,
licensing, now called certification, and the APR in the case of these
people. The extra APR layer confers no extra protection, but adds
bureaucracy and creates a business cost. There will be plenty of scope
for legal wrangling in the event of a regulatory failure, given the
great scope for confusion, and for an equal measure of recrimination by
regulators who will say they were asked to do too much by Parliament.
Banks will have a point when they complain about that. For all those
reasons, I hope that the Government will come back to this issue and
remove the APR from banking entirely in due course.</hs_Para>

just want to say a word about the Opposition amendment before I sit
down. It draws on a number of the Banking Commission’s proposals
and, by seeking to put it on the face of the Bill, the Opposition have
contributed something by forcing the Government to think again about
their rejection of our proposals on licensing. The amendment was
therefore probably worth while. However, the Government have now
thought again and are implementing our proposals.</hs_Para>

The first is it would require regulators to pre-approve all people
covered by licensing—or what is now going to be called
certification. I fear that would risk recreating many of the problems
we had with the APR—the box-ticking bureaucratic culture that we
are trying to get rid

other concern with the amendment is that it appears to mix up licensing
with the professionalisation of the banking industry. It would be
imprudent to link professionalisation to licensing too closely.
Licensing needs to happen now. Professionalisation is not a substitute
for it. Even if banking is something that could acquire the
characteristics of a profession—which many people are not yet
convinced of—it would, as the commission reported, take a
generation to build that sense of a professional
standard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000091">For
those reasons, although I strongly sympathise with the intent of the
Opposition amendment, it is not a Banking Commission proposal and I
shall not be supporting it. The House could do better by implementing
the commission’s proposals, which are now embodied in Government
amendments.</hs_Para>

mind that this country’s economy relies heavily on the financial
services industry, and that a massive banking and financial crisis
occurred in 2008, not only in the UK but in similar economies around
the world. We know that the crisis started as a result of the collapse
of Lehman Brothers and of the sub-prime mortgage market in the United
States, which led to the collapse of many banks around the world.
Economies like ours—in the USA, Japan, France and Germany, for

hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie), Chairman of the Treasury
Committee, said that this Bill started off 35 pages long and now runs
to some 180 pages, after some 192 amendments. That shows that the
Government were not thinking things through properly when they were
putting the Bill together. One expects some amendments as a Bill passes
through both Houses and one expects the number of pages to increase,
but the fact that the Bill has increased in size by more than
100 pages shows that it was not thought out properly and

type she would like to see. However, it is important to note that those
standards are not set and regulated in this place; they are set by the
professions themselves, which have a huge vested interest in ensuring
their own high reputation. Those professions also carry out much more
specific and autonomous work in terms of knowing whether an individual
has transgressed or not. It is much more difficult in large
organisations with long decisions chains to say who is actually
responsible for each individual activity. However, I urge the banking
profession to think a lot more about how it can enhance its reputation,
which, let us face it, is pretty much at rock bottom at the moment. It
should think, “How can we have professional standards which are
enforced? How can we ensure that people are kept up to date with
continuing professional development and that people will be struck
off?” However, that is increasingly a role for professional
bodies such as the Chartered Banker Institute to be thinking about; it
is not something for legislation in this place.</hs_Para>

shall briefly touch on some of them. May I begin with the difficulties
that exist in relation to this offence? Under the Bill, it would be an
offence for a senior manager recklessly to take a decision. I
appreciate that some of the additional 175 pages that have been added
to the 35-page Bill have been to backfill exactly what a senior manager
is and how they will be defined. That is clearly an improvement, and it
is unfortunate that it was even suggested that the Bill would be
sufficient in its original form. One must remember that even if a
definition of senior manager is now one with which we can all be happy,
there have been banks that have been brought down by people other than
senior managers. Nick Leeson from Barings bank comes to mind, as does

before. What is the point of bringing in an offence that will change
the behaviour of bankers, but will not, by itself, defend the banks? As

prosecutions end in shambles because of the behaviour of the
Government, which have cut the SFO’s funding from £53
million in 2008 to £30 million by the end of this Parliament.
Differences can be made to the behaviour not only of banks but of
businesses generally. May I just add that of course I support
Labour’s position on a stringent licensing regime for bankers,
the imposition of a fiduciary duty of care on financial-sector staff

that I am a critical friend of the Serious Fraud Office. Sometimes the
emphasis is more on the word critical, especially after what we have
seen in the newspapers today, with the crash of yet another serious
fraud case because the SFO asked an agent, which clearly had a conflict
of duty, to do its investigation. That is yet another mistake that the
SFO has made. If we want the SFO to turn a corner, we need to do more
than show good will.

prosecute the organisation, unless it can show, in the same way that it

respectfully, introducing such legislation will have a greater impact
than the measures proposed in this Bill. If we were to introduce a
different form of corporate liability, we could increase the fines
hugely, and that money could be ploughed back into the Serious Fraud

He said that he was grateful to the Government for moving such a long
way along the road towards the commission’s recommendations.
That is a tribute to the organisation that he chaired extraordinarily
well for about 18 months and that came up with such sound proposals. It
was a great honour for me to be part of that process. It also says a
huge amount for the Government that they have taken great heed of what
the commission said and have moved a great deal further towards
implementing the
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:41:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000130">On

just about preventing banks from collapsing. It is about getting better
standards and better service for consumers. Many constituents will
complain about their treatment by banks and that has nothing to do with
criminal matters; it is simply about the culture and how certain people
address other people in their everyday lives. We want to drive that out

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:42:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Financial Secretary is also a former banker, so to a certain extent
we have a private interest in ensuring that banking standards are
greater than they have been. There has, however, been an enormous
amount of progress. We have a new regulatory regime, there have been a
number of changes in the banks and we have seen a complete change of
culture at the top of many of the banks. Things are moving in the right
direction but it will take a long time and this Bill is part of that
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000133">Although
we are all trying to achieve the same thing, the important question is
how we will achieve it and who, ultimately, we should ask to ensure
that the licensing 
<?notus-xml column=276?>regime is upheld and looked after. The Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards was perfectly clear that we felt that the approved
person regime was complete and utter nonsense. One of the Bank of
England’s greatest thinkers, Andy Haldane, highlighted why that
was the case: if regulation is devolved to a regulator, all that
happens is that the individuals at the head of the banks think that
they have nothing to worry about. It becomes the regulator’s
problem to worry about such things, and not that of those
individuals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T14:44:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000134">When
we met a number of the banks—particularly UBS, the Union Bank of
Switzerland, the senior directors of which appeared in front of us just
after it had been fingered for its share in the LIBOR scandal—we
discovered that there was an incentive to be ignorant of what was going
on within them. The senior managers of UBS who were running the bank
when the LIBOR scandal happened within their organisation knew nothing
about it until they read about it in the <I>Financial Times</I> three
or four weeks before our hearing. That gave rise to the accusation that
there was an accountability firewall between the management of the
banks and the individuals working on the front line—that is,
those at the coal face on the dealing room floors and servicing our
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000135">We
were trying to work out how on earth we could reach a system in which
those at the top of the bank took accountability for the work and
standards of the individuals in the lower part of the bank. That is
crucial in leading me to support the Government in rejecting amendment
41: it does not deal with that accountability but rather gets around
the problem. That is why it fails to hit the nail on the
head.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13121193002065" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193002065">2.45

to the scene since the crisis and, in some cases, since I have been

that end, the banks have got together and employed the wisdom of Sir
Richard Lambert, who is looking into setting up a professional
standards body for the banks. The banks will run it, pay for it,

thinkers working on that and it is symptomatic of the fact that the

that. I keep coming back to this point: if

fellows of the CISI. Indeed, Sir Richard Lambert’s proposals,

recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking, which were
scrutinised extensively in the House and in the other place, including
the recommendations of the PCBS. The Government produced their response
as quickly as they reasonably could to the PCBS, which was in July, in

shadow Minister also asked why the Government resisted Opposition
suggestions on improving professional standards. Again, she will know
that because the PCBS 
<?notus-xml column=278?>had been set up and had been asked specifically to look into this area,
the right thing to do was to listen to the commission and take its
views into account when drafting amendments, before anything was
settled upon. She asked about minimum standards and competence. She is
right to do so, as we all recognise the importance of those. It is
worth pointing out that, because of Government amendments that were
introduced, banks will be required to check all new applicants to
ensure that they are fit and proper, and not just at the point that
they start with the bank; annual checks will have to take place and
regulators will have important powers to specify any qualifications

135 to 152 establish a special administration regime to be known as the
financial market infrastructure, or FMI, administration. Inter-bank
payment and settlement systems are integral to the efficient operation
of the financial system, processing transactions worth hundreds of
billions of pounds a day. Currently, if such a system becomes
insolvent, it will typically enter the normal administration procedure
and the administrator will be under a duty to look after the interests
of the company’s creditors without regard to the implications
for the wider UK economy. In those circumstances, the continued

Mills:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way one
very last time. I am not sure that I agree with him that it is not for
Parliament to decide roughly where the cap should sit, because if we
set it too high it will be meaningless and if we set it too low we will
drive too many people out of the loan market. What will the Minister do
if the FCA pitches the cap in a different place from where the
Government think it ought to be? Would he want to come back to
Parliament to take another look at the

Javid:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I
think that the FCA, acting independently and looking at the evidence,
is the right organisation to set the cap. I do not think that
politicians setting the cap would be as productive; actually, it could
be
counter-productive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T15:26:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000732" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000732">I
now turn to the cost-benefit analysis that the FCA will have to
conduct, which I think will help reassure Members that it will approach
the task in the proper way. The amendment specifically requires that
the FCA must consult the Treasury before it publishes and consults on
any draft rules. To reflect the importance of keeping the rules current
and effective, the FCA must report, each year in its annual
report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T15:27:25"></hs_TimeCode>, on any
rules it makes under its capping
powers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000733" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000733">Finally,
it is worth spending a moment on the issue of defining payday lending
in primary legislation. Putting a narrow definition in primary
legislation could lead to unintended consequences. Lenders may just try
to circumvent the definition. The amendment therefore allows the FCA to
specify precisely which types of high-cost, short-term loans are
captured when it makes its rules to effect the
cap.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000734" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000734">Amendment

am grateful to her for raising that important issue and the Government
fully agree that urgent action is necessary to tackle it. The whole

the industry that it must improve the way in which data sharing works,

executive of the FCA, Martin Wheatley, has made a commitment to me
today in writing that if the industry fails to improve, the

hon. Lady also tabled amendment (b) to Lords amendment 155, which
relates to the timetable. The Government want the cap to be in place as
soon as possible. That is why we are taking this opportunity to
introduce legislation that requires the FCA to impose a cap on costs.
The FCA will then be able to get on with implementation without delay.
Let us be clear that the Lords amendment provides a statutory backstop
date for implementation. The cap must be in place by 2
January 2015. If the FCA can deliver it sooner, it will. However, it
must not rush and risk getting the wrong result for
consumers.</hs_Para>

the market, which I referred to earlier. It is vital that
the FCA can benefit from the Competition Commission’s insight
into the market when designing the

making, many consumers and campaigners on this issue will be concerned
about what he has said about the time scale. The Government have
dragged their heels on this issue for a number of years and could have
taken action well before the date that has been set. I would like to
see a cap before this Christmas. I agree with other hon. Members that
it is crucial that the cap is in place before next Christmas. One of
the campaigners from Swansea whom I met, a woman called Serai, got into
more than £1,000-worth of debt with one of these lenders after
taking out a very small loan to help pay for her kids’ Christmas

number of steps must be taken before the cap can be implemented. All of
those steps are important and if they are rushed, it will put consumer
protection at risk for the sake of speed. There must first be evidence
gathering and analysis. That is critical in getting the cap right. The
FCA will draw on the evidence that the Competition Commission has
collected. It might also have to get information from lenders and
others in the market to get on with its work as quickly as possible.
Yesterday, the Government laid secondary legislation before Parliament
that will allow the FCA to seek 
<?notus-xml column=290?>information from the industry. That will support the design of the cap
and the cost-benefit analysis that the FCA must

second and most vital part of the process is the consultation with
interested parties on the proposals and their impact, as set out in the
cost-benefit analysis. The final component that is necessary for the
successful implementation of the cap is that lenders must be given a
short period in which to update their systems and processes to meet the
new requirements and become responsible, compliant lenders. Difficult
though that is, we are not prepared to compromise on the process
because that could lead to poor outcomes for consumers.</hs_Para>

want to return to those who perhaps suffer most from the payday lending
sector. Despite changing their tune and bowing to pressure from the
Opposition and campaigners at the sharp end, the Government have not
gone far enough to protect hard-working families from falling into
unmanageable debt. That is why, even at this late stage, we have tabled
our amendments. On the first, which relates to data sharing, I am sure
the Minister will be aware of the concerns set out by StepChange Debt
Charity about how the FCA’s proposed responsible lending rules
fail to make payday lenders use real-time credit data in their loan
decision making. It says that evidence from its clients suggests that
payday lenders often use out-of-date credit data and therefore fail to
pick up on whether borrowers have existing payday loans.
Understandably, it then makes the point that lenders cannot be sure
they are lending responsibly.</hs_Para>

we have heard repeatedly, multiple payday loans from different lenders
are a major cause of debt problems. Two thirds of StepChange clients
reporting financial difficulties with payday loans have been granted
overlapping payday loans from different lenders. It also argues that
the regulator’s responsible lending rules transpose Office of
Fair Trading guidance into binding rules but continue to allow payday
lenders to make loans without using that up-to-date information about
borrowers’ existing financial commitments. That is obviously
causing particularly severe problems for those who get into difficulty
with multiple payday loans.</hs_Para>

should listen to what StepChange tells us about the growing problem of
people being lent one unaffordable loan after another as they struggle
to pay off the loans falling due. It tells us that more than 30,000
people contacted it for help with payday loans in the first six months
of 2013—almost double the figure for the previous year. The
average amount owed on payday loans by its clients has risen to more

Council—which is dominated by the banks and other firms involved
in the payments system—decided in 2011 to abolish the cheque,
without providing any explanation of how it would provide an adequate
replacement. That was a profound mistake, and the Committee decided to
investigate. The justification for that decision looked pretty
threadbare and the abolition also carried a considerable consumer
detriment both for charities and for a lot of people who use cheques. I
did 20 radio and TV interviews on this subject after the report was
published. I asked each of the interviewers whether they had a
chequebook; 19 of them said they did and they very much wanted to keep
it. I think that brings home the value of cheques. This does not affect
only the elderly; quite a large group of people want to keep some kind
of paper-based transaction system for the time

pressure the Payments Council did a U-turn and cheques have been
retained. The Treasury Committee also looked at how such a crass
decision could have been taken in the first place. We concluded that
the explanation lay with the structure of the Payments Council itself.
Frankly, it has been little more than a poodle of the industry, and it
certainly could not reasonably claim to act on behalf of consumers. A
reasonable case can be made, however, that it is a monopoly controller
of a crucial banking service.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:10:02"></hs_TimeCode> recommended
that that responsibility for the payments system be brought within the
ambit of regulation, and we gave an outline of how that should be
achieved. Amendments 63 to 134 would implement that central

the FCA is much more responsive to the needs of consumers and

of the reason for that could be that the industry is not keen on
guidance. A lot of our payday lenders have American ownership. When I
was at a conference recently, I was harassed by some of those American
owners asking me what the rules were. I started to explain the
guidance, but they were not interested. They just wanted to know about
the rules. If something is not written down, they do not want to do it.
They do not want to be the first, or just one of a few, to do

Yes, that was irresponsible borrowing. I could see that he had been
desperate, but it was also irresponsible. The system allowed him to do
it. Had the lenders had a real-time database when they agreed to those
loans, we could have got them for irresponsible lending. Their excuse,
however, was that they did not know how many loans he had already taken
out. The lack of a database gives them an excuse to lend irresponsibly,
without penalties.</hs_Para>

sensible than going to a company such as BrightHouse. Those responsible
customers get no credit for paying back on time, however, because there
is no database and because it is not mandatory to report their

the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson), the present

they would like to get into the market, and that there is a gap for
providers of loans between £500 and £1,500 taken over six
months to a year at an interest rate of around 30%. However, the
business risk is too great, because there would be no way of knowing
whether their customers already had payday loans and when they had
taken them out. Entering such a market would add to their business
risk, and they also worry that raising their rates would involve a
degree of reputational risk.</hs_Para>

Leadsom</B> (South Northamptonshire) (Con):</Member> I rise to
congratulate the Minister on the excellent introduction of an
independent payments regulator. I am amazed that this absolute game
changer has not received more press attention, because our banking
system still, on today of all days, faces the threat of being
undermined in the eyes of consumers by its appalling behaviour. Today,
Lloyds bank has been fined £28 million for its appalling
treatment of retail customers—that is the biggest fine for
retail misconduct ever. I stress that the reason for that, as the
investigations by the Treasury Committee and the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards showed, is a profound lack of
competition in the UK banking sector. Even worse, we even have the last
great remaining closed shop, because the Payments Council regulates the
banks, yet the banks own the Payments Council, and the banks both clear
through and own the payments infrastructure. So there is no incentive
to innovate and no self-regulation, and there is a deliberate
suppression of competition. What the Minister has done by introducing
an independent payments regulator is open that can of worms. The
regulator will be a real game changer for the competitive outlook in
the UK in
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:16:25"></hs_TimeCode>, and I
wish to explain why that
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:16:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193000820" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0002.htm#13121193000820">The
proposal is for the payments regulator to look at access to the
payments system. As we know, the big clearing banks access the payments
system directly, but challenger banks such as Virgin Money, Metro Bank
and Aldermore have to go through an agency clearer. If its systems
break down, those banks cannot serve their customers. Not only that,
but because these banks have to go through the clearer to access the
payments system, they get charged up to 10 times or 20 times as much as
the clearers have to pay for one payments transaction. It is an
absolute closed shop and it is appalling.</hs_Para>

regulator’s first job will be to examine access to the payments
infrastructure and to say to the big banks, “You have to give
direct access to every player.” The big banks argue, “You
can’t do that because we all mutually underwrite one
another’s payments.” As with any other clearing system,
however, it is perfectly possible to leave a deposit up front and then
to be called for more margin should you be running out of money, so the
reason given for not allowing other banks direct access to the payments
system is a completely spurious one. That will be item No. 1, and
dealing with it will, in itself, create a completely different playing
field for all those who want to come into the banking

system; there are regulatory barriers to entry. In other words,
“If you are small, you cannot become a bank. Until you become a
bank, you cannot become big. Therefore, you cannot ever become a

I wish to put in one plea for full bank account portability. I know
that the Minister has absolutely agreed that one of the first jobs of
the new payments regulator will be to undertake a full cost-benefit
analysis of account number portability. That would mean that if I want
to switch banks in future, instead of waiting for even seven days,
having to change all my direct debits, standing orders and bank account
details, and having to be issued with new credit cards and cheque books
and so on, I would simply be able to have my bank account details
re-pointed at a new bank and so everything would remain the same. It
would be instantaneous account switching.</hs_Para>

our mobile phone account number now, we can take our phone number with
us. In a world where we had full number portability, we would also be
able to take our bank account details with us. That would be a radical
game changer for competition. New entrants could come in and attract
new business on the promise that if a consumer does not like them they
can always move somewhere else tomorrow. Banks would lie awake at night
wondering how to retain their customers through excellent customer
services rather than what next they can fleece them with, which happens
all too often now.</hs_Para>

is not the only issue. There are two other items I wish to mention. The
first is about resolution. We have put in all this effort to try to
ensure that, in future, a bank cannot fail. We have increased capital
requirements and changed the regulatory structure, which is all to the
good. None the less, we know that in future, as sure as eggs are eggs,
a bank will fail. What bank number portability will do is to give an
instant means of resolution to avoid ever seeing again queues of people

concerned about.</hs_Para>

the ability to repay. It sounds perverse that many lenders are not
primarily concerned about ability to repay. As the OFT has highlighted,
up to 50% of payday lending revenue comes from 28% of
loans—those that are unaffordable—so providing real-time

charges across the unsecured lending market, not just the payday loan

cost of payday lending, which we discussed earlier. As the shadow
Minister said, 2 January 2015 is just a back-stop. Of course I would
like to see it introduced sooner, as I think we all would. However, as
we have discussed, it is better to have a cap that works and protects
consumers, rather than one that has been forced on the regulator by an
artificial time scale. It is important to listen to the FCA, the

a gross distortion of the evidence given at the time. As the submission
makes clear, the word “extensively” was not used as a
description of Government policy, but as a description of fact about
the activities of local councils. The word “creatively”
was not used in relation to parking charges, but as an approach to
improving accountability and responsiveness in service delivery. I have
a fairly thick skin, but such a deliberate and cynical
misrepresentation is surely out of order. Will you, Madam Deputy

Obviously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:10:18"></hs_TimeCode>, the
contents of comments on Twitter are not a matter for the Chair, but if
this has occurred, it is an extreme discourtesy to the right hon.
Gentleman, and I hope that the Treasury Bench has taken note.
Ultimately, Ministers are responsible for what they say, but perhaps in
future the Minister could say it in a written answer and be accountable

familiar with this argument, because we had this debate when he was

being too cavalier in simply excising three hours of parliamentary

I was sitting in mine, when the Deputy Leader of the House rose simply
to move this motion formally, without giving any explanation of the
circumstances tomorrow whatsoever. I think the House deserves a better
explanation. I understand that tomorrow there is an important
celebration in the main Westminster Hall relating to the death of
Nelson Mandela. No doubt, that will be a wonderful occasion, and it is
right for the House to celebrate the great man’s life in that
way, but we have been given no explanation for why the sitting in the
small Westminster Hall tomorrow afternoon is to be cancelled. Is it to
do with security, logistics, staffing? I do not know. I would welcome
an intervention from the Deputy Leader of the House, if he wants to
apprise the House of the reasons, but as far as I can tell no one in
the Chamber knows why the sitting is to be cancelled.</hs_Para>

Leader of the House that the International Development Committee have

important debates on Monday afternoon from 1.30 to 4.30 or from 4.30 to
7.30? Sittings in Westminster Hall take place on Monday afternoons so

Westminster Hall as very important, and I am pretty sure that the House

proposals about the timing, for example, although I do not know whether
the International Development Committee considered that because I was
not party to the discussions. If we do not proceed with this motion,
the impact would be that the business would still appear on the Order
Paper and a Chair, Clerks and Doorkeepers would need to be on a rota to
attend tomorrow’s business even though it was not taking place.

Alan Haselhurst</B> (Saffron Walden) (Con):</Member> It was almost
three years ago, on 19 January 2011, that I last had the opportunity to
address the House on the subject of the West Anglia rail line. The line
runs from Liverpool Street to Cambridge and beyond, serving many
stations in my constituency and in other important towns and villages.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:22:17"></hs_TimeCode>In the speech
that I made in 2011, I castigated every Government from 1985 onwards
for first willing the expansion of Stansted airport—which is
served by the line—and then branding the M11 corridor, as it is
described, ripe for major development, while doing absolutely nothing
about the capacity or quality of service on a line that served all
those different needs. I regret to say that not much has changed in the
intervening years, apart from the fares that long-suffering passengers
have to pay.</hs_Para>

acknowledge that there was a timetable change in December
2011—in the teeth of opposition from Transport for London, I

there was certainly a major improvement. I also acknowledge that, as

Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs Villiers), told
me in her reply to my speech in January 2011, some of the new type 379
train units did come our way. I am not sure that that was entirely due
to my persuasion; it was probably rather more to do with the fact that
business at Stansted airport had slumped rather badly, and 10 of the 30
new train units were spared to supplement services for other passengers

could add to what my hon. Friend has said by describing my experience
this morning. At the Audley End ticket office there are two counters.
Both were closed, with a notice up to say that the one person who was
in on this particular morning would be back at 9.45, which was one
minute after the departure of the train to London. The rumour was that
the ticket agent was having a break, but that meant that there were no
tickets available to purchase except from one of the machines on the
platform, and those machines are not flexible in what they can
offer—they can only provide fairly simple fares. It would
certainly appear to be a shambles that we do not have a proper standard

might have suggested that not much has been happening, but in fact I
suspect that things are now stirring, although not necessarily in a
helpful way. The 
<?notus-xml column=321?>Mayor of London has shown great interest in acquiring control over part
of this railway. More disturbingly, my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State seems to have given assent in principle to that taking place.
The Mayor would then have control over the services to Enfield Town,
Chingford and so on, although not further up the main line between
Tottenham Hale and Broxbourne.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:31:00"></hs_TimeCode>That is
interesting, because one of the justifications for bringing together
the services out of Liverpool Street in a single franchise was that it
would make the operability of Liverpool Street more effective. If a

next point is that, to run those services, the Mayor will need some
rolling stock, and I suspect that a portion of the rolling stock
currently being operated flexibly by Greater Anglia would be painted a
different colour and handed over to the Mayor. It is not clear,
however, what would replace that rolling stock. I regard this as an
aggressive, acquisitive policy on the part of the Mayor. I am not
denying that it could be good for the people he serves, but it would
have an adverse effect on the people served by me and by

further disturbing matter, from the point of view of railway
passengers, is that Stansted airport is starting to expand again in
terms of passenger numbers, and I imagine that, under the dynamic new
ownership of the Manchester Airports Group, those numbers will continue
to rise over the next few years. That will build demand to a point at
which we will look back on the history and say to Ministers,
“Excuse us, but we would now like to have back those trains that
you allowed to run on the Cambridge line to serve the commuters, so

have no particular complaint about there being a decent rail service to
the airport; indeed, I am in favour of it. However, it could pose a
second threat to the fleet that is available to Greater Anglia. The
question would then arise: where are the substitute carriages to come
from? I am advised by Abellio that there are no trains that can
obviously be cascaded down to us. We would, I suppose, be grateful for
second-hand trains, but we have been living with second-hand trains for

line was to be welcomed. But the more one
examined<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:35:00"></hs_TimeCode> the
proposal, the more one became aware that the clue was in the
title—London First; the approach was just that, and it would not
be to the advantage of those of us who are further away from London and
rely on services on that line. London First is proposing a third track 
<?notus-xml column=322?>over a short distance north of Tottenham Hale, as much as anything to
facilitate services to Stratford. In principle, I see nothing wrong
with that, but the proposal is not going to be to the benefit of the
passengers we represent in ever-increasing numbers. It is a diversion

the most appalling disruption. In any case, I do not believe they serve
any real purpose. Four-tracking between Coppermill junction, south of
Tottenham Hale, and Broxbourne is the way in which most people’s
interests can be served. If we take our eye off that goal, we will end
up with miserable scraps. I worry that, if London First gains favour
for its proposal, which is not only inadequate but very damaging the
further north one goes, it will be all too easy for Network Rail or the
Department for Transport to say, “Job done, we have helped

it makes sense to link at Cheshunt, bringing in to the west end people
who do not necessarily want to go to the City, where Liverpool Street
station is situated. But it is not helpful to have eyes diverted from
the West Anglia line and suddenly say that we might start spending
money on Crossrail 2. I found it extraordinary that that possibility
was apparently being touted by another representative of London First
in a different forum, with the suggestion to get Crossrail 2 and then
four-track between Cheshunt and Broxbourne. That seemed entirely at
odds with what is in the main London First report. Therefore, I am not

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:41:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon) rightly points out, feel that
what they have seen are rising fares, falling standards, overcrowding
getting worse and a sense that they are being left behind. Indeed this
autumn the overcrowding has got worse. When we saw the storm, we
understood the need to close the railway lines on the day. On the
second and third days, our constituents found themselves not only
inconvenienced but without the information they needed to make
alternative arrangements. They rightly complained to us, which is why
we want to challenge and speak with the Minister.</hs_Para>

makes no sense. The good folk of Bishop’s Stortford and

is a real danger of our being diverted, as my right hon. Friend rightly
said, from the real opportunity. The core of the issue is the
funnel—the last five or six miles into Liverpool
Street—running back towards Tottenham Hale. If we solve that
capacity issue, people in London—whom I am sure the Mayor is
concerned about—Essex, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire will see
a service that is punctual and has the capacity to deal with many of
the changes in our area—an increasingly important issue, because
alongside that investment is the debate about the number of additional
homes that need to be built in our areas.</hs_Para>

not be diverted or distracted by the suggestions that we might loop one
town or another. That will not solve the central problem and that is

the Members for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk) and

recognise that demand has been growing quickly and significantly. To
explain to my right hon. and hon. Friends some of the investment that
has been made, it might be helpful to consider the line in separate
parts. Demand has been growing quickly, particularly in the lower Lea

provided approximately £80 million to 
<?notus-xml column=325?>deliver three and four-tracking at the south end of the route. That will
allow the introduction of some new services, will increase operational
reliability, and should support regeneration in the lower Lea valley. I

right hon. Friend made that point. We are taking steps to address it

operationally the best they can be.</hs_Para>

the Crossrail operation starts in 2017 there will be the chance to
introduce new connections to the West Anglia line. I recognise that
this is not in my right hon. and hon. Friends’ constituencies,
but to suggest that the Government have done nothing about the line is
not exactly true as there has been investment in new stations at the

overcrowding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121193002011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/debtext/131211-0003.htm#13121193002011">With<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:54:41"></hs_TimeCode>

I highlighted at the beginning, I recognise that there is a key

Unfortunately, if we look at it in the short term, that is unbelievably
expensive. The plans developed by BAA in 2007, when it ran Stansted
airport and there was higher demand, merely to three-track a section of
the route were estimated to cost between £800 million and
£1 billion. At the moment, such investment would represent a
significant portion of the Government’s rail investment budget.
It would therefore require a robust business case. In the medium term,
that business case might be made, but my right hon. Friend was right to
acknowledge that the Government are spending more on railway
infrastructure—£19 billion between 2014 and 2019. None

times the problems we had with the storm a few weeks back. I
particularly remember travelling on that line all those years ago when
it was one of the worst-hit lines. I think he will recognise that in
certain places a large number of trees overhang the line, more so than
on many other commuter routes, simply because of its structure. I am
afraid that there was also a certain amount of overhead line damage
that significantly delayed the reintroduction of services. None the
less, he can be assured that the Secretary of State and I, and other

annual net immigration figure under Labour rose from 48,000 in 1997 to
198,000 by 2009. Between 1997 and 2010, net migration into Great
Britain totalled 2.2 million people—more than twice the
population of Birmingham. It is no wonder we had a crisis. Members on
both sides of the House know that immigration is not just a population
problem; it is also an NHS, education and welfare problem. Government
figures cited in <I>The Sunday Telegraph</I> last week show that, on
average, each immigrant costs the taxpayer more than £8,000 a
year in health care, education and benefits. That applies whether they

60% in social housing waiting lists. Foreign nationals now occupy 8.4%
of the housing stock, and among 
<?notus-xml column=74?>those aged 16 to 40 the figure is 12.6%. On the Isle of Wight we have a
relatively small immigrant population, and overwhelmingly those

me describe a personal experience. Last Friday, when I was conducting
one of my regular advice surgeries, I was talking to a Romanian citizen
currently living in the UK. She is a student and is making a
significant contribution to our local economy in Sheffield. She was
volunteering for AIESEC, which is a student society committed to
promoting business, finding business placements, developing skills in
an industrial and commercial context and growing global-minded
entrepreneurs. She was enthusiastic when she came to Britain, but she
was deeply depressed by the public discourse around Romania and
Bulgaria and their citizens, which made her feel unwelcome. I think we
need to take care how we debate the issue, not only for her sake and
others’, but also for the sake of all those UK citizens who have
raised concerns, of which all hon. Members have experience, about
immigration. They deserve proper leadership from us as politicians,
which means being honest about the facts and coming up with the right
solutions to the real

have some sympathy with the Minister. He was right a couple of weeks
ago to talk down the fear of a mass influx of Romanians and Bulgarians.
He will not be surprised, however, that I have only some sympathy. Much
of the problem has been created through the Government talking up the
problems of migration for political advantage. We need an honest
debate. We have heard a lot of noise, some of which was reflected in
the speech by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T09:49:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Isle of Wight, about benefits for newly arriving EU migrants. The
impression being given is that EU migrants are freeloaders who come
simply to claim our benefits and to exploit our generosity. However,
all the evidence, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, suggests that
EU migrants make a net fiscal contribution.</hs_Para>

published last month by the centre for research and analysis of
migration—CReAM—at University college London, which is
one of our country’s greatest universities and one of the
world’s leading universities. It concluded that recent
immigrants—those who arrived after 1999, who constituted 33% of
the overall immigrant population in 2011—were 45% less likely to
receive state benefits or tax credits than UK natives. Over the same
period, recent European economic area immigrants have on average
contributed 34% more in taxes than they have received in transfers. By
contrast, over the same period, the total of UK natives’ tax
payments were 11% lower than the transfers they received.</hs_Para>

the most talented migrants. In 2011, 32% of EEA immigrants and 43% of
non-EEA immigrants had university degrees. The estimated net fiscal
contribution of immigrants increases even more if we consider that
immigration helps to share the total cost of fixed public expenditure
among a larger pool.</hs_Para>

reasons for the large net fiscal contribution of recent EEA immigrants
are their higher average labour market participation than UK natives
and their lower receipt of welfare benefits. Professor Christian

migration—CReAM—and the co-author of the study,

research shows that in contrast with most other European countries, the
UK attracts highly educated and skilled immigrants from within the EEA
as well as from outside. What’s more, immigrants who arrived
since 2000 have made a very sizeable net fiscal contribution and
therefore helped to reduce the fiscal burden on UK-born workers. Our
study also suggests that over the last decade or so the UK has
benefited fiscally from immigrants from EEA countries, who have put in
considerably more in taxes and contributions than they received in
benefits and transfers. Given this evidence, claims about
‘benefit tourism’ by EEA
immigrants”—</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13121175000044" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000044">that

example of the Government talking up the migration issue but
introducing measures that damage the economy by targeting the wrong
issue is on the issue of international students. The Minister will not
be surprised to hear me speaking about that again. I agree that the
Government are right, as were the previous Government, to clamp down on
bogus students who not only are exploiting our system, but are
themselves in many cases exploited by bogus colleges. However, overall,
international students bring huge benefits to the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121175000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000046">Oxford
Economics conducted research on behalf of the university of Sheffield,
which looked at the students’ net contribution after all costs
to public services—such as traffic congestion and everything
else it could think of. The survey was published in January 2013 and
showed that during the previous academic year the 8,000-plus
international students at our two universities made a net total
contribution of more than £120 million to the Sheffield economy.
Probably about 6,000, 7,000 or 8,000 local jobs depend on
those students. Furthermore, the net benefits generated by the indirect
supply chain advantages were assumed to account for approximately an
additional £22 million to the local economy. International
students obviously bring further external benefits, such as boosts to
demand as a consequence of increased familiarity with locally produced
goods and the potential for our status as a city and a country to be
boosted  by the relationship that they build while they are
in  the UK.</hs_Para>

students are a growing market internationally. The Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills has calculated that by 2020 the market
could double. Instead of being worth £8 billion to our economy,
it could be worth £16 billion; instead of 6,000 jobs in
Sheffield, it could be 12,000 jobs. Currently, international student
numbers are flatlining, while our competitor countries are taking
advantage of some of the measures that this Government have put in
place. We should be concerned about that.</hs_Para>

happening in the labour market. My concern is that he did not focus on
the things that can be done to address issues in the labour market. The
Minister for Immigration made a useful contribution before the Home
Affairs Committee this week when he was challenged about a statement
from the head of Domino’s Pizza about why it was unable to
recruit sufficiently from within the UK domestic work force. The
Minister rightly made the point that the company should perhaps look at
its employment conditions and 
<?notus-xml column=79?>wages. It would be helpful to consider positive labour market
interventions that can create the sort of level playing field that the

Minister for Immigration (Mr Mark Harper):</Member></B> To be clear, it
is worse than the hon. Gentleman suggests. The chief executive of
Domino’s Pizza was not arguing that he could not recruit in the
UK alone. He was arguing that he could not recruit enough people from
the whole EU labour pool, and that we needed to start importing
low-skilled workers from outside the EU in order that he could keep low
wages in his business. That is why I said he perhaps ought to reflect
on the terms and conditions. So he was arguing that we should have an
unrestricted free-for-all, but I do not think it is the role of
Government policy to let multinationals keep wages low when, frankly,
they should pay their staff a little more.</hs_Para>

Blomfield:</Member></B> I agree entirely with the Minister on that
point. We should ensure that multinationals pay wages that will attract
people to do the jobs. We should also ensure that companies do not
recruit exclusively from eastern Europe, as they seek to do. Jobs
should be available to local workers in the market. We should also do
more to ensure that companies that flout the minimum wage rules are
prosecuted. The number of businesses that are fined for employing
illegal workers has halved, plummeting from more than 2,000 in 2009 to
a little more than 1,000 in 2012. We can talk positively about those
sorts of labour market interventions to address many of our
concerns.</hs_Para>

conclude by commenting on something that the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight said about a constituent, who is concerned about the way in which
their community has been transformed by the influx of migrants. I am
sure that if we look back in 50-year snapshots, we will find that
people have always expressed such concerns. I am sure that they
expressed concerns about my wife’s family, who came across from
Ireland to supplement the work force in the UK. I was brought up in
Sheffield in the 1960s and it was a relatively monocultural city. The
city in which I have brought up my son in the 1990s is stronger, richer
and better for having welcomed people from around the world—some
to build better lives, some fleeing persecution. I am proud that we are
the country’s first city of
sanctuary.</hs_Para>

that it is a dereliction of duty on the part of Her Majesty’s
Government not even to attempt an estimate of the numbers of people who
may come in from Romania and Bulgaria on 1 January. I can understand
politically why the Government have decided not to publish an estimate:
they do not want to make the horrendous mistake of the previous Labour
Government, who said that the number of immigrants from the  A8
eastern European countries would be only 13,000 a year. I understand
that the population that has come in is 1.1 million and climbing. If
people from Romania and Bulgaria come in at the same rate, we will be
looking at a figure of 425,000 Romanians and Bulgarians—a number
with which, I would suggest, our country cannot cope.</hs_Para>

Saturday night I was on duty outside Piccadilly Circus underground

Kettering, where green fields are being built over to provide
the homes that we will inevitably need if we fail to stem the influx of
people to our shores. As my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight
said, the issue is not just immigration. It is the NHS,
schools— far too many primary school children do not
have English as their first language—and all the pressures on
our local public services. Frankly, those services need to be

Julian Huppert</B> (Cambridge) (LD):</Member> It is a pleasure to
follow the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone), whom I thought
made an excellent case for investment in public transport. I hope the
Transport Secretary was listening to him.</hs_Para>

the hon. Gentleman on one other issue: when I talk to businesses in my
constituency of Cambridge, immigration is one of the issues they raise
most often. They have huge concerns about the processes and about the
times when it is harder to get people in—for example, when it is
hard for people to whom those businesses wish to sell in the US to get
into the country because they are Chinese nationals. That is hitting
our economy, and we need to work on it as a priority, to make sure that
we can get people into this country who will benefit the economy. I
thank the Minister for coming to talk to a small handful of such people
recently. There have been some improvements.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121175000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000064">Overall,
immigration is a good thing: it benefits us socially, culturally and
economically. There are associated problems—it is not an
unalloyed triumph—and there are constraints in terms of housing
needs, schools and many other matters. But when we net it all together
we find a substantial benefit from immigration—I am not talking
about a completely open border but well-managed and well-controlled
immigration. It is a huge positive.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121175000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000065">There is much
we could do to reduce the associated problems. For example, we could
run more programmes to make sure that people are able to learn to speak
English. It is a shame that the Government cut back English classes for
some new immigrants a few years ago, although work is going on now to
remedy that. It would be good for people to be able to communicate in
our language: it would help them and would also help the state. There
are also concerns about people in the UK not being able to find
employment. We should  
<?notus-xml column=82?>therefore be training people in the UK better. I agree completely with
that, but it does not mean that we should not also have
immigration.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121175000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000066">The way the
rhetoric on this issue has been going is a real danger. It scares
people—I am not surprised that the constituents of the hon.
Member for Kettering are so concerned when he and so many others tell
them they ought to be. But it does us harm when we use that rhetoric:
when people overseas are looking for where to invest and where the best
and the brightest should be going—where people pay huge amounts
of money to study—they will look at the rhetoric on this issue
in the UK and they will be worried. We are in danger of appearing
isolated and closed off, and so missing out on all the benefits we
could have.</hs_Para>

the Home Affairs Committee I asked the Minister about the balance of
competences report into freedom of movement. I agree with the hon.
Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) that there is a lot of
evidence—the best I am aware of is the UCL study he
cited—showing that we have seen over £20 billion of net
benefit from EU migration. I am sure the numbers are not exact, but
that is a very substantial contribution. I would love to hear from the
Minister—slightly more accurately than in the masterful answer
he gave yesterday—when that report will come
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121175000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000068">This
debate feels a little like a rerun. Many of us have been in such
debates many times: the Immigration Bill Committee; the Select
Committee yesterday; and indeed in this Chamber on 22 October, when the
hon. Member for Witham (Priti Patel) played the role the hon. Member
for Isle of Wight (Mr Turner) is playing today. Many of the comments
were the same; my first intervention was almost exactly the same then
as the one I made today, and was made for the same
reasons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121175000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000069">I
do not think that the previous Government got everything wrong, but
they did not get everything right. There was too much abuse and too
many loopholes, student migration being an example. I agree with the
hon. Member for Sheffield Central that student migration is important,
but we definitely saw people coming through to bogus colleges. The
previous Government also did not do enough to control the people I
blame for many of the problems we face, namely rogue immigration
advisers—people who give dud advice. That shows how complex the
system is, which is another issue we have to work on.</hs_Para>

Minister today as I have many times before that the most important
thing he can do has nothing to do with changing any laws or with
anything in the Immigration Bill: it is to get the UK Border Agency,
now within the Home Office, to work better. He will be well aware of
all the criticisms and problems and the amount of work that has to be
done. I also know that he intends to deal with the matter; no Minister
would want to run an organisation with such a huge number of problems
and complaints. Some 92% of complaints made about the Home Office to
the ombudsman are upheld, and they are almost all to do with the
workings of the UK Border Agency.</hs_Para>

the Border Agency will do more than anything else that has been
suggested could do. For example, landlord pilots have been
suggested—we rehearsed the arguments about those in the
Immigration Bill Committee. I disagree with them. The Bill Committee
compromised on having a single pilot, although the 
<?notus-xml column=83?>right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson) wanted to have five, helpfully
listing Lambeth, Derbyshire, Flintshire, Glasgow and Belfast, as he
thought that was perfectly acceptable. We disagree on that but we have
rehearsed those arguments, and it will be interesting to see the
results of that one pilot.</hs_Para>

Committee we also rehearsed the arguments about child detention. It is
a source of great shame for the previous Government that more than
7,000 children were detained in the last five years of their time in
office, one of them for 190 days. I argued in the Bill Committee that
we should put a measure on the statute book about child
detention—I hope the Minister will continue to deal with the
issue in the helpful manner of his previous comments. I was surprised
to hear the former Labour Minister, the hon. Member for Hackney South
and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier), defend child detention; she said that
some of her constituents would be “envious” of the
conditions at Yarl’s Wood detention centre, which was a rather
surprising comment.</hs_Para>

be done, but ultimately it comes down to the basic question: how do we
get things right? How do we make sure that we do not spend hundreds of
thousands of pounds trying to remove an ill man—again, the
Minister was questioned about this case yesterday— such as Isa
Muazu? Surely we can think of better things on which to spend such
sums. We should try to promote international business, so that people
who want to try products made in Britain can get into the country to do
so and find out whether they want to buy them.</hs_Para>

promote students and do what we can not to make it easier for other
countries to compete. I talked to the Minister about charging for the
NHS. He is right in saying that other countries charge students more to
use their health service than we do here, but any marginal step that
makes it easier for other countries to compete will make it harder for
our students. I hope the Minister will
reconsider.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121175000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000075">We
must change some policies, principally the operation of our visa and
immigration system, to ensure that the right people can get in and the
wrong people cannot. Those decisions should be made quickly and
promptly. We must ensure that our rhetoric shows that we are welcoming

I have always contributed more to society than I have taken. I have
built up a successful business, paid my taxes, raised my family and now
have the privilege of representing my country and my community in
Parliament. The vast majority of individuals who come to the United
Kingdom do so, like me, because they want a better life for themselves
and their families. They want to make a contribution to society. Let us
therefore continue to welcome those who wish to contribute to our

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T10:16:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr Turner) on securing this timely
debate. He described the change that has taken place in this country,
on which the British people were not consulted. I refer particularly to
the free movement of labour under the European
Union.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121175000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000090">I
am old enough to have taken part in the 1975 referendum when,
thankfully, I voted no—I say “thankfully”, but it
came to nothing of course. I do not recall that free movement of labour
ever played a significant part in that debate. Indeed, had it done so,
I am sure that it would have been glossed over by the leaders of all
political parties at that time; they assured us that the United Kingdom
would have a veto and that we had nothing to fear. Clearly, we were
misled, to put it mildly. Unfortunately, the British people fear that
their political leaders are not taking note of their
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121175000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000091">My
part of the United Kingdom has a small immigrant population. The two
local authority areas that make up my constituency have 5% and 3%
non-British populations. The latest figures from the Office for
National Statistics show that 7% of those in north Lincolnshire and 4%
in north-east Lincolnshire were born outside the UK. Those figures are
remarkably low compared with many parts of the country, but that does
not alter the fact that immigration is the No. 1 issue on the
doorstep.</hs_Para>

concerned. To say that they fear change is putting it too strongly, but
they are certainly concerned about change. One role of the political
process is to manage change, and one reason why people believe the
political process is failing them at the moment is that change is
coming so quickly that Governments throughout the world find it
extremely difficult to manage that
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121175000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000093">My
constituents are not opposed to all immigration, and they recognise the
important part that existing communities play in voluntary and
charitable organisations, churches and the work force. Spanish nurses
have recently been recruited at our two local hospitals. People
recognise that they bring a skill and can see the value of that. They
may regret that we do not have enough trained nurses in our own work
force, but they see an obvious advantage in recruiting Spanish nurses,
so they are prepared to accept
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121175000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0001.htm#13121175000094">However,
my constituents can also see the tensions only 50 miles down the road
in Boston. They are reported on regularly on the regional television
news and that causes concerns. We as politicians and as Governments in
particular bury our heads in the sand if 
<?notus-xml column=86?>we do not recognise that we are not serving the best interests of those
we represent if we allow unlimited immigration into our provincial
towns and cities. Places such as Boston and other provincial towns find
it much more difficult to integrate than a large multicultural city
does. London is the exception, but the point can equally be applied to,
say, Birmingham or Manchester.</hs_Para>

opinion is clear in this country and if we go by media reports in
France, Germany and elsewhere in the EU, populations there are equally

to visit my constituency in July. We saw then the Border Force’s
excellent work and looked at how the considerable container traffic

our electorate—I suggest that this applies in Cambridge and
Sheffield just as it does in Cleethorpes, Immingham and the towns that
I represent—would like that transitional period to be
unilaterally extended. I suspect that the Minister will not stand up in
a minute or two’s time and say, “Yes, we entirely agree
with that and that is exactly what we are going to do”, but we
must have more robust action, otherwise the Government and we

the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr Turner), not only for securing this

said, this is the most important issue facing our constituents. My
constituents in Aldershot are constantly raising the issue of
immigration with me. They feel that nobody is speaking up for them and
that they are on their own. Indeed, they preface all their remarks by
saying, “I am not a racist, but—”. They then go on
to express opinions that are denounced by our opponents as racist, so
they have felt intimidated from expressing their perfectly legitimate
and perfectly honourable concerns about how they see their country has
been transformed.</hs_Para>

the Member for Braintree  (Mr Newmark) rejoices in being an
immigrant; I rejoice in tracing my roots to nowhere else but into the
soil of this kingdom. What my hon. Friend needs to understand about the
wave of migration, which has so upset the people of this country, is
that between 1066 and 1950, we had about a quarter of a million
migrants to this country. We have now seen a massive change, with
something like 8 million people coming into this country. The numbers
are what is upsetting people. It is not necessarily the colour of
people’s skin, although, of course, that brings different
cultural challenges. It is the numbers—that is what Enoch Powell
was trying to draw attention to in 1968, for which, of course, he got
roundly traduced.</hs_Para>

briefly on the practical effect. As MigrationWatch has pointed out,
there is massive pressure on housing and services. We are constantly
reading in newspapers that house prices are going up. Of course they
are—there is a shortage of supply and an increase in demand.
Where are all these 100,000 Somalis going to be accommodated? Where
will all the incoming people from Romania and Bulgaria be
accommodated?</hs_Para>

building houses, and why not? In part, because our constituents feel
that we are already full up in our communities, so there is a massive
challenge there. As MigrationWatch has said, we will need to build the
equivalent of eight of the largest cities outside the capital in 15
years. For the next 20 years, we will need to build a new home every
seven minutes, night and day, just for the new migrants and their
families, because it calculated that the UK population will reach 70
million in the next 15 years. Parliament cannot allow itself to ignore
those massive pressures on our country.</hs_Para>

point is about the cultural considerations. I do not know when I was
ever given the opportunity to vote on diversity. Everybody said,
“What a wonderful thing diversity is.” Personally, I
happen not to like curry, but I understand that many people do. Indeed,
I represent the garrison town of Aldershot—I am proud so to
do—and the Army seems to eat nothing but curry. That makes my

has been a mask to distract attention from people’s concerns
that their own way of life has been changed. One of the interesting
things about the latest wave of migration is how those new migrants to
our country are not content simply to accept our way of life, our
customs or even our laws. That is wholly contrary to the practice
adopted by previous waves of migration to this country—most of
which, of course, one has to say, have been from other European

adopt certain practices—not to drink and not to show affection
in public—because “This is an Islamic area.” In

assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police said last week that

migration into this country. We have a growing threat to our way of
life. There is a man called Anjem Choudary whom I have denounced in

right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to ban it. She has said that she
will not, but I think that there is a very strong case that the wearing
of the burqa should be banned in courts and where people are
encountering officials. After all, if a young lad goes into a shop

in view of the potential for Romanian and Bulgarian immigration from 1

authorities to step up enforcement, and I want fines for non-compliance

the potential for a move in that direction. It is not acceptable for

Friend the Member for Sheffield Central mentioned recruitment agencies.
As we discussed in the Immigration Bill Committee, there are websites
on which people try, in contravention of the Equality Act 2010, to
recruit staff solely from eastern Europe or, increasingly, from
southern Italy. I do not think that that is fair or right, and we
should look at measures to outlaw such recruitment. In my constituency,
local people cannot access vacancies in certain factories because staff
are recruited solely from eastern Europe. That has to be wrong, and we
should deal with that labour market issue.</hs_Para>

agrees, because he has mentioned beds in sheds. We need to end the
practice of shifts of people in the same accommodation sleeping for
eight hours, working for eight hours and spending eight hours on the
street, as happens in my constituency and in many others. We must take
action to tackle that, because it undercuts the UK labour market and
exploits those who come here legitimately for work.</hs_Para>

representations from businesses—I even met some this
morning—through London First and others. They tell me that, as
the hon. Member for Cambridge and my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield 
<?notus-xml column=92?>Central have said, we need to attract people from the student community
abroad, to ensure that they not only bring fees and spending power to
the country but carry the good will of this country with them into
their future work. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, or the future
chairmen or chief executives of businesses abroad, will look back on
their time in the UK with fond memories. That is an unseen export that
we should contribute towards.</hs_Para>

to attracting students, we must also focus on tourism. I discovered
last week that Chinese tourism is worth £103 billion to the rest
of the world, but in this country we benefit from only £300
million of that amount. We need to increase our share of that market.
To give credit where it is due—I try to be fair—the Prime
Minister has tried to do just that. We must not ignore the fact that
immigration is not only about eastern Europe; it is about opening our
borders to allow people to get in for tourism purposes and to spend
their money. I agree that we also need to look at business issues,
which are important. If someone wants to come here to invest £1
million or £2 million in creating a business, we must allow them
to.</hs_Para>

view of the hon. Member for Cleethorpes that integration is extremely
important. In many of our towns and cities, including my constituency,
the sudden influx of people speaking different languages in
supermarkets and on the streets has created tensions, which I hope will
ease with time. We must look at how we can maximise the benefits of
Europe while having fair and appropriate immigration
controls.</hs_Para>

to say that we must ensure that we have strong borders. The report
“The Border Force: securing the border”, published
yesterday by the Public Accounts Committee, raised some criticism. No
one says that the problem is easy to deal with; it was not easy when we
were in charge and it is not easy now. We need to look at strong border
controls. We need to ensure that those who have been through the system
and have failed the residency test are removed from the United Kingdom
in a fair way. We need to ensure that people who come here integrate
and speak English and that we have a proper and effective immigration
system.</hs_Para>

think, however, with due respect to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight
and some others who have spoken today, that closing our borders in the
way they have described by repatriating powers would be a good thing. I
do not think that putting up a “Britain is shut” sign
will help the economy or the residents of the country, however long
they have been here, in the long term.</hs_Para>

grateful for the Minister’s response to the points I have
raised. There are real steps that the Government could take, but are
not taking, to deal with labour market issues, which would assuage some

Friend the Member for Isle of Wight was right to highlight the failure
of the previous Labour Government, and one can argue about whether that
was the result of a conspiracy or a cock-up. The former Home Secretary,
the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw) leans towards the view
that a “spectacular mistake”, in his words, was made. A
significant number of people came into the country when the previous
Labour Government were in power, which is partly why people have
concerns. It was partly to do with the fact that at time of the eastern
European accession, we were the only major country to have no
transitional controls, so most of those who left their own countries to
work came to Britain.</hs_Para>

remembering, however, that eastern Europe was not where the largest
number of people came from. During the Labour party’s time in
office, more than twice as many migrants came from outside the European
Union. Although the shadow Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for
Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), was presented
with that information in a clear graphical format during a recent
edition of “Sunday Politics”, and she was sitting right
in front  of the screen, she denied that it is true. I am
afraid it is, however. Although the Labour party may argue that it made
some mistakes on eastern European migration, in an area in which it had
complete control over who came to the United Kingdom, it failed. That
is behind many people’s concerns, so we have tried to
demonstrate that we are able to take tough decisions to reassure
people.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers) said that even in an
area such as his constituency where immigration is low, people see
significant numbers of migrants from eastern Europe in neighbouring

numbers of people who have immigrated in a relatively short space of
time and how successfully they have integrated. That is why we have to
address those concerns.</hs_Para>

the Member for Isle of Wight. Two things are worth remembering. First,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T10:51:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Kettering was concerned that we will see a repeat of
what happened in 2004, but the situation now is different, because in
2004 we were the only country to have no transitional controls. This
time, we have had such controls and at the end  of September,
the controls of eight other European countries—including large
countries with successful economies, such as Germany—will expire
at the same time as ours. We are not the only country that will have a
policy change. Secondly, 48% of immigrants come from outside the EU,
36% come from within the EU and 15% of the people coming to Britain are
British citizens who have lived overseas for more than a year who are
returning home or who have never lived here. It is worth putting the
numbers into perspective.</hs_Para>

immigration policy, our welfare policy and our education and training

tougher immigration policy; a tougher welfare policy that encourages
people to work and contribute; and an increase in the number of
apprenticeships and more rigour in schools. In the five years to
December 2008, under the previous Government, when there was economic
growth and jobs were being created, more than 90% of the increase in

I am pleased that the United Kingdom is playing its part, too. It is
very appropriate that legislators in this country should highlight
international anti-corruption day, because we are in a particularly

places far removed from the UK, such as Nigeria, Afghanistan and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. While those might be the sites of
theft and where the devastating consequences impact on people, the
deals themselves might be taking place just down the road from
Parliament, in our capital city. In truth, corrupt officials in
developing countries would find it much harder to steal from their
citizens if they were unable to use the tools provided by international
business, which includes UK citizens, UK-based companies and those
listed on the London stock exchange. Those are all elements over which
we can exercise some control. We are rightly proud of our aid spending
in this country, and I strongly welcome the Chancellor’s
confirmation in Budget 2013 that the Government intend to meet and
build on Labour’s legacy, which was to set the UK’s
historic target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas
aid.</hs_Para>

countries’ dependence on aid. To do so, we have to look in our

impact on international poverty. Western business frameworks facilitate
illicit financial flows out of Africa. Shockingly, those flows outweigh
the amounts that those countries receive from aid and foreign direct
investment. We have the power to prevent that, but until we do so, we

consider the role of western countries in this scandal, let us take a
hypothetical example. A corrupt Minister tenders the mining rights to
his country’s substantial mineral wealth. A multinational
company guarantees winning the tender by sweetening its application
with a large bribe. It most likely does so using a shell company to
provide anonymity and an almost total guarantee that the money will be
unrecoverable by officials. Alternatively, perhaps the Government sell
the mines directly to a recently registered company with no employees,
premises or registered activities. The Minister oversees the sale of
the assets at as little as 5% of their market value, and the company
then sells the assets on for a hefty profit, making sure that the
corrupt Minister is well compensated personally for his generous deal.
The shell company hides the often overly close relationship between the
individual buying the assets and the person selling them, and corporate

is important that beneficial owners are required to provide information

with other registers, such as those of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency or the passport authority. Where company ownership is not
direct, individuals should be asked to explain how they exercise

reasonable time period.

This register of beneficial ownership should not be an onerous burden

banks’ due diligence officers, civil society groups,
investigative journalists and foreign law enforcement officials to use
the information on it, but for companies themselves to register the

target, culling is liable to make the incidence of bovine TB worse
because of the impact of perturbation? Given that the current
performance in the pilot zones could only be improved by the use of
cage trapping, surely the Minister will agree that the pilot has failed

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T15:32:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman for his helpful intervention. I agree with him absolutely,
and I am familiar with the Sussex badger vaccination project. As he
rightly said, it is a service run by volunteers to offer landowners and
farmers in East Sussex the chance to vaccinate badgers at very low
cost, thereby providing a humane and less controversial method of
tackling the disease. It has said that there is strong evidence
that a programme of badger vaccination, combined with a robust cattle
control programme, will produce better medium and long-term results
than culling in eradicating bovine TB. It has many volunteers on hand
to do that. It is just one example of how we could, with the right
political commitment, take action that would make real gains in
reducing bovine TB and its terrible consequences for our
farmers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000144">The
cost of the culls has spiralled out of control when the increased cost
of cage trapping and expenditure on policing is taken into account.
Based on analysis of DEFRA’s estimates, badger vaccination would
cost the equivalent of £2,250 per sq km per year compared with
the estimated £2,400 price tag per sq km for the pilot culls.
Vaccination is the cheaper option and many other figures show that
culling is even more expensive than the DEFRA figure that I
cited.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000145">My
second reason, and the last point I want to make, is that vaccination
works. It reduces the probability of infection by 70 to 75%, even
allowing for the fact that not all badgers will be reached and that
vaccination needs repeating year on year to include new cubs. It is
still more effective and more cost effective than shooting,

because of this dreadful disease, which causes a painful death for
badgers and other wildlife. Last year, 28,000 cattle were compulsorily

Friend quoted Lord Krebs as saying that the “crazy
scheme” of badger culling had got “even crazier”.
As we have heard, the two pilots carried out in the west country have
been a complete shambles, and the worst thing is that that was utterly
predictable. The aim of the pilots was to kill 70% of the badger
population in the chosen areas, but in Somerset, only 58% had been
killed at the end of six weeks, while 64% had been killed at the 
<?notus-xml column=122?>end of the extended cull period. In Gloucestershire, it was even less

39% had been killed at the end of the 11 weeks and two days after it
was extended.</hs_Para>

are based on the figures that the Government came up with after the
pilots had already started, when they dramatically revised down the
estimates of the number of badgers in the cull areas. Somewhat
mysteriously, the number of badgers estimated to be in the Somerset
area had fallen from 2,490 to 1,450, and in Gloucestershire, from 3,400
to 2,350. That simply looks like pure guesswork, yet back in October

As we have heard, extending the culls beyond the original six-week time
frame could be very dangerous for farmers. We have heard about
perturbation and the fact that if less than 70% of the population is
killed, traumatised badgers will be moving out of cull areas. The
longer the pilot culls and the shooting are going on, the more likely
badgers are to do so, and potentially they could spread TB to

also want to talk briefly about the comparative costs of culling versus

vaccination programme works with farmers who would prefer to vaccinate
badgers on their land. They have vaccinated 140 badgers, which works
out at £83 per badger, of which the group charges
£25 per badger to the farmer. The group said that if
DEFRA is prepared to cage-trap the badgers, it will cover the cost of
vaccinating the badgers at a cost to the group of £14.50 each
for the vaccine. Is the Minister prepared to consider that

Ministers pressed ahead with the cull, despite scientists warning
against that untested and risky approach. Instead, what we need is a
science-led policy to manage cattle movements better and a vaccine to
tackle TB in cattle. The Government have now been warned for
more than two years that the badger cull was bad for farmers, bad for
taxpayers and bad for wildlife. However, the cull has not
helped to resolve the issue at all. Based on recent evidence,
culling clearly does not work. Culling risks spreading the

to me that the Government’s policy does not make sense. Instead,
they should be implementing a science-led strategy in the fight to
reduce bovine TB, including the use of vaccination. In contrast, the
Government, I believe, are still proposing to shoot free-moving badgers
as the main method of culling. The Government say that the vaccine is
not ready. Why is that? It could be because one of the first acts of
the Government in 2010 was to cancel five of the six vaccine
field trials commissioned by Labour. Also, DEFRA has cut funding for
the research and development of a badger vaccine and a cattle vaccine.

the Zoological Society of London, and Professor Rosie Woodroffe and I
came up with a proposal to establish a vaccination programme
that was community-led, volunteer-led, using the big society approach,

us—it is doing so in a rather minuscule way, I am sorry to say,
but at least it is a start—in providing the vaccine ampoules
during the whole programme, up to 2019. This is across 200 sq km of
Penwith. We have strong buy-in by the local community. The farmers are
coming on board. We have undertaken a pilot in the area. Indeed, I have
been out to oversee that and I can confirm, as a result of having been

finds that they are not effective? It is not even there in terms of
judging whether the cull is effective in controlling bovine TB, because
it would take years to undertake that. Also, I understand that the
independent expert panel has been given only a six-week window; it is
looking only at the six weeks. I hope—I have asked the Minister

vaccination is probably about 10 years away, and the
situation is not much different today. It is possible to vaccinate
badgers; I am told that in Wales, it costs about £662 per

Members have referred to different types of vaccinations. I think they
are great, and I hope that the Minister will tell us that he is open to
all such suggestions. We want a way of dealing with a hugely complex
issue that causes the death of huge numbers of perfectly healthy
animals, which disrupts and causes massive distress to a huge number of
farming families, and which disrupts and causes disease among our
wildlife. We need a way of dealing with this. In the short term, I
think we need a targeted pilot cull to make certain that we know that
going down the cull route is the best way to deliver what we

like to mention the contributions of others of various parties who made
significant points in favour of vaccination. I pay particular tribute
to the hon. Member for St Albans (Mrs Main), who made it clear that she
had changed her mind based on the evidence. She made a passionate
contribution, demanding that the matter should be brought back to the
Floor of the House of Commons, debated in full in Government time and
put to the vote. As she said, I think the outcome of such a vote would
be very different from the previous one.</hs_Para>

Government’s badger culls have been an expensive failure for
farmers, for taxpayers and for wildlife. For the Prime Minister and
DEFRA Ministers to pretend otherwise is to ignore the evidence. In
2012, the culls had to be abandoned because the number of badgers had
been counted wrongly, which is a pretty fundamental mistake. There were
too many badgers. This year, the badgers have been miscounted again.
This time there were too few, but with no satisfactory explanation,
which conveniently allowed the Government to revise the targets
downwards. That numbers problem should not have been a surprise to
Ministers, because in November 2012, 30 leading scientists wrote to the
Secretary of State objecting to the culls and
noting:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13121190000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000329">“Setting

estimates of badger population numbers for the first two culls have
been repeatedly wide of the mark. For the Secretary of State to add
insult to injury by talking nonsense about badgers moving the goal
posts was ridiculous. That is not good enough, when there is a risk of
spreading tuberculosis by culling too few badgers or eradicating an
entire local population by killing too many. The first two
pilots, failures as they have unarguably been, have at least taught us
one important lesson. We can have no confidence whatsoever in the
accuracy of badger population estimates. That knowledge reveals a risk
of perturbation or of localised extermination. On that basis alone,
until sound population baseline analysis is undertaken, we cannot
proceed with these culls, let alone the further 40 that the Government
desire.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=129?>avoid an increased risk of perturbation. At that point, the Government
should have stopped, in accordance with their own guidance and the
Secretary of State’s words. There was no grey area, but they
turned their backs on the science. They extended one cull by 42 days

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (George Eustice):</Member></B> I congratulate
the hon. Member for Derby North (Chris Williamson) on securing what has
been a lively debate. I welcome the opportunity to outline to hon.
Members the Government’s strategy to eradicate bovine
tuberculosis and the role that a targeted badger cull can play in that
strategy. As my hon. Friend the Member for The Cotswolds (Geoffrey
Clifton-Brown) set out, we should first recognise the huge impact that
the disease is having on the farming industry. Our farming communities
continue to suffer as a result of the spread of bovine TB. In the 10
years to 31 December 2012, more than 305,000 cattle were
compulsorily slaughtered as a result of the disease. Statistics
published only today show that a further 24,600 cattle were slaughtered
up until the end of September, solely as a result of bovine TB. Over
the past 10 years, the disease has cost the Government more than
£500 million, and it is estimated that it will cost taxpayers
another £1 billion in the next decade if we do
nothing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000216">Let
me start by saying that no one, least of all me, wants to kill badgers.
I recognise the sentiment that many people feel towards the animals. As
my right hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir
John Randall) said, that feeling is shared by many people in the
country, and we recognise and understand that. If there were an easy
way to tackle bovine TB, we would have done it. There are no easy
answers when it comes to reversing the spread of bovine TB, and there
is no example in the world of a country that has successfully tackled
TB without also dealing with the reservoir of the disease in the
wildlife population. In Australia, a national eradication programme
spanning almost three decades enabled the achievement in 1997 of
official freedom from bovine TB and an infection rate of less than
0.2%. The comprehensive package of measures included a cull of feral
water buffalo. The comprehensive and successful package of measures to
eradicate the disease in New Zealand focused on the primary wildlife
reservoir of brushtail possums. As a result of those efforts, New
Zealand is in the verge of achieving bovine TB-free status. Closer to
home, the Irish Republic has also had a comprehensive eradication
programme, which included the targeted culling of badgers in areas
where the disease is attributed to wildlife. Since 2000, there has been
a 45% reduction in

Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), have suggested that
vaccination is an easy answer. I wish it were that simple, but it is
not. Members will remember that last year, there were concerns about
the Schmallenberg virus, a disease that affects sheep. It was
relatively straightforward to develop a vaccine that was virtually 100%
effective, and the disease is now fully under control. TB is not a
simple virus. It is a complex bacterial disease. The bacteria reside
inside the cell walls of the host, which makes it incredibly difficult
to develop an effective vaccine. As a result, the current BCG vaccine
provides only limited protection in about 60% of cases, and even then,
the level of protection given is variable. Notwithstanding those
difficulties and limitations, we are nevertheless investing large
amounts of money in developing methods of deploying vaccine to both
badgers and cattle, because, 
<?notus-xml column=132?>although vaccination is not a solution on its own, it could have a role

approximately £250,000 a year. Uptake has been slightly
disappointing so far. We must also recognise that vaccination does not
provide protection to all badgers, even once they are vaccinated. In
Northern Ireland, a trial has been discussed, described as,
“Test, Vaccinate and Remove”, meaning that the badgers
are first trapped, then tested, and the ones that are not infected are

Twigg</B> (Liverpool, West Derby) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am delighted
to have the opportunity to raise a constituency issue in Westminster
Hall. Gary Dunne was tragically murdered on 3 March 2006 in Benalmadena
on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. He was attacked by 12 men and
stabbed to death with a machete by Victor Posse Navas. For his family,
nothing will bring Gary back. Every day, they remember him as a son, a
partner and a father. Although nothing can be done to soften the horror
of the tragedy for the family, much more could have been done, and
still can be done, to make life that bit easier for
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000232" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000232">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:16:23"></hs_TimeCode>
British consular staff deal with thousands of deaths of British
nationals around the world, often in difficult, traumatic and
complicated situations. They deserve praise for their work. More often
than not, the support from consular staff is of the highest standard.
In this case, however, the Dunne family were left vulnerable; they felt
alone and received little help. In the midst of dealing with the news
of the cruel murder of their son, they were told that they would have
to pay to bury him, not in Liverpool, but in Andalucia in southern
Spain, due to local legal restrictions about hygiene. The Spanish
authorities said that before Gary could be brought home to Liverpool,
he would have to be cremated in Spain. The family received no
assistance from the Spanish police and were not met by liaison
officers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000233">Mr

Prime Minister played his part. The community and people of Liverpool
were a constant support to the Dunne family. A petition lobbying for
Gary’s body to be returned home was signed by more than 40,000
people. When his body was finally returned for a funeral in Liverpool,
hundreds of well-wishers turned out in the streets to applaud. It is
not often that civilian funerals are held at Liverpool cathedral, but
the dean agreed to host the service there. Everton football club
provided Goodison Park as a venue for the wake. No 
<?notus-xml column=134?>family should have to face the trauma and struggle that the Dunne family
have had to endure—waiting for years before they could finally

remain grateful to the Prime Minister for meeting Mr and Mrs Dunne and
for his support in that meeting. What progress have the Government made
since then? Do the Government see any way in which we could ensure that

to grieving family
members?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000239">The
Spanish authorities had insisted that due to rules related to their
hygiene laws, Gary’s body could not be repatriated for at least
five years. However, since then, the Dunne family have discovered that
other families who suffered tragedies in Andalucia were told that they
did not have to wait such a long time. Will the Government look into
why there seems to be an inconsistency in the application of the rules?
If the rules indeed state that a body can be repatriated only after
five years unless it is cremated, will the Minister make the case,
through the appropriate channels, both directly with the Spanish and
through the European Union, for reform of what seem to be unreasonable
and unfair
rules?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000240">After
all that, the tragic saga still goes on for Gary’s family. The
Dunne family were not informed by the Spanish authorities when the
murderer was caught; they had to find that out through a friend phoning
them. Due to their frustrations with the Spanish legal system, the
Dunne family tell me that they still do not know whether the killer is
still in jail, and if so, when he will be released. Will the Minister
make representations on behalf of the family to ensure that their case
is brought to the attention of the relevant Minister in
Spain? It is critical that the Government of Spain undertake the
responsibility to keep the Dunne family informed of developments as and
when they
occur.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000241">While
the process up to this point has been handled atrociously by the local
and national authorities in Spain, there is still a lot more that they
can do. Gary’s partner, Ashley, and his young son, Kieran, have
struggled to receive any compensation. The Spanish court has ordered
the perpetrator to pay €125,000 in compensation, yet so far,
only €1,500 has been received. Payments stopped some time ago,
and the small amount that was paid was of little comfort, as it had to
be used simply to pay court costs.</hs_Para>

Lesley have spent time themselves in Andalucia, at their own expense,
fighting for justice for Gary. Due to a legal error during the
formalities of applying for the money from the Spanish Government, the
Dunne family were only receiving €100 a month from Gary’s
killer, which came from the wage that he gets from his work in the
prison kitchens. Now even that has stopped. Neither the killer nor his
family has significant assets, and they are apparently unable to pay
the compensation.</hs_Para>

support of Arlene McCarthy MEP, the Dunne family have been lobbying the
relevant Spanish authorities. In December 2011—two years
ago—Arlene McCarthy wrote to the Spanish Minister who leads on
this area of policy, but she has not even received the courtesy of a
reply. Will the Minister look into that issue as a matter of urgency
and make representations on behalf of the Dunnes?</hs_Para>

Mr and Mrs Dunne well, as their constituency Member of Parliament. I
have known them now for six years. Their focus has always been on the
fight for justice for Gary and his surviving partner and child, but
also, more broadly, on trying to ensure that no other family has had to
endure what they have endured. However, the court in Spain had ordered
compensation of €125,000. Although the issue of compensation has
never been the one that the family has asked me to prioritise, I feel
that I owe it to them, as their MP and a friend, to say that it seems
to me a basic minimum that the compensation should be paid out to the
family as a matter of urgency.</hs_Para>

the Minister assure me that more is being done to ensure that standards
are maintained and improved in our consulates around the world? The
Foreign Secretary has said that the Foreign Office is always seeking to
improve the consular support and assistance in such tragic
circumstances. Will the Minister set out what measures are being or
will be taken to fulfil that? It seems critical that the staff who are
involved in what is by its nature delicate and sensitive work are
equipped fully to do their job professionally and
compassionately.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000246">I
am aware that the Foreign Office has signed an agreement with the
national homicide service run by Victim Support to provide the same
level of support to families who lose a loved one as a result of a
murder or manslaughter overseas as they would receive if the crime had

Government and Victim Support. Will the Minister tell us how that new
service will work and whether the Government have reached their goal of
offering the level of service that one would expect in the UK for
families who find themselves in such tragic circumstances

lost a son, a partner and a father; they have battled for three years
just to have a proper funeral for Gary; and they are now trying to
receive the compensation that a court has ordered should be paid to
them. It is a great tribute to them that they continue to campaign for
justice for others, as well as wanting justice for themselves. I
believe that they have been let down, and they deserve more from the
relevant authorities. I urge the Government to do everything in their
power, both bilaterally with Spain and through the European Union, to

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:28:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Liverpool, West Derby, I would like to outline the involvement of
the Foreign Office in the case to date. Following Mr Dunne’s
death, British officials were in close contact with the family to
provide consular assistance. When, as the hon. Gentleman said, the
family experienced difficulties in bringing Mr Dunne home to Britain,
consular staff did all they could to help. However, it became clear
that under local law, the possibility of a further autopsy during the
trial process prevented an individual’s remains from being
repatriated, cremated or embalmed. The only option therefore was a
local burial until the trial
was<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:29:10"></hs_TimeCode> complete.
After that, exhumation before a period of five years had passed would
only be permitted if an immediate cremation within the cemetery was
arranged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000252">Representations
were made to the director general for the Costa del Sol health district
in November 2007 and to the provincial delegate of Andalucia’s
health district in February 2008, to see if an exception
could be made to these requirements, based on the compelling
compassionate circumstances of the case. While sympathising with the
family’s wishes, both the director general and the provincial
delegate explained that, because Mr Dunne was a victim of murder, his
case was considered a judicial
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:30:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000253">Understandably,
Mr Dunne’s family continued to fight for his return and in July
2008 they petitioned the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member
for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown). In October 2008, the right
hon. Gentleman raised the case with the then Prime Minister of Spain,
Jose Luis Zapatero, and secured an agreement from the Spanish
authorities to allow Mr Dunne’s repatriation without a
cremation, on exceptional humanitarian grounds. So, with guidance and
support from consular officials, Mr Dunne’s family made an
application for his
exhumation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:30:45"></hs_TimeCode>. As
we have heard, three years after Gary Dunne’s murder his family
and friends finally held the funeral, at home in Liverpool, which they
had long sought<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:30:58"></hs_TimeCode>.
Later that year, Mr Dunne’s family contacted the Prime Minister

now turn to the points the hon. Gentleman raised in his speech. First,
I will address the question of whether EU-wide procedures for
repatriation could be agreed, to prevent other families from facing the
horrifying and distressing situation the Dunnes faced. As the hon.
Gentleman will be aware, this is a difficult and complex issue. The
power to act lies with other Governments, and the ability of the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office to intervene in domestic
matters—such as the variations in Andalucian law on
repatriation, burial and cremation, which the hon. Gentleman
outlined—is limited. 
<?notus-xml column=137?>However, it is clear that, as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister
said when he met the Dunne family and—I think—the hon.
Gentleman in 2011, we should do all we can to prevent other families
from facing the suffering endured by the

I have asked that, as a matter of urgency, officials follow up with the
hon. Gentleman and the Dunnes’ MEP, Arlene McCarthy, on who has
done what following the Downing street meeting, so that we can

Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:32:15"></hs_TimeCode>, I
know that the hon. Gentleman and the Dunne family are deeply concerned
about the apparent inconsistencies in the application of the rules
governing repatriation. The advice we have received from the Andalucian
authorities consistently made it clear that an unembalmed body can only
be exhumed and repatriated after five years, unless it is cremated. The
hon. Gentleman will appreciate that there may be factors at play in the
other cases that he mentioned that we are not aware of. Exceptions can
clearly be made if the grounds are sufficiently strong, as indeed they
were in the Dunnes’
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
as I have said, I have asked officials to provide a progress report on
efforts to establish common practices across those parts of Europe that
currently require delays in

hon. Gentleman also highlighted the lack of support that Mr
Dunne’s family felt they received from the Spanish authorities,
and indeed the authorities’ level of support continues to fall
short of the family’s expectations when it comes to their being
kept informed of the current status of the perpetrator of this terrible
crime. It is important that the Spanish authorities keep the family
informed of any developments in the case, either directly or through
their legal representatives. I have asked my officials to contact the
relevant authorities in Andalucia to see if lines of communication can
be re-established.
For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T16:33:34"></hs_TimeCode> his part, I
urge the hon. Gentleman to consider raising the matter directly with
the Spanish

the issue of compensation, I am aware that, as the hon. Gentleman said,
although an award of €125,000 was made by a Spanish court to the
family, they have only received €1,500 to date. I am conscious
that that can only add to the distress they have already suffered.
However, the British Government cannot interfere in another
country’s judicial process or direct the Spanish courts to
enforce payment, particularly when the offender may not have assets
with which to pay the outstanding compensation, which I understand to
be the case in this instance. Therefore, I am afraid that our
consistent advice to Mr Dunne’s family has not changed. Their
Spanish lawyer is best placed to help them pursue this issue through
legal channels and to advise them on applying to the Spanish state for
payment of the outstanding

Homicide Service, which in part was set up to address the problems

the Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (James Morris) present for
the debate. I suspect that he, like myself, is here because he was
deeply concerned last month when proposals to cut by 40% the budget for
children’s centres in Dudley were published by Dudley

Undoubtedly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:06:30"></hs_TimeCode>, a
major reason for the council’s change of heart is the excellent
work of our children’s centres and their ability to galvanise

council’s proposal, albeit withdrawn, has unnerved everyone
involved. A will therefore now exists to ensure that the role of
children’s centres and the value that they provide are properly

value for money in ways that work ever more efficiently in future. For

James:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for
that excellent intervention. I completely agree. The Hob
Green children’s centre, which I mentioned earlier, covers a
huge area. When Hob Green was started in 2008, a similar proposal to
start a children’s centre approximately two miles
away was dropped. The Hob Green centre therefore covers a huge area,
which takes in many different communities with different levels of
socio-economic advantage. The strength of our children’s centres
is that they serve a wide community and bring together people of
different backgrounds, who get on together and learn from each other.
That cannot be done if children’s centres are confined to narrow
disadvantaged
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000280" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000280">If
any thought had been put into the proposals that we are discussing, the
number of children under the age of five years might have been
considered as an additional factor relevant to the decision-making
process. If the constituencies of Dudley North and Stourbridge are
compared, for example, we find that 5,508 children under the age of
five live in Dudley North, while 8,020 children under the age of five
live in Stourbridge. It is illogical to propose the closure of three
children’s centres in the area with many more under-fives while
proposing to close only one in the area with far fewer children under
five.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000281">Having
made the case for the vital importance of children’s centres and
the work they do, I will conclude by looking to the future. According
to a survey undertaken this year by the charity Action for Children,
which runs the excellent Stourbridge children and families centre, more

deployed. If children’s centres act as gateways for such
services, it is far better that they take a joined-up approach. More
can be done locally as well as nationally through the greater

the specific position of Dudley council. We are clear in our guidance,
however, that the starting point should therefore be a presumption
against the closure of children’s centres. That is an important
part of our guidance, because having a wide network is important, so
that parents are able to access a children’s centre near their
home. Other research by the Department for Education suggests that
parents are not willing to travel great distances for early years
services, as obviously, with young children it can be difficult to
travel long distances. That is why we have a presumption against the
closure of children’s centres. In fact, less than 1% have been
closed since the start of this Parliament, and new centres have been
opened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:26:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121190000297" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/halltext/131211h0002.htm#13121190000297">I

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:26:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stourbridge on joined-up services and how important it
is that families and children have a joined-up service and experience.
Too often, people have to go to different locations for antenatal
classes, health checks or parenting classes. Would it not be better for
all those services to be on a single site? I went to see some excellent
children’s centres with
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-11T17:26:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Watford (Richard Harrington) recently. We saw an on-site
midwife who was able to give people advice pre-birth, and stay-and-play
sessions and parenting classes were taking place on the same site.
Other centres have also done birth registration on site, which is often
far more convenient than going to the registry office and helps parents
to access a children’s centre. That is something local
authorities should be looking at. I am speaking to the Local Government
Association about that at the

children’s centres provide child care on site, although that
amounts to less than 1% of total child care in the country. Centres
also provide access to child care through other routes, such as local
schools and school nurseries, which provide 30% of child care, as well
as private and voluntary sector providers and local childminders. I am
pleased that children’s centres are involved in our new trial of
childminder agencies, and are providing some training to and support
for childminders. We want to see more locally integrated networks of
services, so that parents who go to children’s centres have a
clear steer on what is available locally and where they can get support

individuals and organisations are already taking action to reduce
waste, which is highlighted in the programme. To encourage further
action, we will support change in a number of ways. For example, we
will bring industry together under a new sustainable electrical action
plan to catalyse action and seek commitment on designing products for
optimum life. Alongside this, we are supporting pilot projects and
trials of takeback and hiring and leasing schemes to demonstrate the
benefits of resource-efficient business models and supply chain
innovation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121191000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/wmstext/131211m0001.htm#13121191000039">Supporting

We are developing a two-year, £800,000 scheme to support

also had a major impact on our spending decisions. While some
high-performing organisations received considerable increases in
funding, some poor performing institutions had their funding stopped

to secure any future funding from DFID. The review also highlighted the
strengths and weaknesses of multilateral organisations, and enabled us

urgent reforms are making progress, and that some multilaterals which
were already doing well are doing even better. There have been
significant improvements in crucial areas such as the management of
finances, and how organisations work with others. This is encouraging,
but more needs

not the same scheme that was proposed prior to May 2010 although it
does have a number of similarities. The agency is still considering the

has not yet produced its final report into the fire on the

only able to report on data that is captured in certain mandatory
fields on the Home Office's Case Information Database (CID). Additional
data relating to the specific details of appeals lodged against the
European Convention on Human Rights and Refugee are only recorded in
the case notes sections within the database or held solely on the case
file. In order to provide the requested information on the reasons
given for lodging an appeal, we would need to undertake a manual case
by case search of records. We have estimated that to gather and collate
the information you have requested would exceed the cost

Hopkins</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 27 November 2013]:</I> The
Government has no current plans to make a specific assessment of
students' rented property; however it is taking forward a review into
the condition of property in the private rented sector to ensure that
there is a robust system in place to check that tenants' homes are safe
and healthy with appropriate standards of hygiene and sanitation. The
review will include and take account of the views of tenant groups
including
students.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131211119000543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/text/131211w0001.htm#131211119000543">Most
landlords ask a tenant to pay a deposit before moving in to the
property and, providing they have appropriate evidence, can withhold a
proportion at the end of the tenancy to cover any damage caused by the
tenant. Many landlords also request a guarantor for the tenant's
obligations—for example, if the tenant in question cannot
demonstrate a prior track record of having rented
previously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131211119000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/text/131211w0001.htm#131211119000544">Many
universities already work with local authorities to ensure a
consultative approach is taken on development and standards of
accommodation for students and we will encourage this to continue in
the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131211119000545" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/text/131211w0001.htm#131211119000545">Local
authorities have powers, under the Housing Act 2004, to assess the
risks and hazards of any property. If a property is found to contain
serious (category 1) hazards, the local authority has a duty to take
the most appropriate action. This could range from trying to deal with
the problems informally at first to prohibiting the use of the whole or
part of the dwelling. This system provides an important safety net,
ensuring that homes are safe and
decent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131211119000546" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/text/131211w0001.htm#131211119000546">For
Houses of Multiple Occupation, there is a statutory duty on local
authorities to licence larger higher risk dwellings of three or more
storeys housing five or more unrelated persons. These properties are
seen as higher risk, both because of the nature and condition of the
properties, and the vulnerability of their occupants. The mandatory
Houses of Multiple Occupation licensing regime addresses poor
management practices and aims to secure a reduction in death and injury
from fire and other health and safety hazards, and ensures adequate
provision of amenities.</hs_Para>

In 2011 there were over 850 English Language Training centres operating

achievement of qualifications. The Government has set national minimum
standards for QSRs that providers' performance is measured against.

Department for Communities and Local Government has responsibility for
homelessness issues. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has
introduced a number of initiatives in order to minimise the risk of
service personnel becoming homeless on leaving the armed forces. Most
recently, we announced the new £200 million Forces Help to Buy
scheme which will commence on 1 April 2014. It will mean that
servicemen and women can borrow up to 50% of their salary, up to a
maximum of £25,000, interest-free, providing a boost to those
needing to find a deposit to buy their own home. This will replace the
current advance of salary and the Armed Forces Home Ownership Scheme,
which enable service personnel to purchase their own homes. These
initiatives will continue to 2014 and
2015.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131211119001005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/text/131211w0002.htm#131211119001005">To
assist the transition of serving personnel to civilian life, the MOD
offers a wide-ranging resettlement programme which includes a briefing
by the Joint Services Housing Advice Office. This offers advice and

find useful relating to an individual's housing needs before they leave
the armed
forces.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131211119001006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/text/131211w0002.htm#131211119001006">In
addition, the MOD has supported the establishment of two supported
housing schemes for ex-service personnel-Mike Jackson House in
Aldershot, which opened in 2008, and The Beacon at Catterick, which
opened to residents in September 2011. The focus is on helping
individuals to develop independent living skills and with finding
suitable ‘move on’ permanent accommodation, training and

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Quality
Standard For diabetes, published in July 2011, sets out that people
with diabetes should receive a structured educational programme. There
are a number of education courses available on the national health
service for people with diabetes. The most common structured education
programme for Type 1 diabetes is Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating
(DAFNE). Since  
<?notus-xml column=275?>the DAFNE approach relies on carbohydrate estimation, it can be applied
to any diet as long as the carbohydrate content of the food can be
established.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131211119001340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/text/131211w0002.htm#131211119001340">There
is no requirement for a specific level of education. The DAFNE

funding of structured education courses for people with diabetes is the
responsibility, of local clinical commissioning groups. The 2011-12
National Diabetes Audit report, published in October 2013, includes
high-level analysis on what percentage of people registered with
diabetes receive accredited structured education in line with NICE
guidance. The report set out that for those people newly diagnosed as
diabetic, 0.6% of patients with Type 1 and 3.1% of patients with Type 2
are recorded as attending structured education. For all people with

Ellison:</Member></B> Total spend in future years by the Department's
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) on research into
mesothelioma depends on the volume and quality of scientific activity.
The usual practice of the NIHR is not to ring-fence funds for
expenditure on particular topics: research proposals in all areas
compete for the funding available. The NIHR welcomes funding
applications for research into any aspect of human health, including
mesothelioma. These applications are subject to peer review and judged

The Figures above are from households below average income (HBAI),
which is sourced from the Family Resources survey. The latest
publication of HBAI can be found using the following

Someone is considered to be in relative low income if they live in a
household whose income is below 60% of median income for all
households. Median income is the income of the household in the middle
of the income distribution. Household income is equivalised, which
means that income is adjusted for the size and composition of the
household; and household income is also deflated, which means that
income is adjusted for changes in
inflation.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.
In household below average income, a household is defined as a single
person or group of people living at the same address as their only or
main residence, who either share one meal together or share the living
accommodation. This differs from a benefit unit (family), which is
defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting couple, plus any
dependent children. From January 2006 same-sex partners (civil partners
and cohabitees) are also included in the same benefit unit. A household
will consist of one or more benefit
units.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
Figures have been presented on a before housing cost basis, which means
that housing costs have not been deducted from income. Housing costs
include; rent (gross of housing benefit); water rates, community water
charges and council water charges; mortgage interest payments;
structural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); ground rent and
service
charges.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
Figures for government regions are presented as three year averages.
This is to ensure that the sample size is sufficient to produce robust
estimates.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6.
Figures for Northern Ireland are only available from 2002/03. As such
figures for Northern Ireland can only be presented from 2002/03-2004/05
onwards.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">7.
Figures have been rounded to the nearest 1% and to the nearest 100,000
people. Estimates based on survey data are subject to uncertainty; and
are subject to sampling error. Figures may not sum due to rounding
error.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table></TableWrapper><hs_Para UID="131211119002713" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131211/text/131211w0004.htm#131211119002713">The
