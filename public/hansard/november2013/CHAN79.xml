huge value of broadband in rural areas, particularly to the small and
medium-sized enterprises that are so important to the rural economy.
The roll- out of broadband to all rural communities across the
country is a top priority for us. The Government’s current
£530 million rural broadband programme will ensure
that 90% of the country has access to superfast speeds. The Government
recently announced an extra £250 million investment
to extend superfast coverage to 95% of premises by 2017. Together with
the industry, we are exploring how to expand coverage further, using
more innovative fixed wireless and mobile broadband solutions to reach
at least 99% of premises in the UK by

approach that is fair to all parts of the UK. The reality is that farms
in Scotland tend to be larger and the per hectare rate has been lower
historically because the land is less productive, but the average
farmer in Scotland receives about £25,000 a year, the average
farmer in England receives approximately £17,000 and the average

ministry has remained broadly stable over the past 20 years. In 2012,
11,375 ordained clergy and at least 1,411 chaplains were serving in the
Church of England, and there were 12,953 parishes. As a result, it is

Tony Baldry:</Member></B> In 2011 in the diocese of Lichfield there
were 100 claims for lead metal theft costing nearly £200,000. As
of May of this year, there were fewer than 10 claims costing less than
£10,000. Churches still have a duty to use things such as
SmartWater and CCTV, but the fact that it is now no longer possible for
robbers to strip churches of lead at night, go round to the scrap metal
yard next day and get paid in cash means that we are seeing a
considerable drop in lead theft. That is good news and the whole House
should be grateful to

now but permanent. He used to pretend that he did not come into
politics to make cuts, but now he has really let the mask slip. Is it
not time to admit that the rebranding of the Tory party has been a
total failure? It is just as toxic as ever. The Conservatives said,
“Vote Blue, go Green.” They have even changed their logo
to a tree. But now apparently they want to get rid of all—I have
to use this phrase, Mr Speaker—the green crap. They said that
they would reform our politics, but now in the lobbying Bill the
Government are legislating to shut ordinary people out. They said that
they believed in a big society, but now they just play the politics of
division and the dog whistle. The Conservatives can delete what they

Roger Gale</B> (North Thanet) (Con):</Member> The European Court of
Human Rights has drawn attention to the fact that prisoners in this
country do not have voting rights, and much consideration has been
given to that. Far less consideration has been given to the fact that
among the member states of the Council of Europe a large number of
countries—Malta is a particularly bad example—hold
prisoners for a very long time without charge or trial. Instead of just
leaving this matter to the Backbench Business Committee, will my right
hon. Friend consider that there ought to be at least one day of the
year when this House gives the opportunity to those of us who represent
the United Kingdom on the Council of Europe to indicate precisely what

think that we have now demonstrated that it is a myth to suggest that
flexible working and the rights associated with it are somehow an
impediment  to successful business. In fact, they are often
integral to successful business, because they enable businesses to
acquire and retain the skills they are looking for, especially as far
as women in the workplace are concerned. This country has a very high
participation rate of women in work and record levels of women’s
employment. I think that is absolutely part of what is enabling
businesses in this country to respond successfully to, and to recover

Opposition Front Benchers mention Sure Start. One of the most important
things for mothers and young families is to get that start right, but
it is not just about the availability of a centre; it is about the
availability of a health visitor for every family to give them the
right start in life. Under the previous Government, health visiting
ceased to be a universal entitlement for mothers and young families as
they started out. That is why we committed ourselves—it is in
the coalition agreement—to providing 4,200 more health visitors.
From memory, I think there are about 1,000 more health visitors
already. We are on track to deliver on that commitment. That increase
of 50% in the number of health visitors will be integral to giving
mothers and young families the support they need to get the right start

completely understand the point that my hon. Friend rightly makes. The
failings that have been evident in the way in which the Co-operative
bank was run and the implications of that are a matter of the greatest
disappointment to many of us. I personally share with my hon. Friend a
sense that we do not want that to undermine the commitment to mutuals
and co-operatives as a form of organisation for businesses. They have
tremendous potential—as yet unrealised potential in many
cases—for ensuring that businesses are very successful in the

its long-term

business for a debate in this House to consider Lords amendments to the
Energy Bill, and that may afford him, and others, the opportunity to
make such points. Through competition and better electricity market
reform, the Government are setting out to ensure that the public have
access to the lowest possible tariffs, and that we bring prices to the
lowest point that is consistent through competition. At the same time,
we must ensure that we fulfil our obligations on the reduction of
carbon emissions and meet climate change objectives, but
without—quite properly, I think, under the
circumstances—loading those costs on to consumers. To meet those
otherwise competing objectives, it is important that we help consumers
to lower their energy bills and reduce energy consumption. As far as

we have too many special advisers at the moment; we need special
advisers for a number of reasons and they do an important job. The
particular circumstances of coalition government inevitably give rise
to an additional requirement, because it is important for both parties
in the coalition to have access to independent and politically
supportive advice. As part of the civil service reform plan we must
understand that valuable and excellent as civil service support can be,
civil servants do not have a monopoly on advice. Ministers should be
able to draw on additional expert support and advice, and it is
sometimes difficult for that to be achieved wholly by organisations
outside Government. Sometimes the only way Ministers can get access to
that further advice is by bringing experts into the Government, and
that is part of the civil service reform

should like briefly to set out some wider points about the estimate and
then make a small number of points that I believe should be addressed
individually. At the start of this Parliament, the Commission decided
that, in a time of considerable austerity, it was right to have a look
at the costs of running the House service. During 2010-11, a rigorous
examination was made of expenditure, based on the principle that we
should be able to do whatever was necessary for our proper work as
scrutineers of Government, legislators and promoters 
<?notus-xml column=1387?>of our constituents’ interests, but that, within that principle,
we should seek to do that work as effectively as possible. The result
of that examination, which took place over some
considerable time through that year, was the medium-term financial
plan, which the House agreed to last year and which broadly delivers a
17% reduction on the estimate over the course of this Parliament, from
what was estimated would be £231 million at the start to
£210 million by 2014. This year’s estimate of
£200.6 million is on track to achieve that.</hs_Para>

should add, for those who are aficionados of dissecting the numbers,
that some areas of the numbers are not entirely like-for-like.
Therefore, to make an exact comparison, one has to take account of

Thurso:</Member></B> The Finance and Services Committee has looked in
detail and scrutinised all these areas. One of the major factors that
will affect the estimate is the movement of the House pension fund from
our own resources across to the civil service, which will change the
way it is accounted. The other areas where there is a degree of
uncertainty include, for example, the impairment costs, which we have
been advised should be made in respect of certain buildings, and the
way we account for them. These have been moved from the capital cost,
which is where they were budgeted for, to the resource account of the
administration budget, where it is thought they should more properly
be. I hope that answers, in part, the hon. Gentleman’s

as one of my five main issues. The 17% figure applies to the total, but
there are variances within it. I believed it was important to approach

let’s just slice it and take 17% off everything”, but by
looking at areas where bigger savings or fewer savings might be made.
The objective was to deliver the appropriate service that we as

behind the work that was done. There is an issue relating to Committee

pay and conditions, then, I have said before that we have a very high
quality of staff. In my judgment, it is imperative to maintain that,
and to do so, we must be exemplary employers. It is indeed the firm
intention of both the House of Commons Commission and the Management
Board that the House service be regarded as a model employer, using the
best practices in employment. As we all know, however, the road to hell
is paved with good intentions, and it is not so much the intentions
that count as how we give effect to them.</hs_Para>

me deal with our commitment to the London living wage. I may be in
danger of getting pelted for what I say, but I pay tribute to you, Mr
Speaker, because you have led the drive with the Commission and the
Management Board to ensure that we make a full and true commitment to
the London living wage. You have provided an important piece of
leadership on that issue. Both the chair of the
Commission<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T11:34:35"></hs_TimeCode> and
the chief executive of the House service take the issue of the London
living wage extremely seriously. The House is aiming to secure
accreditation as a living wage employer from Citizens UK before
Christmas this year and to achieve full compliance on all our contracts
by April next year. That means our approach goes beyond the
accreditation requirements. I can report that as of today all current
House staff and all agency staff supplied to the House are paid at
least the London living wage, and that contractors with dedicated staff
who are based on the estate are paying those staff at least the London
living wage, with a small number of exceptions that are currently being
addressed and which we anticipate will have been addressed within a
very short space of time. The final category is other contractors that
provide services to the House. Good progress is being made to ensure
they are paying their UK staff at least the London living wage if in
London, or the living wage if outside London.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T11:35:56"></hs_TimeCode>I reiterate that
we are on course to be accredited by Christmas and we are on course to

compliance by next

practices are not particularly keen on zero-hours contracts because of
this lack of mutuality. We came to the firm view that, as that is the

point I would make on pay and conditions is that change is always
difficult and unsettling, even in the best of organisations. I have had
experience of, to use the jargon, “re-engineering” two
businesses that were going bust to make them sustainable for the

things, there are difficulties and there is absolutely no way round
that. That is going on here, but what we are trying to
ensure—and seeking to impress on the management—is that
this be done as transparently and fairly as possible. There will be
blips in morale from time to time, but everything possible should be
done to mitigate that, and I believe the House service has listened to

that the catering department has had to look so much more widely is
that political parties and trade unions, which regularly used to use

reforms of a few years ago. We want healthy political parties and
well-organised trade unions that serve the interests of their members,
and it is something of an irony that those bodies in our civic society

Palace of Westminster is a heritage site, an iconic building and a
major visitor attraction. Most importantly, it is also a working
institution in which we work throughout our time as Members of
Parliament. It is also a building in which the fabric is at, or well
past, its sell-by date. Some mechanical and electrical elements have
been nursed on by brilliant engineers, but in any other building they
might well have been replaced quite a long time ago. It is clear that a
major project of renewal and restoration is required. The
Commission’s internal report suggested a number of
possibilities, and three broad strands were chosen. It was decided
that, as the matter was so important, it should be looked at by
external experts who can look both at the robustness of the business
cases and at the cost, so that we have the very best possible advice.
It has always been my experience that money expended at the start of a

to proceed with the full-on version but instead to proceed with a more
modest approach, which is that being proposed at the moment. The

Thurso:</Member></B> I am delighted to reassure my hon. Friend that it
is not a temporary structure in the sense of being a glorified
portakabin. In fact, it is quite the reverse. It is actually a
purpose-built, demountable building with a minimum guaranteed shelf
life of around 30 years. For a number of years we have had a
very good-looking demountable building that used to be used on the
green when we first started giving tours of the House. Everybody
thought that it was a pretty good building and good value for money.
Ultimately, it is about balancing the fact that it would be lovely to
have something permanent that might or might not come with R and R with
the 
<?notus-xml column=1397?>possibility of having something not very good-looking but extremely
portable. This genuinely offers extremely good value for money. The
design has been undertaken by architects who were involved in some of
the work on the Olympic site. It is really terribly well done. As I
understand it, it is so well designed that the only objection so far on
seeking planning permission is that one cannot see it—that it is
not obvious enough. I therefore think we have probably got it just
about right. I reassure my hon. Friend; I genuinely believe that it is
good value for money. I commend it to Members of the House.</hs_Para>

about this Parliament is the way in which Select Committees have taken

Select Committees’ resources have remained broadly the same. The

money to buy, say, part of or a whole extra member of staff. Obviously
some Committees have very big travel commitments, but I do not see why

years ago, there was a by-election where the Labour party did not do
particularly well, and a then Labour Minister, who I will not name for
obvious reasons, went on the radio to explain our poor showing and said
that the reason Labour voters had stayed at home was that they were
clearly very happy with what the Labour Government were doing. Looking
around the Chamber at today’s attendance, I wonder whether some
colleagues may wish to draw the same conclusion—that the reason
there are not as many colleagues here as there might have been is that
they are so delighted with the work that has been done by the
Commission under your chairmanship, Mr Speaker, the Administration
Committee and the Finance and Services Committee.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:13:42"></hs_TimeCode>It is surprising
that many of the MPs who on previous occasions have complained vocally
have not come along or tabled an amendment. I therefore assume that
they are broadly content or have no better plans for how to make the
necessary savings.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:14:05"></hs_TimeCode> appreciate the
incredibly difficult job that you, Mr Speaker, and your fellow
Commission members have in trying to come up with those savings. I am
struck by the fact that at a time when we are always preaching across
the House about the need to make savings, some Government Members are
asking for more money. That is very difficult to justify to our
constituents. We must get better at spending the limited resources that
we have.</hs_Para>

want to address three of the areas that have been covered so well
today. First, on the catering and retail services, the Administration
Committee has made it absolutely clear—I do not think I am
speaking out of turn in saying that the Commission shares this
view—that it is ludicrous that we have in the Palace of
Westminster two sets of catering and two sets of retail outlets that
are run completely separately. I know from the Clerk of the House and
from you, Mr Speaker, that there is genuine good will towards the idea
of seeking to merge the two services. I hope that my hon. Friend the
shadow Leader of the House will set out the Labour party’s
position and the Leader of the House will set out the
Government’s position on whether that is a good
idea.  
<?notus-xml column=1400?>We could achieve significant savings for the taxpayer that would help us

to any organisation—there will be a vetting process—and
it will be for the House itself, through the Chairman of the

only appropriate organisations come here. I know that my hon. Friend is

The intention is not to turn Parliament into a Disneyland, as an hon.
Member who is not here has said previously, or to rent it out to any
old organisation. My hon. Friend makes a valid point, because some
organisations have, in the business parlance, a reputational risk for
Parliament. At the same time, we need to offset the cost of running
Parliament and, as you have set out, Mr Speaker, we cannot simply

want to make progress, because I am conscious that there is another
debate to follow. My second point is about the new MPs who will arrive
in 2015. Labour Members hope that we will welcome a very large number
of new MPs, but others may be less keen on that. The Administration
Committee took a thorough look at the process that took place over the
past couple of Parliaments. It is important to place on record our
thanks to the House service and in particular to the Clerk of
the House for the work he did with you, Mr Speaker, to
prepare our induction in 2010. Those colleagues who have been in the
House slightly longer have told us just how chaotic—I put it
politely—the process was for them. Perhaps that was your
experience when you entered the House only a few short Parliaments ago,
Mr Speaker, but the process has improved dramatically under your
chairmanship and as a result of the Clerk’s
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112168000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112168000207">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:24:09"></hs_TimeCode>
very much welcome the plans for the future, but they will clearly have
cost implications. We recognise that it is important to get Members up
and running as quickly as possible. As we all know,
constituents—not unreasonably, having in their wisdom voted us
into office—expect us very quickly to be able to take up their
cases. The lag of six or perhaps eight weeks because of the general
election has meant that MPs have not been able to take on new cases. I
know from my experience three and a half years ago that deserving cases
that need time get lost. The Administration Committee therefore
proposes a series of sensible steps to ensure that when a Member
arrives, even before they have been sworn in, they will be able to
begin to tackle their case
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112168000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112168000208">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:25:03"></hs_TimeCode>
is why Members will be issued with tablets along with their pass as
soon as they arrive on their first day. They will get them going and
they are also a way of trying to reduce costs, because, frankly, we
waste a huge amount of paper every day. I certainly hope we will never
get to the point where we wave our tablets during Prime
Minister’s questions, but do we honestly need the vast amount of
paper we generate every day? Surely we can do much more through
electronic devices such as tablets and iPhones. The move that you have
championed with the Order Paper is hugely welcome, Mr Speaker, and the
move towards greater use of the cloud in the next Parliament is also
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:25:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112168000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112168000209">My

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:25:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

renewal. We are spending a huge amount of money just to keep the place
running. The building is now about 160-something years old and the
piping and wiring are about 60 or  
<?notus-xml column=1403?>70 years old. The building has not had an overhaul since the restoration
work that took place at the end of the second world war. It is not fit
for purpose. Colleagues in both Houses who have difficulty getting

of the building’s

think everyone knows that I am of the view that we need to make the
very difficult decision to decant, not only because that will allow us
to overhaul this place, which appears to be the cheapest option, but
because it will allow us to upgrade our facilities. We really
need  to make sure that we have a Parliament fit for the
21st century. As has been said, there is an opportunity to
do it in one go. I used to work for Network Rail, which was pretty
efficient in the end at doing what is called a blockade, whereby it
would shut a section of line and do everything—the signalling,
wiring and track maintenance—at once. We need to use this
opportunity, in the next decade, to have a thorough overhaul so that
this place is fit not only for Members, but for the illustrious Press
Gallery and for visitors who want either to see Parliament in action or
to participate in our

would like to add to what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:30:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John
Thurso) said about the staff of the House. I have every bit as much
cause as he and many of us to recognise what they do for us and the way
they serve us. It is also worth remembering that apart from being
deliverers of services, they are also consumers of some of those
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:30:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112168000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112168000217">The
basic approach I share entirely with my hon. Friend—to recognise
that this House is a working building and also an iconic visitor
attraction. It is clear that the second consideration should in no way
impinge on  the first, but it is equally clear that the working
pattern of Members of this House has altered dramatically. The amount
of time spent in the building has changed, the division of time between
constituency and Westminster has changed, and this has had an impact on
the availability of facilities.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112168000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112168000218">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:31:45"></hs_TimeCode>
emphasise that there is nothing unusual about a subsidy for catering in
the House as a place of work. It is unfortunate that too often we are
reported in the papers as apparently being 650 people who are running
this place to our own advantage in terms of the catering. There are
more than 13,000 pass holders who have access to this estate and who
need to avail themselves of its facilities for normal refreshment in
the course of a working day. Those 13,000 pass holders, be it noted,
include representatives of the media, who enjoy the supposed advantage
which sometimes they denigrate for
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:32:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112168000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112168000219">We
have, nevertheless, a duty to address the scale of the catering
subsidy. It was of the order of £6 million in 2010-11 and the
aim is to have it down to £3.8 million by 2014-15. It seems
sensible to the Committee that we have a twin approach—cutting
costs where that could be done in an obvious way, and increasing
income. It is right that efficiencies could be achieved. These have
been undertaken, and a new, intelligent approach to how we deliver our
services on the catering side has, I believe, been achieved. But it is
also necessary to increase sales. Surely we want to make sure that what
is on offer in our catering outlets meets the needs of all the people
who may wish to avail themselves of it. I can report that the footfall
in the cafeterias is up 9% and the banqueting covers are up by 14%, so
we are making progress in getting the facilities
used<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112168000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112168000220">Attention
has been drawn in this debate to the room hire charges, which are
another element of the changes that we have made. I should say that the
charges that are proposed are benchmarked. There is a discount for
charities and a further discount for Member functions. This is for a
trial period and it is under the strict scrutiny of the Committee. We
will feel our way on this. I give an undertaking to the
House—words I never thought I would be in a position to
offer—that we will look at this very carefully. I recognise that
there are possible points of difficulty and so on. We will watch this
and, if necessary, look at it again, but the principle is clear and has

hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon) raised
the question of political dining. The change that was made was
instigated by two hon. Members who are still Members of the House. It
was thought improper that profit should be made by a political
organisation, be it a party or a trade union, through having access to
these facilities. For many people that has seemed unduly restrictive,
but I have always taken the view that if we were to be more relaxed
about that, it would have to be on an understanding among the parties
in this House that no one was seeking to gain an advantage over
another. It is odd, is it not, that those who perhaps take the closest
day-to-day interest in political affairs are the ones for whom it is
now slightly more difficult to come here in the way they used
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112168000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112168000224">The
other matter to which we have given attention because we believe it is
capable of great improvement is how to achieve greater revenue from
retail sales. I will admit to being a retailer at heart. My dad kept a
shop and I served behind the counter from an early age to earn my
pocket money. I have always had a desire to see how I can sell things
to people. There is a tremendous opportunity. The people who come here

definitive answer. There are aspects of the tiles that would make them
an unacceptable item for sale. Some of them are to be re-used. We are
examining the possibility that reproductions of the original be
considered for sale. They will not contain any noxious substances or

response to my observation about the Parliamentary and Scientific

process. People come here not only for us to learn about their skills,
but for them to learn about what we do, as per the education unit. It
is hugely important that we encourage not only young people, but other
people —he mentioned older people who have not had the
opportunity—to come here. People might not understand how their
life or occupation fits into this place and it is hugely beneficial if
they get exposure to it. There is a huge gap between Parliament and
areas such as science and engineering, and it is vital that we
strengthen our links with them. The Administration Committee is
supporting access for young people—I totally agree with him

we should be an exemplary employer—if we cannot do that, how can
we expect the rest of the country to follow suit? In his final remarks
he mentioned the potential court case. I do not accept that an
exemplary employer will, at some stage, inevitably end up in court, and
I urge the House to use all resources available to you, Mr Speaker, the
Committees and the Commission, to work to resolve that problem and
avoid the courts.</hs_Para>

in me getting into places where most right hon. and hon. Members never
go, such as the roof of the House of Lords or down in the basement. I
have been down and looked at some of the structural issues, which are
potentially very concerning, and we should not ignore the possibility
that the subject of decanting might come up quicker than we thought.

the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Thomas Docherty). One cost we
are bearing—I do not know the exact figures, but they would be
possible to calculate; I do not know whether the Finance and Services

particularly the September sitting. I fully understand the argument
used by the late 
<?notus-xml column=1412?>Robin Cook and subsequently the current Government about the merits of
the September sitting, but is a bit of a myth. If we shifted those two
weeks to either end of the summer period, what savings could be built
into the restoration and repair programme during that period? I think
they would be quite significant, and the House needs to look at that as

in some areas we can work towards savings based on the way we work,
whether the September sitting or the use of electronic tools. All those
issues require serious, mature thinking, and some up-front investment.
The Visitor Centre will command support only if it is seen to be a
genuine investment for a long-term facility, and I worry that the
possible juxtaposition of the two projects might mean that it ends up
as an investment that never gets its full use. As I said, I urge the
House to use every possible resource to resolve the HR issues. Having
spent 15 years in HR, I know that that is sometimes easier said than
done, but getting things away from the courtrooms is by far the best
solution and I urge everyone to work hard towards that

report’s introduction explains, this is the second year that the
Committee has produced a report. Assuming the motion is agreed, the
report will go to the House of Commons Commission, which I assume will
ratify it. As has been said, the report was put together with
considerable assistance from the Management Board and senior staff,
particularly the finance team. They did that under the unusual
difficulties our system imposes on us, and they are to be congratulated
on their expertise, persuasion, and—probably even more
so—tolerance.</hs_Para>

in the private sector in a small and medium-sized business, been
associated with a large national retailer, and had some small influence

<?notus-xml column=1413?>number of years on the finances of a local authority, I found our
procedures to be quite bizarre, although at the end of the day they
seemed to work.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T13:08:03"></hs_TimeCode>There are
similarities with the outside world in that the Committee, with
considerable input in certain areas from other Committees, in
particular the Administration Committee, works with the Management
Board and puts together the financial report. The bizarre
part—in our system, the important part—is putting the
financial report before the House, where individual Members with
individual foibles, of which we have seen a little today, can seek to
change individual parts of it. That risks an unbalancing effect on the
whole estimate package, but that is democracy.</hs_Para>

difficult part for the Finance and Services Committee and the
Management Board has been the necessity that the administration
estimate be reduced by 17% by 2014-15. This is an obvious basic
requirement, as similar savings are being sought and achieved across
the public sector. Interestingly, although it is not obvious to the
outside world, the majority of the savings, whether positive or
negative, have been produced with imaginative thinking and in many
cases with an improvement in the
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T13:10:36"></hs_TimeCode>. They
have also come with a recognition that some services were expensive,
out of date and redundant, and have generally, if not entirely, not
been missed.</hs_Para>

response of the Management Board and the staff has been remarkably
positive and is distinctly worthy of our thanks, which have already
been given but which I reiterate. All the changes, it seems to me, have
been done without affecting the day-to-day work of Members of
Parliament. Some of the modernisations set in train, particularly
current and impending changes in our IT systems, will bring positive
benefits to MPs who are prepared to utilise new ways, although some are
a little slower than others. The new benefits post-election for MPs and
their IT opportunities is, when grasped, an overdue advance that will
bring us slightly in the direction of modernity.</hs_Para>

the issue of security, which has increasingly become a deep concern. We
face more complex attacks, which make security more expensive. This is
an area we share with the other place and that itself gives us
problems, which have been subtly touched on. In this area and others,
sharing brings considerable complications.</hs_Para>

area of complication is the proposed new education centre. That has
been walked over and I do not intend to follow the same steps, but I
would guess that no Member would decry the importance of extending
education opportunities to the United Kingdom. The new proposals have
been mentioned at some length by others. I have a constituency close to
London, so my schools are in the best situation to benefit and
increasingly do so. The relatively new transport grant should help the
spread elsewhere. Nevertheless, this is an area where co-operation with
the other place appears, for the moment, to have stumbled. It is
amazing and astonishing that the facilities—I touched on this
point in an intervention—particularly the dining rooms, in
addition to the historic tourist attraction of the Palace, have not
been used for income generation. At last, the Administration Committee
has taken the brilliant step to expand services, in particular by
utilising our dining facilities to the benefit of the House. These
rooms are a brilliant addition, especially with our excellent
banqueting team. Our change of 
<?notus-xml column=1414?>hours has enabled the opportunity for a considerable extension in this
area, although there are kick-backs that were touched on earlier. The
Administration Committee should be congratulated on grasping this
opportunity, which will increase

the biggest area of concern is the repair and renewal of this amazing
historic building as we move towards a full capital expenditure of
repair and renewal in the 2020s. All in all, we have to recognise that
although we have pondered on this matter today, it is not what the
report is about. Assuming the House agrees the estimates, we will move
slowly towards having tighter functions and better services. Despite
our bizarre system of financial control, it does seem to work and I

on that, and I think that if I had asked most MPs about how decisions
on financial arrangements for this place were made, they would not have
had a clue. In this Parliament, we have clarified the relationship
between the Finance and Services Committee and the House of Commons

so that matters are available for all Members to discuss, and, if

collectively across the piece on financial matters, and that, with the
changes to Standing Orders, individual items with financial
repercussions are not decided outside the framework of an annual
budget. All financial matters must be taken within that framework. It
is not too revolutionary to think of having a annual debate in this
Chamber on the budget: any self-respecting council will have being
doing just that for years. The fact that Parliament has only just got
around to it shows we do not always move as quickly as local

we will continue to engage in dialogue to resolve the issue before it

occasionally have a disagreement with their employees. Both sides have
genuinely tried to resolve the matter, but have not come up with an
agreed solution. The disagreement should not go to court through a lack
of effort in trying to find a solution. I hope both sides redouble

for having further discussions with trade union representatives. I hope
those take place and that they can find a way forward that provides

on the education centre, it is right that in reducing our expenditure,
we have not done anything to affects Members’ ability to do
their job, but neither 
<?notus-xml column=1416?>should we take any actions that affect the ability of members of the
public—our constituents—to visit this place and to see
what goes on here and how Members do their work. It is particularly
important that we do not impact on the opportunity of young people and
schoolchildren to visit this place. I understand the concerns about
spending money on the education centre—I think everyone agrees
that in principle it is the right thing to do—and I do not think
we should delay that expenditure if it means schoolchildren losing out
on the opportunity to come here. After all, if we delay the expenditure
for five years, some of those children will have ceased to be
schoolchildren. It is right and proper, if we have a bit  of
extra money to spend, that we spend it on opening up access to
schoolchildren. With that included, I  hope we pass
today’s motion. I, certainly, am happy to support
it.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_21_PT_1/F51949A8E673C55ACCB26011E5A9DBFE822C8489" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="21 November 2013">Thursday

unfairly, he argues that you should have fought harder to protect or

have been reticent in your support for Select Committees, but asking

hon. Friend the Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen
Barclay)—a member of the Public Accounts Committee, which,
backed by the National Audit Office, is richer in resource than any
other Select Committee—suggests constructively that we could do
more to tap into external expertise. I agree that we could do that; I
think we are doing that. Indeed, he might underestimate how much Select

Departments, but from the NAO, outside firms and so on. It is something

have Select Committees done to save money and make ourselves more
efficient? I am told that we carried out a “lean process
review”—a term recognisable to management
consultants—which has led to many practical steps being taken.
When I was first appointed a Select Committee Chair, I noticed that we
got all our press cuttings on wads of photocopied paper that the Clerks
had got from the Library. I said there were ways of doing it
electronically. I hope that all Select Committees now have electronic
cutting services. There are some glitches in the
system—understandably, it took some time to get electronic
copies of the<I> Financial Times</I>—but the Committee Office
and the Library have been assiduous in ironing them out and delivering
a much better electronic “digital first” strategy for
Select Committees.</hs_Para>

of course, that includes our being given iPads for our work. It should
be put on the record that our iPads mean that our staff no longer spend
hours photocopying, collating and sending out vast quantities of paper
in the post. All evidence is now electronic. Giving iPads to Select
Committee members, apart from a few colleagues who understandably find
it difficult to adapt to new technology, has probably saved about
£1 million a year. That can be devoted to scrutiny, instead of
photocopying, saving an enormous amount of staff time, freeing them up
to do more interesting and rewarding work. Given the high quality of
Committee staff, it is absurd that so much of their time is spent on
this unproductive work.</hs_Para>

Committee Office also decided to establish a web and publications unit.
Painfully, that will take resource out of the direct control of Select
Committees. For example, the Public Administration Select Committee
will have to share a Committee assistant with another Committee. I
would have preferred it to have been paid for by additional resources,
but the unit will make our websites and publications more usable for
the public and more up to date. A new web portal has also been created
for the submission and publication of evidence by electronic means.
PASC was one of the early pilots. Now all but one departmental
Committee—my briefing does not say which is the miscreant
Committee—have moved to accepting submissions in this way.
We  have also switched off the printing of written and oral
evidence altogether. Therefore,

to the future, the Liaison Committee reported a year ago on the
effectiveness of Select Committees and their resources and powers. That

things that Select Committees could do. I particularly 
<?notus-xml column=1418?>commend the training of MPs in the art of cross-examination. We all
think we are frightfully good, until we are confronted by somebody who
points out our tics and habits. Would you believe it, Mr Speaker? It
was pointed out to our Committee that we all liked talking rather a lot
and asking questions that made our points, rather than seeking
information from our witnesses. I hope we have improved as a result of
our training, and we will have another away-day of training later this

goal reflects the shifting nature of the work of Parliament. Less and
less can we control the detail of legislation from this Chamber and the
old-fashioned Standing Committees. It is clear that the public are more
and more engaged with the cross-party, consensual approach adopted by
Select Committees in the scrutiny and exposure of inefficiency,
wrongdoing or whatever else is going on in Departments. As we monitor
the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T13:32:31"></hs_TimeCode>recommendations

Committee Chairs are now paid the equivalent of what an Under-Secretary

means that I have willingly turned down offers of outside interest,

reflects the additional responsibilities, particularly now that Select
Committee Chairs are elected by the whole House to deliver a service to
the House. I cannot describe to hon. Members how different it must feel
from the old days. Indeed, I remember a senior Select Committee Chair,
who had previously been effectively elected by his party’s Front
Benchers, telling the Liaison Committee at the outset of this
Parliament how much the terms of trade of Select Committee’s
engagement with their work had changed.</hs_Para>

points that need to be addressed by extra resources include additional
support for Chairs in all the extra work that we increasingly take
on—as we take on a higher media profile, more and more demands
are made on our time. That could mean providing either an additional
member of staff for each Chair’s office or more staff in
Committee teams to assist the Chair with his or her wider duties. I
have no illusions. That is not 
<?notus-xml column=1419?>going to happen very quickly. We have also pressed for more media
support. It is extraordinary. I do not know how many press officers
Departments have, but they run into the hundreds and hundreds. Each
Select Committee shares a single media officer with several other
Select Committees. The media that are generated are almost
self-generated. However, when we issue a report, the entire Government
media machine might be deployed in deflecting the criticisms made in
it. This is an unequal battle. The need for a larger pool of shared
media officers is
s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T13:35:30"></hs_TimeCode>omething that
Select Committees are focusing on. I pay tribute to our media officers.
They work incredibly hard, are very enthusiastic and help us to put
Select Committees on the map effectively, even with their limited
resources.</hs_Para>

and my Committee staff are in 7 Millbank. I do not know how long that
is, but by the time one has bumped into a few colleagues on the way, it
is at least a 15-minute walk. Would Ministers running Departments
accept not having an office in their Departments? Again, that puts us
at a disadvantage. The co-location of Committee Chairs with their
Committee staff would be an instant efficiency gain. Indeed,
Parliaments in other parts of the world would be aghast that a Chair of
a Committee was not co-located with the staff of his or her Committee.
That will clearly need to be thought about in the future, if Select

effectiveness.</hs_Para>

I think the long-term game must be to do what we did with the Derby
Gate Library—we acquired a building and put all the Library
staff there to create a corporate centre for the Library—and
have a similar building for Select Committees. I have in my
mind’s eye the Canon row police station. I cannot believe that
the police will be there for ever or that when that building becomes
available, the parliamentary estate will not wish to acquire it. It is
already in the public sector and would be an ideal building in which to
co-locate Chairs of Committees, their Committee staff and their
constituency staff, so that they are not separated. That would be a
major step forward in the effectiveness of Select Committees. It would
also mean that we could vacate 7 Millbank and release it from the
parliamentary estate, because it is largely occupied by Select
Committee staff.</hs_Para>

in thanking the staff of the House, we should add our thanks to the
Library staff, whose work for my Committee and others has been
invaluable. I know that it was a bit counter-cultural for the House of
Commons to do this—there is a sense that the Library staff work
for all Members, not Select Committees, whose own staff should deliver
for them—but the ability to lend Library staff to Select
Committees for particular inquiries has been extremely useful and very

the vision for the future, our aim is that Select Committees should be
respected, listened to and, indeed, feared by Departments and Ministers
for the quality of our investigations, the rigour of our questioning,
the depth of our analysis and the value of our reports. Our influence
should go beyond the subjects that we choose to inquire into. I am
reminded of an anecdote by a 
<?notus-xml column=1420?>special adviser in a new Government, who told me, “You have no
idea how much the attention of a Select Committee on a part of a
Department galvanises the civil servants in that part of the
Department, because they know they’re going to come under
intense public scrutiny.” The benefits of Select Committees
doing more of their work, producing more reports and doing more
inquiries are obviously beyond doubt.
Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T13:40:08"></hs_TimeCode> ability to

hearing about crime and the recording of crime statistics, which
demonstrates the role we can play in public life in empowering
individuals whose ability to give evidence is being stifled. We can
provide them with a unique opportunity to explain their concerns,
protected by privilege. The role of these Committees and the powers
they can draw on will need to become better understood by the public.

the whole issue of House of Commons finances and how this place is run,
I personally think that we should open it up and charge a commercial
rate to anybody, providing they are legal, and that includes political
parties and trade unions. They should be fully declared and the
information should be fully open on the public register. After all,
what is the difference between a political party or a trade union
making a profit as opposed to a commercial bank making one? Provided
everything is properly declared and provided a full commercial

Committee has made it perfectly clear that there are to be some
exceptions to full commercial cost recovery, for charitable
organisations or events run by Members, for example. I think a third
category of events run by all-party groups could be considered. If they

pity—no, it would be more than that; it would be a serious
limiting effect—if we limited the work of Select Committees by
the amount of finance they receive. There clearly needs to be a budget.
My suggestion would be for each Select Committee to put in its bid
within an overall budget that is administered by the Chairman of the
Liaison Committee. If a Select Committee has a particular problem for a
good, well-made reason, it might need to incur additional expenditure
through the year and should be able to go before the Chair to make its
case. If the overall budget were breached, our Committee would have to

that as a chartered surveyor. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the

doing the most efficient job and saving the most work if we adopt the
more extreme option, which is to decamp this House. If we do decamp,

others Members have said, if one goes down into the basement of this

lighting and IT and communication services are very fragile indeed, and
our works department and works contractors do a fantastic job in
keeping them going, but there is only so long that that can be done
before a complete renewal will be needed. As has been said, there has
not been such a complete renewal, and certainly not on the entire
building, although part of it burnt down during the war. Some of the
services in this place are therefore very ancient indeed, and we will

Victoria tower gardens for only a fraction of its life and then it
would not be used. As a chartered surveyor, I think that there will be 
<?notus-xml column=1424?>some resale value to this building, however, and I believe it is still

Angela Eagle</B> (Wallasey) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to have
been here to listen to the vast majority of this extremely important
debate. I am glad the House of Commons Commission decided that having
annual debates on this topic on the Floor of the House would be a good
use of time, and I am delighted that the Backbench Business Committee
agreed, because that has allowed us to have a very enlightening debate.
I also want to thank the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and
Easter Ross (John Thurso) for opening the debate and for summing up the
issues that the House’s various administration
Committees—particularly, in my case, the House of Commons
Commission—have been wrestling with.</hs_Para>

programme that the House has been working towards since 2010 has been
managed efficiently, as has been demonstrated, and I should like to add
my voice to those Members who have commended the work 
<?notus-xml column=1426?>done to find the £16.1 million of savings needed in the coming
year. It is right that we have a savings programme, and that we not
only play our part but are seen to play our part in the general
belt-tightening that has to go on across the country. However, it is
vital when finding savings and efficiencies that we are constantly
mindful of the knock-on effects on Parliament and its role. These
savings must not impact on the House’s ability to scrutinise the
Executive—a theme of today’s
contributions —or on Members’ ability to
represent and serve their constituents.</hs_Para>

House is cutting its budget by 17% over five years, the other place has
no formal savings programme. I am told that it has achieved savings of
15%, which is wholly welcome, but its having a formal process that
could be held to account, in the way we are doing here, would have been
desirable. We must ensure that the standing of the House of Commons in
relation to the other place is not weakened because of our savings
programme, and that we maintain an appropriate balance between the two
Houses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112171000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112171000104">When
a large savings programme is put into effect, it often tends to be done
at the expense of the lower-paid members of that organisation. That is
the lazy way of conducting efficiency and savings programmes, and I am
delighted that we have taken steps to avoid falling into that trap. We
must ensure that we are seen not to fall into it, which is why I
welcome the assurances the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and
Easter Ross was able to give us on zero-hours contracts and the London
living wage. I welcome the lead that you have taken, Mr Speaker, on the
latter, and the ambition that has been shown and set out in our
discussions today. I hope that by Christmas the House will be
accredited as a living wage employer for our directly employed staff,
and by next April for our contractors. If we can achieve
that—from what the hon. Gentleman said, it sounds as though we
are on track—we will all be rightly proud, and it will
demonstrate to others who have savings to make that they do not have to
make them at the expense of their lowest-paid
workers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112171000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112171000105">As
you know, Mr Speaker, I have been explicitly and particularly exercised
to ensure that we do not use zero-hours contracts as part of our
employment terms. I therefore welcome the tantalising early look the
hon. Gentleman gave us at the advice which will be coming to the
Commission on Monday, which allows flexibility but ensures mutuality of
expectations. I warmly welcome the commitments we heard from him today
and I hope we will have minimum hours guaranteed, and not have to
resort to the easy and unfair expedient of zero-hours contracts. I look
forward to considering the advice he hinted at in his opening remarks
when the Commission meets on Monday.</hs_Para>

to take this opportunity to recognise the great work and expertise of
the staff in this place—a constant theme of all who have
contributed to this debate, and one I warmly endorse. Often, we are the
people who are seen, talked about and given credit when we achieve good
things, but this House could not operate without the fantastic work of
the staff who keep us going, whatever their level or grade. I always
find them enormously
helpful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112171000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112171000107">I
also want to address the potential for further savings and
efficiencies, and suggest something that could be done to deal with the
important points that the Select 
<?notus-xml column=1427?>Committee Chairs who have contributed to today’s debate have made
about their own resources. It is time we explored the potential for
further savings and efficiencies by merging the administration of this
House and the other place. There is no reason why, in the 21st century,
we should have separate administrative bodies for each House. For
example, Parliamentary Information and Communications Technology, known
as PICT, which has operated as a bicameral service since 2001, provides
Members with an excellent service. Perhaps its advantage is that it was
created in 2001 and not 1801. Moreover, security, visitor services,
estate management, outreach, broadcasting and other such services are
run on a joint basis. Procurement will also be run
jointly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112171000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112171000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jenkin" PimsId="1170" UID="13112171000164" xid="310" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112171000164">Mr
Jenkin:</Member></B> Of course we must be ready to explore anything in
these times of austerity, but I honestly believe that the hon. Lady
will find that some of the lessons of those joint services are not
comfortable ones. Running a single organisation with dual governance is
difficult. An example is running Committee staffs when there are
already complicated personnel issues, such as trying to support them
with flexible staffing arrangements. There is good exchange between the
two Houses and Clerks Departments, and it would be absolute madness to
consider merging the Clerks Departments of both
Houses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112171000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112171000109"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ms Angela Eagle" PimsId="3064" UID="13112171000165" xid="185" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112171000165">Ms

place, with two legislatures that are not the same but coexist in the
same building, in a far more effective and efficient way. That does not
mean making them completely co-operative in the way the hon. Gentleman
suggests, but it does mean that we should see what efficiencies and
savings we can get from running joint services. There is absolutely no
reason why we cannot make large administrative savings from doing
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112171000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112171000110"><B><Member ContinuationText="Thomas Docherty" PimsId="5686" UID="13112171000166" xid="1052" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112171000166">Thomas

dismissing this without thinking much more carefully about the

hold the Executive to account even more effectively than they do now. I
do not know whether he has talked himself and his Committee out of

of the worries that have been expressed today about the more radical
proposals to rent this place out on a completely commercial basis. I
hope we can all agree that we should expect to cover the costs of

join Members across the House who have rightly expressed support for
the way in which the House continues to manage the provision of
services. Much continues to be achieved in delivering high-quality
services to Members, to enable them to provide support for their
constituents and to provide the representation here that is integral to
our democratic process. We can do all that only because of the
tremendous service and support that we receive from the staff of the
House. Integral to the way in which the savings targets have been
delivered has been the way in which the House staff have participated
and offered their ideas on how the plans in the various Departments
could be brought together.</hs_Para>

over three years ago, the House of Commons Commission committed itself
to reducing the administration estimate by at least 17% by 2014-15. I
am pleased to see that we are on track to meet that target. This is
related to the reduction in administration costs across government as a
whole, including an average reduction in departmental budgets of 19%
over four years, and a reduction in the overall administration costs in
many Departments of one third in real terms. Of course, this is not
only about administration costs; it is also about delivering
efficiencies that can be reinvested to enable services to be
qualitatively improved wherever possible.</hs_Para>

that already. Good examples of where that can be, and should be, done
are security, procurement and back-office

the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin) has made some good
points in this regard. It is not an anomaly; it is a constitutional
fact, and it is not going to change in the immediate future, so far as
I can see. I know from my conversations with the Leader of the House of
Lords that the Lords want to work together with us, but we must respect
their position and the need for the two Houses to make decisions for
themselves. My hon. Friend rightly drew the analogy of two local
authorities working together to share support services and back-office
functions. We can and should do this, but there might well be
governance issues and areas in which separate decisions will continue
to be
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:19:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0002.htm#13112191000009">I

the shadow Leader of the House gave of PICT. None the less, when we
look at PICT, we must understand that there are certain areas of
activity in which having two masters makes the business of trying to
manage a service much more difficult. Effectively, we need to
distinguish between the two sets of governors, as it were, and see
whether they have entirely complementary objectives. It might be true
for many areas of human resources, administration and back-office
functions, but, in some other respects, the two Houses might not
necessarily have the same objectives and, because of the nature of the
governance, they must be given the opportunity to manage those
separately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:21:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000014">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:21:53"></hs_TimeCode>

the Member for The Cotswolds (Geoffrey Clifton-Brown). Pay is clearly a
significant part of the overall management of cost. I know that there
have been intensive discussions between management and trade unions,
but too many issues remain unresolved for a 
<?notus-xml column=1431?>deal to be done. The Management Board’s offer was a fair one, but
it remains open to discussions with the trade unions. I hope that it is
understood—I have had my own conversations with the staff about
this—that there is no possibility of either the House or the
staff winning from a court case. The net result of continuing with the
court action will be a negative one overall, and it is in the interests
of both sides to continue to try to reach a deal—if one can be
reached<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:23:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000015">I

contracts. I entirely take the point made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:23:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. Strictly
speaking, such contracts mean no minimum guaranteed hours
and an obligation to undertake work at the request of the
employee. There are no corresponding obligations from the employer in
relation to the employee. That is not what we have, or what we are
looking to have. We want a relationship with our staff that recognises
that they and we have a legitimate reason for having flexibility and
call-off contracts, but that should be on the basis of offering minimum
hours if staff are looking for that and if it is consistent with the
needs of the House. I am talking about areas such as visitor services
and catering. We must always ensure that we meet our obligations in
relation to annual leave, sick pay, training and, importantly, access
to internal vacancies as and when they
arise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:24:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000016">The
House is asked to note the medium-term financial plan. I am tempted to
take the position of the shadow Leader of the House and say nothing
more about restoration and renewal. However, I will just say that it is
a major issue. It is not simply that the expenditure is beyond the
medium-term financial plan. We need to assure ourselves that the
expenditure that we are undertaking on capital is not nugatory and will
contribute beneficially to the overall programme. However, that does
not require us to rush at defining what that overall and major
programme looks like. Options should be properly explored and
costed.</hs_Para>

involvement of the Major Projects Authority and Infrastructure UK in
the review process is entirely sensible. Members in this House and in
the other House will have potentially strong views on whether it is
necessary to leave this place for a period. There could be a decant for
a short time, or a long time, or no decant at all. No one would choose
to decant; it is not something that any of us seek. None the less, we
must understand that the risks and constraints on us if we do not do so
may also be considerable. The independent assessment needs to give us a
clear understanding of the options in terms of the practicalities, cost
and potential value for money. The decision will not emerge from the
options appraisal; it is a decision that we will have to make. We need
to weigh the costs and complexities against how we manage our business
and how the House continues to meet its obligations. Indeed, the
relationship between Parliament and Government in trying to manage the
business of government is a significant one, so we will only make a
decision on the basis of that assessment and of Members being
consulted. A decision will be made at the proper time.

of Commons Commission, I can say that we have rightly identified how we

young people as possible to have a direct experience of Parliament,
which they will carry with them through their lives. We are aiming for
100,000 young people, but it is a shame that we cannot aim for 600,000.

at some point during their school lives, they would have an opportunity
to visit Parliament. To be as ambitious as we are is the very least

a reference to further pressures, including the Government’s

not elaborate, but I am talking about things such as the public reading
stages of Bills. I am keen to work with colleagues from across the
House on the further development of our petition system, including the
Government e-petition system, which will make it easier for the public
to engage with us. It will be readily accessible and will help the
public to understand that they are petitioning Parliament and
Government on their issues—not one or the other. There will be
an enhanced expectation about and experience of the response, and a

implementation of the new stalking laws—sections 2A
and 4A of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which came into
force on 25 November 2012. The new legislation was passed as a result
of the work of the independent parliamentary inquiry into stalking law
reform, which I had the privilege of chairing. The inquiry drew its
membership from both Houses of Parliament and from across the political
parties, as well as from Cross Benchers in the other place. I think
that this might have been the first example of a cross-party group that

sentencing practice surrounding that law, the availability of treatment
programmes for perpetrators, parole arrangements , the need for
training for police and the probation service, stalking law in the
European Union, and, crucially, the experience of victims and their
families. Over the course of six months, the panel took oral and 
<?notus-xml column=1435?>written evidence from criminal justice professionals, academics and
legal experts as well as victims of stalking and their families. On 7
February 2012, we published a report and recommendations based on that

credibility of the evidence provided to the inquiry panel. The new

plagues his or her victim with flowers, phone calls, letters and gifts.

the courts in England and Wales in the first six months following
enactment of the new stalking laws. In a letter to me dated 27
March 2012, the Home Secretary informed me that 
<?notus-xml column=1439?>the Government would be consulting various stakeholders to ensure that
the police and prosecution service have the necessary training and
guidance to enable them to make best use of the new legislation.
However, although I understand that the police have begun training, to
date less than 30% of police officers have seen the e-learning
packages. The number of arrests in the first six months was just 320.
In Scotland, by contrast, in the 30 months since their law was
introduced 1,431 detections had been recorded, and 1,046 of them had
commenced prosecution. Of the 1,046, 450 had secured convictions and
315 still awaited prosecution. That suggests that the figures for

analysis of cases dealt with by Paladin has shown that the Crown

choose to enter a plea bargain, so denying the victim the right to a

the past few months, the Government have taken proactive steps to
improve the treatment that victims of crime receive from the criminal
justice system. The government have raised the possibility, for
example, of giving victims the opportunity to challenge decisions taken
by the CPS not to charge suspects, or to drop prosecutions. This is
essential work, and it must be followed through if we are to see any
real change. As a result of the stalking law reform campaign and our
inquiry here in Parliament, we now have more robust legislation to
tackle the problem of stalking. But having a robust law is not enough;
we must ensure that it is properly and thoroughly implemented. Thorough
and complete training must be rolled out for all criminal justice
professionals and monitored by relevant Departments within Whitehall.
Victims must be made to feel more confident in the system. Most
importantly, however, and since stalking is characteristic of obsessive
behaviour, getting conviction rates up on its own will not stop these
problems occurring. That is why, in the long term, we must combat the
root of the problem by introducing a register of perpetrators and
treatment programmes for serial stalkers.</hs_Para>

forward to reading, the Minister will be able to respond to those
initial figures and perhaps produce some updated figures with which to
help us. I welcome him to his place on the Front Bench. He is not the

the end of June 2013, data from 30 of the 42 police services

that there have been 320 arrests, with 189 alleged offenders
having been charged. However, so far only 33 of them have been
convicted of stalking. I recognise that the majority of these cases are
still being processed, but the numbers of arrests do seem to be low. If
the figures are representative, as they probably are, there will have
been about 450 arrests under the new laws in that six-month period.
However, in Scotland, where the new laws became effective at the
beginning of 2011, there have been more than 1,450 detections of
stalking in the first 30-month period, and I understand that so far
about a third of those individuals have been convicted. During the

seems to be widespread inconsistency between the police service areas
in England and Wales. I have had a look at some of the figures. There
were 133 arrests in the Metropolitan police service area,
but in Gloucestershire there were none. In between those extremes,
there were 36 arrests in Lancashire, 20 in my own Thames Valley police
area, 14 in Suffolk, 12 in Bedfordshire, 
<?notus-xml column=1443?>and just two in Merseyside. I think all Members
would agree that there is something very challenging about those
statistics. The number of people charged also varies. The Metropolitan
police service is again on top with 71. My own Thames Valley police
area had 12. In north Wales there were six, in Sussex eight, and in
Leicestershire 10—I could go on.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:04:34"></hs_TimeCode> number of
those so far convicted is too small to be of any statistical
significance whatsoever. I hope the Minister will be able to share some

would also welcome an observation from the Minister on how we can
improve the situation and on what the Government intend to do about
their strategy and working with the police. Case material received by
my office from Paladin seems to indicate that there are some major
outstanding training needs, particularly in the understanding of the
new laws. I think we need to consider all stalking behaviour when

want to talk briefly about some of the sentencing trends. Current
sentencing decisions are inconsistent. Several of the jail sentences,
which are rare in themselves, have been for only a few months, while
suspended and community sentences appear to be commonplace. We need to
revise those sentencing guidelines and reissue them pretty quickly to
ensure some consistency across the board. I do not believe that the
guidelines have been revised since the new laws came into place a year
ago. Therefore, we have confusion at best; we certainly do not have the
clarity envisaged when the legislation was
introduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:07:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
There is no evidence that magistrates and judges have received adequate
training on how to interpret the new laws. That is absolutely
essential: our magistracy and judiciary need that training in order to
understand what is, after all, a complex area of
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:08:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000087">I

will not surprise Members that in my contribution I shall briefly
compare the situation in Scotland and in England and Wales, and look at
the behaviour and treatment of perpetrators and the work and experience
of the national stalking helpline, if time permits. I pay tribute to my
constituent Ann Moulds, who endured years of torment from a stalker.
She has been at the heart of campaigns to raise awareness of stalking
at both national and local level and founded Action Scotland Against
Stalking. This is a voluntary organisation which was set up to campaign
for victims of stalking to be protected through the introduction of
specific anti-stalking legislation and to help progress the rights of
victims within the criminal justice process. It is obviously a sign of
progress that we now have legislation across the UK to deal with
stalking, and Ann Moulds has played an important part in helping to
bring these laws
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:12:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000095">As
we heard, in Scotland in the first 30 months of the legislation more
than 1,400 charges were reported to the Crown Office and
Procurator Fiscal Service, of which 1,046 resulted in the commencement
of a prosecution, with around 460 convictions. I am informed by the
Crown Office that 315 cases are still in process. Given that the
legislation is relatively new, I give it two cheers. The numbers are
positive, as we have heard, compared with the situation in England and
Wales, where the population is much bigger. It is useful to look at how
the legislation is being implemented in both places to see what lessons
can be
learned.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:13:53"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

hon. Members have said, the reported detection rates for England and
Wales suggest a clear lack of effective implementation of the stalking
legislation. One of the biggest issues is the lack of statistical data
to establish a base-line reference for a true measurement of the
problem. Training completion rates for police services suggest that a
higher level of detection rates could be anticipated, but police
recording of the crime lacks transparency and practices are not being
systematically monitored. Whatever the precise stalking rate, it is
clear that it is dramatically higher than the number of persons
identified by the police would suggest. In other words, the low
detection rates supported by anecdotal evidence provide enough
information to suggest that there is a severe lack of expertise in
stalking cases throughout the police, prosecution agencies and the
courts, not a lack of stalking
cases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000097">The

as a concept is completely different from harassment: it has a
different mode, motive and perspective. An inability to recognise those
intrinsic differences is one reason why stalking is not taken seriously
enough. Recognising stalking as a distinct and serious crime
is in the interest not only of victims but of the public,
because it plainly shows that such an offence has been
committed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000099">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:15:50"></hs_TimeCode>
is a vast difference between someone identified as a stalker and
someone who has got into trouble for harassment, as harassment says
very little about the persistent, obsessional nature of the crime.
Should an offender come before the criminal justice system again, it
will be clear that he has a conviction for stalking. That is important
in detecting stalkers who are serial ones, as many are. Stalking can
lead to other forms of serious acts of violence, so it is important to
establish such
links<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:16:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
Prosecution for stalking signifies that the stalking has been
acknowledged and taken seriously. It sends a clear message to the
victim and to the public, and it encourages other victims to seek help
and to report cases to the

criminal justice system is a tool that we, as a society, use to signal
what is and what is not acceptable. Based on many years’
experience, I firmly believe that where legislation is brought in,
hearts and minds will follow. Victims should no longer be expected to
live with the constant fear and powerlessness of being stalked. A
miscarriage of justice occurs not just when an innocent person is
wrongly convicted, but when innocent victims are failed by the state,
sometimes at the cost of their lives, including from a failure to
realise that psychological harm can be every bit as serious as physical
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:17:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000101">There

that involving Ashley was lowered from a section 39 charge of stalking

return to the subject of perpetrators, I was astounded to hear last

suggested that some domestic violence offenders could be directed to

That would take us back to the early ’90s—it failed then
and it would fail now. To categorise domestic violence or stalking as
some kind of relationship dysfunction, rather than a crime, sends out
all the wrong messages. It is particularly worrying that that has come
from a person who is running the whole police force of Scotland. I
honestly thought that we had made much more progress than that. To make
matters worse, he takes issue with the fact that his officers have to
act in every case. It took us years to achieve that in domestic

NAPO’s study it became apparent that court report writers,
following training, often concentrated on the immediate matter before
the court and did not take into account previous histories or
behaviours. In NAPO’s view that meant that significant stalking
and harassment evidence was being missed by the courts on a finding of
guilt—a view also shared by the leadership of the
Magistrates’
Association.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000116">Probation
staff are concerned that evidence shows that sentences handed down by
the courts are often too short for rehabilitation or treatment to
occur, and that cumulative behaviour is not taken into account by the
courts when determining outcome. For example, it is not routine for
psychological or psychiatric assessments of the perpetrator to be
requested by the courts; indeed, often they are turned down. In the
view of NAPO and Paladin, as a consequence of that, women who are being
stalked are placed at grave risk. The cases submitted by NAPO members
are strikingly similar. They are disturbing and frightening for
victims, and all the experiences were harrowing. The overwhelming
majority 
<?notus-xml column=1448?>of victims were in constant fear; many were
physically injured and most experienced varying levels of assault. Many
were the victims of criminal damage, and in extreme cases victims were
either murdered or subjected to attempted murder. There is evidence
that perpetrators threaten the family and friends of victims to get
information, either in real life or through texts and the
internet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000117">A
number of common characteristics appear in all cases. Most victims
claim that a significant number of incidents occur before they go to
the police, and often their complaints are not investigated thoroughly.
Stalking usually occurs over a long period—often
years—and tends to be a mix of real life and cyber-stalking.
There is overwhelming evidence that a perpetrator’s behaviour
escalates if there is no criminal justice intervention or treatment. It
appears that stalking behaviour is not properly recognised by
professionals. In most cases—although not all—there is a
history of domestic violence, with numerous incidents before matters
are reported to the police. In a number of cases men were placed on
domestic violence courses that were not appropriate, especially for
those with links to mental ill health.</hs_Para>

supplied by Paladin illustrates the problems that victims face. Rachel,
aged 40, has been the subject of a long-term campaign of stalking. The
stalker breached a court order banning him from contacting Rachel just
hours after it was made. The magistrates court heard how he turned up
at her address and workplace demanding she hand over cash, and he
admitted stalking involving serious alarm and distress. He was given an
18-week suspended prison sentence and ordered to stay away from Rachel,
but the next day he showed up at her place of work and was re-arrested.
He told police, “She better not live in that house when I get
out. I mean it.” His defence team stated that he was desperate
and pleading for help. They said he did not threaten her when she said
no to giving him money. The judge ordered the man to serve 18 weeks for
each breach of the restraining
order.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000119">I
strongly believe that whether a perpetrator is given a community or
custodial sentence, a treatment programme from skilled practitioners is
essential if victims are to be protected. I would welcome any statement

Patel</B> (Witham) (Con):</Member> I, too, commend the opportunity to
speak in this debate, and congratulate those who secured it. This is an
immensely important issue, and those of us in the House this afternoon
will agree that more often than not, we do not spend enough time
focusing on many of the challenges associated with the horrific issue
of stalking, the impact it has on victims, and the processes that
victims endure on their journey through the criminal justice system. I
pay tribute, as all speakers have, to the work of Harry Fletcher and
Laura Richards of Paladin national stalking advocacy service, and that
of many others.</hs_Para>

would like to consider the experience of the victim. As co-chair of the
all-party group on victims and victims of crime, I have been exposed to
all sorts of horrible stories relating to stalking
and other crimes, 
<?notus-xml column=1449?>which have shone a spotlight on the process that individuals must go
through, in addition to the personal suffering, trauma and emotional
distress. It will not surprise the Minister to hear me say that I have
long believed that victims’ voices should be at the centre of
the criminal justice system, and I pay tribute to the Lord Chancellor
and Secretary of State for Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) for supporting the work of the
all-party group.</hs_Para>

is clear from everything we have heard today that the voices of
stalking victims are not represented effectively in the criminal
justice system. The issue is not just about going to court, but the
entire process: engagement with the police, how cases are treated, the
thoroughness of investigations and whether complaints are taken
seriously. It is fair to say that the process is ad hoc. There is not
enough consistency and victims are being let down. It is excellent that
new stalking laws are in place, but it is clear to all of us that much
more needs to be done to assist victims properly.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000123"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:32:17"></hs_TimeCode>To
focus on the level of victims’ dissatisfaction with the criminal
justice system process and with the professionals in it, I shall refer
to the briefing from Paladin. Laura Richards produced a study that
revealed the deep dissatisfaction felt by victims of stalking and the
secondary victimisation that occurs—a very important
point—when reliving the trauma of horrific experiences. We hear
time and again about victims’ lack of confidence in the long
judicial process, which does not acknowledge their emotional distress.
Stalking is life-changing for victims, and the injustice has numerous
psychological and physical aspects that affect their ability to engage
and function socially. Irrespective of whether there has been a
physical assault, there is psychological and emotional
trauma.</hs_Para>

are treated in a totally different way from victims. We need balance
and fairness, and we must focus on fairness for the victims. I think
the point has already been made this afternoon that victims tend not to
report to the police after one or two incidents, but after the
hundredth incident. There are many experts on this subject. We know
that perpetrators are serial offenders, that they are persistent and
malicious, and that they inflict as much psychological damage as
possible and, in the worst cases, physical damage and the ultimate
harm. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:34:47"></hs_TimeCode>The
offending is relentless, but the system—the police
interventions, the criminal justice system, the whole
process—does not know how to address these issues. Much of it is
down to how an officer responds on the scene or interacts with victims
in the first instance. The situation is dreadful and something has to
change.</hs_Para>

letting victims down. It is appalling to think that, as we have heard

is pretty clear that the victims of stalking are consistently let down
by the criminal justice system. Victimisation is an issue, as I have
said, but although new laws have been introduced, it is pretty obvious
that victims are still not at the heart of the criminal justice system.
There is no doubt that many agencies display a lack of awareness of the
new law, as the comments I have quoted show.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:42:18"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan) spoke about
training. There is no doubt that we need much more training, education
and awareness. Again, incidents are treated in isolation, not linked
with the totality of an offender’s behaviour and thus not seen
as stalking when the victim finally reports. It is relentless. We have
heard examples already, but although a perpetrator might be arrested,
that is not linked with their stalking behaviour and they are not
charged appropriately for that or for harassment. Then there are the
wider issues about such behaviour leading to domestic abuse.</hs_Para>

to touch on the courts. It is quite clear that the courts are not
always aware that victims might have been stalked consistently over a
long period, as they will be dealing with only the latest and most
recent element of crime in a case, with the result that the offender
might not receive the right sentencing, as the judge or
magistrate will not be fully aware of the context or history. There is
so much more that the courts and the Crown Prosecution Service could do
in this area, as well as by working with the police. I feel that the
CPS sometimes enters into plea bargaining with offenders and drops
charges in exchange for a guilty plea for a smaller number of lesser
offences. We must look at this whole area if we are to ensure that
victims receive the justice they deserve.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:44:05"></hs_TimeCode>as they must
be—this is not about “should”; it is about
“must”. They need to be treated with respect throughout
their journey and their experience. All the research shows that too
often the accounts of perpetrators are given precedence over those of
victims, without thorough checking for corroborative evidence. Victims
are not signposted to the appropriate support or given the right kind
of safety advice or risk assessment. Again, it is a matter of securing
the right balance. All of us who work with organisations and

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:45:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Witham (Priti Patel) said about the need to hear victims’
voices in this debate 
<?notus-xml column=1452?>as we evolve the way in which we address stalking within our society. I
shall speak about my own personal experience of these issues. I thought
long and hard about whether it was appropriate to do so and came to the
conclusion that it was—even though some might accuse me of
abusing my position as an MP in putting these issues to
Ministers—because of the concerns I have as someone currently
experiencing some of these behaviours.</hs_Para>

Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Mr Llwyd)—<I>[Interruption.]
</I>The right hon. Gentleman says “10 out of 10” from a
sedentary position, so I thank him for that. I am in awe of the work he
has done through the independent inquiry into stalking. I add my
heartfelt thanks, too, to people such as Harry Fletcher and Laura
Richards for their work. In three short parliamentary years, we have
seen a powerful advocacy process, with the independent inquiry and
changes made to the law. That has, for me, been phenomenal. It is a
test for all of us to see whether we can match that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000143"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:46:34"></hs_TimeCode>A
year ago, when I was part of the shadow Home Affairs team, I was
honoured to work on the changes to the legislation. Never in a million
years did I think I would have to know the details of this legislation
so thoroughly to deal with something that was happening to me. I was
particularly struck at the time by the importance of bringing the
victim’s voice into these issues and the need to create an
offence in legislation that looked not at the particular behaviours of
the offender, but at the experience of victims and the impact the
offence had on them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000144"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:47:01"></hs_TimeCode>I
was struck by what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:47:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Sandra Osborne)—only
nine out of ten for my pronunciation this time—said about
obsession, how society should regard the impact of one person fixating
on another person and what that might mean for the people involved.
Impact matters because much of our criminal justice system nowadays is
about watching and waiting.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:47:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Witham spoke about that, too—that we can see that someone
might be at risk, yet we look for escalation. The impact on an
individual changes that conversation. The individual voice needs to be
heard not just in sentencing, but in the prosecution, in trying to
address these issues and trying to understand the risk that someone
might face. Having spoken to victims of a whole range of different
types of stalking, I know just how important it is for their voice to
be heard. A lot of stalking is about control; it is about silencing
someone. It is crucial that we now have legislation that makes
victims’ voices part of the prosecution process.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000145"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:47:59"></hs_TimeCode>Like
many other Members today, however, I am concerned that, a year on, we
may not be making as much progress either in prosecuting or in changing
the culture as the legislation was designed to achieve, so I want to
add my voice to those encouraging the Minister to look at not just what
he can do with the police, but at what can be achieved by colleagues
across government in dealing with some of these challenges.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000146">Before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>
the legislation was drafted, figures suggested we were looking at about
120,000 cases a year, but I agree with
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:48:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock that that understates the
amount of pressure and the number of cases that need to be dealt with.
I agree, too, with the comments of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:48:32"></hs_TimeCode>
right  
<?notus-xml column=1453?>hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs
Gillan)—I am sorry she is no longer in her place—about
learning the lessons from Scotland and using this legislation, now that
we have it, to prosecute people effectively.</hs_Para>

work of Paladin is truly transformative. I encourage the Minister to go
and sit with Paladin, to listen to the cases, go through them and hear
about the experiences people are having, now that the legislation is
enacted. It is not just the volume of cases that is important because
we need to be able to address the different kinds of issues and
different kinds of behaviour that come up and their impact on
victims.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000148">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:49:14"></hs_TimeCode>
would particularly encourage the Minister to sit with the independent
advocates. I have worked with one of those advocates not just in
supporting victims of stalking generally, but in respect of my own case
after my experiences. I cannot over-emphasise how important it is to
have such a person with you. However strong someone is, this kind of
behaviour is distressing; it is designed to take out of people the
fight and the fortitude that might help them to deal with the problem
themselves. The independent advocates are vital. We have been talking
about the work done by Harry and Laura and others with the legislation,
but we also owe them a debt of gratitude for putting in place a support
process for victims. We must ensure our police are able to work with
that, and Members have highlighted the low take-up of police training
on these issues. It is crucial that the police understand the
new legislation and how to enforce
it.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:50:06"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

must tell the Minister that my own personal experience of this and my
experience over the summer of trying to support people who were being
victimised online has been very mixed. That is reflected in the
conversations I have had with the police and those in the
criminal justice system; there was a lack of awareness about the powers
they now have and the nature of this crime, such as the concepts of
escalation and control and how to respond to them. I am talking here
about practices such as treating incidents in isolation, issuing lesser
cautions, and minimising behaviour rather than addressing it and
thereby keep victims safe. That lack of training leads to a lack of
understanding of just how serious this issue can be.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000150">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:51:03"></hs_TimeCode>
must also put on record my concern about the increasing evidence that
police forces are moving away from the DASH—domestic abuse,
stalking and honour based violence—risk assessment in respect of
domestic violence. I am exceedingly troubled by that as a constituency
MP who has used that assessment method myself in working in particular
with women who are victims of domestic violence. As somebody who has
been a victim of stalking in a non-domestic violence case, I am also
concerned about the lack of training and understanding of what such
behaviour could
mean<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:51:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000151">I
have spoken previously about Caroline Criado-Perez receiving 50 rape
threats an hour. We did not know whether they were coming from one
person, 50 different people or several different people. Each incident
would require a different level of risk being applied based on the
person involved. I have to be honest with the Minister: an
understanding and comprehension of that range of scenarios was
not there within the police force. I believe this kind of training will
help police forces understand the different levels of risk people might
be facing, and help to prevent, rather than just monitor, these
offences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:51:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

recognise that the training of the police is only 50% of the story. I

will talk about online activity shortly, but first I want to point out
that victims must also be asked about what they think should happen.
When people are under this sort of pressure, we should not flinch from
saying that the impact on the victim is paramount. Therefore, if
someone is distressed, that is reason enough for the police to act and
the CPS to be involved.</hs_Para>

also recognise that insufficient resources are put into this. There is
a fear that we might open the floodgates, but if there are floodgates

feel I can add a little insight in terms of online forms of behaviour,
and I am very mindful of the fact that 50% of stalking cases involve
both online and offline behaviour. That is part and parcel of modern
life because we now spend our lives both online and offline. Our
freedoms are involved in that, too, and, as I have said, stalking and
harassment is about curtailing people’s freedoms and inciting
distress in them, and therefore making it impossible for them to lead
their lives as before. I direct the Minister to the work of Claire
Hardaker, at Lancaster university, who is trying to understand online
harassment and stalking. She was recently commissioned to do such
research, and it would send an incredibly powerful message if the Home
Office looked at it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000160">In my own
case, the difficulties the current legislation has in dealing with the
world online became powerfully obvious. The legislation refers to a
“course of conduct” or a consistent type of behaviour,
and the question is whether the same metrics for that course of conduct
can be applied to the online and offline environments. When the
Opposition were scrutinising the legislation, we tried to get the
Government to think about a list of types of behaviour that we, the CPS
and the police might be looking out for, because we recognised that as 
<?notus-xml column=1455?>life evolves and people have a life online and a
life offline it is important to ensure that we are not missing
particular types of
behaviour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000161">Although
the legislation refers to sending e-mails, it does not even begin to
deal with the very different types of behaviour that occur in the
social media that are now so much part of the modern world, such as the
ways in which and ease with which people can be contacted, and the ways
a victim can express concern and displeasure about the messages they
are receiving and behaviour they are experiencing. My concern is that
the attempt is being made to apply the “course of
conduct” test to the online and offline worlds in a similar way.
There is the sense that if someone is experiencing serious alarm or
distress online, it is somehow less serious. Instead, we need to
understand that, if that person is experiencing such pressure, and if
it is coming from someone whom they have told—whether online or
offline—they do not want to have contact with, we should not see
it as being any different.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000162">The course of
conduct deadlines need to be updated for both the CPS and the police,
so that the different ways in which the online world works are
recognised. One example is the different time periods relating to a
course of conduct. Offline, we might be talking about a contact period
of days or even weeks; online, an hour is a long time. Both Caroline
and I experienced people setting up accounts in order to send us rape
and death threats, causing us harassment and severe distress. We
publicly said that this was causing us severe distress, and they had
their accounts suspended, although they started new ones. However, the
question whether each incident is seen as a separate course of conduct,
or something that took place over the course of an hour, cannot be
dealt with under the current legislation. That example makes a powerful
case, which my right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary has also
made, for cyber-awareness within the police force—for
understanding that these are the ways in which online behaviour
works.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000163"><Member ContinuationText="John McDonnell" PimsId="1799" UID="13112191000356" xid="379" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000356"><B>John

Creasy:</Member></B> My hon. Friend has literally taken the words out
of my mouth; he is absolutely right. As I was about to say, we think of
a course of conduct in terms of person-to-person contact. It is vital
to understand that with social media, the ability to have an audience,
to have spectators, is crucial to the level of stress that can be
caused. Even if a perpetrator is not directly contacting somebody, by
using that public forum they are using the way in which the internet
and social media work to get a message to somebody. We need the police
and the CPS to understand that, to understand just how dangerous these
new forms of behaviour can be, so that they can act to protect
people.</hs_Para>

the Minister to revisit the debates we had a year ago on the importance
of having a more extensive list, in order to give a flavour of the
range of behaviours. Nobody is suggesting that there can be an
exhaustive list of behaviours for stalking, but we need to recognise 
<?notus-xml column=1456?>that there are sections of our society, and of our lives, that the

Immigration, the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr Harper), to work
with the CPS not only to get the training in place but to get a
commitment about test cases. It must be made clear that, as the world
evolves, we will not falter in our determination to change the way in
which the legislation is being used. We must ensure that the police,
the CPS and the judiciary as a whole are what I would call
cyber-sensitive. Just as we would not say to a woman,
“Don’t walk down those streets at night”, we must
ensure that we do not say, “Just come off Twitter and Facebook.
Don’t put yourself in a position of risk. You must curtail your
freedoms and rights so that we don’t need to deal with the risk
that you are facing.” We need to send a strong message that
these behaviours must be addressed and changed offline and online,
throughout all the areas that I have described.</hs_Para>

messages and debates that have been close to the bone, but this
legislation was designed to deal with something very
different—predatory behaviour. It was designed to deal with the
person who will send 50 rape threats in an hour, not just on one night

this and that we would bring justice to the victims and find a form of

Harris</B> (Castle Point) (Con):</Member> In my
experience—mercifully not my personal experience, but my
experience as a Member of Parliament—the new laws whose
anniversary we are celebrating today were spot on. They absolutely
address the experience of many of my constituents, but it is also clear
from my experience as a Member of Parliament and from what we have
heard today that they have not yet had time to bed down and work their
way through the police and criminal justice system.</hs_Para>

the legislation is to work, it is crucial for all those involved in the
police and criminal justice system to understand exactly what this
crime is. They need to know what to look for and listen for when
victims have the courage to come forward and complain, not least
because the perpetrators of this obsessive and controlling behaviour
can often be very manipulative and very convincing individuals. It has
also been pointed out that these stalkers can sometimes involve other
individuals and agencies in their crimes. Those agencies can include
social services, and I know of a case in which a benefits office was
used, involving numerous false calls. MPs themselves can sometimes be
drawn into this. Even the police can find themselves being used as
unwitting proxies in a harassment campaign.</hs_Para>

need a much wider understanding of these crimes throughout all
agencies, not just the police, and among the wider public. It is
important that the public understand more about this, because we need
to reach the victims and their families and supporters. They also need
to recognise this behaviour for what it is—criminal behaviour.
If they do not do so, they will not have the confidence to come
forward. Confidence is often completely lacking as a direct consequence
of the sustained, emotionally draining abuse that a victim is
suffering.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000174">Victims<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:04:20"></hs_TimeCode>
need greater knowledge. They also need the confidence that their
complaint will be taken seriously and not dismissed, as they often fear
it will be. I have often heard of such complaints being dismissed as
what appear to be a succession of relatively trivial incidents. As we
have heard, however, those apparently trivial incidents can have the
cumulative effect of making people feel positively imprisoned in their
own home and completely emotionally downtrodden.</hs_Para>

of the answer is to incorporate this subject into relationship
education in our schools. We need people to understand both the
potential victim and the potential perpetrator and to recognise that we
are not talking about a normal relationship, an argument or someone
getting their own back. It is controlling, dominating and threatening
behaviour. If we get that message across to young people and the rest
of society, we might be able to ensure that such patterns of behaviour
are not set in course in the first
instance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000176">In
this new year—one year on—we are fully capable of
addressing the appalling and soul-destroying crime of stalking. For
that to work in practice, we need a much wider understanding of the
methods that stalkers use and the effects that the crime has. Many
people do not realise quite how prevalent and damaging the crime is to
the people who suffer from it, and from the sustained abuse, and how
bad it is in society. By having this debate, I hope that we have
contributed towards that understanding.</hs_Para>

Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan) said, the debate on the
stalking law started at the justice unions group a number of years ago.
We received papers from Harry Fletcher, Laura and others explaining the
problem, and the right hon. Gentleman came up with the idea of setting
up a separate all-party group to carry out the investigation. I
apologise for attending only a couple of those sessions, but they were
enlightening to say the least.</hs_Para>

am pleased that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:07:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy) took the decision to speak
and to explain some element of her experience. We hear from other
people who have had equally horrendous experiences. To have got the
legislation in place within such a time scale from a Back-Bench
initiative was a near miracle, and certainly set a precedent, but, as
has been said, we are now a year on. What we have done so far is all
well and good, but we must also ensure that the law is implemented
properly. What we have heard across the House is that there are real
issues with implementation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000181"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:07:56"></hs_TimeCode>A
number of hon. Members quoted the arrest statistics, the comparison
with Scotland, and training. May I make a number of suggestions? On
training, it would be helpful if the Government brought in the police
and crime commissioners, the Magistrates Association and the Crown
Prosecution Service to have a joint discussion about where we go from
here. There is an inconsistent approach across the country in the
e-training of the police. Some police authorities and police and crime
commissioners have taken the matter to heart and engaged in the
process, but others have not. The job of Government is not to interfere
in the local aspects of what is happening on the ground but to
encourage a consistent approach. As has been said, that applies to the
police in terms of training, the CPS in terms of training and possibly
how it prioritises such matters, and the Magistrates Association in
terms of what is happening in the courts. Producing that defined line
is the role of Government. It is not about interfering, but about
bringing people together to discuss how we go forward more effectively.
In doing that, it would be useful if the Minister involved the justice
unions group and Paladin in the discussions, so that we can develop a
national
strategy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000182">Let
me turn to a couple of contentious issues. The proposed new legislation
on probation will mean that there is the potential for a large number
of people who 
<?notus-xml column=1459?>have been convicted of stalking to be categorised in
due course as low or medium-risk offenders and to be managed not by the
probation service, as they are now, but by the private company that
will take over some of that work. Apart from my opposition to the
privatisation overall, that makes me anxious because we have still to
learn the details of the professional qualifications and level of
training and experience in the supervision of offenders that the
private company’s staff will have. We await the details from the
Government and a number of us will seek to insert something into the
legislation to ensure that there is the required standard of service. I
would welcome an assurance that part of that will involve training
people on stalking and the legislation.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:10:30"></hs_TimeCode>I am worried
that in the rush to get the legislation to privatise the probation
service through—that is, the provisions in the Offender
Rehabilitation Bill on the supervision of nought to 12-month
sentences—we will lose expertise and no longer concentrate on
training people on the legislation on stalking.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000183"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:11:01"></hs_TimeCode>As
well as the justice unions group, we have established a family courts
unions group, which met this week. The legal aid cuts mean that there
are more litigants in person, so a large number of cases now involve
two individuals turning up without any legal representation whatsoever
to pursue their cases in the courts themselves. We are also concerned
that ex-partners who have become stalkers then use the family courts as
part of the stalking process to intimidate their former partners though
a dispute that is often unrelated to the future of their children. The
existence of litigants in person will mean that behaviour in courts
will become increasingly difficult to control. In the past such people
will have received legal aid and legal representation and there would
have been some control over the presentation of their cases. When they
become litigants in person, it is extremely difficult to ensure that
they behave in a manner that is not threatening or abusive. As part of
the monitoring of the stalking legislation, we must monitor whether our
family courts, in particular, are being used for abusive behaviour by
past stalkers.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000184"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:12:33"></hs_TimeCode>Court
reports have also been mentioned. The cuts to the probation service and
the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service have
increased the workload of the officers and mean that although people
are meeting their targets as best they can, it is becoming increasingly
difficult to provide court reports or even to enable time to be spent
on ensuring that sufficient information is provided to the court. It
has now been reported that cuts in the court service have led to some
of those staff being involved in the drafting of court directions as
there are insufficient clerks within the courts. The situation in some
of our family courts is almost chaotic.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000185"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:13:23"></hs_TimeCode>The
other issue brought up by the family courts unions group this week
concerns contact centres. Again, many of the cases of stalking we have
heard of have involved past partners who, for a variety of reasons,
have continued abusive behaviour after separation. Often, they will be
granted access to their children but it will be supervised access,
often through contact centres. There is a report in the <I>Law Society
Gazette</I> this week, I think, and we received a report from the
National Association of Probation Officers and the Public and
Commercial Services Union that states that there will be cuts to the 
<?notus-xml column=1460?>contact centres and some are now closing. They are
usually run by voluntary organisations, charities and others but
because of cuts, often to local funding, contact centres are closing or
curtailing their facilities. There is a concern that cuts overall might
mean that contact centres cannot be properly supervised. If a contact
centre is not available, we return to unsupervised contact, leaving
victims of stalking and abuse vulnerable. I would like the Minister to
look at that. The family courts unions group would welcome a meeting
with him to discuss it and the courts issues.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:15:05"></hs_TimeCode>As I have said,
the important thing now is to ensure that the system is geared up for
implementation of the legislation, and central Government have a role
to play in that by overseeing different aspects of the processes
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:15:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000186">The
briefing papers that Paladin provided show that there is an unusual
inconsistency across the country. In some instances that might be down
to the personal priorities of the police and crime commissioner,
or the background and experience of the individual chef police
officers. I think that it is the role of Government, when introducing
legislation, to ensure its consistent implementation across the
country, because otherwise it will become a postcode lottery whether
stalkers are prosecuted, whether the police are adequately trained and
whether other services are adequately resourced to tackle what at least
is now accepted as a significant issue in our
society.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_21_PT_1/D589057C9FAD5FF928FC3DB0153296AA52111009" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="21 November 2013">Thursday

it is not enough just to put an offence on the statute book; it must
also be enforced. We have heard clearly this afternoon that the law is
not being enforced properly. The freedom of information request passed
to Paladin, which was referred to earlier, showed that from 25 November
2012, when the law came into force, to the end of June this year 320
people were arrested for stalking offences. That was all. Of those,
only 189 were charged. That is very worrying because unless there are
lots of spurious complaints—no one is arguing that there are,
least of all me— there must be a real problem with the training
of the police and Crown Prosecution Service, which needs to be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:19:54"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
even more worrying when we look at the completed cases—I accept
that there are few at the moment. In those cases completed by the end
of June, six people received custodial sentences, and 27 were dealt
with by means of a community disposal. I want to make it clear that,
except in very exceptional cases, community sentences are not
appropriate to deal with stalking. Stalking wrecks lives, it damages
people psychologically, it affects their physical health, and it
affects their social well-being. Stalking is not something that takes
place at a distance. Stalkers enter people’s homes, they get
into their workplaces, and they go to the places where they socialise,
so a victim of stalking cannot feel safe in any aspect of their
life.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112191000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000192">Stalkers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:24:28"></hs_TimeCode>
often issue threats. What is more, half of those threats are carried
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:21:07"></hs_TimeCode>. In that
sense, stalking behaviour is a strong predictor of future violence. It

appalling feature is the huge
variation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:24:28"></hs_TimeCode>
between the arrest and prosecution rates in police forces. Some
examples have been given, but let me touch on a few more. Northumbria
force arrested eight people and prosecuted seven. Powys arrested three
and they were all prosecuted. The Met arrested 132 people, but only 71
were prosecuted. That is profoundly unsatisfactory. Whether victims
receive justice should not depend on where they live. We cannot have a
postcode lottery in law enforcement, and that, I am afraid, is what we
are seeing at the moment. Part of the reason for that seems to lie in
the failure to train police and Crown prosecutors adequately.</hs_Para>

National Policing Improvement Agency has produced a 20-minute online
package of training—very little in itself—but up to the
end of June only 27% of eligible officers had seen that package. The
rates of training vary hugely among police forces, even neighbouring
forces. In Greater Manchester, for example, 5,000 officers had seen it;
on Merseyside, only 76. In my own area of Cheshire, it was 57. One can
see a similar process with the CPS. Training has begun only this

do not blame the front-line officers or the prosecutors for that. The
blame actually lies squarely with the Home Office, which has to admit
that if it cuts police numbers, as it has, there is less time to take
officers off the front line for training or to update their skills, and
that if it cuts 25% of the CPS’s budget, the CPS has to manage
its caseloads differently and there is less time to develop training
packages or to let people take time out for training. That is what we

factor that needs to be clearly stated is that stalking is largely a
crime against women. Yes, there are male victims and they suffer just
as much as anyone else, but 80% of stalkers are men and 80% of victims
are women. As such, it has to be seen as part of the continuum of
violence against women—because stalking is violence. It is
psychological violence that can spill over into physical violence, and
it is part of the same perspective of harassing women and preventing
them from speaking out, as we have seen online recently, and treating
them as though they have no right to an opinion but are there merely to
be controlled.</hs_Para>

root cause of this sort of behaviour is an attitude prevalent in some
sections of our society that, sadly, sees women as objects to be
controlled and manipulated—as people who should not have an

the Government must not only deal with this crime but look at how to
prevent it. They must consider having a proper, and compulsory, package
of sex and relationship education in schools. I am sorry that they
rejected our amendment to the Children and Families Bill to make it
compulsory, because without teaching young people from the start that

There is no doubt that a small minority of stalkers are psychotic, and
there is evidence that some might have a personality disorder, so their
first contact with the criminal justice system ought to trigger a
mental health referral. Mental health treatment will 
<?notus-xml column=1463?>not be suitable for everybody, but there ought to be
an assessment to see whether it is the appropriate way forward before
someone’s behaviour spirals out of control and perhaps into
violence.</hs_Para>

third thing we would like the Government to do is to make sure that
sentencing guidelines are updated, because they have not been updated
since 2008, and that police officers and Crown prosecutors are trained
to ensure that the law is enforced. We cannot say to the victims of
this crime, “You must simply put up with it”, or,
“It’s not very serious.” We can no longer keep
saying that there is no action we can take. This is the 21st
century, not the 19th, and nobody should be subjected to this behaviour

Government have done the right thing by putting this law on the statute

incidents of stalking before they even report it, it is not lack of
evidence that is preventing this crime from being prosecuted; it is
lack of training and lack of will, and that is what we have to address.
I hope that the Minister will be able to encourage us that the
Government are moving towards doing so, because, to be frank, women in
this country—and it is largely women who are
affected—deserve better than to be told that this is behaviour
that they just have to put up with. It is not, we will not and it needs

including when

Member who has participated in the debate has made the point that
stalking is a serious crime and the various examples given—the
hon. Member for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy) spoke from her own personal
experience—have illustrated that it can seriously affect
people’s lives. People can be physically attacked and they can
lose their homes, families, friends and jobs in a bid to escape a
persistent, fixated stalker. Stalking can also take place in a
relationship or after a brief relationship, or people can be stalked by
a complete stranger. It varies and the response needs to take that into
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:33:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000208">The
crime survey for England and Wales shows that 4% of women and 3% of men

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:33:39"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, demonstrated clearly that there was a
gap in the law, and the Government were able—partly, I am sure,
because of the excellent case that was made, but also, I suspect,
because of the fortuitous timing of an appropriate piece of
legislation—to introduce the new offences very shortly after the
case had been so powerfully made. Legislation is, of course, not the
only response and I will address some of the other issues that have

Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:35:15"></hs_TimeCode> who are
elected, such as police and crime commissioners, will listen to the
concerns of the public, so they provide a good opportunity to drive the
issues home. Angus Macpherson, the police and crime commissioner for
Wiltshire and Swindon, is someone I know personally as I used to live
in Swindon, my home town. He attended a stalking awareness event and
made it clear that he wanted to understand the issue so that he could
see whether there were any provisions that he could put in place to
further support victims and stop offenders.</hs_Para>

cross-party on the issue, I note that the PCC for Greater Manchester,
Tony Lloyd, a former Member of this House, has welcomed the fact that
the police are taking stalking seriously, and has been working closely
with his police force to raise awareness of the importance of dealing
with that crime. There is a great opportunity for Members of Parliament
to work with police and crime commissioners and to have a democratic
voice in challenging police forces that may not take the issue as
seriously as they should. The vast majority of police and crime

College of Policing is the other new feature in the policing arena that

of the debate about police and crime commissioners focuses on the
“police” part of their role, but the most significant
benefit that they can being is the “and crime” part. It
is their role in their police areas to bring together all parts of the

Service and the voluntary sector—and to bang heads together so
that there is a properly joined-up approach in local areas. That is one
of the most significant things that police and crime commissioners can

look at whether different parts of the UK are doing things better, and
if they are, we should happily learn from them. That is a benefit of

have the necessary knowledge and understand what works and is
successful. The College of Policing can help share best practice, which
is one advantage of having set it up. The Government will keep that

is important to talk about victims and their experience of the criminal
justice system. We have consulted on a revised victims’ code to
give victims clearer entitlements. It was published at the end of
October, and will be implemented next month. It includes information on
the victim personal statement, which lets victims explain the impact of
the crime on them. That will be of particular benefit in stalking
cases, where much of the issue relates to the emotional and
psychological impact of the offence on the
victim.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000220">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:43:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:43:20"></hs_TimeCode>

Creasy:</Member></B> My concern, and that of other people who have
experienced this problem, is that the victim’s voice has
traditionally been heard when there is a prosecution, but that should
happen during the investigation of the offence. The police, like the
criminal justice 
<?notus-xml column=1467?>system, need to develop a different culture in which the offence is not
seen as an issue of harassment, but in relation to the impact of
particular forms of behaviour on the victim, because that opens up a
different investigative process. The training is so important because
too often the presumption is still that a victim comes in
after the offence has been determined, rather than as part of
the process of determining the
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000222"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="13112191000369" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000369">Mr
Harper:</Member></B> The hon. Lady makes a very good point. When the
impact on the victim is part of the importance of the offence, the
matter is more complex. She is right that that should form part of the
investigative process in terms of the work that needs to be done to
provide the evidence and to ensure that the right charge is brought. I
will draw her point to the attention of the College of Policing
for its consideration when rolling out the

hon. Lady also made an important point, sadly illustrated by her own
experiences this year, about the dark side that the internet brings
out, alongside all its benefits. On the internet, it is easier for
people to abuse their victims. Sometimes that happens wholly online and
that has a tremendous impact. Sometimes, it happens offline as well.
The Government are clear that if something is illegal offline, it is
illegal online. There is no difference. She said that in her experience

recognised
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0003.htm#13112191000224">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:46:22"></hs_TimeCode>

consider the course of conduct and the disparities in relation to that.
The police are doing some fantastic work. I pay tribute to the police
who are dealing with my case at the moment. However, they are hampered
by the disconnect between what we are told at a national level about
guidance and how that guidance is interpreted, especially with regard
to behaviour online. There is an issue with the understanding in our
criminal justice system of behaviours online and of what constitutes a
course of conduct. I am sorry to tell the Minister that I do not feel,

order/prison sentence, the scope of which was extended in 2008 to
include all those with a mental disorder. It seems to me that this
option should always be considered whenever the prosecution accepts a
plea of guilty to manslaughter owing to diminished responsibility.

have looked at the guidance for prosecutors of diminished
responsibility manslaughter cases, and it seems that it is not as clear
as it could be. The Minister knows it is the responsibility of
prosecutors to give advice, if asked, to the judge about their
sentencing powers. One would hope, therefore, that section 45A would
have a prominent place in the guidance, but it does not. The guidance
does not mention the possibility of a mixed order. Indeed, it refers to
an earlier case when such an order was not an option. This must be
changed. I recommend that reference be made to a more recent case, such
as the Court of Appeal’s decision in the Cooper case in 2010. I
simply suggest that we change the guidance to prosecutors.</hs_Para>

it goes further than that, because judges also rely on guidelines from
the Sentencing Council. Again, there are no sentencing guidelines
specifically about this issue. No such cases are included in the
Sentencing Council’s case compendium, which sets out sentencing
options for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility with
reference to older cases, but not the latest cases. Therefore, the
option of the mixed sentence is not foremost in judges’ minds
when making decisions. I accept that additional guidelines from the
Ministry of Justice would be available, but they are not in the main
guide that a judge would have when sentencing an

know that the family greatly appreciate the support she has given them

matters on the record, it is only right to say that 90% of homicides
are not perpetrated by people with mental illness. Indeed, the number
of homicides perpetrated by people with mental illness is going down,
as are all homicides. However, for the tiny minority of cases where the
perpetrator is suffering from a mental illness, we need to ensure that
the sentencing guidelines and the law are tight and clear, so that
families such as the Ilumoka family do not face, frankly, the injustice
and uncertainty that they are currently facing.</hs_Para>

would like to touch briefly on the broader issues raised by this case.
It is clear that if Mr Anabah had not been mentally ill, he would have
been given a life sentence for killing Abiodun Ilumoka and her unborn
child, and when he reached the end of his sentence he would have been
detained pending deportation, alongside other foreign nationals who had
committed crimes. The disparity between a life sentence and deportation
and escorted leave four years after sentencing is huge. I understand
that other people who have killed while mentally ill have been freed in
even shorter times. I can see why victims would feel that to be
fundamentally unjust. The lack of information provided to victims about
applications for hospital leave, coupled with the lack of opportunity
for relatives to have an input into applications for release when cases
come before the Mental Health Tribunal, must cause us all
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:07:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0004.htm#13112191000264">I
appreciate that this is my personal view, but having had experience of
such cases, I believe that judges should impose a minimum detention
time in all cases where there is a homicide conviction. It appears that
the power to impose a prison/hospital order already exists, but it
needs to be more prominent, so that mentally ill offenders can have
access to treatment and bereaved relatives can be provided with some
certainty. Judges and prosecutors should be considering the victim when
looking at sentencing. I hope that the Minister has taken on board the
points I have raised today and that the family will see the changes
they are campaigning

the hon. Lady said, Benjamin Anabah is now subject to a restricted
hospital order. It might help if I say a word or two about the broader
issues she has raised about the sentencing regime
in such cases. As she 
<?notus-xml column=1474?>made clear, the management of mentally disordered
offenders is a complex area, and it can be difficult for victims to
understand why individuals convicted of very serious offences are not
serving long prison sentences. However, as she also knows, it has been
the policy of successive Governments that mentally disordered people
who commit offences should receive treatment for their disorder in
hospital. When presented with medical evidence that a convicted
offender requires treatment in hospital under the Mental Health Act
1983, the courts have wide discretion to deal with the case as they
consider appropriate under the
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0004.htm#13112191000268">As
the hon. Lady says, one option is to impose a hospital order, which
diverts the offender from the criminal justice system. Offenders
sentenced to hospital orders are detained for as long as they require
treatment in hospital; there is no minimum period to be served. In
making a hospital order, the court is making a clear decision that the
offender should be diverted into the hospital system for treatment and
not be punished in the criminal justice system. When making a hospital
order, the higher courts may also impose a restriction order, which
requires evidence that additional controls are necessary for the
protection of the public from serious harm. The restriction order gives
my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice controls over
the offender’s access to the community and the level of security
in which the offender is held. In exercising these powers, priority is
always given to the protection of the public. This, of course, was the
option taken in Mr Anabah’s
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:10:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0004.htm#13112191000269">As
the hon. Lady also says, another option open to the court is the
hospital direction under section 45A of the Mental Health Act 1983.
This disposal was introduced in 1997, but at that time, as she said,
could be imposed only on offenders with a diagnosis of psychopathic
disorder. This, of course, is not the case now, because the Mental
Health Act 2007 abolished the separate categories of mental disorder.
Accordingly, since the 2007 Act was commenced, offenders with any form
of mental disorder can be dealt with by means of the hospital
direction. That option was therefore available to the court sentencing
Mr Anabah—but not one that the sentencing judge decided to
take<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:11:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0004.htm#13112191000270"><B><Member ContinuationText="Emily Thornberry" PimsId="4821" UID="13112191000380" xid="857" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0004.htm#13112191000380">Emily
Thornberry:</Member></B> The advantage of an order under section 45A is
that someone who is mentally ill can go into hospital and his condition
can be managed there; indeed, he could come out the other side and be
cured. He would then have to face the punishment that the public and
victim’s family certainly expect someone to

Wright:</Member></B> Yes, I agree. That is exactly the effect of a
section 45A direction. I can entirely understand why that is, of
course, a preferable option from a victim’s point of view. I
would repeat, however, that it is for the individual sentencing judge,
who must be cognisant of those options—I shall come back to the
hon. Lady’s point about guidelines—to decide what the
most appropriate sentencing choice should be in each circumstance. It
is difficult for all of us to second-guess the decision that the
sentencing judge made, so long as he or she was fully cognisant of the
options before him or her. As the hon. Lady says, it is quite right
that, if the offender recovers to the extent that treatment is no

the sentencing remarks. My concern, which I shared with the family, is
that the judge did not seem specifically to have directed his mind to
the possibility of a section 45A order. That is one reason why we are
so concerned about the lack of prominence given to it in the

Wright:</Member></B> I understand the hon. Lady’s point about
the guidance. I hear what she says about guidance to
prosecutors—and I will, of course, see whether we can improve
it. On this case, however, it is difficult for either the hon. Lady or
me entirely to second-guess the judgment of the sentencing judge, but I
would have thought that the judgment that really needs to be made in
such cases is whether the offence is a direct result of the mental
illness, in which case a hospital order might be appropriate, or
whether the defendant is culpable for the criminal act but also has a
mental disorder that could be subject to treatment, in which case a
hospital direction might be more appropriate. I understand her point
about the guidance. As she says, some guidance is already in existence,
but we will look at whether we can improve the guidance, particularly
to prosecutors, who are there to advise the sentencing judge on his or
her sentencing options.</hs_Para>

medication and psychological therapies as well as interventions to
address other risk factors such as substance use. The difference is
that the offender can be sent to prison should they recover to the

involve the loss of life, may find it difficult to accept that an

acknowledge that uncertainty about the time that will be spent in

courts have made a clear decision to divert the offender to a
psychiatric hospital for compulsory treatment, it follows that the
offender may be detained only for as long as treatment is needed. It
would be quite wrong to detain people in psychiatric hospital for any
longer than their mental health requires.</hs_Para>

safeguard against arbitrary detention. In establishing the tribunal,
Parliament imposed on it a statutory duty to discharge a patient if it
is not satisfied that the criteria for detention in the Mental Health
Act 1983 are met. I understand the point the hon. Lady makes about
repeated referrals back to the victim when 
<?notus-xml column=1476?>tribunal hearings become necessary, but I am sure she will understand
that it is important that the tribunal keeps a watch on detention to
make sure it does not take any longer than it should.

tragically, risk can never be entirely eliminated, either in relation
to offenders released from a prison sentence or offenders discharged

protecting the public, including victims, from further harm, but I

would be very interested to hear the Minister comments. First, how can
we stop there being community leave without the family knowing about
that? Secondly, what is the purpose of community leave? Its purpose is
to help an offender get back into the community, but the fact is that
this man has a recommendation for deportation. We do not want him back
in the community; we want him on the next plane out of the country as
soon as he has finished his

Wright:</Member></B> I will certainly try to pick up both those points
in the comments I want to make about community leave. Community leave
is an important part of the treatment and rehabilitation of mentally
disordered offenders. For restricted patients, community leave may be
taken only with the consent of the Justice Secretary, and permission
will be given only after a thorough risk assessment of the evidence.
Permission for escorted leave, during which the offender remains in the
custody of escorting staff, may be given some 
<?notus-xml column=1477?>considerable time before that patient is ready for discharge. However, I
should make it clear, with particular relevance to Mr Anabah’s
case, that the risk of absconding for those subject to a recommendation
for deportation will be a relevant factor in determining whether
escorted or unescorted leave is
appropriate.</hs_Para>

the answer to this question. If that is right and the recommendation

said, community leave is part of treatment. The hon. Lady will
recognise that there is a duty to respect the confidentiality of
medical treatment. None the less, in certain cases this information can
already be disclosed to victims on a discretionary basis.
Considerations such as the impact on victims of a chance encounter with
an offender or, in cases that attract media interest, hearing about
community leave in this way, will be taken into account. However, not
least as a result of what has happened in this case—and as a
result of the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Witham (Priti
Patel), which has been mentioned—I have considered whether the
current position goes far enough for the benefit of victims. I have
asked my officials to look into making the necessary changes to ensure
that there is a presumption that, unless there are exceptional
circumstances, victims should be told when community leave is planned,
as this is a key development in an offender’s case and
sentence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112191000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/debtext/131121-0004.htm#13112191000286">In
Mr Anabah’s case, the decision to give permission for escorted
leave was taken after very careful consideration of the clinical
evidence provided by the responsible clinician. The decision took into
account any known or possible risks to the public and victims, as well
as the risk of abscond. As the hon. Lady knows, Mr Anabah’s
escorted leave passed off without incident. However, 
<?notus-xml column=1478?>due to the representations made by the Ilumoka family, the responsible

we have discussed in correspondence, there appears to have been
confusion about when the hon. Lady’s constituents opted in to

is, I am afraid, in the nature of a restricted hospital order that I
cannot give any assurances about how long Benjamin Anabah will be
detained in hospital, or how his treatment will progress. I can however
assure the hon. Lady that the concerns expressed by the Ilumoka family
will be taken into account in his future

hon. Lady perfectly fairly raised the immigration aspects of this case,
including foreign nationals who are mentally disordered offenders.
These individuals do not fall to be automatically deported from the UK
under the UK Borders Act 2007. Rather, deportation is considered under
the Immigration Act 1971 and is aligned with the offender’s
discharge date. All such cases are considered carefully in close
liaison with the Ministry of Justice and the hospital authorities. In
this case, that means there should not be a gap or hiatus between Mr
Anabah’s release from hospital and his removal from this
country. I spoke today to those who represent the immigration
authorities and they have assured me that they will be in close contact
with those administering the hospital order to make every effort to
ensure that that is the case.</hs_Para>

constituents, and I am grateful to her for the points she has raised.

John Stanley</B> (Tonbridge and Malling) (Con):</Member> The 2013
report by the Committees on Arms Export Controls is the most extensive
that we have ever produced. The report, plus its evidence, encompasses
nearly 900 pages in three volumes, all of which are available on the
internet, although in the interests of economy, only  the first
volume has been printed. It is entirely for the House and those who are
outside it to decide whether the length of the report has been
accompanied by additional merit.</hs_Para>

report, we have broken new ground in two ways that I highlight at the
outset, the first of which relates to arms control. Sadly,
globalisation extends as much to arms transfers as to pretty much any
other activity in which we engage, and the electronic age is
accelerating that process. As a result, the ability to procure devices
that kill or maim, either individually or on a horrendous scale, has
never been more widespread. The consequence is that effective
international arms control agreements—whether nuclear, chemical,
biological or conventional—have never been more important and
imperative. That is why the Committees have substantially extended
their scrutiny of the Government’s policies over the entire
international arms control agreement
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000010">The
second area in which we have broken new ground is that, for the first
time, we have taken the list of 27 countries highlighted in
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s annual human rights report
and asked the Government what existing arms export licences they have
approved to each of those 27 countries. The Government’s answer
took me and many others greatly by surprise: the total number of extant
arms export licences approved by the Government to the 27 countries of
top human rights concern was just over 3,000. The value of those
licences is equally astonishing, at £12 billion. Even
that figure is an understatement, as the Government, reasonably, can
provide value information only for standard individual licences, not
for open individual licences, where they do not know precisely what
quantities will be exported. The details of those 3,000 licences,
country by country, can be found in volume 2 of our report, annexe 13.
For those who are interested in the subject, it makes concerning
reading.</hs_Para>

out the same exercise in relation to five additional countries not
currently on the Foreign Office’s list, of which four are still
of human rights concern: Bahrain, Egypt, Madagascar and Tunisia. The
additional 
<?notus-xml column=404?>fifth country is Argentina, which is of concern due to its
posture in relation to the Falklands. Again, the
details of extant licences to those five countries are available in our

to make is that the Committees’ report would not have been
possible on the scale on which we have produced the information for the
House without the Government’s co-operation. With one
conspicuous and important exception, to which I will come in a moment,
the Government have broadly co-operated in providing us with the
information that we have sought. As a matter of course, I maintain
contact with parliamentarians in the major arms-exporting countries in
Europe and north America. I am in contact with those who are interested
in the field in the Italian Parliament, the Bundestag, the National

information as we do. That is a considerable credit to the British
Parliament and to successive British Governments. I say
“successive” deliberately because I want to put it on

Robin Cook in being the first Foreign Secretary to publish an annual

difference with the Government over one critical piece of information.
Members from throughout the House were utterly appalled by the sarin
attack that took place in Damascus on 21 August. Sarin is a ghastly
chemical weapon. It is one of the most painful and grim ways in which
anyone can die, and as we know, hundreds of men, women and children
died in that attack. However, the uncomfortable reality that we in this
Parliament must face is that between 2004 and 2012, a total of seven
export licences were approved by the present and previous Governments
for the export to Syria of the dual-use chemicals sodium fluoride and
potassium fluoride, which are precursor chemicals in the manufacture of
sarin. Those seven export licences have been under detailed scrutiny by
the Committees, and that scrutiny commenced well before the sarin
attack to which I have
referred.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000017">The
one crucial piece of information that the Secretary of State for
Business, Innovation and Skills has so far not been willing to provide
to the Committees is the names of the companies to which the Government
provided export licence approval to export the precursor chemicals from
the UK. That is crucial information for the Committees, without which
the Committees are unable to take either oral or written evidence from
the 
<?notus-xml column=405?>companies concerned. In his latest letter to the Committees, dated 25
October, the Business Secretary once again advanced
arguments about why he should not disclose the names of the companies
to the Committees. I shall take the arguments one by one.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112174000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000018">First, the
Business Secretary said that, in deciding not to provide the names of
the companies, he had done so in the framework of the Freedom of
Information Act 2000, to which I reply: that Act does not circumscribe
inquiries carried out by House of Commons Select Committees.</hs_Para>

Business Secretary said that companies deal with his Department on the
basis of confidentiality. However, he has been willing to provide every
other important piece of information that the Committees have sought.
He has provided the Committees with the names of the chemicals
involved; the quantities of chemicals approved; the financial value of
the approved chemicals; the dates of the licence approvals; and, most
significantly, the names of the concerns in Syria to which the
chemicals were to be exported. On that basis, I fail to see how the
names of the companies applying for the licences can be considered
confidential.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000020">Lastly,
the Business Secretary said that he does not want to disclose the names
of the companies because of the reputational risk that the companies
would face. He also advanced the argument that there could be physical
danger—imagined, in my view—to the companies’
employees. To that argument, I say that if Select Committees were to be
debarred from taking evidence from witnesses on the grounds of the risk
of reputational damage, that would effectively destroy most of the
inquiries carried out by Select Committees. That would clearly be
unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000021">In
the Business Secretary’s latest letter to me, he has offered an
alternative proposal. He said that he would be willing to give the
Committees the companies’ names in confidence and on the basis
that they took evidence in a closed session. However, that would defeat
the central purpose of Select Committees, which is to carry out open
and transparent inquiries and to make full reports to the House on the
basis of the evidence received.</hs_Para>

Committees will of course respond to the Business Secretary’s
letter. I hope that he will consider the issue further, achieve the
change of policy that the Committees are seeking and disclose the names
of the companies to the Committees, so that the Committees can take
evidence from them.</hs_Para>

say that, over a substantial area of the Committees’ work, the
Committees are broadly on  the same ground as the Government.
However, I owe it to the House to highlight two important areas where
the Committees differ from the Government’s position. The first
is the key area of UK arms exports and their possible use for internal
repression. There is no difference between the Committees and the
Government on the wording of the policy; the difference comes in its
implementation.</hs_Para>

wording goes back 13 years to a written answer provided by the then
Minister of State at the Foreign Office, the right hon. Member for
Neath (Mr Hain), on 26 October 2000. That wording was fully
reflected in 
<?notus-xml column=406?>the wording provided by the Foreign Secretary to the Committees when
he gave oral evidence in February 2012. The wording
is:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13112174000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000186">“We

“or” is indeed of crucial importance. The House will see
from that statement that there are effectively two tests for the policy
in deciding whether an arms export application should be approved in
circumstances where internal repression could arise.</hs_Para>

test is what I call the “clear risk” test, which is a
relatively loose test. I can hear the arguments going on around
Whitehall regularly, with officials and Ministers saying, “There
is a risk, but it isn’t clear, so we can approve the
export.” The much more stringent test is in the second half of
the sentence—after the “or”—the test of
whether an export might facilitate internal repression. That is why
both halves of the Foreign Secretary’s policy statement are
crucial.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000028">Our
deep concern is that the Government repeatedly only refer to the
relatively loose “clear risk” test, but fail to refer to
the “might facilitate internal repression” test, which is
much more stringent. I will provide the House with just two examples.

still, in that letter, the Business Secretary claimed—without
any foundation—that the Committees were over-interpreting the

Secretary’s mind at rest: the Committees have not made any
interpretation of the Foreign Secretary’s statement. The wording

the simple reason that, once military and dual-use exports have been

13 shows at a glance that the overwhelming majority of exports will not
be visible once they have been exported from this country. Those
exports are made up of components, software, technology, communications
equipment, cryptographic equipment, ammunition, small arms, automatic
weapons and sniper rifles, which will not be identifiable as having
come from the UK once they have left our shores, even
assuming—it is most unlikely—that we have anyone on the
ground to see what those items actually
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:03:45"></hs_TimeCode>. We are

crux of the Government’s policy decision and the
Committees’ scrutiny is the nature of the original decision to
grant the export licence. The Government have a simple choice: do they
follow a relatively risky policy that has been the policy hitherto, or
do they adopt a more cautious policy when approving export licences to
authoritarian regimes? For the Committees, the fact that the present
Government have now had to revoke more than 200 arms export licences to
countries predominantly in the middle east and north Africa is the
clearest possible indication of the extent to which both this
Government and the previous Government misjudged the risks that they
were running in approving those arms exports in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:05:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000051">I
stress very clearly that the Committees do not criticise the Government
for being unable to predict the future. None of us can reliably predict
the future, and it is precisely because neither the Government nor any
of us can do so that we believe that the more cautious policy should be
adopted. That is why, for two years in succession, the report of our
four Committees unanimously urges the Government to adopt a more
cautious policy on arms exports to authoritarian
regimes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:05:50"></hs_TimeCode>,
particularly on those items that may be used for internal
repression.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000052">I

will focus on several issues addressed by the report. First, on a
positive note, our Committees have rightly commended both the current
Government and the previous Government for their work on the arms trade
treaty. The UK Government should be proud of their leading contribution
to achieving the first ever international arms treaty on conventional
weapons, but it is important to ensure that work on adopting and
enforcing the treaty is just as ambitious and

hope that over the coming year, in anticipation of the treaty’s
coming into force by the end of 2014, the UK Government will show their
commitment by making a strong interpretive statement on the
treaty’s text and incorporate the treaty’s principles as
an integral part of our future decisions on arms exports. We should
also be offering practical assistance to other countries, particularly
those that receive UK aid, so that they can sign, ratify and properly
implement the treaty. The UK should also show that in future we expect
that only signatories to the treaty should be provided any access to
arms fairs here in the United Kingdom or be permitted to enter
co-partnership agreements with UK-based defence

Chair spoke about the export of chemicals to Syria. I share and endorse
his concerns about the manner in which the decision was made last year
to grant a licence for the export of chemicals at a time when there
must have been an ongoing debate within the EU on an export ban. In
fact, such an export ban was subsequently announced a couple of months
after the original decision to grant the export
licence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000059">Thankfully,
the Committees have been advised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:09:05"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State for Business, Innovation and Skills that no goods were exported
under the licence, but the manner in which the decision was made, and
the allegations about the nature of the end user’s relationship
with the Assad regime, is a legitimate matter of public concern. Our
Committees have rightly insisted on much more detailed information and
on an opportunity to take evidence in public from those
concerned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000060">Although
there is no evidence to suggest that the applicant companies did not
act in good faith, it cannot be satisfactory, given the nature of the
ongoing Syrian conflict, which commenced before the export licence was
granted, to believe that exports capable of dual use should continue as
normal between the two countries. 
<?notus-xml column=411?>Parliament needs to have the ability properly to scrutinise such
applications, to hold Ministers and officials to account and to put
forward any necessary recommendations on future practice.</hs_Para>

the Minister will assure us that full answers will be provided and open
access to witnesses will be secured. If, as we have been advised, the
chemicals provided were for completely innocent, civilian use, I fail
to see why a company’s reputation would be seriously damaged.
The argument made about the Freedom of Information Act was totally
ridiculous and insulting to the work of the Committees. This is nothing
to do with the Freedom of Information Act; this is about the ability to
scrutinise what the Government, funded by taxpayers, do on our
behalf.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000062">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:10:57"></hs_TimeCode>
report also touches on the decision in May to alter the European Union
embargo on the export of arms to the Syrian opposition. I am not
convinced that, given the fragmented, chaotic and fast-changing
situation in Syria, any arms exports could safely meet the criteria on
end use. There is a real risk of weapons falling into the hands of the
Syrian Government or extremist opposition groups.</hs_Para>

would appear that the Government have, with the exception of a gift of
non-military equipment in July, not granted any export licences. Given
the prospect of talks to address the conflict, it would be helpful if
the Minister indicated the Government’s thinking on that issue.
Will he also confirm whether, to his knowledge, Croatia has carried on
supplying arms to rebel forces, as was widely reported earlier this
year, since their accession into the European Union in July? If so,
what discussions have been held at European Union level about the
consequences of such continued supply in the run up to possible
negotiations to resolve this ghastly
conflict?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000064">There
are continued concerns regarding our policy on arms exports to Egypt.
Our Committees have again sought reassurance that such exports will not
be permitted when there is a clear risk that proposed exports might
provoke or prolong regional or internal conflicts or be used to
facilitate internal repression. We noted the Government’s
response to our report last month, but why was there a gap of over a
month between the initial decision to suspend five licences and the
suspension of a further 47 licences, with the second decision only
being taken after agreement at European Union level? Given the obvious
and ongoing risks of further internal conflict, it is difficult to find
good reason for such a delay. Is it now the Government’s
intention to review the UK’s policy, which currently considers
Egypt to be an appropriate destination for arms exports? Given the
delicate state of affairs in Egypt, it is important that the UK should
have a clear, transparent
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000065"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:13:24"></hs_TimeCode>I

will have read the report in <I>The Guardian </I>on Monday about the
sale of mass-surveillance technologies by private firms, including many

of more than 338 companies, including 77 based in the UK, offering a
total of 97 different technologies, covering 
<?notus-xml column=412?>a vast spectrum. There are disturbing stories about the hacking of
dissidents not only in their own country, but in the UK, where some are
currently taking refuge. Some fairly small, relatively unknown
companies are now involved in the sector, and given that the equipment
is exceptionally portable and that technical specifications can change
rapidly, the detection of illegal exports is bound to be
difficult.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000067">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:14:42"></hs_TimeCode>

Tempora programme run by GCHQ, that has the ability to tap information
from fibre-optic cables carrying internet traffic and to analyse texts,
mobile calls, billing data, e-mails and social networks in real time. I
welcome the announcement this week by the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills to introduce new rules in this area. Will the
Minister provide us with information today on how his Department
intends to tackle the issue and what discussions have been held at
European Union and international level about combating illegal use? It
is unacceptable that this growing market currently lacks either
effective oversight or accountability. I hope, given the serious

me start by saying that the British system of arms control—the

It is absolutely right for the Committees to emphasise that the

accept that the gathering of evidence of illegal activities may be
difficult, but the Government should direct their investigators and
officials to that end. I fully accept, however, that it is extremely
difficult for the Government to supervise subsidiaries of UK-registered
companies that are under the jurisdiction of a foreign country. Such
companies are outside the UK’s legal jurisdiction, so I accept
the Government’s comment that they have no plans to legislate on
the matter. To be honest, I cannot see how they can introduce
meaningful legislation that would be

are still obvious problems in the regulation of arms brokers. It seems
clear that sometimes previously licensed and, shall I say, clean arms

them operationally, but not using them on the battlefield normally
implies that more soldiers are required. For a small
army, anti-personnel mines often make up for lack of personnel, because
they are used to provide intimate protection, perhaps in a defensive
position where the enemy might creep up. Anti-personnel mines could
stop the enemy, or give
warning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:24:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000079">The
lasting problem of anti-personnel mines, however, is that they go on
for a very long time. In 1992 to 1993, I was the British UN commander
in Bosnia. When I was looking for a base for one of my companies, I
went to northern Bosnia and came across a former Yugoslav air base at
Tuzla. It was a huge place, and I decided to position one of my rifle
companies there—lots of space, lots of cover and lots of hard
standing. The whole place, however, was surrounded by anti-personnel
mines—vast numbers of them. There were so many that we made no
attempt to try to clear or neutralise them. Visiting the place 20 years
later, I saw that the mines were still
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:25:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000080">Eighteen
years ago, my wife was a delegate of the International Committee of the
Red Cross in Lebanon, and she actually lost her driver to an
anti-personnel mine. The minefield was old and unmarked, and the man
did not realise that he was walking in a minefield. Just think of
that—if an adult does not realise that a minefield is there,
what chance does a child have? My point is that once anti-personnel
mines are laid, they can be there for years and years. Anything that we
can do as a country to stop their deployment would be a very good
thing. We are doing our
best<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:26:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000081">To

us; I do not include the Opposition Members present in that, but rather
accuse myself. The effort put by our Chairman, or Chair, into the

respects, the response of the Government answers a fair number of the
Committees’ queries, problems, questions and recommendations.
Today, therefore, I will speak about the areas in which I feel that the
Government did not answer the concerns expressed, or did not answer
adequately. That does not detract from the areas in which there has
been a helpful response from the

is extremely worrying that in spite of the good work done to date we
still have a situation in which there are some 3,000 extant licences
and some £12 billion of goods—and that is only
the countables, not the uncountables—going to countries with a
poor track record on human rights. There is a mismatch between the
Foreign Office’s list of such countries and what is happening
with arms exports on the ground. The situation is concerning, so we
should continue to look at the issue and not simply let it die a
death.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000087">I
pay tribute to all those on both sides of the House who have helped to
bring the arms trade treaty into being this year. That was a tremendous
achievement. Although that is extremely good news and the UK can be
extremely proud of its work to date on the treaty, we now need to work
proactively to ensure that it is ratified. It does not come into force
until 90 days after the 50th country has ratified
it, and to date only eight countries have done so. We know that there
are certain issues with regard to the EU that are shortly to be
resolved, which will enable a lot more countries to ratify the treaty,
but I would stress that the UK needs to use every opportunity to push
ratification with other countries. We might also need to offer
financial and legal help to those countries that need that sort of
support to ratify the treaty, so that we can see the treaty fully up
and running in a year’s time. Perhaps the Minister could take
that message back to colleagues in the Foreign
Office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000088">Here
in the UK we need a strong, clear explanation of how the UK intends to
apply the criteria in articles 6 and 7 of the treaty. It is most
important that we state that the UK will deny any export licences where
there is a significant risk that the goods in question will contribute
to breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law. Now we
have the instrument of the arms trade treaty it is important that we
have the strongest possible interpretive statement and description of
what it means to the UK, so that it can be as effective as possible. It
is important not only that we do that but, as it is a treaty, that we
encourage other countries to do likewise, to make the most of the
opportunity the treaty brings.</hs_Para>

the issue of brass-plate companies. The Committees say in their report
that the Government have not taken any action against brass-plate
companies involved in arms exporting and arms brokering. Those
companies have the benefit of UK company registration but export arms
and carry out arms-brokering activities overseas in contravention of UK
Government policies. I feel that the Government’s response is a
little vague and that this area needs significantly more attention. The
Government speak of using existing export control legislation in
certain circumstances and of using other legislation to discontinue the
UK registration of such companies, but stress that they need to have
the necessary evidence. I believe that we need a concerted strategy.
Will the Minister tell us what measures he could take to 
<?notus-xml column=416?>develop a strategy to pursue those companies more rigorously? It is
quite clear that they are used as an avoidance mechanism. Such
companies want the brass plate along with the good name that it brings,
but have ways of avoiding UK legislation.</hs_Para>

Griffith:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman puts the matter very well.
The problem is the devious nature of such arrangements. That is why I
am suggesting that the Minister could look into ways of developing a
strategy, closing loopholes and collecting evidence—possibly in
conjunction with other countries—in order to get the necessary
detail and put the measures that are needed in place to enable us to
discontinue the UK registration of such companies. I am not saying that
the problem is easy to solve, by any manner of means—I accept
the point being made—but it is something that we need to be
looking at, to try to work out how we could bring more pressure to
bear.</hs_Para>

discuss Syria briefly. Many of my constituents contacted me about Syria
over the summer. They had a particular concern: if we were to go into
Syria and support the opposition there, who exactly would we be
supporting? It is worrying that a gate has been opened that basically
allows EU countries to export arms to the opposition in Syria. As my
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow North (Ann McKechin) pointed out,
Croatia has taken advantage of that situation.</hs_Para>

me that people in this country really want the Government to crack down
on that loophole, because they do not want to see arms going to rebel
forces when we do not know who they are or which groups they consist
of. Given that we are very concerned about what both the Government
parties and some of the opposition groups in Syria are doing, the
position seems quite straightforward to me: we should close the
loophole and reinstate the full EU arms embargo on Syria that existed
prior to May 2013. That would not mean that we were turning our backs
on the people there—there is a huge amount to be done for the
refugees and we also need to see a lot of negotiation—but the
embargo needs to be reinstated as soon as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000094">I
turn now to Egypt, which of course has had a tumultuous time over the
past couple of years, swinging one way and then the other. Many of us
have been contacted by Christians in Egypt, who also fear for their
safety. The situation, again, is that we need to re-examine exactly
which arms are being transferred to Egypt, who the end users are, to
what use those arms are being put and what licences there are for
Egypt. I ask the Minister to re-examine those matters, and to look
again at trying to set out a clear strategy to ensure that those items
are not misused or diverted. We want to know exactly what the UK policy
is for arms exports to Egypt, because the situation there is extremely
volatile.</hs_Para>

briefly mention the situation in Colombia. There are still £20
million of extant UK licences there. Members will be aware of
well-documented violations of the human rights of trade union activists
in Colombia. 
<?notus-xml column=417?>There are worrying reports—I have heard accounts of this myself
from Colombian lawyers—about the army’s track record
towards indigenous peoples. There are serious
concerns not only about how the Colombian Government treat activists
who speak up for indigenous peoples but about the behaviour of the
armed forces, particularly in areas where indigenous people are being
moved off the land, often to enable mining activities. Moreover,
concerning evidence is now emerging that multinational companies are
contributing to the funding of those armed forces. Once more, I would
ask the Government to look again at what we are doing about arms
exports to Colombia.</hs_Para>

conclusion, I wish simply to say that this issue will not go away. I
ask the Committees to continue their excellent work and continue to be
vigilant. The issue is one that every single one of us needs to know

Governments, whatever their colour, have had in place a robust system
of export controls that has led the world. It dates back to the first
arms export controls in 1939 and was consolidated at the start of the
century with the Export Control Act 2002. Since 2004, we have had
quarterly reporting to provide greater scrutiny. The success of the
system is highlighted by the way in which it operates and the fact that
the Committees can look at an issue in great detail. We do not want
export licences to be revoked, but the fact that they are shows that
the system is robust. It is not perfect and unimprovable, but it is

dry, but that does not mean that the job is done. In fact, it has just

shall make only one slightly partisan point, because there is generally
cross-party consensus. Concern was raised by the Committees’
Chair about how some of the good work may be undermined by the
Government’s role and how it operates in other countries. We
have seen that in Sri Lanka, and the right hon. Gentleman mentioned
Libya and other parts of north Africa. It is all about perception. When
the Prime Minister takes trade missions to areas that have just had the
significant upheaval of regime change and so on, the perception may be
that arms sales are at the top of the agenda. I am not sure that the
Government should operate in that way. It may be only perception, but
the Government should work hard to ensure that that perception is not
carried through in practice. The Sri Lankans called the Prime Minister
“God”, and that should probably debar any
exports.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000106">There

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:46:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Glasgow North was right to highlight the fact that the
goods were never delivered, but two licences were granted to a regime

highlights something that I

profile for some of these regimes, perhaps the granting of those two
licences would have been justified. In the black and white of the
legislation—the black and white of the process, as the Secretary

probably, on balance, the right decision, but a question remains about

share the Committees’ disappointment at the Government’s
response to dual uses. There must be greater transparency. Just calling
something “dual use” is not enough, and that goes back to
perception. We should be completely transparent about what an export

licence may be granted in good faith for chemicals to be transferred to
a regime under the export licensing criteria, but they could fall into
the wrong hands, and that feeds right back to the risk profile and how
we deal with dual use. I would like further clarity from the Minister
on the Government’s thoughts about dual use. The Joint
Intelligence Committee concluded in a letter that the Syrians had used
chemical weapons and that it was clear that the Assad Government had
used them. There are still issues about whether those export licences
should have been granted and whether an error might have been
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112174000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000110">There

context works well, this is about brass plating across international
communities, where companies that have brass plating in this country
operate against the rules that would apply here when operating
overseas. That must be looked at clearly, but it again highlights the
globalisation of the issue. International co-operation is required to
deal with some of the bigger issues on brass plating, and the Chair of
the Committees is absolutely right to highlight that issues relating to
the globalisation of the agenda are greater than ever.</hs_Para>

briefly turn to the points made on systems for spying and other such
technology. I say flippantly that I notice that we have not sold
anything to the Americans—they seem to be able to do quite well
themselves—but a significant problem would not have passed the
Committees by. In particular, there was £8 billion of such
spending under export licences to Israel and £600 million to
China; I think that was the figure given by the Chair of the
Committees. We have to deal with that kind of issue and see whether the
export goods are being used for the purpose that they should be used
for. I would like  the Minister to dig down further into that

Export licensing to Egypt seems to be a bit of a hokey-cokey, and that
highlights the problem of not knowing what is happening in the future
and with the risk profile. Licences are granted, then have to be
revoked, then some are re-granted and others revoked. There seems to be
a problem about whether we should be licensing any exports to Egypt
while it is experiencing its current operational and regime
difficulties. At the risk of repeating myself, it looks as though,
again, that all feeds back into risk, and that was rightly highlighted
by the Committees as being part of the problem.</hs_Para>

issues that I have raised, I shall finish by asking the Minister two
specific questions, the first of which is on paragraph 46, which has
been referred to a lot, and the Chair of the Committees highlighted the
ambiguity in relation to that paragraph. The Foreign Secretary was
pretty categorical in what he said to the Committees. However, it seems
that the common position that is referred to can be used by omitting
certain phrases from terminology. Many countries are highlighted by the
report, including Iran, Argentina, China and various others, but if we
refer back to paragraph 46, that is where the ambiguity lies. We need
clarity on that issue. I realise that the Government’s action on
the consolidated criteria in paragraph 46 was to wait until the
European common position had been developed in 2012 and until the arms
trade treaty had come into force and been implemented. However, it
would be useful to get some time scales from the Minister on whether
that position will be resolved.</hs_Para>

The Government should be commended on the way in which they have
responded to the report, the clear direction that they have given on
many aspects of it and on the support that they have given to the
Committees over many years. However, on this issue, significant clarity
is needed on what is meant by “clear risks” and
“internal repression”, particularly in the current
climate. If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:53:25"></hs_TimeCode> we
look at that climate in north Africa and some other countries, there is
clear risk of internal repression in any of the countries listed in the
report—32 in all. Until there is a categorical clarification of
exactly what is meant by the issues raised by the Chair of the
Committees, there will be some confusion over whether the licences
apply and which countries we should be concerned about. A clear policy

first reassure the Chamber that the Government are committed to
managing all transfers of strategic goods responsibly. That involves,
as the Committees recognised, a delicate and continual balancing act.
On the one hand, there are valid concerns, articulated on many
occasions by right hon. and hon. Members, that strategic goods should
not fall into the wrong hands. That is why all export licence
applications are carefully assessed, case by case, against the
consolidated European Union and national arms export licensing
criteria, taking into account all relevant factors—including the
prevailing circumstances in the recipient country, the nature of the
goods, the identity of the end user and the stated end use.</hs_Para>

the other hand, the Government support responsible defence exports and
we remain committed to a strong defence industry. Our defence exports
rose by 62% in 2012, and totalled £8.8 billion in
that year. Defence exports are only a proportion of what we license;
defence and security 
<?notus-xml column=422?>exports, taken together, rose to £11.5 billion in 2012. The
importance of those exports to our economy is
self-evident from those figures, so we need to operate a fast and

while imposing the minimum regulatory burden on legitimate
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:00:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_76fChair UID="13112174000005" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/halltext/131121h0001.htm#13112174000005">[<SmallCaps>Philip

approach of case-by-case assessment that I have set out remains, I

efficient and transparent system that produces rational decisions, but

of the more specific cross-country issues. May I begin with Egypt?
Egypt provides an example of our responsiveness and our determination
to ensure that our exports do not contribute to internal repression or
human rights violations. Following the worsening events in Egypt this
year, we conducted a review of extant export licences. As a result, on
19 July, five licences were revoked, as they were assessed to be no

increasing levels of violence in Egypt, the Foreign Affairs Council of
the European Union agreed to suspend all export licensing to Egypt for
equipment that might be used for internal repression. That is a lower
threshold than the consolidated criteria that we applied, whereby the
test is whether there is a clear risk that goods might be used for
internal repression. The UK fully supported the Foreign Affairs Council
decision and, as a precautionary measure, we applied that suspension to
all licences to the Egyptian army, air force and internal security
forces. That resulted in 47 extant licences being suspended and a hold

goods might be used for internal repression. A further 24 licences were
removed from suspension, because we no longer judged that the goods

took those decisions. What I can say is that the exporters concerned
behaved responsibly by applying for the licences. All the licences were
rigorously assessed against the criteria to determine that the end

existing legislation would, in certain circumstances, allow enforcement

with other relevant agencies the possibility of using other legislation
to discontinue the UK registration of such companies on public interest

about brass-plate companies, and we will follow up what the Minister
has said in reply. She made an important point about whether the EU
arms embargo towards Syria should be resumed. It has always been
somewhat mystifying to me that the British Government took steps to end
the EU arms embargo on Syria, but they have yet to come up with any
suggestion about how Britain would renew arms exports to Syria and
ensure that the arms got into the right hands.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:32:09"></hs_TimeCode> is a lot
of force in what the hon. Lady has said, and we need a similar
clarification on policy towards Egypt. I am glad that she raised
Colombia, which is an important issue given the human rights situation

that we have a total of 53 extant licences to Colombia, which are
valued at £20 million.</hs_Para>

Security scanners are currently in operation at 10 of the UK’s
largest airports. They were deployed in response to the threat to
aviation posed by non-metallic improvised explosive devices, such as
the device used in the attack on Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam
Schiphol to Detroit on Christmas day 2009, and the device recovered in
Yemen in spring 2012. These devices were designed to make detection by
existing screening

at substantial: an attack is a strong
possibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13112169000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/wmstext/131121m0001.htm#13112169000067">It

the past, passengers who refused to be scanned by a security scanner
were not offered an alternative, and were not allowed to fly on that

search (a thorough hand search in which the passenger may be asked to
loosen or remove clothing) would offer a broadly similar security
assurance to a scan, and it was considered that offering this as an
alternative would be too operationally disruptive to the airport and to
other
passengers.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13112169000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/wmstext/131121m0001.htm#13112169000083">However,
experience of operating security scanners for several years has shown

refusing to be scanned is very low. As a result, and having reviewed
the current position, I have concluded that from tomorrow, Friday 22
November, passengers who opt out of being screened by a security
scanner will be allowed a private search alternative. This is a method
of screening which we consider is of an equivalent security value to a

employability and look for work is discussed and agreed with their
adviser and then set out within their Jobseeker’s Agreement
(JSAg) or Claimant Commitment (CC). We work to ensure that all such

all evidence is considered by a trained decision maker. Where the
claimant had “good reason” no sanction will be applied
and their benefit will not be stopped. Even where a sanction is applied
claimants can ask for the decision to be reconsidered, and can appeal
to an independent tribunal. Hardship payments are also available to
guard against destitution and sanctioned claimants can apply for such

improve claimant comfort and service. Claimant seating provided in all
Jobcentres in Manchester is the same as that provided within Jobcentre
Plus as a whole, but will vary in terms of layout and proximity to
advisers. We endeavour to make the best use of the available space but
appreciate that sometimes people will inevitably need more privacy,
particularly if discussing things of a personal or sensitive nature.

request.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13112190000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/petntext/131121p0001.htm#13112190000047">As
Jobcentres develop and we introduce more technology, claimant safety,
privacy and comfort are all factors we take into consideration. This is
evident in Rusholme which has recently been transformed into a Digital

health surcharge will ensure that temporary migrants make a fair
contribution to the cost of health services in the UK commensurate with
their more limited immigration status. The surcharge will be set at a
competitive rate and will be at a substantially lower cost than private
medical insurance, which is a common requirement in many of our
competitor nations. We remain committed to ensuring that the UK remains
competitive as a destination for the brightest and the best and nothing
in these proposals will prevent us from achieving that goal.</hs_Para>

proposals will introduce simple and straightforward checks that
landlords should undertake when letting private rented accommodation to
tenants. These will be very similar to the checks that have been
required of employers for many years and which most employers are able
to conduct within a matter of minutes. Our engagement with landlords
and letting agents shows 
<?notus-xml column=951?>that many landlords already ask tenants to provide evidence about the
identity of the individual. Student halls of residence will be exempt
from the checking requirement, as educational institutions are already
under a requirement to check the status of overseas students under the

recommendations to improve the functioning of the border, and we fully
expect Spain to act on these

its consultation with user groups and the rail industry on its Draft
Determination, the ORR concluded that it should both lower the Public
Performance Measure (PPM) targets it had initially proposed for
punctuality for long distance services and toughen the corresponding
targets for cancellations and significant lateness (CaSL). This
reflected customers' and operators' views that long-distance rail users
are particularly disadvantaged by serious lateness and cancellations.
In ORR's view, it was sensible to rebalance targets to focus on these
areas of particular concern. The revised targets are at least as
challenging for Network Rail to deliver as the original PPM
targets.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="131121110000028" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/text/131121w0001.htm#131121110000028">Secondment</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="131121110000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/text/131121w0001.htm#131121110000189"><B><Member PimsId="488" UID="131121110001116" xid="515" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/text/131121w0001.htm#131121110001116">Chris

Eustice:</Member></B> There is a range of existing legislation that can
be used to deal with fly grazing, including the Animals Act 1971 and
the Animal Welfare Act 2006. In addition, because fly grazing is a form
of antisocial behaviour, existing antisocial behaviour legislation and
forthcoming measures in the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime &amp; Policing
Bill may be used to tackle it. The Government considers that a
joined-up approach by enforcers and interested parties at a local level
can be helpful in tackling the problem. There are continuing
discussions at official level on tackling practical problems associated
with fly grazing, including any that might arise from any new
legislative measures in

Eustice:</Member></B> DEFRA is aware of, and has considered, the issues
relating to the problems of illegally-tethered ponies, abandoned ponies
and fly grazing. There is no formal Government guidance. However, there
is a range of existing legislation that can be used to deal with these
issues, including the Animals Act 1971 and the Animal Welfare Act 2006.
The abandonment of ponies which causes unnecessary suffering is a
potential offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. In addition,
because fly grazing is a form of antisocial behaviour, existing
antisocial behaviour legislation and forthcoming measures in the
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime &amp; Policing Bill may be used to tackle
it.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="131121110000505" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/text/131121w0002.htm#131121110000505"><B><Member PimsId="5583" UID="131121110001206" xid="1059" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/text/131121w0002.htm#131121110001206">Damian

Expenditure data are calculated from PCT programme budgeting returns to
the Department of Health for 2003-04 to 2011-12. Programme budgeting
returns are based on a subset of PCT accounts data and represent a
subset of overall NHS expenditure
data.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>2. Calculating programme
budgeting data is complex and not all health care activity or services
can be classified directly to a programme budgeting category or care
setting. When it is not possible to reasonably estimate a programme
budgeting category, expenditure is classified as “Other”.
Expenditure on General Medical Services and Personal Medical Services
cannot be reasonably estimated at disease specific level, and is
separately identified as a subcategory of “Other”
expenditure.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. The allocation of
expenditure to programme budgeting sub-categories is not always
straightforward, and sub-category level data should therefore be used
with caution.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>4. In order to improve
data quality, continual refinements have been made to the programme
budgeting data calculation methodology since the first collection in
2003-04. The underlying data which support programme budgeting data are
also subject to yearly changes. Programme budgeting data can not be
used to analyse changes in investment in specific service areas between
years. Users of the data should note that significant changes to the
data calculation methodology were introduced in
2010-11.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>5. Figures for years 2003-04
to 2009-10 are calculated using provider costs as a basis. Figures for
2010-11 and 2011-12 are calculated using price paid for specific
activities and services purchased from health care providers. PCTs
follow standard guidance, procedures and mappings when calculating
programme budgeting data.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>6. PCT
figures used to calculate 2010-11 data differ from those previously
published in the 2010-11 programme budgeting benchmarking spreadsheet.
This is due to the correction of errors identified for five PCTs for
this year.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>7. Aggregate PCT data
supersede previously published England level programme budgeting data.
England level data incorporated estimates of expenditure on health care
conditions for the Department, strategic health authorities and special
health authorities. The Department of Health no longer publishes this
data as aggregate PCT figures provide a more accurate and meaningful
representation of the breakdown of NHS expenditure by health care
condition.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>8. For 2003-04, figures are
based on PCT net expenditure. For 2004-05 onwards, figures are based on
PCT spend on own population. This is calculated by adjusting net
expenditure to add back expenditure funded from sources outside the NHS
and to deduct expenditure on other PCT populations incurred through
lead commissioning
arrangements.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table></TableWrapper><hs_Para UID="131121110000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131121/text/131121w0002.htm#131121110000594">Due

Until December 2012, health visitor workforce data was published by the
Health and Social Care Information Centre as part of the Hospital and
Community Health Services workforce publication. It was based on use of
the electronic staff record (ESR) and thus did not include health
visitors employed in organisations such as local authorities and social
enterprises that do not usually use the ESR, A new health visitor
minimum data set was published from December 2012 which includes health
visitors employed by organisations not using the ESR. This supports the
Government's commitment to recruit 4,200 more health visitors by April
2015 and better reflects the true health visiting
