Plymouth’s growing marine sector, to deliver tailored business

Friend is absolutely right. Part of the transition is to ensure the

registration officers target the accuracy, as well as the completeness,
of the register. I was struck by some figures from the Metropolitan

the then Government voted against and the then official Opposition and
the Lib Dems would not support, although 
<?notus-xml column=1088?>48 Conservative colleagues did vote for them, would have put
our exclusion from the charter beyond any doubt? Will he therefore

the complexities and challenges of EU law? He is a valuable contributor
to these debates and we listen to him carefully. I have both listened
to what he has said and I have taken extensive legal advice about the

of the charter in the United Kingdom is limited. We were made various
promises about even that degree of involvement over the years, but we
were not in power at that time. It is absolutely essential that it is
limited in scope in the UK. I would treat it as a matter of the utmost

will consult on whether hospitals that are found not to have been open
and transparent with patients or families at the earliest reasonable
opportunity should risk having their indemnity from litigation awards

out loud and clear from hospital boards and chief executives to all
clinicians: if in doubt, report an incident and tell the patient. The
professional regulators have agreed to place a new, strengthened
professional duty of candour on all doctors and nurses. Failing to
inform a patient, not reporting avoidable harm or obstructing someone
else seeking to do so will be subject to sanctions, including being
struck off.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd), Professor Tricia Hart,
Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, Camilla Cavendish, Professor Don Berwick

Francis reports found three primary and fundamental causes of what went
wrong: a failure to listen to patients; a lack of properly trained
staff; and a dysfunctional culture. I shall take each of those issues
in
turn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T13:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111944000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0001.htm#13111944000024">First,
I am sure the Secretary of State agrees with me that patients and their
families must always, as Francis recommends, be the first priority for
the NHS. That principle unites this House and it must also unite the
NHS. Is not Robert Francis right to recommend that the NHS
constitution, and the ethos it sets out, should be required reading for
all NHS staff? I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on agreeing to
implement the Clywd review in full and change the way the NHS handles
complaints<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T13:09:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111944000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0001.htm#13111944000025">Secondly,
on the issue of staffing numbers and training, the first Francis report
found that Mid Staffs made dangerous cuts to front-line staffing over a
short period. I welcome the Government’s new focus on this
issue, but is it not the case that nurse-patient ratios across the NHS
have got significantly worse in the past three years, with 5,890 fewer
nurses, more older patients in hospital and bed occupancy running at
record levels? It is encouraging that the NHS has plans to recruit more
nurses this year, and is introducing more monitoring. The Secretary of
State says “things are already changing for the better”,
but is he aware that Monitor has warned that trusts are planning major
nurse redundancies in the 2014-16 period, far outweighing any increases
this year? Will he intervene now to stop
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T13:11:10"></hs_TimeCode>? Further,
can he explain why he stopped short of requiring safe staffing levels?
Is he further aware that nurse training places have been severely cut
in recent years and trusts are being forced to recruit
overseas?</hs_Para>

nursing, more action is needed to raise standards across the caring
work force. As Robert Francis has said, it is unacceptable that the
security guard at the door of the hospital is more regulated, and
subject to professional sanctions, than the health care assistant
attending to an elderly patient. The development of the care
certificate as proposed by Camilla Cavendish is a step forward, but
will it not work only alongside a register of those who hold it and an
ability to remove  it if they fall short? Was not Robert
Francis right to recommend a system of regulation for health care
assistants and, going forward, will the Government reconsider their
decision to rule this out? Overall, although there is progress on
staffing today, it does not go far enough and we will continue to
challenge the Government on
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T13:12:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111944000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0001.htm#13111944000027">Thirdly,
on culture change, Francis’s central proposal is a new duty of
candour on organisations and individuals. Extending the duty to
organisations is a step forward,  
<?notus-xml column=1099?>but patient groups are disappointed today that it will cover only the
most serious incidents. Can the right hon. Gentleman say why it has not
been extended to  all incidents of harm? Further, it is not
clear how an organisational duty alone will help individuals challenge
an organisation where there is a dysfunctional culture. Is it not the
case that an individual duty as proposed by Francis is essential? This
point comes over clearly from the evidence given to Francis from a
senior, soon to be retired consultant. He

duty of openness and transparency should apply equally to all
organisations providing NHS services including, as Francis rightly
recommends, contractors providing outsourced services. Given that this
Government are bringing into the NHS more outside providers, patients
will need reassurance that we do not have an uneven playing field where
private providers face less scrutiny. So will the Secretary of State
extend the duty of candour to all health care organisations, as Francis
proposed? His amendments to the Care Bill do not make that clear. And
should not he now commit to extending freedom of information law to any
provider of NHS

on openness, the NHS would be more accountable to families with a
proper system of death certification. The House will remember that this
was a recommendation of the Dame Janet Smith inquiry into the Shipman
murders. The report today says that the Francis recommendations on this
are not accepted in full. If we fail to act now, might people be
justified in thinking that this House has not learned the lessons of
tragedies that have gone before? If the Secretary of State brings

in turn. First, he will know, because this is what happened after the
Bristol inquiry and the Shipman 
<?notus-xml column=1100?>inquiry under the previous Government, that Governments do not always
accept every single recommendation. What I have said today is that we
accept all the  principles behind every single one of Robert
Francis’s recommendations. We are implementing 204 in full, and
in respect of the 86 that we are not implementing exactly as he said,
we are doing everything we can to make sure that we implement the
spirit behind them, but we need to make sure that everything we do is
workable in practice. Francis himself has said that it is a
“carefully considered” response that is a
“comprehensive collection of
measures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T13:16:16"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111944000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0001.htm#13111944000035">On
staffing numbers, which is an essential part of what we have to
consider, if the right hon. Gentleman looks at the nursing hours per
bed, he will find that they have gone up since 2010, not down. We
recognise the crucial importance of front-line staff, which is why I
gently say to him that we made some reforms to the NHS that meant that
there are 5,500 more doctors on the front line and 8,000 fewer
managers. What we also need is more nurses. That is why it is so
encouraging that in response to what Robert Francis has said and the
recognition throughout the NHS of the importance of compassionate care,
we are getting a reaction from NHS trusts—not as a result of a
direct ministerial decision, but because trusts themselves are
recognising the importance of compassionate care. We think that is a
very encouraging
sign<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T13:17:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111944000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0001.htm#13111944000036">With
respect to whether staffing levels should be mandatory, we agree that
there are minimum recommended staffing levels, but they are not the
same for every ward in every hospital. The minimum level might be one
in six for an acute medical unit, one in four for a general medical
unit, and one on one for intensive care. We took extensive advice on
whether it would be appropriate to set a national minimum mandatory
number. Not only is the chief nurse and leading nurses from across the
country against this; the King’s Fund and the British Medical
Association are against it. The BMA said something today in a statement

the individual duty of candour, let us be clear: we want total candour
about all avoidable harm, at every stage that it happens, anywhere in
the NHS. We decided after much discussion that extending the statutory
duty of candour to individual front-line clinicians would be likely to
create a huge amount of bureaucracy and damage the culture of openness
that we are trying to 
<?notus-xml column=1101?>create, because everyone would constantly be worried
about whether or not they were breaking the law. We
decided that the right way to achieve the objective is through a
professional duty of candour, which is much stronger than the current
professional duty states. Critically—this is a key
change—we decided to make sure that, just as airline pilots have
protection if they speak out, if front-line NHS employees speak out,
they too will get protection if there is a professional conduct case,
and that openness at an early stage will be treated as a mitigating
factor. That is really important in terms of changing the

extremely seriously. She knows that I basically accept everything she
said in it, although we will have to work carefully on the
implementation of some things to make sure we get them right. She
highlights one of the most fundamental problems. Probably the biggest
problem is that some hospitals treat their complaints procedure as a
process rather than something that they can learn from. Every NHS
patient whom I have met who has had problems only ever says the same
thing. They just want to know that the NHS will learn from what has
gone wrong. That is all that they are interested in.</hs_Para>

establishment that might be well funded and is not really interested in
hearing what they have to say is a very lonely process. It is vital
that everyone who wants it can get independent support. One thing that
we will be requiring is a sign, prominently displayed in every ward of
every hospital, telling people, first, how they can make a complaint,
and secondly, how if they want it they can get independent help and
support. That could be a very good role for the new healthwatch
organisations, but it may not be them in all cases, so most
importantly, we will insist that people everywhere can access that

radical, tough new Ofsted-style inspection regime. The point of that
regime is not just to identify hospitals where care is unsafe, but also
to identify outstanding hospitals, so that hospitals in difficulty have
hospitals from which they can learn, and we create a culture, just as
we have in schools, where failing schools learn from outstanding
schools and have a pathway to improvement. That will make a big
difference. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, we now have 13 hospitals
in special measures, and I am sure there will be more as the inspection
process gets under way. But we will also have the great hospitals that

right hon. Lady has campaigned a great deal on the needs of people with
dementia, and I share her desire to do much better for them. Salford
Royal is one of the best hospitals in the country and we should always
learn from what it does, but 25% of people in hospitals now have
dementia. The tragedy of what happened at Mid Staffs and of many of the
stories of poor care in other hospitals that we read about is that very
often they involve people with dementia, because they are the kinds of
people who have been deprioritised when hospital managements have
decided, for example, 
<?notus-xml column=1107?>that they want to cut nursing inappropriately. We absolutely have to
change that culture. There is now a very good system at several
hospitals. People with dementia, in particular, must be helped to eat
and drink at meal times. Many of us have been shocked by the stories of
full trays of food being taken away because someone is unable to eat
unaided. That, in particular, we need to stamp right

that the definition of success as regards how the system views a
hospital will be the same as patients’ definition of success.
They want to go somewhere that treats them promptly and safely and with
decent, compassionate care. That has not been how the system has judged
the success of a hospital or its chief executive or board. That is why
it is such a profound change to have a new chief inspector and
Ofsted-style ratings. I think this will make a big difference, but I do

The Secretary of State will be aware of people’s disappointment
that there is still no proper system of regulation for health care
assistants. Does he understand that many members of the public feel
that one of the problems with general standards of care in the health
service may have been the push—under a Labour Government
—for an all-graduate nursing profession? There is a strongly
held view among members of the public that that has led to elevating
taking exams and inputting data on a computer over providing basic
levels of care, which is what they really value in a nurse.</hs_Para>

from this side of the House—I do not wish to destroy her
credibility with her own party! She points to something that the public
feel very strongly about and that is an issue in some parts of the
nursing profession. We looked carefully at whether we should remove the
requirement for graduate qualifications and decided that nurses are now
asked to do a great deal more than they were 20, 30 or 40 years ago in,
for example, giving people medication and the clinical procedures they
are asked to be involved in. We need to make sure that there is the
right culture in nursing. That is why I proposed—it was very
controversial at the time, although I think it has been quite broadly
accepted now—that before becoming a nurse people should spend
some time, potentially up to a year, on the front line as a health care
assistant to make sure that those going into nursing had the right
values and recognised that giving this personal care is a fundamental

the possibility of it being put into administration. The reason for

standards and poor care persist over a long period. I am pleased about
the progress made at Medway Maritime in recent months; Frimley Park,

Hunt:</Member></B> I totally agree with my hon. Friend. That is why I
hope that what we have announced today will bring about a
transformation in the way in which hospitals manage complaints. Some
excellent work has been done to help us do that. The heart of the
matter is that hospitals should be really interested in the complaints
that they receive, because that will enable them to understand where
they are not delivering good care and what they can do to put it right.
That does not happen everywhere. Too often, the complaints system is
treated as a process, in effect, to fob people off, rather than to get
to the heart of what people are talking about. We absolutely need to
change that.</hs_Para>

the 15 years since the Act was passed, British society has benefited
hugely from the bravery of whistleblowers. Those public-spirited men
and women have shamed corrupt officials, identified heartless and
hopeless hospitals, and exposed the deliberate or reckless misuse of
public money. In the past five years alone, whistleblowers have exposed
pharmaceutical companies that have overcharged the NHS for drugs;
alerted the National Audit Office to the tax authorities agreeing
sweetheart deals, which let multinational companies reduce their tax
bills by billions; filmed the abuse and neglect of elderly people in
care homes; and exposed a litany of failings in our health
service—some of which we have just heard about—such as
the appalling standards of care at Mid Staffordshire, the failing
maternity unit at Morecambe Bay and fiddled waiting time figures at
Colchester.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111955000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0002.htm#13111955000103">Thanks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T14:14:43"></hs_TimeCode>
to the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, whistleblowers have some
protection. Employment tribunals have made 3,000 judgments in cases
brought under that legislation. However, those cases are just the tip
of the iceberg. For every whistleblower who goes public with their
concerns, many more never come to light. The decision to expose
wrongdoing is a life-changing choice. Whistleblowers find themselves
shunned by colleagues, bullied by bosses and hauled before tribunals on
trumped-up charges. Ugly rumours are started and careers finished.
Whistleblowers’ health, wealth, friendships and marriages are
tested to destruction—all casualties of their acting in the
public
interest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111955000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0002.htm#13111955000104">Let
me take one example to illustrate the point. The story of Edwin
Jesudason is typical. As a paediatric surgeon with more than 20
years’ experience, he raised concerns that children had died
unnecessarily at Alder Hey children’s hospital. As a result,
colleagues refused to work with him. Trust bosses tried to force him
out. When that failed, they tried to gag him by offering him a
six-figure sum if he left his job, kept his mouth shut and destroyed
incriminating documents. He refused to take the money. Last year, he
sought an injunction to stop trust bosses sacking him. Halfway through
the hearing, the British Medical Association suddenly withdrew its
support. Near bankrupt, he had to drop the case.</hs_Para>

shocking, but it is not remotely unique. In April, a poll showed that,
of more than 5,000 nurses who had reported substandard care, a quarter
were warned against taking the matter further. Half of all
whistleblowers face negative treatment of that sort, with a third
of those being sacked. Faced with such treatment or the
threat of it, many whistleblowers admit defeat. Hundreds have been
pressured into signing compromise agreements, complete with gagging
clauses that buy their silence. In the last four years, 77 NHS trusts
have used gagging orders to silence 133 staff at a cost of almost
£4
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111955000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0002.htm#13111955000106">The
culture of secrecy clearly comes at a financial cost, but more
objectionable is the unquantifiable impact on our society and public
services. The lives needlessly lost or irreversibly damaged; the
unsuitable managers and staff allowed to continue in their posts; the
missed opportunities to learn from mistakes—that is the real
cost of using public money against the public interest. Every time a
whistleblower is dismissed, ignored or bullied into submission, a
cover-up is allowed to
continue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111955000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0002.htm#13111955000107">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T14:18:18"></hs_TimeCode>
is why I welcome the Government’s decision to use the Enterprise
and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 to strengthen the legal protection for
whistleblowers. However, I believe that we should go even further. In
February, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills published
a 22-page document called “Blowing the whistle to a prescribed
person—List of prescribed people and bodies”, which lists
the bodies that a whistleblower can contact if they do not feel that
they can go to their employer. The list includes Revenue and Customs,
the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Care Quality
Commission, but not the whistleblower’s Member of
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111955000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0002.htm#13111955000108">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T14:18:35"></hs_TimeCode>
means that whistleblowers who report wrongdoing to their MP will not
automatically be protected by law. Those conversations will be
protected only if the whistleblower meets a series of conditions set
out in section 43G of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which includes
notifying a potentially hostile employer, showing that the wrongdoing
is exceptionally serious and demonstrating a reasonable belief that
their employer will destroy vital evidence. If they cannot meet those
conditions, whistleblowers who contact their MP place themselves at the
mercy of employers who may want them to be victimised, sidelined or
even sacked. I believe that that is wrong. Whistleblowers should not
have to consult a solicitor in order to talk freely to their Member of
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111955000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0002.htm#13111955000109">The
Bill therefore seeks to do three things. First, it will ensure that a
whistleblower’s disclosures to their Member of Parliament will
be unconditionally protected for the purposes of the Public Interest
Disclosure Act 1998. Secondly, it would make it a criminal
offence for an employer to try and prevent a worker from blowing the
whistle to their MP. There will be some narrowly defined exceptions,
particularly over the Official Secrets Act, but even those could be
overridden if the disclosure was clearly in the public interest. Third,
it would empower Members of Parliament to refer allegations made by a
whistleblowing constituent to a prescribed body, and it would enable
that Member of Parliament to require from any one of those prescribed
bodies a confidential response. In that way, the Bill would extend
legal protection to whistleblowers’ disclosures to their MP, but
also ensure that any allegations are investigated by a body with
relevant knowledge and experience.</hs_Para>

often demonstrate great courage, but they should not have to be heroes.
Acting in the public interest should not require such huge personal
sacrifice, and employers who jeopardise public safety simply to save
their reputations should have to explain that choice in court. By
shielding these courageous men and women from legal hurdles and
vindictive bosses, this proposal would allow Members of this House to
protect everyone from waste, corruption and incompetence in business,
health care, and more generally in public
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111955000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0002.htm#13111955000111"><I>Question

was the main factor in choosing child care. As the chair of Ofsted,
Baroness Morgan, recently pointed out, getting children school ready by

In government, we will deal with the child care crunch by expanding
free child care for three-year-olds and four-year-olds from 15 hours to

<?notus-xml column=1125?>25 hours per week for working parents. The value of that
child care is worth £1,500 per child per year. It would be paid
for by increasing the bank levy, charged as a proportion of their
liabilities, to raise an extra £800 million. In the
past financial year, the banks paid a staggering £2.7 billion
less in tax overall than they did in 2010. The Government have given
the banks an extraordinary tax break and we would reintroduce some
fairness into the system to support our child care plans.

me now turn to some of the spurious claims made by the hon. Member for
Stoke-on-Trent Central. Labour claims that more than 500
children’s centres have closed. That is simply not true. Forty
five centres have closed since 2010—just 1% of the
total—and some new centres have opened, including one in
Ipswich. Centres are joining networks so that they can be run more
efficiently, but the same buildings are open to the same parents to use
services. We are seeing a record number of parents and children using
children’s centres—more than 1 million. I do not
understand why the hon. Gentleman does not want to celebrate the
success of children’s centres, rather than constantly talking
them down week after week. Children’s centres are doing a better
job than ever under this Government. Let us not confuse
children’s centres and child care providers. Children’s
centres provide less than 1% of child care places.</hs_Para>

claims that costs have risen by 30%. That is based on figures from the
Family and Childcare Trust. Despite the impression given by the
Opposition, those figures were published before 2010. If the Opposition
used the pre-2010 data, they would have found that the previous Labour
Government were a catastrophe. Between 2002 and 2010, the cost of a
nursery place rose by 46%. That is £1,200 a year more for a
part-time nursery place for a child over the age of two, but we did not
see the hon. Gentleman jumping around then, did we? Labour has, not for
the first time, been cherry-picking statistics and ignoring the
research. On 30 September 2013, Laing and Buisson published an in-depth
report on the child care nurseries market in the UK. The report said
that 2012-13 was the second successive year in which the price of
full-day care in nurseries had been flat in real terms. In 2012-13,
average nursery fees rose by 2.6%, which was the same as inflation. In
2011-12, average fees rose by 2.7%, compared to 3% inflation. In June
2013, the National Day Nurseries Association published the UK nursery
insight report, which said: “58% were freezing
fees”.</hs_Para>

Maternal employment rates are rapidly rising under this Government. As

that is realistic and sustainable for schools. That means making the
necessary regulatory changes, aligning the requirements after the
school day from within the school day and making it easier for schools
to collaborate with outside providers. We do not get anywhere by making
false promises that cannot be realised. We are also reforming child
care funding so that parents see more of their money, rather than see
it wasted. This means that all working parents will get up to

in child care is one of the most important sets of investment that any

Manchester Central (Lucy Powell) who made the point a few weeks ago in
one of the many articles she writes that we often talk about the
importance of infrastructure investment—very topical at the
moment, given the controversies over High Speed 2—and that child
care should be viewed as an infrastructure investment. I entirely
agree. Investment in child care is good not only for our future
economic capacity, but for our children. That is what I shall focus on
in my speech.</hs_Para>

is a general debate about how to raise the trend rate of growth in this
country and how to rebalance the economy. We also debate how, if growth
happens, it should be shared fairly and not snaffled away by the
privileged few, as seems to be happening under this Government.
Investment in child care must be an absolutely central part of building
the economy of the future that we all want to see. I consider it to be
one of the best social and economic investments that we can make.
However, today I want to emphasise the benefits that it has for
children.</hs_Para>

am sure all Members will agree that learning begins at birth. The first
few years of a child’s life are critical to its development.
Children need a stimulating, caring environment: they need
opportunities to interact, to be talked to, to play, and to explore in
safe surroundings. While I entirely accept that academic researchers
differ on what is the right balance for a child between being in child
care and being at home and that there are different conclusions to be
drawn, it is undeniable that good-quality, affordable child care is
central to a child’s
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:10:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111955000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0002.htm#13111955000227">Both
Front Benchers mentioned Baroness Morgan’s observations on
preparing children for school. Academic evidence suggests that children
who have experienced child care are much further ahead when it comes to
development and readiness for school, but we also know that child care
gives society an equality dividend. It helps women, in particular, to
move into the labour market, but all too often they are priced out of
that market by the cost of child
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:11:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111955000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0002.htm#13111955000228">Ministers
boast about the state of the economy, and say that we have turned the
corner. Some top Tories even claim that they are on the glide path to
victory, 
<?notus-xml column=1133?>which I would describe as a brave and, indeed, arrogant prediction. In
reality, however, the economic benefits that exist are not being
shared. There is a huge squeeze on living standards, and hard-working
people are worse off and therefore cannot afford child

We know from the figures that 2 million children in poverty live in
households containing a single earner, and that nine out of 10 of the
workless partners are female. Securing good-quality, affordable child
care and helping mothers to return to the labour market is one of the
best ways in which we can make a significant dent in child poverty
numbers. But what is the record of the present Government?</hs_Para>

the Minister knows, I have tremendous respect for her. I listen
carefully to her speeches, and read a great deal of what she says.
However, the fact remains that the cost of nursery places has risen by
30%, and Ofsted figures show that there are 35,000 fewer child care
places. The average bill for a part-time nursery place providing 25
hours a week has risen to £107. Breakfast clubs have been scaled
down, and the cost of summer holiday child care places has passed the
£100-a-week mark for the first time ever. Although all the
academic research tells us of the advantages enjoyed by
children and toddlers who have been exposed to books, the
Secretary of State—who likes to think of himself as a champion
of academic rigour—has halved the Bookstart grant.</hs_Para>

Government have implemented a range of policies that affect mothers.
For instance, they have cut the child care element of working tax

have the taxman knocking on their doors because of the

school and in life. I do not think we should forget that, for many
parents, that means early years at home with mother or father; but for
many others who, like me, are working full or part time, it
means relying on child care. What we all want is the best-quality child
care, which will promote the best possible development for our children
in those early years. It is not just 
<?notus-xml column=1135?>parents who are committed to that; the Government are absolutely

often not provided a trigger given the way in which the need for child

for a parent is when they need emergency child care, as occurs when
teachers go on strike and parents are left trying to get time off work.
It would be welcome if Labour Members condemned the decision of
teaching unions to go on strike at irregular intervals, so that we can
make sure that children are in school. The Minister referred to the
fact that we are starting to remove red tape, so no longer will schools
have to have a separate Ofsted registration when they cater for
children under three years of age—that is to be welcomed. We are
also dealing with aspects of planning and other requirements that
restrict schools and deter them from facilitating child care provision
outside the core school hours. It is important that we make it as
straightforward as possible for existing school buildings to be used,
be it by the school or not. I understand the wraparound guarantee to
which the Opposition refer but, as has been pointed out, no extra
funding is being provided for that—indeed, Opposition Members

were still not listening after a consultation. Fortunately, however,
when I sent them their communications from the Secretary of State, they
realised that they should, of course, be considering

Members have said that their proposals will be funded through the bank
levy—I appreciate that they are not talking about a
bankers’ bonus measure, which may have been discussed earlier.
The shadow Secretary of State mentioned that less tax is coming in. He
might have noticed that some of our largest banks have not been making
a profit. The obvious cause is the global recession, but the previous
Administration allowed the financial disasters to emerge: they allowed
RBS to grow without any particular controls; HBOS was forced together
with Lloyds, and similar other things occurred; and we had the
disasters at the Co-op which have been revealed in the past few works.
The Opposition are trying to suggest that a recovery in financial
services is bad and that we need to tax them and, indeed, the people
who work in them, further to pay for more and more schemes; the
bankers’ bonus tax seems to have been used 11 times to pay for
various schemes that Labour Members cite. The reality is that money
does not grow on trees—we all got taught that lesson when we
were children—and we have to make every penny stretch. I am very
proud that this Government have genuine ambitions for world-class child
care. We know that at this moment in time the coverage is patchy and it
is costing more than it should, but I am very supportive of the moves
we are making to ensure that child care becomes a significant
contributor to growth and to the growth of the

hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock) made a
powerful speech about the difficulties in which many families find
themselves. A recent 
<?notus-xml column=1143?>Asda survey reveals the startling picture that seven out of 10 mums said
that they would be worse off if they went back to work because of the
costs of child care. Any Government should take such a matter extremely
seriously. Many families are caught in the poverty trap. Although they
work all the hours they can, only one person can work because of the
costs of child care. As a result they are struggling with the

the Department’s figures show that. It would be an appalling
situation if Sure Start was just about providing affordable child
care—we know that the Government have a great
challenge on their hands to meet their obligations in that
regard—but it is not. Sure Start also provides vital support
services to young children and families, who are some of the most

parenting advice, breastfeeding support, affordable child care or just
an opportunity for isolated and often vulnerable and frustrated new
mothers and fathers to meet up with other people.</hs_Para>

that child care is not a peripheral issue, a soft issue or even a

example, research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows that the

we need to bold. I urge those on my Front-Bench to be bolder even than
they are being now. We should be proud of our record, but in the past
progress was sometimes slower than it should have been. It was
sometimes piecemeal. I do not speak for my Front Bench, but I would
like to see a child care Bill in the first Queen’s Speech,
announcing our aim to move towards universal child care. The Institute
for Public Policy Research think tank has shown that a decent universal
system of child care pays for itself in the long run. More parents

third area that I have a brief moment to flag up, as I know we are
running out of time, is the idea of sustainability and ownership. I am
a proud co-operator, and there must be a greater role for co-op and
mutual models when it comes to child care. Many of the original Sure
Start centres were run by boards of parents. I worked among them as my
own older children were growing up and saw the empowerment that that
gave many of those women. These community assets should not be at the
command of Ministers of any party. They remain under threat if
Ministers do not care about child care. Parents know best. I would like
to see more co-operative ownership, including childminding co-ops,
rather than the agencies that the Government are 
<?notus-xml column=1147?>promoting, which would cream off a profit and remove the parent

The great thing about Sure Start centres is that they were open to all
and a range of services were provided. It was a one-stop shop. It will

the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) by agreeing
with her about the cuts to Sure Start and the effect that that has had
throughout the country. The Minister confirmed that the figures have
fallen from 3,631 in 2010 to 3,053—a reduction of 578 in the
number of Sure Start centres. That is the reality.</hs_Para>

take the Minister back to her evidence to the Education Committee in
reply to a question from me on this subject. She did not deny that that
was the situation. She claimed that, where the centres were still being
used, they had moved to a hub and spoke model. We heard in evidence
that sadly, far too often, instead of the delivery of the service, a
part-time member of staff hands out leaflets, signposting parents to a
service that may exist somewhere else. That is not the same thing as
delivering the service that was there previously. That is what has
happened with these closures. We have seen a drastic reduction in the
quality of the service. When I asked about that in the Select
Committee, the Minister ignored the point and moved on to something
else. I have the transcript here if she wants to check what she said.
She failed to give me an answer when I put that point to
her<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:05:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:05:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
According to Government figures, 7,200 fewer staff work in Sure Start
centres throughout the country. That has to mean a lower level and
lower quality of service. I am sorry to say this, but that was the
evidence given to the

am proud of our record on Sure Start. My son was three when he came to
live with us, and we were fortunate in that the Sure Start centre where
we used to live 
<?notus-xml column=1148?>opened about a week before then. It was linked to a school, so there was
a nursery, and he benefited from the brilliant staff working there. We
as a family benefited from the support of Sure Start. Talking to other
parents there and to parents who used other Sure Start facilities, it
was clear that Sure Start transformed their lives and the
lives of the children who benefited from those services. It
made an enormous difference to their development and school readiness.
That could be seen when looking at older children who had benefited
from going through that system and the quality of child care and
support for families that resulted from what the last Labour Government
did. The Labour party is right to be proud of our record on Sure Start.
I have confirmed that with the Sure Start centres in my constituency.
Having children who are school ready makes all the difference. In the
deprived areas that I serve in Crosby, children whose parents have
benefited from Sure Start are school ready while others from the same
estates are not. There is a marked difference in school
readiness and the outcomes that schools can achieve for
those

the difference. The Minister shakes her head, but her Department has
produced a report, which was evidenced in the Select Committee, in
which a thorough analysis of the figures showed that spending levels

things are going backwards under this Government. They are presiding

costs, falling places and cuts in support to help parents. Since 2010
the number of child care places has fallen by over 35,000, including
2,423 fewer childminders on the Minister’s watch, all at a time
when a rising birth rate is putting greater demand on the system. The
failure to supply enough places is impacting on costs for families. The

promising is dwarfed by the £7 billion a year of cuts
they have already made for families with children. The scheme does not

this House believes that the Government is failing to deliver a
recovery for women and is making women pay three times more than men to
bring down the deficit, according to research by the House of Commons
Library; notes that under this Government, women’s unemployment
has reached its highest levels for a generation; further notes that
wages are stagnating in jobs where women are predominant; and calls on
the Government to support more women into decent work by extending free
nursery places for 3 and 4 year olds from 15 to 25 hours a week for
parents at work, provide a legal guarantee for 8am-6pm breakfast and
afterschool club childcare, and bring in Make Work Pay contracts to
provide a 12 months tax rebate for firms which sign up to pay the
living
wage.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T11:30:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev>

test of a successful economy is whether it improves the living
standards of ordinary people: families and businesses who want to work
hard and to get on. Today, official figures say that working people are
on average £1,600 per year worse off than they were at the
election. On this Government’s watch, we have seen the biggest
fall in workers’ incomes in any G7 country. Families across the
country are hurting and it is women who are on the front line of this
cost of living crisis. More often than not, it is women who are left
trying to make the family budget stretch that little bit further: when
the weekly shop costs more each month, but the amount in the purse
stays the same; when in the past three years the cost of keeping the

Lady. I will come on to talk a little bit more about this, but the
difficulty with the Opposition’s figures is that they assume
that income is not shared throughout a household but that it is held on
to by one parent in a two-parent household. The Labour figures also do
not take into account self-employment, the correct inflation figures
and any benefits or tax cuts. Therefore, the figure that was stated of
£1,600 does not actually stack up at
all.</hs_Para>

the Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero) has already done a sterling
job of opening the debate and it is important that we pay attention to

is something about being a woman in politics, I suppose, but because we
are a slightly rare breed women in my constituency often approach me
relatively quietly and say wonderful things such as, “I have
told my daughter about you.” I hope that that is for good
reasons. With that comes a duty to speak up for those women whose voice
is not always loudest, and it is not always loudest because, to be
honest, those women are quite busy. On this point, I must disagree with
the Minister. She quoted the first female Prime Minister, who
apparently said, “If you want something said, ask a man; if you
want something done, ask a woman.” The women I know in Wirral

their own would lose the most from the combined impact of changes to
taxes and cuts to social security benefits and public services. To me,
it is horrendous that the Government’s economic policies will
hit women living on their own the hardest. I know many such women in my

at some point go and talk to women working in the care sector. I am

say that they want to be able to choose and not to be punished for
their own choices. Choosing to stay at home and raise children; to work
part time and use informal child care; to use nurseries or

listening to “The Morning Show” on Radio Nottingham. They
were discussing whether people felt better off now that the economy is
growing again. A mum rang in. She was working but finding it a real
struggle to make ends meet. She admitted that sometimes, in order to
get by, she had to ask her son if she could borrow some money from his
piggy bank. That is just one story—an anecdote—but I
think that it says a lot about life under this

that women are losing employment in the public sector, but they are not
getting comparable jobs in the private sector. The Women’s
Budget Group analysis shows the following: although unemployment across
the whole UK has fallen by 0.6% for men, it has increased by 0.8% for
women; the number of women who are unemployed has increased by nearly
15% to over 1 million, the highest level for a generation; and
long-term unemployment has increased eight times faster for women than
for men. For older women aged over 50, the situation is even worse:
unemployment is up by 42,000—more than a third—since the
general election, while for older men it has fallen. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Ashfield (Gloria De

children’s clothes and bus fares. The Lib Dems tell us that the

Government’s own impact assessment on the tax threshold rise to
£10,000 shows that 57% of those gaining from the measure are men
and only 43% are women. The Women’s Budget Group notes that
three quarters of the gain will go to the better-off half of all
households. On average, households in the poorest 10% of the
distribution gain just £6 per year; in contrast, the richest 10%
of households gain an average of £87 per year. What has the
Government’s priority been? A tax cut for those earning over
£150,000 a year and a massive giveaway to millionaires, while
child benefit—a lifeline for many mums—has been frozen
not once but for three years in a row. Tax credits and other benefits
that many low-paid women rely on will rise by just 1%, condemning
families to falling living standards and increasing the pressure on
women, who are most often responsible for making ends meet. It is not a

future—assuming, of course, that universal credit ever

people will benefit even less as the tax threshold increases. Universal
credit will be calculated on net, rather than gross earnings.
Therefore, if a taxpayer who claims universal credit receives a tax cut
of £100, they will automatically lose £65 of benefits.
The lowest paid taxpayers are going to suffer more, and a solution
would be to commit to increase the amount someone can earn before
universal credit payments are reduced every time tax thresholds go up.
Those who advocate the solution for low-paid workers have told us time

everyone but to benefit low-paid workers. However, it will not benefit

recipients of universal credit when—if—it comes in, and
the new child care tax relief starts in 2015. Why not now, however,
especially with universal credit receding somewhere over the horizon?
Further to that, the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission
suggests that the Government should reallocate the

payers to those on universal credit. That would be over and above

Government—has declined sharply since 2010, falling by 26% to
just under 500,000. I agree that that is still too high and we have
more to do, but we are doing an enormous amount—providing free
child care and helping lone parents into work—to help them to
lift their own families out of poverty. There are other positive
aspects of welfare reform for women in the workplace. Although well
intentioned, a terrible consequence of Labour’s approach to
welfare is that it trapped many women in 16-hour-a-week jobs. I have

pay off debts. Disproportionately stuck on pay below the living wage

Widows found that only 40% of women put enough money aside for an
“adequate” retirement—down from 50% two years ago,
and the lowest amount since the number started to be tracked under
Labour in 2006. On average, women who are saving are putting aside
£182 each month, compared with £260 for men—a
pensions “gender gap” of £1,000 in contributions
each year. The continued squeeze on the cost of living has made it much
harder for many women not only to live an adequate and healthy
lifestyle now, but to consider saving for their future and retirement.
The gender pay gap, the opportunity gap and the oncoming pensions gap

want to mention two other issues related to the increasing unemployment
of women. The first is the lack of role models for young women. It is
very noticeable that this Government have only four women in a Cabinet

women, the vast majority of them being Labour MPs. When we look at
chief executives and board membership, this situation is,
unfortunately, common. That is compounded by a lack of consistent
careers advice in schools, and in some schools no careers advice at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:38:52"></hs_TimeCode>, so how are

other key consideration in respect of why more women are unemployed has
to do with their caring responsibilities and lack of Government support
for them. For younger women that is likely to be child care, while for
older women it is more likely to be care of their parents or their
partners. The support for both those groups of women to enable them to
both care and work is being systematically chipped away. Not only is
this bad for the women; it is also bad for the country 
<?notus-xml column=1192?>economically. The ultimate irony is that of the
£14.4 billion raised in 2014-15 through the
additional net direct tax and benefit, pay and pension changes
announced since the general election, £11.4 billion—or
around 79%—is coming from women and £2.9 billion is

the Economic Secretary. It is just a shame that, having won that

the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood) of scaremongering
when she pointed out that the £1,200 fees were putting women off
taking their employers to a tribunal when they had been wrongfully
sacked because they were pregnant. I fear that the Minister might have
been trying to play down the problem. Maternity Action,
whose representative I met just a few hours before the debate began,
submitted evidence to the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee
that showed that only 3% of victims of pregnancy discrimination took
their claim to an employment tribunal, and that the fees involved were
cited as one of the significant barriers that women faced. I recommend
that the Minister meet Maternity Action to learn some facts about the
impact of this Government’s policies on women’s lives. I
am sure that its representatives would be happy to meet her.</hs_Para>

children, and nearly 500,000 mums have lost up to £1,500 a year
in support for child care. It is women who are seeing the services that
they value being hollowed out. Sure Start funding has been slashed by
more than half in real terms over this Parliament, and there are now
578 fewer Sure Start centres as a result. Many of those that remain are
cutting back their services and opening hours, or charging for sessions

want to reply to the point made by some hon. Members about the
£1,200 fee for employment tribunals. It is simply misleading to
suggest that that is what any woman will have to pay in order to take
up a claim. That is not what they have to pay to lodge a
claim—that figure is £200. There is a remissions regime
for people who cannot afford to pay that amount and only in cases that
go to a full hearing—a tiny percentage of the number of cases
overall, and only about 300 each year—will the full amount be
paid. Even in those cases, if people win it is likely that costs will
be awarded and they will not have to pay. Although I accept that the
Opposition should make legitimate points, it is important to be clear

pleasure to open this Adjournment debate on energy transmission
infrastructure in my county of Carmarthenshire. In doing so, I am
fulfilling two promises, one of which I made to the then Minister on 6
March this year when we debated in Westminster Hall the proposed
Brechfa west wind farm application, which he later approved. During the
debate, I kindly informed him that I would seek a further debate if he
approved the Brechfa west generation development without considering
the infrastructure required to connect it to the national
grid.</hs_Para>

reading of English planning law is that these matters—generation
and transmission developments—should be determined together to
help inform a comprehensive picture of the impact of individual energy
projects. I said in the aforementioned debate that local people were
being hoodwinked by the developers and the UK Government in not
processing both together. I regret to inform the House that I share
their
opinions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T19:18:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111982000581" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#13111982000581">I
regret that I have to make a political point so early in my speech, but
the Tories in my constituency have only one campaign, and that is to
oppose wind turbines. I look forward to reminding the electorate of
Carmarthen East and Dinefwr in the months ahead that it was a Tory
Minister who approved the largest wind farm ever built in
Carmarthenshire and who will now be responsible for the 20 metre-high
poles that will service the

I am fulfilling a promise I made to my constituents that I would seek
this debate following two public meetings that my constituency
colleague, Rhodri Glyn Thomas AM, and I held on this issue over the
summer in the villages of Pontargothi and Pencader. In those meetings,
there was not enough room in the various halls to accommodate those who
wished to have their say. This transmission development has generated
huge public interest in the north and west of my constituency. I will
endeavour this evening to portray the arguments made to us as elected
members so that they are now a matter of
record.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111982000583" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#13111982000583">It
will be of little surprise to you, Mr Speaker, to learn that if I had
my way these matters would be devolved. Wales is a net exporter of
electricity, yet we pay the highest electricity prices of any
constituent part of the United Kingdom and, regrettably, we have among
the highest levels of fuel poverty. A key element of my party’s
social justice programme for reducing energy poverty, therefore, is to
obtain control over our energy resources. That is also a key part of
our economic vision of moving our country from the bottom of the wealth
table. I am glad to report that my colleagues in the Assembly will hold
a debate on a votable motion tomorrow in the
Senedd<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T19:19:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111982000584" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#13111982000584">The

the issue of democracy. These matters should be decided not by the
Whitehall machine, but rather by the democratic institutions closer to
the communities of west Wales. The regulatory framework put in place by
Ofgem specifies that the only material planning consideration is
cost—in other words, the cheapest option. That completely

existing electricity network infrastructure is ageing. Much of it dates
from the 1950s and 1960s, so considerable investment is needed to
replace those assets as well as to expand our networks to accommodate
the new generation that we require and to keep the lights on for our
constituents and businesses. That is particularly the case where new
generation is located far from demand or where the existing
infrastructure is
insufficient.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111982000618" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#13111982000618">Developers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T19:34:00"></hs_TimeCode>

turning to the subject of electricity networks in Carmarthenshire, it
might be helpful if I explain the wider approach to deciding on new
network infrastructure. Under the current regulatory framework, it is
for the network companies to submit proposals for new network
infrastructure to the regulator, Ofgem, and relevant planning
authorities. The proposals must be based on a well-justified need case
such as new generation connections or the maintenance of a safe and
secure network.</hs_Para>

they are required to undertake extensive consultation with

to comment on the specific application that lies at the heart of that,
but I repeat that in fulfilling their licence obligations companies
must not only develop efficient and cost-effective networks but have
regard to the preservation of amenity and the mitigation of effects
that their activities have on the natural beauty of the countryside.
That is the balance they have to strike in their
applications.</hs_Para>

to legal requirements to consider the wider impacts of new network

that network companies are required to consider wider impacts and
alternative solutions to overhead lines. 
<?notus-xml column=1209?>That regulatory approach is reinforced by the Government’s energy
national policy statements, which set out the framework for factors to
be considered when consenting to an infrastructure project of national
significance. It makes clear—this may help Opposition
Members—that cost should not be the only factor in determining
the type of network technology used, and that proper
consideration should be given to other feasible means of connection,
including underground and sub-sea cables. I hope that balanced approach
provides some reassurance to those areas potentially affected by cables
and pylons that the need for infrastructure is carefully assessed, and
that alternatives to new overhead lines are considered
seriously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111982000624" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#13111982000624">Since
costs and technical difficulties vary so much from project to project,
it is important that each is assessed case by case to ensure that the
right planning decision is taken each time. The Government consider the
costs and benefits of undergrounding electricity lines important issues
that need to be considered carefully. That is why my Department
arranged for an independent study to provide clarity on the
practicality, whole life costs, and impacts of undergrounding and
sub-sea cabling, as alternatives to overhead lines. That report was
published in January 2012, and its findings are generally consistent
with the comparative costs that National Grid quoted when evaluating
options on current projects. The report should provide a useful point
of reference to inform the planning
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111982000625" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#13111982000625">Let
me turn now to the need for, and the development of, network
infrastructure in Carmarthenshire. Consent for the Brechfa Forest West
wind farm in Carmarthenshire was granted by the Secretary of State in
March this year. The application for the electricity network
infrastructure in Carmarthenshire to connect the wind farm will be
decided by the appropriate planning authorities and Ministers. It would
not be appropriate for me to give my views on the particulars of this
project. However, I can say that I do recognise that many people feel
very strongly about pylons and the impact they can have on the
landscape.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111982000626" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#13111982000626">Effective
consultation with local communities and other interested parties is a
vital part of the planning and regulatory approval process. When making
proposals 
<?notus-xml column=1210?>for new infrastructure, network companies have to demonstrate that
alternatives were considered and why the preferred option is justified.
That in turn must show that stakeholders have been engaged effectively.
Western Power Distribution, the distribution network operator in
Carmarthenshire, has started a consultation process that will continue
throughout 2014 to seek views on route options for the wind farm
connections. It expects to submit an application for consent to the
Planning Inspectorate and it will ultimately be determined by the
Secretary of
State.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111982000627" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#13111982000627">I

our future energy needs will require the expansion of our electricity
network. Deciding where and how this infrastructure is delivered
requires informed and balanced consideration of a number of factors,

communities and the country as a whole. The planning and regulatory
approval processes for new electricity network infrastructure require
that stakeholders are consulted properly on these important decisions
and that their views are demonstrably taken into account. This is now

consulting stakeholders in developing its proposals, and I strongly

mentioning oversight, it is important to give some context to this
debate. In that regard, we should consider resources, including the
funding allocations up to the next financial year. The Government have
allocated a staggering £1.7 billion of capital funding to free
schools, which equates to a third of the total budget for creating new
school places in England as a whole over the spending review period. We
should bear in mind the fact that, at the beginning of the autumn term,
there were 174 free schools, compared with about 24,000
non-free schools. The words “disproportionate” and
“partial” do not seem adequate to describe this
investment in so few schools. However, I am more concerned that all
this money is being ploughed into free schools, which are an as yet

spite of Her Majesty’s chief inspector’s criticism of

from the local authority. Schools such as the Al-Madinah free school in
Derby, Kings science school in Bradford, and Barnfield Federation in
Luton—we are not entirely sure how many others there might be,

breaking E-ACT’s own financial rules. The investigation also
found that expenses indicated a culture of “prestige”
venues, large drinks bills, business lunches and first-class travel,
all funded by public money. “Extravagant” use was made of
public funds for an annual strategy conference, at a cost of almost
£16,000. Monthly lunches took place at the Reform club—I

E-ACT Enterprises, became “blurred.” A number of

of technology, which has more than 640 pupils, if it had enjoyed the

The Secretary of State’s free school pet project is motivated
neither by achieving better results, nor by the desire to obtain better
value for money. Such schools are free only at the expense of the
success of existing local authority schools. I therefore do not
understand how they can be considered to be cost-effective.</hs_Para>

schools mean less oversight, less democracy and poorer value for money.
They are failing the taxpayer, teachers, parents and, most importantly,

identified the need for a pause for thought on the due diligence

about the case that I know best, the Kings science academy, which is

we have heard, at Kings science academy in Bradford. There is also an
ongoing investigation into the Barnfield Federation in Luton, and we
want a guarantee from the Minister that there will not be a cover-up

integral part of the free schools policy design. He said that some free

we have it: the lack of oversight is not an accident, as the hon.
Member for Bradford East pointed out; it is part of the design of this
ideological experiment. According to the Government, a bit of failure
is fine, if there are unqualified teachers, and some financial fraud is
okay: in the long run, presumably, some good schools will emerge from
the carnage of the experiment. The fact that pupils’ education
is disrupted along the way—as with the Al-Madinah free school,
which had to close for a week—is presumably just collateral
damage and a price worth paying.</hs_Para>

to the Secretary of State has told us that we should expect failure and
fraud. Clearly, he is right. At least he is being honest: all we have
had from the rest of the Department is delay and obfuscation when it
has been questioned about all this. Much of that is because Ministers
are hopelessly conflicted about the policy. How can a Minister be both
a promoter of free schools and an adjudicator on them? That is the
situation now. How can the Secretary of State be both propagandist for
his free schools experimental policy and overseer of that policy at the
same time? He is responsible for all of these schools. He is like Dr
Frankenstein: he is in love with his own creation and cannot see the

remember that he is a Government Minister with
responsibility for the proper use of
taxpayers’ money. Ofsted described that school as
“dysfunctional” and rated it “inadequate”
in every category, with unqualified teachers who lacked proper
training. Now there are new allegations of financial irregularities
over the letting of contracts. Will the Minister confirm—he may
need some in-flight refuelling to answer the question—whether
Department for Education Ministers or officials received from
Derbyshire police correspondence relating to the funders of the

Lewis’s name was redacted, despite the fact that the financial
arrangements are in the public domain. Even the name of the head
teacher of the school was redacted in the version that the Department
released. We have to wonder why it was necessary to redact the name of
the head teacher—or principal, as he calls

story. The report found a whole host of financial irregularities,
including an admission by someone at the school that it had submitted
fabricated invoices to claim money from the DFE as part of its set-up
grant, and identified £86,000 of that grant that had not been
spent by the school for the purpose for which it was intended. The
report recommended that those matters should be passed on to the police
for investigation. As has been pointed out, on 25 October, the
Department said that the matter had been reported to the
police</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13111938000066" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0001.htm#13111938000066">“who

“Newsnight” investigation—West Yorkshire police
contacted the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau to ask about the case

that the matter had been passed on to the National Fraud Intelligence

Everyone in the Chamber wants innovative schools with appropriate

irresponsible to design a policy with the expectation that failure is
inevitable—that is what the Secretary of State and special
advisers have done—and with no proper oversight of the spending
of public money and the impact of the policy on the young people in the
care of those schools. There are more scandals to come. As the Minister

almost three quarters of the 25 free schools inspected so far as good

further inquiries and endeavour to write to him in the usual way. He
also asked about the Barnfield Federation in Luton and the publication

reports, but we have to publish them at the right time. In the case of
Kings science academy, for example, that was when the disciplinary
action was complete. It is worth remembering, of course, that Barnfield

what more can the British Government do to achieve a peaceful

Commission’s statement, in my view, was woolly and inconsistent,
and it ignored the real, provocative acts and the long delays at the
border crossing. Greater awareness is needed across Europe about the
real difficulties that the Spanish Government’s policies are
creating for the people of Gibraltar and the serious effect that they
are having on its economy. Several members of the all-party
parliamentary group on Gibraltar are also members of the Council of
Europe. We have a role in the Council of Europe, which is, after all, a
human rights platform, to raise the matter and make the 47
countries across Europe more aware of the situation between Spain and
Gibraltar.</hs_Para>

Melilla, I think that it would be foolish of the Spanish Government to
pursue their current tactics, because they may end up with red faces if
Ceuta and Melilla challenge them over breaches. If Spain continues with
its provocative policies against Gibraltar, Morocco will probably
respond, and Spain would ultimately be the loser. The Gibraltar
Government and the British Government must continue to take part in
trilateral talks to resolve the current difficulties. The all-party
parliamentary group on Gibraltar will continue to support the people of
Gibraltar in their wish to remain British, and we will stand by them at
this particularly difficult
time.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_19_PT_1/34A97A851E1759CACCDC97BDEAE0EB1D284901E7" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="19 November 2013">Tuesday

hon. Friend the Member for Gosport raised Spanish incursions into
Gibraltarian territorial waters. The Government take seriously their
responsibility to ensure Gibraltar’s security. We do not rule
out any measures that are necessary to defend Gibraltar and ensure its
security against a genuine threat. We believe that the unlawful
incursions by Guardia Civil vessels and other vessels of the Spanish
state are merely a futile attempt to assert Spain’s legal
position in respect of the waters. They are not acts of war and they do
not weaken or undermine the legal basis for British sovereignty over
Gibraltar and British Gibraltar territorial waters. The British
Government are committed to upholding British sovereignty. The Royal
Navy challenges all unlawful incursions by Spanish state vessels though
radio warnings and close monitoring of Spanish state vessels until they
leave Gibraltarian waters. We also make formal protests to the Spanish
Government about all such incursions on diplomatic channels, ensuring
that the Spanish understand that those incursions are unacceptable
violations of British sovereignty.</hs_Para>

reiterate the point that there have been constructive discussions with

aim of the UK Government and the Government of Gibraltar is to return
to the trilateral forum for dialogue, from which the Spanish Government
withdrew on taking office in December 2011. In the short term, we need
to find a way to manage our differences with Spain through talks,
instead of border delays, incursions and other unacceptable and

challenges we will continue to take firm action whenever necessary to
safeguard Gibraltar, its people and their

by recognising China’s rich, deep cultural heritage. It is one
of the oldest civilisations in the world, with an impressive history
spanning more than 10,000 years. China is well known for its succession
of dynasties. The first was the Xia dynasty, which began in the 22nd
century BC and lasted until the 16th century BC. It was followed by the
Shang and Zhou dynasties, which lasted five and 11 centuries
respectively, and then a succession of others until the comparatively
modern and more familiar Ming and Qing dynasties from the 14th century
onward.</hs_Para>

made a fundamental contribution to the development of Chinese
civilisation. For example, under the Qin dynasty, the great wall of
China was constructed to protect the country from northern invaders;
under the Han dynasty, a national civil service was established; and
under the Tang dynasty, China became a great world power for the first
time, which is being repeated today. China’s history and culture
cannot be overstated. Whether through literature, philosophy, music,
the visual arts, cuisine or religion, China’s influence has
reached all parts of the
globe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0001.htm#13111959000008">China
is home to more than one in five of the world’s population, with
more than 1.35 billion inhabitants, and to 56 recognised ethnic groups
and at least 292 languages and dialects. It is one of the
world’s great civilisations. China matters. It is big in
history, size, culture, population, commerce and ambition. The scale
and pace of the change that has taken place in China over the past 30
years has been unprecedented—a second great leap forward. It has
been a giant leap. China is now the world’s second largest
economy and its largest exporter and importer of goods. As the
fastest-growing major economy in the world with an average annual
growth rate of 10% over the past 30 years, China has rapidly expanded
its global influence. That growth rate is likely to put its economy
ahead of the United States within the next two decades. However,
countries cannot exist on economic prosperity alone.</hs_Para>

and societies make a country or a civilisation, not volatile stock
markets, trade or the buying of goods and services. Yes, those things
are the lifeblood of outward prosperity, but it is the prosperity of
the human spirit that helps to advance civilisations: the freedom of
the individual to determine their own destiny for good or ill, to
determine whether to turn left or right and what they believe and to
dream, imagine, create and innovate. This is about social growth, not
just economic growth. Whether China’s leaders can recognise that
will determine China’s future and success. Markets rise and
fall, but the human spirit always seeks to soar, wherever it

Chinese are unlikely to act against a country that has, for example, a
military treaty with the United States, such as the Philippines or
Thailand, but some countries do not have such a treaty, including
Vietnam. The international community must prepare for such an event to
ensure that it is united in its response. If we did not
respond—I am referring not to military action but to a timely,
swift and overwhelming diplomatic and political response—it
would be seen as appeasement, as the weakness of the west, and would
give a green light to China to continue its expansionism in the region.

China’s economic rise has been impressive, but if it is to be

people’s rising aspirations, growing expectations and more
informed view of their place in China and the rest of the world. The

probably need to encourage the Commonwealth to develop a China policy,
given China’s deep involvement in Africa and fact that some of
its membership comes from Africa. Democracies around the world,
including Japan and other countries in eastern Asia, might also need to
develop a comprehensive and holistic response to this emerging

have heard about China’s economic importance to the UK and about
the fact that it is the world’s second largest economy. Some
projections indicate that it will overtake the US economy in just three
years’ time. 
<?notus-xml column=300?>To put that growth in context, it was suggested in 2004 that China might
become the world’s largest economy in 2035, but it is now
expected to be 2016. I visited the country with the all-party group on
China two years ago. People have to go there to see for themselves the
phenomenal scale of development in cities such as Shanghai, Chengdu and
Beijing and really to appreciate the extent to which China has
industrialised and modernised in recent years.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) mentioned that
China’s overseas investment has expanded dramatically. He raised
concerns about the perhaps somewhat cavalier attitude of some
countries, particularly in Africa, to the Chinese presence, and he
talked about how we can raise those issues through our relations with
them. China’s overseas investment rose from $17 billion in 2005
to $130 billion last year, and it is on an upward trajectory.</hs_Para>

China’s rising global standing, the importance of a strong
bilateral relationship cannot be overstated. That is why the Labour
Government published a UK-China strategy on a framework for engagement
in 2009, covering China’s growth, including boosting our
business, educational and scientific links; the need to foster
China’s emergence as a responsible global player, including
action on climate change; and promoting sustainable development,
modernisation and internal reform in China. Human rights was very much
part of that third element, and I will come to that later.</hs_Para>

Government are right to seek closer economic ties with China, but there
needs to be a broader focus on co-operation across a range of areas. At
the moment, it seems that the UK is being held back by a lack of
strategic vision and an insular focus on commercial opportunities to
the exclusion of other factors. As the shadow Foreign Secretary said
recently, we need an Asian step change in the UK’s foreign
policy to ensure dialogue is not limited only to commercial
matters.</hs_Para>

Foreign Office should seek to engage better with China on a range of
issues, including climate change, technology and international issues

Additionally, by working with our allies across the Atlantic, we can

China has ratified the Kyoto protocol, it is not required to limit
emissions, as a non-annexe 1 country. We cannot ignore the
environmental implications of China’s sheer size and rapid
economic development. It currently has the highest carbon dioxide
emissions in the world—more than the USA and India combined.
Although its cumulative footprint is obviously not as great as that of
countries that developed much longer ago, evidence suggests that
China’s greenhouse gas emissions are rising by 10% each year. To
its credit, China has taken some positive action in recent years, with
greater use of environmental regulations and advances in mitigation
techniques as a result of the development of its technical 
<?notus-xml column=301?>expertise. There has been considerable investment, for example, in
alternative energy, but despite that, the country is still heavily
reliant on

is particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change, with
increasing temperatures and rising sea levels a threat to its long
coast line. Glacier melt in Tibet is also a serious concern.
Furthermore, the World Bank has estimated that China is home to 16 of
the 20 most polluted
cities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:17:48"></hs_TimeCode>.
Interestingly, there have been dramatic increases in environmental

robust environmental regulation.</hs_Para>

there are signs that the Chinese Government are responding. Chinese
Ministers have confirmed to GLOBE International—I believe they
are meeting at the moment—that they will introduce comprehensive
legislation on climate change over the next two years. It is imperative
that the UK and the wider international community engage with China to
secure its involvement in global efforts on this
front<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:18:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000087">Recently,
there have been discussions on energy, with the Energy Secretary
announcing the Chinese investment in Hinkley Point following his recent
visit to China. As the hon. Members for The Wrekin and for Cheltenham
mentioned, the investment is welcome if it enables us to diversify our
energy mix, but any agreement will require thorough scrutiny, given the
35-year guarantees offered to the companies involved.</hs_Para>

Chancellor has announced a relaxation of visa requirements for Chinese
visitors, which is perhaps an indication that the Government now
recognise some of the tensions and contradictions in their immigration
policy. The issue was certainly raised when the all-party group visited
China a couple of years ago. Businesses there told us that, although
the UK was seen in the past as the premier destination for students
wishing to study abroad, there was increasing competition from
Australia and America. That was partly linked to the visa requirements
and being able to stay on and work in the country for a few years
afterwards.</hs_Para>

such as the British Council and the university of Cambridge, and
companies such as Tesco, which has a presence in China, made the point
quite strongly. There is a strong educational link between our two
countries. Chinese students are the largest foreign contingent in UK
schools and universities, but the Government’s net migration
targets are perceived as a threat to that situation. The news on visas
is welcome if it will help with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:20:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000090">Human
rights have been covered in surprising detail during the debate, which
I expected would be more about the economic side of things. I welcome
the raising of human rights issues. As we heard, after the Prime
Minister and Deputy Prime Minister met the Dalai Lama last year, the
bilateral relationship became rather strained, and it was reported that
the Prime Minister’s visit to China was postponed as a result.
He was not welcome in the country, and ministerial contact was
reportedly cut off.</hs_Para>

thawing of relations it seemed that the Chancellor, on his recent
visit, was keen to reassure China that the Prime Minister had no
further plans to meet the Dalai Lama. Undoubtedly the trip took place
in delicate circumstances, and reportedly there were tensions between
the Treasury and the Foreign Office 
<?notus-xml column=302?>about how to reconcile China’s strategic importance, particularly
on the economic front, with its human rights record. The
answer—I hope that the Minister will agree—is that
neither can be ignored, which is why human rights were central to
Labour’s strategy for building a closer relationship with
China<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:21:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000092"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Pritchard" PimsId="4836" UID="13111959000310" xid="898" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000310">Mark

Government recently published their action plan on business and human
rights, which said that the promotion of business and respect for human
rights should go hand in hand. There is concern that the Treasury in
particular has not signed up to that script. Following the
Chancellor’s visit, I tabled a question asking what discussions
he had had with the Foreign Secretary before he went about human rights
in China and the Government’s action plan on business and human
rights. I also asked what discussions the Chancellor had during his
visit about freedom of expression, freedom of association, the rule of

mysteriously, the question seemed to be transferred to the Foreign
Office. I received a letter from there, telling me that it had been
sent back to the Chancellor for a response. The Chancellor chose not to
respond, and passed the question to the Economic Secretary to the
Treasury, who had not even been on the trip, although I
believe the Financial Secretary had. The Economic Secretary responded
on 4 November at column 11W but would not tell me whether
the Chancellor had discussed human rights with the Foreign Secretary or
with officials he met in China.</hs_Para>

we expect him to be concerned primarily with economic matters, but
human rights should be woven through our bilateral relationship with
any country, and should be raised as part of the delegation. Reports

the moment there are more tigers in captivity in tiger farms in China

tourist attractions. That was raised at the convention on international
trade in endangered species meeting in 2012. The UK Government and, I

to Tibet, while we respect China’s sovereignty, we cannot ignore
the serious human rights issues that arise—the disturbing number
of self-immolations and the reports of arrests because a friend or

continue to raise concerns about the treatment of people in Tibet and
promote dialogue. The UK-China human rights dialogue is one cornerstone
of our bilateral relationship. The 20th round took place in January
2012, and the Foreign Office’s March human rights update
reported that it was waiting for China to respond to the proposed dates
for the 21st round. That was not included in the June or September

Given that the Foreign Secretary has said that his priorities for the
UK’s term on the council include championing freedom of

UK to press its new colleagues on the council on such issues and to
emphasise the value of visits by UN special rapporteurs, as well as
championing the issues

be political as well as economic engagement across Government. The
long-planned autumn statement has now been rearranged because of the
Prime Minister’s visit to China next month. The number of the
Prime Minister’s overseas trips has given the impression that he
is concentrating on trade to the exclusion of human rights, so I hope
that the Foreign Office will ensure that he is fully briefed on the
UK’s commitment to the UN guiding principles on business and
human rights and on the reasons why the Foreign Office includes China

absolutely clear in highlighting the importance of China’s
history, culture and historic civilisation and, importantly, in putting
on the record the huge economic progress in China over the past 30
years or so, as well as the real progress in making it easier for and
enabling United Kingdom businesses to invest in China. I also

important to say that the time is significant not only for the UK, but
for China, in their relationship. The debate is particularly timely
because of recent visits to China by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) rightly outlined some of
the key statistics of China’s economic rise and transformation,
as did other hon. Members. The stark one for me was that McKinsey
believes that China’s economic transformation is happening at
100 times the scale of the first country to urbanise—the United
Kingdom—and at 10 times the speed. That is a really
transformational and expeditious economic
rise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>. That
remarkable growth is primarily taking place in China’s cities.
In less than 10 years, China’s urban middle class will be in
excess of 600 million
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:34:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000118">That
rapid transformation presents clear opportunities for the United
Kingdom. Our economies are set to enter a new, more complementary
phase. There will be a demand for products and services not only in the
obvious economic sectors but in important sectors where the UK has
expertise, such as in health care and education—exactly the
point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:34:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bristol East—as well as in the creative industries.
Furthermore, luxury goods will continue to grow as urbanisation
continues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:34:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Those
are areas of British strength. We already excel at producing what the
future Chinese economy will demand. In addition, our university sector
is first rate. Expertise across the full spectrum of creative
disciplines makes us unique in the world, and we are well placed to
offer increased scientific

growing middle class increasingly sees Britain as a tourist destination
and as a place to educate their children. In the second quarter of this
year, we issued approximately 150,000 visas to Chinese
nationals—40% more than had been issued in any previous quarter.
In the five years to 2011-12, the number of Chinese students in the UK

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:35:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for The Wrekin about the announcements made by the
Chancellor in his recent visit to China. We are keenly aware of the
issues arising from the Schengen visa system for Chinese visitors to
Europe. The Chancellor has announced pilot measures to allow joint
applications for UK and Schengen visas from certain tour groups taking
part in the approved destinations scheme. We clearly maintain our own
separate visa system—a point made articulately by my hon.
Friend—but those administrative measures will help to address
any issues. We estimate and anticipate that the number of visa
applications will be more than 1 million a year by 2017. To make the
process easier and faster for Chinese nationals who want to visit the
UK for business, study or pleasure, the Chancellor followed up any
concerns with his announcement in China of new measures, including a
24-hour visa service and streamlining the UK and Schengen visa
application
processes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:36:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000121">We
have much to learn and gain from each other, not only economically but
culturally, sharing each other’s rich cultural history and
traditions. We can see that collaboration and the growth of societal
knowledge in visitor exchanges between our two countries and in the
important collaborations between our museums—there is currently

discussing the human rights issues rightly raised by hon. Members, I
will turn to some specifics on trade and inward investment, which is an
important component of the China-UK relationship, in part because the
UK rightly has a reputation as the most open economy in the world,
driving unprecedented Chinese investment into the country. We are also
creating the right environment for Chinese businesses to operate in,

hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin rightly mentioned the investment
by Huawei, which is a prime example. Rather than blocking Chinese
investment in that particular important economic sector, we have
welcomed investment of £1.3 billion into its UK business over
the next five years, including a new £125-million research base
that will create up to 300 new
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:38:27"></hs_TimeCode>. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:39:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
also said, however, we of course take the security and integrity of all
equipment used by the Government and the public seriously. GCHQ
continues to work closely with Huawei, as with a number of other
telecommunications suppliers, to ensure that the products are safe,
secure and resilient in the United

particularly keen to encourage investment from China—as from
elsewhere in the world—in our infrastructure, which we hope will
bring about £200 billion of projects over the next
five years. My hon. Friend mentioned the investment in the UK’s
new generation of nuclear plants at Hinkley Point C, with two Chinese
companies as minority
shareholders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:39:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13111959000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000262">Investment
is only part of the story. Our bilateral trade with China is now worth
more than $70 billion a year and we are on track to meet the target of
$100 billion a year by 2015. UK exports of goods and
services to China have increased 10% in the past year alone, and are
growing at the fastest rate of any major EU nation—a testament
to Government policies. The Foreign and 
<?notus-xml column=307?>Commonwealth Office has put prosperity at the heart of its mission, and
as part of our network shift we have 60 new staff working in China, a
third of whom are focused on less well-known but increasingly

encouraging the Chinese not to block flow of information through the
BBC or Google. We strongly believe that a modern knowledge economy must
be built on the free flow of ideas. Freedom of expression is a

economic growth is only one part of a wider regional story.
Asia-Pacific continues to be one of the fastest growing regions
economically, and as British business seeks to take advantage of the
opportunities offered by that growth it is fundamental that the region

security challenges that risk undermining the region’s economic
and political development. The tensions between China and Japan are
well documented. We do not take sides in the underlying sovereignty
issues but urge all parties to seek peaceful solutions. The effective
development of a regional security apparatus is important to stability

the important issue of human rights, which has been raised by a number
of hon. Members. It is right to say that our prosperity, security,
values and global interests are clearly interconnected. As my right
hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has said, we must have a foreign
policy based on our values, and the Government believe that respect for
human rights is good for economic growth. We want China to continue to
succeed. We believe that the development of an independent civil
society and the application of human rights under the rule of law are
essential for China’s long-term prosperity, along with the free
flow of ideas that is an essential part of the growth of a
knowledge-driven economy. That is why we welcome the reforms announced

the importance of engagement and external lobbying to ensure a

those other reforms. We hope that the authorities will plan not just to

frameworks to which both the United Kingdom and China are party. We
made a statement at the United Nations universal periodic review of

meaningful dialogue is the best way to address and resolve the

agree to action to tackle the three main aspects of the problem:
improving enforcement; reducing demand for illegal wildlife
products—that aspect is particularly important in relation to
China—and supporting sustainable livelihoods for communities
affected by illegal wildlife trade. We hope to work with China and
other global partners to address the destabilising effects of the

is important that we continue to work with China on such issues, which
we do. Clearly, China’s rapid industrialisation has put strains
on the environment. Other hon. Members mentioned that, and
China’s third plenum also recognised it. It is important to
establish ecological civilisation. We continue to work with China at
all levels, not just with central Government, but at provincial and
local level on a multilateral basis to try to encourage process and
improvement in environmental standards, and to encourage the use of
renewables and energy efficiency, which are a key component of this

point that hon. Members raised is the importance of Chinese engagement
with Africa. We welcome that engagement in Africa. China plays an
increasingly important role in security and prosperity on the
continent. Both the UK and China share a fundamental interest in
promoting sustainable development and maintaining regional stability.
The Chinese are now involved in UN peacekeeping operations in Sudan,
South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in anti-piracy
issues off the horn of Africa. We are building a partnership with China
in Africa to help to reduce poverty and to achieve the millennium
development goals. Chinese and UK businesses are working together to
maximise the beneficial impact for those living in Africa. I could not

we take, we are all very disappointed by the process, which, as one
understands it, is that following the Crown Estate identifying a site,
in comes a preferred bidder who floats a number of potential scenarios.
People are never quite sure what they are dealing with—how many
turbines, how big, or what will be generated. The proposal goes through
various phases of consultation, and it is only towards the end of the
process that we get it firming up and we start to see what the shape of
the development will be. That makes it very confusing and difficult for
constituents, who mostly do not understand the process—indeed,
Members of Parliament sometimes have great difficulty dealing with
it.</hs_Para>

reality, therefore, is that later in the process there is a more
specific application that eventually goes either to the Planning

decision is taken without councils being involved, although they will
be consulted—Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset will be
consulted—and without Members of Parliament being able to have

jobs will be generated by the proposal. Once it is built, some people
will have to maintain the wind farm, but on the whole, it will not be a

If a cable has to be run from the wind turbines to connect into the

maintain the turbines and they have to go out an extra 2 or 3 miles,

the merits or otherwise of the proposed Navitus Bay wind farm, because
any application for development consent for the proposed wind farm and

Secretary of State on whether consent should be granted or refused. The
Secretary of State will then have to consider the recommendations and

can be broken down into several stages. The first stage is
pre-application—the stage that the Navitus Bay proposal has
reached—and is when an applicant has notified the Planning

consultation on the proposal in question, the results of which will
feed into its thinking on the configuration of the project before the
application is submitted.</hs_Para>

stage is pre-examination, in which an examining authority—an
individual or a panel of examiners—will be appointed by the
Planning Inspectorate. Members of the public and other interested
parties can register with the Planning Inspectorate and provide
summaries of their views on the proposals. I encourage all individuals
and organisations with an interest in the proposal to engage with any
public consultation when it is launched. The inspectorate will convene
a preliminary hearing at which the process for consideration of the

considered.</hs_Para>

stage is examination. The Planning Inspectorate has six months to carry
out its investigation of the application, which will be undertaken by
way of hearings, and to consider any written representations submitted
to it. During that process, the examining authority will give
consideration to all important and relevant matters that are brought to
its attention. The examining authority will also consider any relevant
national policy statements that set the policy framework for
determining applications for nationally significant infrastructure
projects, which were themselves subject to public consultation and
scrutiny in the House.</hs_Para>

Doughty:</Member></B> Although I appreciate the courtesy that the
Minister and his officials have shown, the cases I will discuss today
raise serious concerns about the competence of senior Home Office
officials, the processes put in place and ultimately, I am sorry to
say, ministerial oversight of the immigration system. Importantly, the
cases do not merely relate to the soon-to-be-defunct United Kingdom
Border Agency, but to the new immigration and visas directorate under
Home Office control. I have come across numerous cases where documents,
such as passports, birth certificates and travel documents, have been
misplaced or permanently lost, which has led to lengthy delays,
erroneous decisions, expensive appeals, tribunals and compensation
payouts and a great deal of personal anguish for constituents, with
results ranging from being unable to attend funerals of family members
and being wrongly stigmatised as illegal immigrants, to being denied
work, social security and the normal family life to which they are
entitled. There is disturbing evidence that documents are not being
opened or included in a person’s case, and wrong decisions may
be made as a
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000215">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:38:48"></hs_TimeCode>

would like to highlight some specific areas of concern with clear
examples to which I hope the Minister can respond. I have encountered a
number of cases in which the Home Office has wrongly advised
constituents that their documents have been lost, only to locate them
subsequently on the premises, sometimes years after denying their
presence. Constituents have advised me that in addition to spending
time and energy pursuing these matters, they have been unable to enrol
in university, accept job offers, travel for work or even manage daily
affairs as a result of the loss.</hs_Para>

that crops up frequently in such cases is that the documents were
“with another team”. That was the experience of one of my
constituents who submitted his passport and biometric residence card to
support his children’s application for naturalisation. The Home
Office website advises EEA nationals that they can expect to receive
their documents within 10 working days. In order to ensure a
speedy return, my constituent had taken the liberty of enclosing a
self-addressed envelope affixed with a paid special delivery stamp and
a covering letter requesting that the documents be returned promptly,
as he is frequently required to travel overseas for business.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111959000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000219">The Royal
Mail tracking system confirmed that the parcel was received, but when
my constituent contacted the Home Office, he was informed by an
official that the package did not contain his passport and biometric
card. That information later turned out to be untrue. I am pleased to
say that eventually the documents were located and returned to my
constituent, but unfortunately he was extremely frustrated by the
incompetence that he had experienced and missed a business trip as a
result of the misplacing of his passport and
documents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000220">In
another case, the Home Office advised me initially that it had returned
my constituent’s documents 12 months ago, only to
apologise eventually and confirm that it had in fact retained his
documents following a failed application. In other cases, documents
have been located years later in files archived in error. I have been
told by a reputable organisation of a case involving a family granted
settlement earlier this year who received their biometric residence
permits but whose passports were not returned. They phoned the Home
Office and submitted the return of documents form by e-mail. The Home
Office advised that it had returned the documents but could not find
the recorded delivery reference number. The family contacted their MP
to try to find out what had happened. After repeated phone calls from
May 2013 onwards, in which the MP’s office was also
advised  
<?notus-xml column=322?>that records stated that the passports had been returned, the Home
Office eventually agreed to recall the family’s paper file,
which had been sent to storage. Lo and behold, the passports were found
and returned to the family, but not until August
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000221">Such
cases cause frustration and serious short-term consequences, but in
other cases, recovery has not been possible, with much more
serious implications. Asylum seekers and refugees are required to send
their documentation, often including passports from their home country,
birth certificates and education qualifications, to the Home Office as
part of their asylum claim. Such documents are almost impossible to
replace, particularly given the circumstances in which individuals have
fled their original country. There is concern that where such crucial
evidence is lost, erroneous decisions in either direction may be made.
The Welsh Refugee Council has advised me of several cases in which
asylum seekers’ files have been lost prior to the refusal of
their application. That then affects their ability to return home
voluntarily or even by forced removal, as many countries refuse to
accept individuals without documentation who claim to be nationals of
that country, leaving them in
limbo.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000222">In
another case that was brought to my attention, an asylum seeker was
advised that his passport would be retained following the refusal of
his application in 2001. The individual appealed against the refusal of
asylum and, after a series of mishaps and appeals, was finally granted
indefinite leave under the legacy programme in 2011. However, although
he provided the Home Office with a copy of its own letter confirming
that it had retained his passport, it continued to deny any record of
holding it. After the intervention of his MP, the Home Office finally
admitted that it had lost his passport in 2012. Given the serious
circumstances in which such individuals flee their home countries, what
confidence does the Minister have in the system, which is supposed to
support and protect some of the most vulnerable people in the
world?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000223">I
am sorry to say that the situation for many other non-asylum applicants
is no better. In one particularly serious case with which the Minister
is familiar, the former UK Border Agency returned the documents of my
constituents Mr Conde and Ms Mane to their former address, rather than
to their solicitors as they had requested. It was then impossible for
them to retrieve their documents, as they had no access to the address.
As a result, Mr Conde was unable to see his sister before she passed

funeral.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111959000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/halltext/131119h0002.htm#13111959000224">In
another case, despite the fact that my constituent, Ms Chekera,
informed the UKBA of a change of address and received a written
acknowledgement, her details were not updated on the system and letters
requesting that she enrol her biometric data were therefore delivered
to the wrong address. The UKBA subsequently voided her application
because she had supposedly not provided the information and returned
her supporting documents to her old address. Because she was aware of
the delays in processing applications, she did not contact the UKBA to
ask for an update on her application until some months after the
initial mistake. She was then devastated to discover that unbeknownst
to her, she had been living and working in the UK illegally for several
months, with potentially serious ramification for both her and her
employer.</hs_Para>

another case brought to my attention by a Member of this House, the
Home Office lost an individual’s identity documents, meaning

remained unemployed despite wanting to work and faced a prolonged risk

which the loss of documents has prevented settled individuals from
demonstrating their right to social security. In one case, the Home

are the immediate human consequences of incompetence. I hope that the
Minister will issue an apology to all of them on the
Government’s behalf. I would also like to challenge him on a
number of other points. First, with regard to compensation for
individuals when there has been a mistake, claims for redress should be
considered in accordance with the “Managing Public Money”
standards guidance issued by the Treasury, which emphasises that
Departments should attempt to return the individual to the position
that they would have been in had there been no maladministration on the
Government’s part. More often than not, that is simply not the
case. Many are left significantly out of pocket as a direct result of
incompetence or mistakes.</hs_Para>

documents lost in many of the cases that I encountered are
irreplaceable, where it is possible to source a replacement, applicants
face the challenge of arranging and financing the replacement of their
documents up front and then submitting claims and supporting evidence
to request reimbursement. I find it extraordinary that according to a
recent parliamentary answer, the Home Office does not readily hold data
about the total compensation paid as a result of losing passports and
other travel documents. I can assure the Minister that it is an
expensive pursuit. As he is aware, the constituents that I mentioned
earlier, Mr Conde and Ms Mane, have spent well over £1,500 to
date on arranging replacement documents, but they have yet to be
reimbursed a single penny. Other constituents are in a similar
position. Does the Minister think that it is reasonable to expect
people to resort to taking out loans or enduring financial hardship to
finance the cost of replacing documents that the Home Office has lost,
then to spend months trying to reclaim the money, while never being
sure that they will regain the full amount?</hs_Para>

issue is how documents are sent through Royal Mail. When documents have
gone missing in transit and the Home Office is not responsible for the
loss, it usually advises the applicant to pursue the matter with Royal
Mail directly. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to
retrieve the documents, so the applicant is tasked with claiming
compensation from Royal Mail.</hs_Para>

£500. However, it has come to my attention that the Home Office
often returns people’s documents to them by recorded delivery
rather than special delivery. Recorded delivery includes compensation
cover only up to a maximum of £50, meaning that when documents
are lost due to an error by Royal Mail—not by the Home Office in
these cases, I concede—the maximum amount of compensation that
the applicant can receive is £50, regardless of the cost of
replacing the documents. That is a drop in the ocean compared with the
total expense incurred. Is the Minister aware of any plans, or does he

examples raise serious questions about whether the Home Office is
acting in accordance with data protection legislation. In one
particularly serious case, I have had to raise the matter with the

returned, but along with them was the original birth certificate of an

conversations we have had that it does its best to support his office,
as it supports other hon. Members. We have been trying to put a great

does not mean that there are no issues, but in terms of the ability for
MPs to get swift answers on operational matters and to resolve issues,
both the director general, Sarah Rapson, whom the hon. Gentleman

an MP account manager is pressing for information or action, they are
acting on my behalf and that of the director general to resolve the

Gentleman’s mentioning the time taken to make decisions and how

cases took to decide. Some cases were a result of the backlog of
lengthy decision making in asylum cases. Clearly, if somebody’s

Chamber—that in the 2012-13 financial year what was the UK
Border Agency in its in-country operations, which are those within the
United Kingdom, where a lot of these issues stem from, did not do a
good job at making timely decisions and we had a backlog of cases. I am
pleased that in this financial year we have made significant progress,
although we are not all the way there, in reducing that backlog to the
extent that we have a relatively small number of weeks of cases on hand

of valuable documents—down from the year before. In about 42% of
those cases, the Home Office was partially or fully responsible. Yes,
that is 469 too many, because in an ideal world we would not lose any
documents and documents would not go astray, but that is less than
0.02% of cases, which, putting it in context, suggests that we are not
doing too bad a job. However, that can cause a great deal of annoyance

policies, but to understand the consequences of the loss of such

hon. Gentleman mentioned the postal system and correctly said that we
always send documents by recorded delivery. He made a fair point about
how Royal Mail compensation for recorded delivery compares with that
for special delivery. I will look at our strategy there, at the cost of
those two services and whether the point that he raises in
practice—it is clearly a theoretical problem—relates to
cases where that has been an issue. It would help if he told me about
specific cases, if he has not done so previously, because I could use
those examples to see whether they raise wider
issues.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:59:23"></hs_TimeCode> I am
happy to do that, because he is right. Clearly, if Royal Mail loses
valuable documents and we and his constituent have done everything
right, Royal Mail is responsible for the compensation. We must consider
whether the compensation that Royal Mail pays for the service that is
used is adequate for the task. That is a perfectly reasonable point,

understanding is that, in the case that I considered, we will pay
compensation and refund the cost of replacing the documents, including
associated costs such as travel. I accept his point that that requires
the person to deal with the situation and claim back the money, but the
flipside—he talked about managing public money—is that we
also have a responsibility to ensure that, where we compensate people,
the claim is genuine, which it is in most cases, but we have had
examples in which people claimed costs that they did not incur. That is
why we insist that people reasonably evidence the costs before we pay

Minister for Universities and Science (Mr David Willetts):</Member></B>
In the 2011 White Paper on higher education, “Students at the
Heart of the System” (Cmnd 8122), the Government announced their
intention to introduce a level playing field for regulating higher
education providers of all types. A number of reforms have since been
introduced to deliver convergence between the rules governing higher
education institutions funded by the Higher Education Funding Council
for England (HEFCE) and others, known as alternative providers (APs).
The process of applying student number controls to APs was subject to a
consultation, which was launched in November 2012 and which closed in
January
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13111943000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/wmstext/131119m0001.htm#13111943000020">The
previous Government introduced a system of recovery of payments from
HEFCE-funded providers that breached their number controls. This regime
was not applied to APs, even though students studying at APs are
eligible for maintenance grants, maintenance loans and tuition fee
loans. As the higher education sector has diversified, the number of
applications for student support at APs has increased. In addition, the
tuition fee changes implemented in 2012-13 mean students at APs may
borrow up to £6,000 a year to cover the costs of their tuition.
The number of English and EU students claiming support at APs has grown
from 13,000 in 2011-12 to 30,000 in 2012-13, and the total public
expenditure on these students has risen from £60 million to
£175 million. This is 4% of the total student support budget.
Growth has been particularly concentrated among students studying for
higher national certificates (HNCs) and the higher national diplomas
(HNDs).</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13111943000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/wmstext/131119m0001.htm#13111943000021">The
Government announced in March 2013 that they would introduce number
controls for 2014-15 academic year based on institutions’
2012-13 entry data. Alternative providers were asked to submit data to
HEFCE on their recruitment plans. The Department received these data on
5 November and concluded that some of these plans were unaffordable,
given the need to control public spending. We have therefore written to
the 23 APs that are expanding most rapidly to instruct them to recruit
no more students for HNCs and HNDs in the current 2013-14 academic
year. Degree-level courses are unaffected by these
changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13111943000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/wmstext/131119m0001.htm#13111943000022">Concurrently,
we are dealing with a different student support issue. We identified
that there had been a significant increase in the number of Bulgarian
and Romanian students applying for full student support in England this
year. This support is usually only available to EU citizens resident in
the UK for a minimum of three years. We have asked each of these
students to supply additional information to support their applications
for maintenance, before any further public funding is made available to
them or to their institutions. We have asked all EU citizens applying
for maintenance support in England to supply this additional
information.</hs_Para>

As from 21 July 2010 the HSCIC has published experimental, provisional
monthly NHS work force data (experimental tag has been removed from 24
April 2012). As expected with provisional data, some figures may be
revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and resolved. The
monthly work force data is not directly comparable with the annual work
force census; it only includes those staff on the Electronic Staff
Record (ESR) (i.e. it does not include primary care staff or bank
staff). There are also new methods of presenting data (headcount
methodology is different and there is now a role
count).</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
HSCIC seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and
invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the
organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated
to improve data quality. Where changes impact on figures already
published, this is assessed but unless it is significant at national
level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is
footnoted in relevant
analyses.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><I>Source:</I></hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">Health

of existing approaches while putting in place new actions to address

with BAE Systems (BAES) in summer 2012 about the future of the UK

how best to manage the workload gap and maintain key shipbuilding

Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) in Portsmouth was among the options
considered initially. As discussions with BAES progressed, it became
evident that there would be clear business benefits in the company's
decision to consolidate its shipbuilding capabilities on the Clyde. The
key issue, therefore, became the maintenance of shipbuilding skills on
the Clyde after completion of work on the Carrier blocks. Following
analysis, the build of three OPVs was determined to be the optimum
method to maintain these skills, while delivering useful capability for
the Royal

released on licence should be effectively supervised in the community

that they may be recalled to custody if they breach any of the
