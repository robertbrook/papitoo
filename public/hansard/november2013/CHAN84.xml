were initially disappointed when the decision on the Atlantic Array was

that the

that over 80% of the people who have had a green deal assessment are

calling for the energy companies to put all those over 75 on the

evidence clearly shows that the over-75s are least likely to be on the

disturbing. I think that every Member and every party in this House is
committed to tackling this, not least because it is a problem that
every Government have faced. The solution lies in a combination of
policies—health policies, social care policies, housing policies
and energy policies. That is why our fuel poverty strategy, which we
will publish early in the new year, is a cross-Government attempt to
make sure that we are tackling the real problem. I am afraid that once
again the right hon. Lady is offering a simplistic solution, and she

that everyone is put on the lowest available

Flint:</Member></B> To be very clear, our policy is about putting all
those over 75 on to the cheapest tariff regardless of how they pay and
regardless of whether they are online, which is one of the factors
preventing them from getting the cheapest tariff. The Secretary of
State’s policy does not affect 90% of people and will still
leave those over 75 who are not online and do not pay by direct debit
paying more than other people. I remind him that in his own
constituency nearly 8,000 people over 75 would save up to £200
as a result of our policy. For those people, and for 4 million like
them around the country, why will he not make the energy companies put

week’s business. May I also take the opportunity to congratulate
colleagues who have participated in Movember this month? I applaud
their efforts and labours for an important cause, although I must admit
that I find some of them a bit disconcerting. Some of them even remind

the Government proposed some very sensible measures to toughen rules
for European Union migrants, including banning out-of-work benefits and
quadrupling fines for bosses not paying the minimum wage. Given that
Labour proposed some of these changes eight months ago, will the Leader
of the House tell us why it has taken the Government so long to
announce any action? Will he confirm that none of the
Government’s proposed changes will be in place by 1 January,
when 
<?notus-xml column=416?>work restrictions for Romanians and Bulgarians will end? Much of the
Government’s plan could be implemented using secondary
legislation. Given that we have 13 days of parliamentary time remaining
before the Christmas recess, it is clear that we could work together to
get some of these sensible changes in place. So will he agree to work
with us to get this done in time?</hs_Para>

Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill has provided yet another
lesson in how not to legislate. After ignoring our request to delay the
Bill until after the publication of the report of the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards, the Government presented this place
with a shell of a Bill, which has now grown fivefold in the other
place. That makes it a very different piece of legislation from the one
that we scrutinised in this place, and it is a disgrace that the
Government have developed a Bill of such importance in the unelected
Chamber while treating this place with contempt. Will the Leader of the

a week of spectacular U-turns, perhaps the Chancellor’s
damascene conversion on payday loans was the most surprising. After
all, the Government had voted three times against a cap. Will the
Leader of the House confirm that it was the prospect of yet another
defeat on the banking Bill that changed the Chancellor’s mind?
It seems that the Chancellor is developing a proclivity for ideological
flexibility. Perhaps it is just a public relations strategy to say one
thing and then do another. After all, he said he would stop tax evasion
but he refused to close the giant eurobond loophole. He attacked
unacceptable City bonuses and then went to Brussels to fight for them.
He promised to cut borrowing, but he has borrowed more in three years
than Labour did in 13. He said that we are all in it together, but
prices have risen faster than wages in 40 of the 41 months since he has
been Chancellor. Will the Leader of the House now give us a debate in

rhetoric and the

been participants in Movember. We shall, in some cases, regret the
passing of their facial adornments. I suspect that not many of them
will be persuaded to keep them on a permanent basis, but it is all in
an important cause. I am sure that, across the House, we feel very
strongly about the importance of supporting them in their endeavours to
promote research into prostate and testicular cancers. We have made
considerable progress, but there is much more to be done. I know that
prostate cancer is the most common cancer affecting men and if we can
secure investment in research and treatment such as that characterised
by successful breast cancer campaigns, men—and, I suspect,
women—in this country and beyond will attach considerable
importance to
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0001.htm#13112853000281">The

Secretary answer her questions yesterday in the course of a
rather comprehensive statement of what the Government are doing.
Considering that that statement was the answer to an urgent question

The Home Secretary made it very clear that we will put a bar on
migrants claiming out-of-work benefits for the first three months, stop
welfare payments after six months unless a claimant has a genuine
chance of a job, stop migrant jobseekers claiming housing benefit to
subsidise accommodation costs, and introduce further measures on the

announced that the House would consider Lords amendments to the

that ring-fenced everyday banking from investment banking, ensuring
that banks are never again too big to fail. It reformed the failed
tripartite system that we inherited from the Opposition. It is
staggering that they are now trying to engage in procedural politics on
the Bill. We, as a Government, are having to put in place a banking

not to be completed during this Session and so we used a mechanism
whereby the second report was reflected in measures incorporated 
<?notus-xml column=418?>into the Bill in the House of Lords. That is perfectly reasonable and as

the rhetoric of the Labour party and the reality of Labour in office.
Yesterday, Labour tried to talk about the economic policy of this
Government but throughout the debate Labour Members failed to recognise
or acknowledge the mistakes their party had made. The facts are simple
and straightforward; for example, under a Labour Government there was a
7.2% reduction in the GDP of this country during the deepest recession
we have seen in the past 100 years, which led to unprecedented deficits
in this country. That was the consequence of a Labour Government. As
for the rhetoric and reality of the Chancellor’s policies, I
look forward to hearing him make the autumn statement next Thursday and
set out how this coalition Government are making tremendous
progress—not least by assisting people in this country through
more jobs, reduced taxation, controls on fuel duties, a council tax
freeze available to councils through the whole of this Parliament, and
the largest increases in the state pension we have ever seen—in
helping families with the cost of living, which the Opposition would
signally have been unable to do had they continued to borrow and spend
in the way that they did in the past. It has always been the same old
Labour: spend, borrow and see the economy of this country

quite often note the difference in prices as I go around the country.
Of course, that is happening for a simple reason—there are
different markets in different parts of the country. So I have noticed
in the past that if one is buying petrol in the Wirral close to where
it is refined it might be a little cheaper than in Cambridgeshire. But
the truth is that, wherever people are buying petrol or diesel, they
are buying it 13p a litre cheaper than would have been the case if the
fuel duty escalator introduced by the Labour party was still in place.

are long-term unemployed, the benefits of the Work programme, the
better it is. We have record numbers of vacancies. While we have seen a
modest reduction in the number of long-term unemployed, we want that
number to come down further, and the Work programme has been
increasingly successful in achieving that. According to industry
figures, 383,000 people have started work, and we have reached the
point where 168,000 have found lasting work for more than six months.
That represents tremendous progress so far, but we want to achieve
more.</hs_Para>

administered independently and fairly, and relationships with Ministers

new global efforts to give aid and justice to survivors, and for the

of a new international protocol on the investigation and documentation
of sexual violence in conflict that we have proposed. Those are

position of the UK Government on the issue he raises is that safe
abortion reduces recourse to unsafe abortion and thus saves lives,

adolescent girls, however, must have the right to make their own
decisions about their sexual and reproductive health and well-being.
The July practice paper from the Department for International
Development clearly outlines the UK policy position on safe and unsafe
abortion in developing countries. There are, of course, some countries
holding back on this issue, but we will continue to encourage them to

There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T12:06:12"></hs_TimeCode> are

publicity about one particular case this week. The Foreign Office has
apologised unreservedly for what happened, and, having looked into the
case, I am satisfied that it is not representative of the normal work
of the consular service, including its work in Cairo, where the
incident took place. Our consular staff have been dealing with an
average of five rapes and up to 25 sexual assaults a year, and the

been just a handful of convictions in Bosnia following the many
thousands of rape cases. In any of the conflicts in recent times, only
a tiny percentage of rape cases have resulted in a

Secretary of State for International Development (Justine
Greening):</Member></B> With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to
update the House on the United Kingdom’s response to Typhoon
Haiyan. Three weeks after Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the
Philippines, its full effect is becoming clear. The impact has been
devastating. As of today, the UN reports that more than 14 million
people have been affected, with 3.5 million displaced. The official
death toll stands at 5,500.</hs_Para>

visited the Philippines last weekend. The devastation the typhoon has
wreaked was clearly evident as I arrived in Tacloban in a RAF C-130
that was carrying a cargo of UK supplies. Many of the outer parts of
the town have been flattened and debris from the typhoon litters the
streets, but aid is now getting through at scale. In Tacloban,
clearance work is well under way and reconstruction efforts were
evident throughout the town, with small businesses getting going again
and activity on the streets. The Philippines Health Secretary told me
that 90% of health facilities in the affected areas are now
operational, although many had suffered damage, but there is still huge
need, particularly in the outlying islands and more remote areas. I
heard from non-governmental organisations that only 20% to 30% of those
people in need of shelter kits had so far received
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000432" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000432">Through
our rapid response facility, the UK was one of the first donors to get
relief to the worst-affected areas. The UK has so far committed more
than £50 million of support, which is helping to get
shelter, clean water and emergency supplies to up to 800,000 people.
Our logistical support has helped to transform the relief effort.
Aircraft handling equipment provided by the UK to unload
supplies from planes has doubled the airport capacity at Cebu. The UK
has also extended the reach of our overall humanitarian response
through the deployment of the Royal Air Force, HMS Daring and now HMS
Illustrious. That military support has been crucial in delivering
relief to more remote islands, including the provision of emergency
medical assistance through the UK international emergency trauma team.
I pay tribute to the outstanding servicemen and women of the RAF and
Royal Navy for their tireless efforts to help those hit by Typhoon

seeking to rebuild their homes, lives and businesses. I will be
travelling to the area this weekend. The situation on the ground
remains desperate, but it is now clear that this was one of the
strongest typhoons ever to make landfall and that many of the
communities closest to the shore were ill-equipped and too poorly
constructed to deal with the brute force of the barrage. Typhoon Haiyan
has obliterated whole towns, destroyed communities and shattered lives.
Although many will rightly ask questions about climate change, this is
also a story about poverty. The poorest and most vulnerable were hit
hardest, the worst quality homes were those most likely to collapse,
and families living in some of the 
<?notus-xml column=443?>poorest provinces in the Philippines are now left with no homes, no
assets and no savings to fall back on. I would also like to join in the

not and never will be a nation that looks the other way. The Disasters

Let us think about that. It is £1 for every person in
our country, or an astonishing average of more than £3 million

As a former Secretary of State, I have always held the view that the
political relationship between the two Front Benches is largely set
from the Government Dispatch Box. I hope that I am not going to have to

Government to ensure that all donations that arrive in the country are
of use in that country? The previous Government published plans to
ensure that 10% of all disaster relief was directed towards work

Secretary of State made of the Philippines’ capacity to return
to growth in the coming years and of the impact of this disaster on the
regional economy? I want to conclude on climate change. It is neither
wise nor accurate to attribute any specific weather event to climate
change, but we do know that climate change is real. Due to the nature
of what we are discussing today, I shall make this observation gently:
there are worrying noises from parts 
<?notus-xml column=444?>of the Government regarding renewed scepticism about taking action on
climate change. Will the Secretary of State put it on record that she

particularly prone to natural disasters. The challenge they faced was
simply the scale of the typhoon, which was possibly the largest ever to

focus on Tacloban, but less focus on the area to the west of Tacloban.
A lot of work is under way. I flagged up the issue of shelter because
it is one of the main things on which we are working with the UN. We
have sent significant numbers of shelter kits and six flights will be

Home Office on trafficking. It is a key area with an international
aspect in which we can up our game as part of the solution. We were
concerned by what we came across in the Philippines. One fact that has
been less discussed is the significant displacement of people. Many of
them turn up in Manila and although they might perhaps get initial
support for the first few days they are there, it is easy for them to
become lost after that. They are at serious risk, particularly women,
girls and children, of becoming involved in all sorts of situations,
including trafficking, over the coming weeks and months. That was why I
issued my call to action a couple of weeks ago to raise international
awareness of the issue, at an event attended by the former Foreign
Secretary, David Miliband. On the practical side of things, I sent over

Philippines it hit—the middle third of the country—have
made it incredibly challenging to get to all the communities people
have wanted to reach. I know that when the UN first arrived at Tacloban
airport immediately after the storm had hit, it was initially
impossible even to get into Tacloban, just 10 km down the road, because
of the debris. Even on the mainland, reaching people was challenging.
One reason we have sent our Royal Navy vessels is to reach such
communities and the Illustrious significantly steps up the capacity
beyond that which the Daring was able to provide to reach more of those
islands. As the hon. Gentleman sets out, it is a continued challenge to

humanitarian or disaster response. For example, this was the first time
we had used our NHS emergency trauma list of NHS professionals, so we
will absolutely ensure that we learn the lessons. One reason we sent
the loaders and rubble and debris clearing equipment was that we found
that planes could land in the nearby airport, whether that was Cebu or
Tacloban, but there were then two problems. Either they could get
supplies off the plane but not down roads as they were not clear, or
the supplies were so huge that there was no equipment to get them off
the planes as that had been damaged by the typhoon. My Department
sourced from the Netherlands a massive piece of equipment that could
clear the biggest loads off planes. We got it from the Netherlands to
Tacloban and Cebu airports to double the capacity of what we could
offload from planes. The hon. Lady is absolutely right: this was a big

from the Minister for Europe and the Foreign Secretary regarding a
collective red card with a threshold. We believe that if the principle
of veto is to be accepted, because it does not apply in the national
interest, that should be a unilateral decision taken by an individual
Parliament. The 1972 Act is based on the White Paper of 1971. That
document, which created all the consequences that flowed from the Act,
specifically stated that the veto must be retained in the national
interest, not only for the sake of the individual nation
states—the United Kingdom, in particular—but because to
do otherwise would endanger the very fabric of the Community. It
recognised that imposing a compression chamber on the whole of the
European Union would lead to the kinds of problems that have recently

It does not follow that anyone has a complete monopoly of wisdom in
relation to these issues; what matters is that we have a proper and
informed debate based on central principles. The principle of the
supremacy of 
<?notus-xml column=457?>this Parliament is so fundamental that there cannot be any dispute about
it. A central element of that principle and of our decision making is
that the United Kingdom electorate should not have imposed on them

countries. We are good at complaining about it but we are not engaging
upstream in implementing this legislation or even preventing some of
it. Will he expand on his proposed so-called European document debate

they had people who really knew and understood the context in which
these matters were being debated. They were not just shoved on them by
the Whips at short notice to sit there writing correspondence, or
whatever; they took an enormously coherent interest in those matters.
The idea of having permanent Chairs and permanent members of the
Committee, in parallel with the arrangements for specialist MP
rapporteurs—or reporters, as we call them—to serve on the
departmental Select Committees, is to create an integrated approach so
that the whole House is properly informed at every policy level and can

analysis of all the scrutiny systems of all 28 member states in

introduced the micro moratorium on new legislation for three years. It

The Department has changed employment legislation so that, when there
is a problem and there needs to be a parting of the ways between
employers and employee, the situation is now much easier and effective
for both sides. The Department has also sensibly challenged health and
safety. A non-high-risk business now has to be shown to have been
negligent, rather than face a strict liability test, before it can be
taken to court. The burdensome reporting and assessment that used to

represent a constituency that has one of the largest problems of family
poverty and long-term unemployment in this country, but it also has
some rapidly expanding SMEs. I have been in contact this week with
Gaia-Wind, which is the fastest growing private company in Scotland and
the eighth fastest growing SME anywhere in the UK, to hear its exciting
plans for expansion. It also, however, shows us some of the particular
needs of participants in the green economy and the problems that they
face.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000576" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000576">There
is a lack of investment in our economy. We discovered yesterday that
investment by businesses has been largely flat over the past year. In
fact, business investment contributed only 0.1 percentage points to the
0.8% of GDP growth in the third quarter. We also know that access to
finance is a huge problem for the SME sector. Although the small
regional banks in 
<?notus-xml column=464?>Germany, the Sparkassen, were able to keep lending to support SMEs
during the recession, lending by institutions in this country, such as
the Royal Bank of Scotland, shamefully fell to spectacularly low
levels, which had a huge and disproportionate impact on the SME
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:40:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000577" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000577">In

business makes to our local economies and the national economy. We will
celebrate the fact that there are 4.9 million businesses in this

need to take firm action on business rates, the need to expand the
range of financial institutions that are able to lend to SMEs, and the

Bain:</Member></B> I certainly will not celebrate the three years in
which we have had very little growth, which had a huge impact on SMEs.
With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I want to speak about the positive
issues on which we might find more cross-party agreement in this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:41:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000580" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000580">I
refer hon. Members to the excellent report that Santander and Dods
published recently in the House. It contains key recommendations that
the Government should attend to quickly. It shows that 285 separate
schemes are available to SMEs which, in the view of the report’s
writers, is far too many. It sets out the good recommendation, which
the Government could implement straight away, of developing a single
portal through which SMEs can have contact with central Government. The
report found that only 29% of SMEs were aware of the existence of the
funding for lending scheme and that 28% of businesses thought that
access to finance would be the biggest impediment to growth in the next
few
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000581" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000581">Shockingly,
the report revealed that only 12% of students in our colleges and
universities would make working for an SME their first choice on
graduation. That is a real concern, given that the vast majority of job
creation in the coming years is likely to come from the SME sector, and
it shows that there is much more that the Government, SMEs, colleges,
universities and schools need to do to promote founding and working in
small businesses as good career
paths.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000582" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000582">As
a country, we need to do far more work on skills. Only yesterday, the
Minister illustrated in a written answer to me the growing gap in early
rates of pay between those who have level 4 skills and those without
any qualifications at all. That hourly pay gap of
£8.84 has widened by a tenth in the past six years
alone. SMEs, the Government and local authorities need to do a huge
amount to improve in-work training so that people can see wage
progression in a job, and so that a job in a small or medium-sized
enterprise can become a career with long-term
prospects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000583" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000583">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:44:28"></hs_TimeCode>
need to improve the shockingly low rates of research and development in
this country. In public and private sector research and development, we
lag way behind our main competitors in the EU and many of the emerging
markets. The Government must do much 
<?notus-xml column=465?>more to boost the innovation that comes from the many millions of small
businesses throughout the country, such
as<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:44:39"></hs_TimeCode> Gaia-Wind in

a matter of urgency, we need to improve access to capital. When I speak
to SMEs in my constituency, they make it clear that they are willing
and able to take on more staff, and that they want to create more
demand across our country. However, the banking system is simply not
working for SMEs. We need new players to come into the banking system
and regional banks that focus on the needs of the economies in
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the different regions of
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:45:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000585" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000585"><Member ContinuationText="Huw Irranca-Davies" PimsId="1124" UID="13112853001044" xid="662" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853001044"><B>Huw
Irranca-Davies</B> (Ogmore) (Lab):</Member> Does my hon. Friend agree

Bain:</Member></B> My hon. Friend raises the important point that we
need a culture of long-term investment, as has happened over the past
few decades in Germany, where there has been strong support for SMEs
from the Government and the financial institutions. We need to see more
of that in this country and it would be best delivered through a system
of regional banks that provide support to business on a dedicated,
local
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:46:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000587" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000587">Finally,
in this most significant of weeks for Scotland, I must say that it is
critical that the SME community speaks out on the question of
Scotland’s continued membership of the United Kingdom. It would
be disastrous for Scotland’s trade with the rest of the UK and
disastrous for exporters if Scotland were forced out of the United
Kingdom. It is important that all of us in the House encourage business
to speak out on the need to keep the Union
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000588" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000588">I

the Minister for Skills and Enterprise. We must encourage small and

also encourage constituency businesses to use the mystery shopper
scheme that the Cabinet Office has introduced, which will help to solve
the problem raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton Abbot. When
small businesses that seek simply to get on and do business encounter
poor practice or communication from the public sector, they need a way
to solve the problem. The mystery shopper scheme does exactly that, and
also gives us a chance to do more to encourage public
authorities—whether local government, health, police or fire
services, or any similar service—to do more to make their
procurement SME-friendly.</hs_Para>

can encounter many problems such as the prevalence of pre-qualification
questionnaires and late payment. A care company in my constituency
deals with customers who are particularly vulnerable, and tragic havoc

that.</hs_Para>

motion refers to red tape, but again there is no way to solve that
problem except through a methodical approach. I applaud the opening
provided by the mystery shopper service to which I referred as it
allows us to be methodical by making a list of things that have gone
wrong and solving them one by one. That is the only approach that will
work for regulatory problems. We must hear from small firms that
regulations have served ill, and then we can go about solving the
problems. I always say as a constituency MP that I cannot attempt to
help a constituent to solve something if I do not know the detail of
what the problem
is.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112853000600" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112853000600">Like
many others, I am sure, I encourage firms to use the red tape challenge
that the Government have rightly set up, and I welcome the results of
the initiative so far. To date, more than 3,500 regulations have been
identified for reform, saving businesses more than £215 million
per year. That is worth doing, and I am sure that the Minister will
update the House about how we can extend that approach to European
regulatory burdens. On behalf of my constituency businesses, I care
very much about that issue.</hs_Para>

remaining two minutes available, I will conclude by talking about
recruitment, which is crucial for small and medium-sized firms. Of
course we all want such businesses to become larger firms, if that is
their ambition, but to do so they need great people to become their
employees. I run a large campaign in my constituency called Norwich for
Jobs, which does what it says on the tin. It seeks to create more jobs
in Norwich, especially for those aged 18 to 24, and we aim to halve
youth unemployment in Norwich in two years. I am pleased that local
firms have responded to the call and that more than 800 jobs and
apprenticeships have been pledged to the campaign. Although the
campaign has been going for only 10 months, 400 young people have been
helped into work so far. I want to ensure that small firms have pride
of place in that campaign. I will soon run an event with the Federation
of Small Businesses and a sister campaign called Swarm. We will
consider how to encourage small businesses into such operations, and
help them to find the talent they need among local young people. That
not only helps the community and young people, but places small
businesses in control of their recruitment.</hs_Para>

£2,000 reduction in national insurance that is coming forward in
the shape of the enterprise allowance, which will be important for
cutting small firms’ jobs tax from Easter next year. I also note
the success of start-up loans. So far there have been about 30 of them

Abrahams</B> (Oldham East and Saddleworth) (Lab):</Member> It is a
pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Norwich North (Chloe Smith) and
to co-sponsor this debate, and I congratulate the hon. Member for
Newton Abbot (Anne Marie Morris) on securing it. I am pleased to speak
in this debate, which considers how we can overcome the issues facing
small businesses. Small businesses, which in my definition are those
with fewer than 50 employees, are the powerhouse of the economy. They
contribute 46% of the UK’s income in the private sector—a
massive £l,558 billion—and constitute more 
<?notus-xml column=468?>than 99% of all businesses. Ultimately, a sustained recovery
will be built on their backs, as has been said, and that must be
recognised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112860000004">A
whole range of different factors affect the success and even the
viability of small businesses, including access to finance, the high
costs of business rates and energy bills, but I will focus my remarks
specifically on late payments. Hon. Members may know that for the past
two and a half years I have run a campaign on late payments. It started
as a small, local issue after a haulier came to one of my surgeries and
said that he was going to go out of business because of late payments.
The average term he was being given was 30 days, but he was often not
being paid for 90 days. That is a common story that I wanted to look
into in more detail.</hs_Para>

discover the scale of the problem and it was striking that so few
businesses would come forward and describe what they were experiencing.
That was until one brave local couple, who started a plumbing business
35 years ago, came to me and said that their business was going
under—as indeed it did with debts of more than £150,000
due specifically to late
payment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112860000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Pawsey" PimsId="5620" UID="13112860000427" xid="1139" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112860000427">Mark
Pawsey:</Member></B> Is the hon. Lady confusing late payments with
customers who refuse or do not have the means to pay? Those are totally
separate issues and if a business wants to avoid the problem of late
payment, it can refuse to supply goods to the customer until the
account has been paid.</hs_Para>

bit of background to this case. As I said, the story of Ann and Harry
Long is far from unique and is a particular problem for small and
micro-businesses that do not have the cash-flow buffers of larger
companies. I have a particularly a high level of micro-companies in my
constituency—more than 85% of companies have fewer than 10
employees—and a number have gone into administration, primarily
as a result of late
payments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112860000009">Nationally,
we know from Bacs that more than £31 billion is owed to
small businesses, and more than half—58%—of the
country’s 1.7 million SMEs say that large companies choose when
they pay. In 2011, only £24 billion was owed, so the problem is
increasing. If we compare what is owed in late payments to the amounts
being lent by high street banks, which last year was £56
billion, we sense the scale of the problem.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112860000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0002.htm#13112860000010">According to
Bacs data, the average SME is owed £31,000 at any one time and
waits an average of eight working weeks for payment, which is nearly
double the contract terms. I am particularly concerned about the gaping
north-south divide. Small businesses in the north say that they are
owed an average of £39,000, which is almost double the
£23,000 owed to the average southern
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000011">The
2012 small business survey reported that 55% of SMEs, 53% of small
businesses and 46% of micro-businesses say that large companies are not
paying their bills on time. The most recent Federation of Small
Businesses survey suggests an even worse picture. Seventy-three per
cent. of businesses say that they were paid late 
<?notus-xml column=469?>in the past 12 months, and one in five say that half
of all invoices are paid late. Interestingly, 70% say that the problem
has got worse in the past 12 months and that the private sector is the
biggest
culprit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000012">Research
by the Forum of Private Business last year indicated that late payment
is having a significant impact on businesses development, productivity
and growth. Access to, and the cost of, finance, and credit trade
insurance, were cited as problems linked to late payment. Late payments
have a knock-on effect, leaving many small businesses in a vicious
cycle of late payment. The FPB’s economy watch panel indicates
that 42% of SMEs believe that late payments were not seen as
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000013">As
we have heard, the impact of late payment can be disastrous. It is
estimated that, during the 2008 recession, 4,000 businesses failed as a
direct result of late payments. No official data have been collected,
but the situation needs to be monitored. There is growing evidence that
late payments to SMEs are hurting our economic recovery. Office for
National Statistics data show that SMEs make up to 98% of the total
number of organisations, providing 59% of all private sector jobs and
45% of all employment, and generating 46% of the UK’s
income.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000014">What
is being done to tackle the problem of late payments? The previous
Government introduced the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest)
Act 1998, but it was not used, because companies feared being
blacklisted. The prompt payment code, a tool introduced by the
Institute of Credit Management, committed signatories to pay suppliers
on time under the terms agreed without attempting to change payment
terms retrospectively, enabling every level of the supply chain to meet
the terms. However, the code has had mixed effects. First, there is a
very poor take-up by FTSE 100

are abusing the prompt payment code. They are either signing up and
changing their terms, or changing their terms prior to signing. Most
recently, the EU late payment directive stipulated that public
authority-to-business invoices must be paid in 30 days, and that
business-to-business invoices should be paid in 60 days. However, there
have been problems with the transposition into UK law. Section 7 of the
directive has not been taken up and independent organisations will be

be looked at very differently. In London, businesses are treated
unfairly and we want fair taxation. The turnover of many small
independent shops in my constituency is not as high as one might expect
in London, so they are penalised by the high business rates in London.
They also question what they get in return for business rates. That
could be clearer—police, fire or other services. All they know
is that the £27 billion raised from business rates is spread
across the country. I favour a localised approach, so that we

schools. Secondly, we have already discussed business rates and I will
be talking to the Prime Minister about that next week. Thirdly,
returning to women and enterprise, if women were setting up businesses
at the same rate as women in the US, we would have 600,000 more
businesses. That would add £42 billion to the economy—a
huge amount. I run workshops in my constituency, with the support of
StartUp Britain and the chamber of commerce, to encourage women to

me tell hon. Members about one of my constituents. Ian lives on the
Falinge estate in Rochdale, which has achieved notoriety for having the
highest number of benefit claimants in the country. Like others there,
Ian was unemployed. He was determined to get out of that situation, so
he decided to start his own business. He cashed in his pension and set
up his own fish and chip shop. He learned the ropes by working for free
in another nearby chippy and then set up his own shop in the town
centre. I used to pop in and have a chat with him every now and again.
He was making a good fist of it and there were always plenty of
customers coming through the door. In his first year, he won an award
at the town’s annual business awards. Despite all that success,
Ian was forced recently to close his shop simply— I do
not exaggerate—because of business rates. He was paying double
in business rates what he was paying in rent, and that was not
sustainable.</hs_Para>

case is a tragedy for him and for social mobility. It demonstrates that
unrealistic business rates are damaging our economy and our society.
The Government need to do more on business rates and should have gone
ahead with the revaluation. Hon. Members will not be surprised to hear
that I support the Labour leader’s proposals to freeze and then
reduce business rates for smaller businesses in particular. Business
rates are not the only issue, however. Let me provide another example:
banking.</hs_Para>

Springs, a very successful family business in my constituency, was in
2009 dragged by RBS into what we now know to be the Global
Restructuring Group scandal. Let me briefly explain. RBS in my opinion
deliberately undervalued a property it had a loan against and used that
as an opportunity to push Hanson Springs into its Global Restructuring
Group. At the first meeting with GRG, Hanson Springs was introduced to
a solicitor who had been brought along to discuss taking an equity
stake in this family business. GRG then forced a business review with
Zolfo Cooper on to it at a cost of £20,000. Its GRG
manager had previously worked for Zolfo Cooper—I am sure that
was a coincidence. Hanson Springs was then given three options, none of
which was acceptable. As the family pointed out to me, if the business
had not been cash-flow rich and if they had not had the personal
resolve, the company would have been forced to close.</hs_Para>

Springs is now 50 years old—we have moved on four years. It
turns over £20 million each year, employs 180 people,
exports 85% of what it produces, and since the problems with RBS, has
paid in excess of £l million in corporation tax. If RBS had had
its way, we would have lost hundreds of jobs and the money from
taxation, and we would have had people claiming benefits and yet more
manufacturing moving abroad. Hanson Springs is a perfect example of
business at its best. It is a great example of a family pulling
together to create something great and is probably a perfect example of
social mobility, but look how it nearly all went badly wrong because of
RBS’s behaviour. Ultimately, it is down to us politicians to
intervene and set up the right regulatory process to ensure that banks
treat our businesses
better.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000047">Smaller

went in the opposite direction, as I will make clear in a minute. We

want to suggest something that I first proposed long before I became a
Member of this House: the abolition of business rates for neighbourhood
community and village shops, post offices, community stores, pubs and
things like that. The way to make that fiscally neutral, which the
Treasury would require, would be to put a charge on out-of-town car
parks. That is exactly what the Labour Government proposed in 1997-98,
before they were clobbered by the Tescos of this world, which in those
days had the sort of power over the Labour Government that the trade
unions today have over Her Majesty’s Opposition.</hs_Para>

speaking, business rates are assessed under two headings: the net
internal area or the gross internal area. The NIA is used for small and
medium-sized shops and businesses in town centres and neighbourhood
communities, while the GIA is used for industrial properties, such as
warehouses, factories and distribution centres, but now also
supermarkets and large stores, mostly out of town. In that respect, the
same principle should apply to the treatment of supermarkets as applies
to neighbourhood
stores<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:24:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000053">What
makes it even worse, as I am advised, is that the valuation office
instructs surveyors when evaluating rates not to make an addition for
customer car parking. The average rateable value for small and
medium-sized shops in Colchester town centre is about £225 per
square metre, whereas the average rateable value for supermarkets and
other large out-of-town store premises is about £40 per square
metre, so we are nowhere near a level playing field. The NIA system is
assessed, in part, on benefits—shop windows, for example. To
make it fair, supermarkets should be assessed on their benefits, which
include free customer car parking and the other bits and pieces that go
with it.</hs_Para>

two systems are obviously extremely unfair and biased against
shopkeepers in town centres, neighbourhood communities and villages. I
am grateful to Mr Ian Berry, a retired gentleman with an
interest in the unfairness of rating values for small businesses. On
behalf of him and just about every small shopkeeper in the country, I
wish to put the following questions to the Government. Is it fair that
shops in Colchester and other town centres have a rateable value five
and a half times that of the out-of-town giants? Is it fair that shops
with parking spaces in Colchester town centre are assessed at
£500 per parking space, when those out of town are not? I am
advised that one shop on Colchester high street is rated at £213
per square metre, whereas Amazon, which is in direct competition and
which, incidentally, pays very little corporation tax, is rated at only
£39 per square metre on its premises in Peterborough.</hs_Para>

want to begin by putting a human face on this debate. Several people
have talked about the definition of small businesses. For me, that
definition could include Worgan’s in Llanharry, a small,
family-run enterprise that started as a small gift shop selling various
things for the local community, but which extended by opening a
café in the next-door premises and then a mobile chip shop. The
definition could also include the former Sony site in Bridgend. Sony
went through a difficult time when the market for cathode ray tube
televisions completely fell apart—when flat-screen televisions
came in, those jobs quickly went abroad—but the management
retained the skilled work force and rebuilt the business on the basis
of high-end engineering and their massive expertise in design,
engineering and manufacturing. Working alongside other companies, it
has built itself back up and now has 500 employees onsite, 150 of whom
work in 28 incubation companies—small companies, built up with
the assistance of Sony expertise, working in digital media, graphics,
television and many areas, and supported as they grow from
micro-businesses into small businesses and, we hope, into the giants of
tomorrow.</hs_Para>

definition of small business could also include Ferrier’s, a
local estate agent on Commercial street, in Maesteg, where my office is
based. It was established in 1918—by coincidence, that was the
same year Labour first won the seat of Ogmore, so I hope we
will both shortly be celebrating our 100th anniversary—and it
has extended to open other outlets in Kenfig Hill and
elsewhere. There is a wide range of businesses. I think of
Cwm Tawel Yurts, a tourism enterprise in a beautiful little valley
around Betws, and of the Food Box. Then there are two brothers on the
Maesteg industrial estate who left my state comprehensive school, one
going on to study applied sciences, the other, following a different
path, management. They came back together and established a 3D
engineering company that did all the things expected from 3D
engineering, but which has also now extended into life sciences. It
applies 3D engineering to the life sciences, uses 3D modelling in the
development of things such as heart valves that grow organically within
the body and it supplies tiny parts that help the space station
run.</hs_Para>

only for more localisation of the traditional banks, but for the
regional bank model that Labour Members support. When I made the point
earlier that that model should not be bureaucratic and civil
service-driven, I was speaking from experience based not only within
this country but in other European countries. That model works best
where it is very locally focused and entrepreneurial, with managers of
the account streams fully understanding the businesses with which they
deal. Access to finance is indeed a big issue.</hs_Para>

turn my attention to one area about which I have particular knowledge
and concerns. I refer to supporting small businesses where the
potential for employment growth is the biggest—namely, through
the application of green technologies, such as solar power or
insulation for greater energy efficiency in homes, and so forth. I was
intimately involved in the incubation phase of the Energy Bill that the
Government brought forward, and I pointed out some of its potential
pitfalls. If it had succeeded, however, particularly the green deal
with the associated energy company obligation, it could have provided
massive incentives for tens of thousands of small businesses. I am
talking about all those people who have been installing loft insulation
for years and those who have switched to installing solar panels with
the feed-in tariffs. They could have had a new opportunity to take on
apprentices, perhaps young people in my area who cannot find jobs. The
green deal work could have produced a massive expansion of the
sector.</hs_Para>

had to highlight the problems, however. We noted that the finances did
not seem to work and that it might not be possible to sell the green
deal to people. Consumers are pretty intelligent people who, as they
look at it, will run a mile. We said, too, that there were rogues out
there 
<?notus-xml column=477?>who would blacken the reputation of the green deal
before it even took off and, with deep regret, I have to say that that
has now come true. The Minister put forward an aspirational target of
10,000 installations linked to the green deal. That would have provided
one of the biggest employment boosts in the small business sector right
across the country and in every single community—rural, urban or
whatever. Out of that 10,000, we now know that there have been just
over 200 installations. It does not matter how many
installations were in the plans; they have not taken place.</hs_Para>

different solutions—how best to enhance access to finance, to
reform business rates and so forth—but a proposal that would
make a material difference tomorrow, if we got it right, is dealing
with cold homes and businesses that have runaway energy costs. That
means getting energy-efficiency right and getting the energy
installations right. We are failing—miserably—and
companies are shutting their doors on the scheme. It is a tragedy. I am

would like to celebrate the success of some businesses in my own
constituency. Riley’s the Butchers is one of them. We often say
that butchers cannot succeed in the current environment when they have
to compete against supermarkets. This is a small, family-run butchers
that is beating the supermarkets at their own game with a fantastic
product and a personal bespoke service to everyone who shops there. We
also have businesses such as Parrock Lumb Cottages, which develops
local tourism, but not at the expense of our environment. Environmental
concern lies at the heart of this firm’s economic growth,
showing that economic growth and environmental concern do not
necessarily have to come at the expense of each other.
Each<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:37:33"></hs_TimeCode> of these
firms is a small business; each is unique; and each is succeeding in
the Rossendale valley, the home of enterprise. If anyone is tempted to
visit either of those businesses, I would recommend it, but not without
stopping at Love Umbrellas, which makes 
<?notus-xml column=478?>bespoke, hand-made, high-fashion umbrellas, showing
how small businesses can succeed by using social media to market their
enterprises.</hs_Para>

it rains all the time in Wales, it does in Darwen, too, where there is
business called Minerva Craft, which has moved from Blackburn market
into a large industrial unit, with both retail and internet sales based

making ties and bridal fabrics, showing that small businesses that

community in my area has grown during the last three years, and this
has been the real driver of the transformative change that we
have seen in unemployment. Rossendale and Darwen has the lowest
unemployment rate since 2010. It is half the national average, despite
it arguably being in a deprived part of east Lancashire. Our
unemployment rate has come down by 20% in the last year alone, showing
that small businesses growing and succeeding can transform the local
labour market.</hs_Para>

businesses continue to face challenges. In Rossendale and Darwen, the
biggest one relates to the skills gap. Since 2010, we have seen over
4,000 people start apprenticeships in my constituency, while we have
run two “100 in 100” campaigns this year.
Working with local business, we recruited 200 new apprentices
in 100 days. We are an area predominately concerned with manufacturing,
so many of these apprenticeships were highly technical and skilled
engineering apprenticeships. Many were also in the high-level service
sector, with apprentices taken on in accountancy and hairdressing. One
apprenticeship was even based in my office with a training
caseworker<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>. That
shows how important small businesses are to our economy. Small

rates remain a threat to the future prosperity of businesses, but it
important to say how much I welcome what the Government have already
done. The automatic exemption of small firms from business rates has
helped 330,000 businesses, which not only pay no rates, but no longer
have to engage in the time-consuming task of filling in highly complex
forms. I welcome all that has been done to support small
businesses through business rate relief, but I urge my hon. Friend

should like the Government to consider introducing a fractional payment
option, enabling businesses to pay their rates weekly or monthly. I
should also like the Minister to tell us what information he has about
the use by local authorities of the business rate flexibility that
enables them to give businesses in their areas a 25% discount. If he
had still been in the Chamber, I would have asked
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:40:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Rochdale (Simon Danczuk) whether his local council had offered that
discount to the business that he

April, there will be a further big boost for businesses when the

is understandable that Members want to be positive in such a debate.
Most of what I say will certainly be positive, and Government Members
will obviously want to highlight what they see as the
Government’s achievements. However, we should not forget the
mixed experience that many small businesses have had over the past few
years. Many have survived, and are surviving now, only with great
difficulty. According to the Forum of Private Business—we will
all have received its briefing yesterday—94% of small businesses
are reporting increases in cost pressures, and many small business
proprietors have managed to survive only by cutting their own wages and
those of their staff. Small businesses are not in any way exempt from
the cost of living crisis that is affecting so many of our communities
and constituents.</hs_Para>

I have said, however, I want to be positive and to focus on what can be
done to strengthen and support small businesses, which I have discussed
with representatives of various small businesses in my area. Several
hon. Members have talked about the need for more sympathetic treatment
by the banks. I do not have time to repeat the horror stories that we
have all heard, but some of my constituents have reported awful
experiences with RBS’s global restructuring group. I hope that
the Minister will be able to update the House on what his Department is
doing in response to the allegations about that organisation. Even if
we leave aside some of the more dramatic examples, it is clear that
businesses need more sympathetic treatment by banks. The banks should
recognise the difficulties that have been caused by branch closures,
and, of course, there needs to be more competition and choice in
banking. Labour has made some important proposals in that
context.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:44:21"></hs_TimeCode>organisations,
and indeed areas of government, can also provide funds and other
support for small business, and Edinburgh city council has taken a
number of important steps in that regard. It has provided the Creative
Exchange, an incubator space that opened recently in Leith to provide
affordable work space for up to 80 staff. A further example is the
council’s procurement policy, which covers a £20 million
information technology tender. The council wants at least 25% of the

the East of Scotland Investment Fund, which could provide loans for

changes to corporate lending rules that allow community-based mutuals
to offer loans to businesses. As someone 
<?notus-xml column=480?>who has a very small investment in Capital
Credit Union, I am glad that it is at the forefront of that

if councils are to provide all the support for small businesses that
they ought to be able to provide, they need to have the powers that
would enable them to do that to the full. Local government powers in
Scotland are obviously the responsibility of the Scottish rather than
the United Kingdom Government, but the fact remains that local
authorities can perform an important task in supporting small business.
Those that are already doing a good job should be congratulated, while
those that are not should learn from them.</hs_Para>

I want to be positive, I should add that we must not ignore the real
pressures on small businesses. Cost pressure is an important factor
that needs to be addressed. During Energy and Climate Change questions,
the Government once again refused to accept the merits of
Labour’s proposal for an energy price freeze, which would be of
real benefit to small businesses as well as householders. It is
disappointing that the Government still refuse to accept the strength
of our argument, but in a world of Government U-turns, who knows what
their policy may be next
week?</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13112860000404" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000404"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:48:11"></hs_TimeCode>2.48

want to talk about some of the positive things the Government have

new businesses, which have helped to create 1.4 million new jobs. The
new employment allowance, which comes in on 1 January, is a welcome
measure from the Government that will help to push that even further
forward. We can celebrate the fact that we now have an extra 500,000
apprenticeships. The start-up loans scheme has celebrated its 10,000th
loan, with its loans totalling £50 million. Crucially, that
scheme has allowed those 10,000 firms to take on a further 10,000
people, so for each new firm, an additional job has been created, which
is fantastic.

Many small businesses and micro-businesses believe that they get by
despite the actions of the Government, rather than because of them, so
all the things that we are doing to roll back red tape are
absolutely right. Small businesses are creating jobs, but they want to
be loved, especially by the Government. Over the years they have not

with the good things, I know that the Minister is particularly excited
about the request that I am about to make—it is one that I make
repeatedly—and that he is absolutely going to deliver on it. We
as a Government are doing many good things, but business people are by
their nature extremely busy and, all too often, these good schemes
simply pass them by. However, the one thing that they cannot avoid is
their bills, and every year they are sent a business rates bill. Even
if they have nothing to pay, they are sent a bill telling them how much
they would have had to pay but for the fact that the Government are
allowing them not to do so. We should be communicating all the
Government’s schemes through that mailer. The taxpayer has
already paid for the mail, so let us include with it information on all
the things that we are encouraging businesses to sign up for, and
particularly on the advantages of taking on apprentices and of working
with UKTI to develop exports.</hs_Para>

want briefly to focus on championing young entrepreneurs. I was the
only one of the 350 students on my business degree course who went on
to set up their own business. We all arrived at university keen to do
just that, but we had entrepreneurial flair and risk-taking talked out
of us. I obviously was not paying enough attention, because I ended up
running my own business. The Government help to fund an organisation
called the National Association of College and University
Entrepreneurs, which encourages young people to take up practical,
real-life opportunities for running a business. I have met a number of
the young people who have taken advantage of those opportunities and
who are now going on to be part of the next generation of wealth
generators.</hs_Para>

look at what happens in business degrees. Along with all my fellow
students, I was given a placement job in the corporate environment,
rather than having the opportunity to test running my own business. We
could use spare space at a university to run a retail
business—that is very apt, given my forthcoming
Westminster Hall debate. We could also consider
whether 
<?notus-xml column=483?>part of a placement year could be spent running a
business, as that might allow us to encourage a few more of those
potential young entrepreneurs to take the step towards that.</hs_Para>

can also do a lot more for people before they go to university. For
people who want to go to university, the UCAS system is in
place—the conveyor belt is there. People choose their course
and, if they get their grades, they head off to university. If people
want to be an apprentice, they can look at the fantastic websites
available, see what type of thing they would like to be an apprentice
in, and go forward to the interviews. However, if someone wants to
start their own business, it is pretty much up to them to work
out how to do that, so we need to do a lot more to get those 20,000
business mentors to young people.</hs_Para>

we need to ensure that they are not just a one-off opportunity for
enjoyment. I took part when I was at school—we worked for a
week, made quite a bit of money and really enjoyed it. I recently did
something with Swindon college students whereby we got stalls in the
local market—a tough trading environment. Seven teams were each
given £10 of seed money, and all the money raised on the day
went to charity. We raised about £800 for the Prospect hospice,
but the crucial bit was that we did not have mentors just at the
beginning; we had them at the end.</hs_Para>

called Jessica ran a cake stall. Millions of people think about running
such a stall, but she realised that the market had an older customer
base, so she set up a 1950s-themed cake stall. She made more than
£100 on the day. She realised that she had the
customer service ability, the skills and the innovation to set up her
own business, and now that she has finished at college, she has set up
the Little Lemon &amp; Poppy Bakery. We made sure that mentors were in
place to help to guide her after she used her initial burst of
enthusiasm and went on to do that. I ask the Minister to do all that he

the last election many of us were going around meeting small businesses
in our constituencies, and businesses in Reading were telling me three
things. The 
<?notus-xml column=484?>first was that they were drowning in red tape and
regulation. The second was that they had to deal with an excessive
burden of taxation. The third was that they faced issues relating to
access to finance. Many Government Members have already pointed out
areas where the Government have made a real effort to address all three
issues: the red tape challenge; the one-in, two-out policy; cutting
back on the regulations that micro-businesses have to deal with; the
upcoming deregulation Bill—perhaps the Minister will give us an
update on that; the reduction in the headline corporation tax rate;
extended small business rate relief; the funding for lending scheme;
the enterprise finance guarantee scheme; and a plethora of schemes to
get debt and equity provision for start-ups and growing businesses,
which are on the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills website
and are now starting to be delivered through the British Business Bank.
Of course the one scheme that the Government have not been responsible
for, which perhaps the shadow Minister could tell us about, is the
Co-op bank soft loans scheme, which has been available to only a
restricted number of people.</hs_Para>

friend of mine who works in business and is not particularly partisan
politically has acknowledged that the Government have made a huge
effort in cutting red tape. However, as he says, perhaps the time has
come not just to take an axe to red tape, but to take a chainsaw to
unnecessary red tape and regulation. I am pleased that we have gone
from one-in, one-out to one-in, two-out, but why not one-in, three-out
or none-in, four-out? One reason for not doing that is that the
Government are constrained by EU regulation. I welcome what the Prime
Minister said following the proposals made by his business taskforce on
cutting back EU regulation. I understand that yesterday the Leader of
the Opposition referred to a tweet containing
“#greencrap”. I have just started tweeting, and am
thinking about tweeting after this debate with #EUredtapecrap, because
of the enormous amount of EU regulation that is holding back
our businesses. The issue of increasing competitiveness is felt not
just in the UK but by Governments in Berlin, Stockholm, Amsterdam and
perhaps even Paris.</hs_Para>

about closing the equity funding gap.</hs_Para>

the 2011 Budget, the Chancellor talked about merging national insurance
and income tax. A consultation was held, and the decision was made not
to take the idea forward. None the less, the idea is totemic. I know
that it is difficult and that there are anomalies, but we should
consider merging those two taxes. The reality is that national
insurance is just another tax. People should understand that the tax
they are paying is not 20% as a basic rate taxpayer but 32%. If they
saw that on their pay slips and in their annual tax statements, they
would realise that we are all paying a bit too much tax. They would end
up preferring parties that propose cutting taxes rather than raising
them. Perhaps we will hear something on that from the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:01:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:02:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Newton Abbot (Anne Marie Morris) on securing this
debate. She was absolutely right to highlight the importance of small
businesses to the success not just of our national economy but of local
economies up and down the country. Clearly, we all support small
businesses and we all want to see them succeed. Indeed all large
businesses were once small ones, and the big businesses of tomorrow are
the start-ups and small businesses of
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:02:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000120">However,
it is all very well to talk about support, but there needs to be
practical advice and policies in place that give start-ups, sole
traders and small businesses the full support that they need to prosper
and succeed. Most businesses in this country are small. The vast
majority of those people employed in the private sector work for small
businesses. In many respects it is the owners and workers in those
enterprises who are the unsung heroes of our
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000121">Let
me take, for example, a small business in my constituency of Carlisle,
with, say, five employees. That business pays business rates, which
helps the local and national economy, employer’s national
insurance and corporation tax. It will collect VAT, and it may well pay
VAT itself. It makes a huge contribution to the national economy. It
also conducts business with other local enterprises, helping to create
a more economically active local economy. In addition, it provides
employment to five families, providing them with a standard of living
and supporting their lifestyles. There is also often a wider benefit to
the community. The business owner may well live in the area,
contributing socially to the community through membership of other
organisations. They are often on school boards, local charities and
sports
clubs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:04:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000122">My
principal contribution to this debate relates to the role that local
government should play in supporting small businesses. We should
remember that the vast majority of business people will have absolutely
nothing to do with central Government or Government Departments such as
BIS and, with the greatest respect to the Minister, will probably never
come in contact with a Minister. The most important people in
government with whom business people are likely to come into contact
will probably be from the local council, a local councillor or perhaps
an
MP<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:04:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000123">I
accept that much is made of the contribution, involvement and policy
decisions of central Government. Central Government clearly have a
significant if not central role to play. They set the general
environment in which business can or should flourish and
create a framework within which business will function.
Nevertheless, we should not and must not underestimate 
<?notus-xml column=486?>the role that local government must play in
supporting and encouraging small businesses to flourish and succeed in
their
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:05:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000124">Local
councils, local councillors and officers can make a substantial
difference in a number of key areas. The obvious one is planning, where
the local plan can be made as business-friendly as possible. The
administration process should be as efficient as it can be and issues
for small businesses should be highlighted early so that they do not
incur unnecessary costs.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:06:01"></hs_TimeCode> second such
area is property ownership. Local councils are often property owners;
for example Carlisle city council, believe it or not, has about
£100 million worth of commercial property. It can make a
difference by using that to good
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:06:01"></hs_TimeCode>. The
third area, as has been highlighted, is procurement. It is not
necessarily the big contracts that matter; the small ones can make a
real difference to small
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:06:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
Local enterprise partnerships are also important. Councils have a role
and are often on the boards, and LEPs need to be pro-business and to
help develop policies that support small businesses in
flourishing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:06:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000125">There
are two other key points. We need small business support and engagement
with those local professionals who can help businesses: surveyors,
accountants, bankers and lawyers. Indeed, we should encourage
relationships with the local chamber of commerce or the Federation of
Small Businesses, with encouragement on business plans, finance,
employment and other such matters that will help businesses to
succeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:06:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000126">Most

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:04:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Newton Abbot (Anne Marie Morris) on introducing the
debate. I particularly appreciate her work on the definition of
“small business”. The Government’s definition of
small business is one that employs 250 employees or turns over
£50 million. That is a pretty substantial business and I applaud
how she has raised the profile of what we would probably call
micro-businesses. I suspect that most of the debate has been about
micro-businesses rather than small businesses.</hs_Para>

ran a micro-business, a business I started from scratch in 1982, so I
know about the pressure of ensuring that there is enough money in the
bank account to meet the monthly salary bill. I am therefore delighted
that the Government have recognised the importance of small businesses
and the number of such businesses that have been created. Along with
other Members, I champion the small businesses in my constituency that
are raising their profile through small business Saturday. I shall
visit four new businesses that have been formed in the past year and
opened in the past four months. I am looking forward to seeing what
they are doing.</hs_Para>

made the point in an intervention that every big business started out
as a small business. Big businesses are often large employers, but if
we want to provide 
<?notus-xml column=487?>employment for all our citizens, we need to consider how to encourage
small businesses to grow. In my constituency, there are more small
businesses than people looking for work and I suspect that that applies
across the country. If every small business was encouraged to
take on one additional member of staff, there would be no one looking
for work. That hit me quite hard when I met a successful one-man band
who was telling me how busy he was and that he was running around like
a nutcase trying to keep all his customers happy. I said,
“That’s great isn’t it? No doubt you’ll
be expanding and taking on somebody else in
the business.” He said, “No, I don’t want
any of that trouble headache and hassle. I would much rather stick as I
am.” We need to change that perception, so it is important for
us to consider some of the obstacles that hold people
back<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:09:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000131">One
of that small business man’s biggest concerns was employment
legislation. I understand the concerns of Opposition Members that there
should be a fair relationship between employer and employee, but in a
micro-business the employer and employee get to know each other pretty
well. They often work side by side in manufacturing the goods or
delivering the service. I would argue that many smaller businesses may
not need the employment protection measures that larger companies in
need of more formal arrangements require.</hs_Para>

move from one year to two before an employee can bring a case in an
employment tribunal is a step in the right direction, but we could look
at one or two other areas such as parental leave rules. Transferable
parental leave disproportionately disadvantages small businesses, which
may lose a key member of staff, often at pretty short notice. We could
consider making some exemptions for micro-businesses or those with a
turnover of less than £5 million or fewer than 25
staff.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:10:30"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

am also concerned about access to suitable business premises as we move
out of the recession. Jones Lang LaSalle reported in March that there
was little speculative industrial property development taking place. I
am worried that accommodation will not be available. My business
started in very low-cost old buildings. Such buildings have now in many
cases been demolished to avoid vacant business rates. I am bothered
that access to the internet has encouraged lots of fledgling small
businesses to start, often in niche markets, operating from home,
perhaps in a residential area, and as they grow they will need small
units, which we do not have. Developers have not been providing small
units. It is much easier for a developer to provide one unit of 50,000
square feet than 10 units of 5,000 square feet, and we need to address
that
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:11:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000134">Lastly,
I would like to deal with an issue that is not for Government but is
about a culture change. As a salesmen in my business, I would like to
see more appreciation for salesmen. They are the people who end the
manufacturing process; the services would not get delivered were it not
for the salesman persuading the customer to buy them. Salesmen have an
unfortunate reputation, and I would like to see some credit given to
the profession, with proper recognition and status. Their skills are
invaluable, especially in export markets where not only our small
businesses but the country as a whole prosper if the salesmen do
well.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_28_PT_1/D71B756A64C3FE2B2A008FDE86D1B4D865EA468C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="28 November 2013">Thursday

Perhaps some Members had never done that before taking people on in

atmosphere in which to build entrepreneurship. However, factors that
worked against coming into business included fear of failure, which is
a big deal. It is a psychological barrier that a person has to get over
when they start a small business. Public funding and start-up loans are
pretty indispensible in helping to get over the fear of failure,

I want to focus on the part of the motion that refers to encouraging

will focus briefly on access to finance from banks for my local
businesses. Twelve months ago I secured an Adjournment debate on that
topic, bringing to the House the cases of four businesses in my
constituency and the difficulty they have had in gaining access to
finance from four different banks. As a consequence, I took a
deputation of local businesses to see the banking Minister. We met the
British Bankers Association and had a representative of the Federation
of Small Businesses with us. That discussion
produced an assurance from 
<?notus-xml column=490?>the BBA that it would increase its publicity on access to the appeals
system, because if a business is refused a loan there is an appeals
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000148">The
BBA announced with some pride that in the first two years of the
appeals process run by the banks, a satisfactory lending agreement was
found in 40% of cases where the decline of a loan to a business was
appealed against. This was said to be a cause for congratulations. Let
me point out that in any appeals system, an approval rating of 40%
suggests that there is a problem with that system. Will Treasury
Ministers inform me of the distribution of that 40% appeal rate between
different banks? Which banks succeeded in getting it right and which
failed to do so? Will the Chancellor of the Exchequer consider
requiring banks to notify in writing all small businesses whose loan
application is declined that they have a right of appeal, because this
was not known to many of the businesses in my constituency that had had
such a
refusal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:20:48"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000149">I
have to say to the Minister that the answer I received on 30 October
was rather bland and unhelpful. It was, in essence, a reprint of the
BBA’s press release, and it added no further information. I want
to see whether he can improve on that, either in what he says today or
by reference to his Treasury colleagues as to what they might supply to
the House subsequently. The answer did not explain or offer any view on
whether a 40% overturning rate for the appeals system was a sign of
success or failure. It was also entirely silent about whether there was
to be any requirement on banks to follow through refusals of loans with
better information for companies on how to
appeal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:21:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000150">In

was subsequently offered—by the same bank—an unsecured

have heard a tremendous amount about the importance of small

social mobility, small businesses share one nation Labour’s
values completely. It is a path that several of us have followed, as
reflected in the debate. I worked in the private sector for my entire
life and was running a small business when I became a Member of
Parliament. From my perspective and, clearly, that of hon. Members
across the House, there are few more important questions for us to
consider than how we support small firms, which we all know are the
engines of growth, the biggest employers of the long-term unemployed,
and key drivers of economic recovery.</hs_Para>

On Monday, I was in Harlow in Essex with the local chamber of commerce,
meeting small businesses there and listening to their priorities.
Another organisation right at the forefront of the fight to support
small firms is the Federation of Small Businesses, which does a
tremendous job. A report in the <I>Leicester Mercury</I> this week
highlighted how a delegation from the east midlands, led by David
Nicholls, chairman of the Leicestershire branch of the FSB, got the
chance to lobby the Chancellor on the issues that he should address in
his forthcoming autumn statement. What did the delegation choose to
highlight? Interestingly, the <I>Leicester Mercury</I> tells us that
they demanded action on energy prices, a reduction in businesses rates,
and the Government taking responsibility for setting up a business
bank—very wise

effects of dementia, the worldwide cost of which is estimated to be
about £400 billion, which is the equivalent of 1% of world gross
domestic product. Without urgent action, that figure will increase in
line with the number of people who are anticipated to get dementia,

Members may talk about many aspects of dementia, but I shall address
four, the first of which is investment. The statistics are gloomy, but
there is a good-news story underlying the negative numbers: people are
living longer and people can live well with dementia. We need to
capitalise on best practice and ensure that we maximise people’s
ability to maintain long-term well-being, despite their debilitating
condition. Although we do not have a cure for dementia, we have come on
leaps and bounds in recent years. A cure is hopefully no longer a
lifetime away, but to ensure that we make that cure happen, we need to
take
action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000209">Dementia<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:38:47"></hs_TimeCode>
costs the UK economy £23 billion a year, which is more than
cancer, stroke or heart disease, but the annual research spend
on dementia is about £51 million. The research spend on
cancer is £521 million —10 times
more—yet dementia costs society much more than cancer annually.
I therefore welcome the increase in investment in dementia research
through the Government’s themed initiatives, which has resulted
in Government investment more than doubling over four years. However,
the investment comes from a low base and represents less than 1% of the

is essential that research focuses on investment in infrastructure.
Training and development for researchers is also crucial if we are to
see swifter progress towards treatments and cures for dementia.
However, it remains hard for an academic with a good idea to spin that
off to a company, especially compared with the situation in America.
The Government must do more to promote the commercialisation of
research as these companies become a vital part of the ecosystem. Large
companies and academia can then be partnered in the innovative
collaborations that the Government seek.</hs_Para>

on the provision of care is equally important. Four out of five people
with dementia live at home. We want to keep it that way and to ensure
that they can live there safely for as long as possible. Research comes
in many different forms, including the identification of what works. We
know that dementia costs the UK £23 billion, but
arguably that money is not being spent properly or efficiently.
Prevention is key. Avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions is vital to
ensuring that funding is used effectively and, more importantly, makes
a huge improvement in quality of life. Researching best practice in
care is essential. An economic case developed by the Alzheimer’s
Society estimated that if just 5% of admissions to residential care
were delayed for one year as a result of dementia-friendly communities,
there would be a net saving of £55 million a year across
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</hs_Para>

needs to be a change in the language we use when we talk about care. If
we talk about weekly art lessons that are provided to help to improve
cognitive function as therapy, rather than an activity, we could hope
to see a change in attitude towards research and investment in this
area. Many good ideas are having a positive impact in local
communities. For example, Medway council, which covers part of my
constituency, 
<?notus-xml column=500?>is promoting telecare as a means of supporting
people with dementia, and there are lots of non-clinical treatments
that could be further researched, such as the benefits of pets and
petting animals for people with dementia, memory rooms and memory
boxes. I have even heard of amazing innovative products such as
wristbands that monitor someone’s usual actions so that they
will detect if they have a
fall<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:55:01"></hs_TimeCode>. We need to

should not forget to consider support for carers. Family carers of
people with dementia save the economy £7 billion a year, but
evidence shows that they struggle to do that, which can lead to
avoidable crises in care, hospital admissions or early entry into care
homes, all of which are very costly. The Dementia Action
Alliance’s “Carers Call to Action” campaign, which

the G8 summit, I turn to my final but no less important point:
long-term strategies. The Prime Minister’s challenge on dementia
for England has provided a welcome focus on the treatment and care of
people living with dementia and the search for a cure, but there is a
danger that the focus will be lost, especially as the initiative is not
UK-wide but covers only England. Many countries have dementia
strategies or brain bank initiatives, and the UK needs a new long-term
strategy, because the current one is due to expire in 2014. I would be
grateful if—not today but soon—the Minister could outline
his plans to evaluate the national dementia strategy for England and
tell the House when he will commit to a new strategy following the
current strategy’s expiration next year. Notably, the US has a
dementia strategy in place until 2025, which means that we could 
<?notus-xml column=501?>be left in the embarrassing situation of the UK
Government leading the G8 in a discussion on dementia without a

conclusion, it is fantastic that the UK Government, under the Prime
Minister’s personal commitment, are using the G8 summit to
champion a more collaborative approach to preventing, treating and
curing dementia, but it is essential that the legacy of this summit
goes further than the G8 and that the declaration and communiqué
of the summit makes firm long-term commitments to the doubling of
research funding, to sharing best practice, and to delivering an

the presidency of the G8 have an opportunity to name a subject around
which they would like to mobilise the international community. In
playing his card at the G8, the Prime Minister has chosen dementia. I
commend him for taking that action. I believe that international
collaboration will be the way to achieve the next big leap forward,
particularly on the research agenda. I support what the Prime Minister
said at Prime Minister’s questions yesterday—that this
issue is not a matter only for world leaders, important though they
are; it is a matter for every single person in the community, whether
they be a world leader, a health Minister or an ordinary citizen.

shall start with the people who have dementia, along with their
families and their carers. When we promote policy, do collaboration or
talk about international research, we must constantly remind ourselves
that the people with the disease and their carers and families are
usually the most expert people in the system. Therefore, the services
that we provide, the quality of care and the innovations we develop
have to be shaped and guided by those people. We must empower them to
make their voices heard in this debate. When we bring together our
creativity, our imagination and the huge brain power in the research
community, we must always bring to this issue, too, our own humanity.
We must remember that people with dementia are valuable and loved human
beings. If we can keep that at the forefront of our minds, we will make
progress and be doing absolutely the right thing.</hs_Para>

Question Time yesterday I mentioned a lady called Joy Watson. I met her
a little while ago. She is only 55, but she has early-onset dementia.
Her family 
<?notus-xml column=502?>was devastated. When she went into shops, she might be a little confused
over her change or what she needed to order, and the shops—and
sometimes the customers—would be irritated with her, tutting and
asking her to hurry up. She took to wearing a badge, which she designed
herself, saying “I have got Alzheimer’s; please be
patient with me”. She should not need to do that. Nowadays there
is a scheme—I think it is called the purple angel scheme, and
Joy is promoting it—so that people can wear a purple angel on
their T-shirts as a means of raising awareness in every single part of
our community.</hs_Para>

Salford, we have worked on this agenda for a number of years. We have
just formed our dementia action alliance, with 30 organisations now
committed to action plans to make us, I hope, the first
dementia-friendly community in Greater Manchester. As well as health,
education and housing bodies, we have the Lowry arts centre and our
shopping centres included in the scheme. I think we have the first
private-hire taxi firm in the country to be involved in this, Mainline
Sevens taxis. It has trained 400 drivers and has an account system so
that people with dementia do not have to fiddle with their money when
they get in a taxi. All those groups are now dementia aware. That shows
the really practical things that can be done.</hs_Para>

Friend’s championing of this cause. When it comes to
universities, there are examples of research that have focused on ideas
for prevention. We heard yesterday from Professor A. David Smith from
Oxford about the vitamin B6 and B12 levels as a means of achieving
this. Currently, it is not possible within the health service to have a
test of homocysteine levels that would help to identify the problem.
Could we not put that prevention in place; should we not be doing that
now?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000235"><B><Member ContinuationText="Hazel Blears" PimsId="4035" UID="13112860000497" xid="51" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000497">Hazel
Blears:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I was
horrified to learn yesterday that only 0.1% of research on dementia is
spent on prevention. In every other area of public policy, such as
education and social mobility, we are aware of the importance of
investing in prevention, but in this area there is virtually no grant
support, and that must change. I understand that in Norway and Sweden,
tests for dementia are the norm. They are cheap once the investment has
been made in the equipment, and the vitamin B12 research looks
extremely promising. I hope that when the Minister responds he will say
that that is something that our own national health service should take

Blears:</Member></B> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has
mentioned Plymouth, because it is one of the pioneers in this area.
Plymouth, Torquay, Bradford and other towns all over the country want
to ensure that dementia is not something shocking that we do not know
how to deal with, and that everyone is dementia-friendly and aware.
They are tackling the stigma, which is a huge issue. People do not like
to talk about the fact that their families and friends are afflicted
with this disease.</hs_Para>

search for a cure is essential. No one wants to have dementia, and
everyone wants to be able to cure it. However, at the G8 I want just as
much importance to be ascribed to research on the quality of
care. The Evington initiative, which is backed by a number of business
leaders including Terry Leahy—who used to chair Tesco—and
Sir Marc Bolland are putting their weight behind that initiative. They
are asking two questions. First, how can we change the system so that
it is driven by users and carers rather than simply by
clinicians and producers? Secondly, how can we establish
a good, rigorous evidence base in relation to therapeutic
interventions, quality and consistency of care and tackling stigma, so
that clinical commissioning groups can be confident that the services
they are commissioning actually work?</hs_Para>

a cure for 10, 15 or 20 years, and in the meantime 800,000 people are
living with dementia. At present, there is virtually no evidence base
relating to the quality of care. “Singing for the brain”
is fantastic, but does it work, and if so, why does it work? Then there
are the arts, the drama, and all the memory work that goes on. We need

because he has covered a number of debates on the subject before. Much

have just a few points to add to what has already been said. The
Minister will recall that I led a debate recently in Westminster Hall
on what was being done about dementia in Gloucestershire and on the
ways in which I believed we had adopted best practice. However, a
critical question is: do we really know what best practice is? How do
we measure the quality of what is being done in our local hospitals and
care services? How do we measure the contribution of organisations such
as the Barnwood Trust, a mental health charity specialising in these
conditions which we are lucky enough to have in our

the right hon. Lady said, it would be useful if the Minister could
share his thoughts on a guide to best practice, not only for
commissioners—although I agree that that is important—but
for MPs. Representatives of the Gloucestershire family of NHS services
recently told me in a meeting that they had received an award for the
care and services they provided for old people in general and for
dementia sufferers in particular. That was terrific news—I am
always delighted when people win an award—but it would be useful
to know what we are doing best, and what is being done better in
different areas, so that we can have a nice, easy frame of reference.
People could then see whether their area offered a four-star or a
five-star dementia service, for example, and we could assess how we
might attain a higher standard if we did certain things

Abrahams:</Member></B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that, in
addition to building up the evidence base through randomised controlled

outcomes, some kind of action-based research would be appropriate? Such
research could be carried out and interventions could be offered and

<?notus-xml column=505?>the same time. It would be a case of learning as we went along. Does he

first question to the Minister is: could we have star ratings for

for the first time. We should work with other countries on this. A
number of us have received briefings suggesting that the United
States and France, among others, are also doing great things in
dementia research. Should we not all be able to share our findings?
Perhaps we could have what is known as a global inter-operative data
sharing base, so that all the work being done by organisations such as

duplicated. Effort could then be spent on taking research forward,
rather than replicating it.</hs_Para>

aim of trying to join up what organisations around the world are doing
is a key reason for the Prime Minister getting this topic on to the G8
summit agenda, and I hope that the result will be an international plan
involving more pooling of thinking, research and ideas. I sense that
science is beginning to feel more confident about finding solutions to
this ghastly disease, and if the G8 summit can give an enormous
turbo-boost to pooling research and getting closer to finding
solutions, the actions of the Prime Minister and the Government will
have been worth while, not only for the 800,000 people in

this House this year—I believe it was on 10 January when we
debated dementia and mental health—I discussed my
mother’s case. The debate was filled with passionate
contributions from Members across the House, although I was
particularly moved by the personal accounts from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:14:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends

also spoke of my pride that a decade after my mother’s passing
the city of Liverpool earmarked 2013 as the year in which it would
focus efforts on dementia awareness and promote innovative approaches
initiated by organisations in our city. Our work complements the
findings of the report from the G8 summit on dementia. Right across the
Liverpool city region, our health care providers, arts organisations
and academic institutions have embraced a collaborative approach to
increase awareness of dementia, early diagnosis and patient-friendly
treatment, with the mission being to make dementia everybody’s
business. I stand in this House proud and confident that Liverpool is
well on its way towards creating dementia-friendly environments in
workplaces, public areas and communities.</hs_Para>

of the most high-profile projects—the Prime Minister might like
to bring it to the attention of G8 colleagues—is the National
Museums Liverpool House of Memories project, which now has a
staggering 1,000 participants. Since I spoke on the issue
earlier in the year, the team, led by David Fleming, has developed its
innovative approach even further, branching out into the housing
sector, in partnership with local registered social landlords. In
total, four north-west housing providers have joined together to fund a
re-modelled initiative which has taken the House of Memories
project—using art, dance, music and creativity—to 600
homes. That is set to be further expanded next year. I am pleased to
report that the ambition of the House of Memories team knows no bounds.
Despite our year of dementia finishing in just a few short weeks, the
team already has an even more ambitious plan for 2014 to help
dementia
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000255">I
made it clear in January that I did not see any reason why the project
running in Liverpool could not be extended across every region of the
UK, so it is particularly pleasing to be informed that the
Minister’s Department has confirmed that £135,000 will be
awarded to take the House of Memories project to the midlands region in
March next year, and I thank him for that. As if that were not enough,
the team are even developing an app for iPhones and iPads on behalf of,
and working with, dementia sufferers, which will also be launched next
spring.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000256" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000256">The
House of Memories is by no means the only successful project
operational in Liverpool, so I make no apologies for bringing a number
of other local initiatives to the attention of the House. The unique
Sedgemoor specialist dementia support centre was opened in Norris
Green, on the border of my constituency, in May, at a cost of
£1.2 million. The centre features a high-tech, interactive 4D
theatre, where people can immerse themselves in the sights, sounds and
even the smells of the past, through old videos, cinema footage,
photographs, music and even relevant scents, which trigger reaction and

Thursday, I took part in a local dementia forum in my constituency,
which was organised by the Sutton Alzheimer’s Society. It
brought together a range of organisations to listen to and engage with
people who are experiencing dementia—either as carers or as
sufferers who have the diagnosis and are living with its consequences.
That was an incredibly powerful experience. At the heart of this issue
is how we ensure that people have a good life and maintain good
relationships, because dementia can rob them of that. We need to think
about how we can ensure that people, whether they be a professional, a
carer or someone who is working in another part of the public or
private services, understand and are aware of the issues about
dementia. We need to build a community that is more friendly towards
those who suffer from dementia. Good communication is at the heart of
that. The one message that all of us who were speakers at the event got
from both the carers and the people with dementia was to slow down. We
were gabbling and talking at great pace, because we were trying to get
across too much in too little time. With just over three minutes left,
I will not manage to achieve that requirement now.</hs_Para>

want to take a slightly different tack from the contributions we have

the impact dementia will have on the development of low and

need for long-term care for people with dementia strains health and
social care systems, and budgets. The catastrophic cost of care drives
millions of households below the poverty line. The overwhelming number

public health
priority.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13112860000263" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0003.htm#13112860000263">That

me put some numbers into my argument. In 2010 it was estimated that,
across the world, 35.6 million people had Alzheimer’s disease
and other dementias. That number will increase to 66 million by 2015
and to 115 million by 2050. The majority of that increase will not fall
in the developed world; it will be in low and middle-income countries

said, the number of people with dementia in 2050 will rise to 115
million, but the number of people who will develop dementia worldwide
between now and then is estimated to be 600 million, which is roughly
one new case every four seconds. In the UK, the national dementia
strategy, which, as we have heard, runs out next year, and the Prime
Minister’s dementia challenge, on which I had the privilege of
working when I was care Minister, recognise the challenge posed by
dementia, that dementia is not a normal part of ageing and that

leads me on to my next point about an example of research in India. It
is estimated that in 2010 there were 3.7 million people with dementia
in India, which will rise to more than 14 million by 2050.
Approximately half those people will be over 75 and almost 2 million
will be over 90. There is a serious lack of awareness about the issues
in low and middle-income countries, especially those in Africa. Almost
three quarters of people with dementia will live in those countries and

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:28:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

spend every five years, but it is not good enough for just our
Government to do that. We need other Governments to agree to the same
thing at the G8 summit. We need to know how much is being spent in the
G8 on such things. There is no published figure—that is
extraordinary—and when I tried to find a figure for the debate,
I could not. We need a baseline to know whether we are making

ambition on research, we need to learn from the journey that cancer has
gone on. Cancer research has for many years had ambition, reach and
strategy. We have an Institute of Cancer Research and it is time this

Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles spoke about turning the
spotlight on to AIDS and HIV in the 1980s and 1990s, which really did
make an unprecedented step change because there was an international
focus on treatment and care. Massive interventions were made in
previous decades on cancer treatment, and they had the same effect.
There is a desire across the international community, especially given
the opportunity provided by the G8, to have that same impetus. It is
not simply an issue of spending; it is an issue of real focus and
relentless drive on everything from prevention to treatment, care and
research<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:31:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

People with dementia and their family carers are clear about what makes
good dementia care. They want joined-up services and support so that
they do not have to battle different parts of the system. They want
care that is personalised to their individual needs. The vast majority

many hon. Members, I have seen lots of inspiring examples of people
working to improve care for people with dementia: day centres that
provide stimulating activities such as gardening, cooking, singing and
music; care homes that understand that they have to ask the families of
people with severe dementia what kind of care and support they need,
because those people’s memory has been taken from them;
hospitals that involve families by asking them what food and activities
their relative wants and needs; and, crucially, higher education
institutions such as the university of Worcester, which I recently
visited and is transforming staff training by getting patients to
interview people who want to be student nurses, and then to develop and
actually give the course, because how can NHS and social care staff
know what dementia patients really need if they have not been trained

loved ones will not get the quality of care we all want for them within
a malnourished and depleted social care system. In fact, I think that
the growing crisis in social care is the biggest threat to people
suffering from dementia and the largest challenge we face. Council
budgets have been under pressure for many years, but almost £2
billion has been cut from local authority budgets for older
people’s social care since the Government came to power. Fewer
people are getting the up-front care that they need to stay living at
home. Home care visits have been shortened to barely 15 minutes, which

get the help and care they need so that they can live at home, they end
up in residential or hospital care, which costs taxpayers

Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles. The integration
transformation fund is not new money, but existing resources of
£1.9 billion from clinical commission groups, with the rest
coming from existing local council budgets. I think that £3.8
billion is a really unambitious amount of funding in the context of a
total NHS and social care budget of £120 billion. We need the

96 approached me because it is concerned about the switchover. We all
know that small local stations, whether licensed by Ofcom as commercial
or community stations, lie at the heart of communities up and down the
country and hold a special place in the hearts of millions of
consumers. However, local radio cannot stand apart from consumer
trends. It is worth remembering that, although levels of music
listening have never been greater, a large proportion of the listening
done by those consumers who are most attractive to advertisers is not
done through radio—whether BBC, commercial, analogue or
digital— but is instead selected from thousands of
people’s own MP3 tracks, or from an even bigger library ready to
stream courtesy of programmes such as
Spotify.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112860000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/debtext/131128-0004.htm#13112860000332">There

a national station, the cost of broadcasting in DAB need not be very
different from broadcasting in analogue. For a small local
station, however, with a single FM transmitter, the cost of
broadcasting on a local DAB multiplex with half a dozen transmitters
could well be unaffordable, especially while it is still also paying to
broadcast on FM. If small stations made that leap to DAB, they would
invariably find that they were paying for coverage far greater than
they had on FM, whether they wanted it or not. DAB is fundamentally 
<?notus-xml column=519?>the wrong platform for genuinely local radio
stations such as Mix 96, which is a hugely popular and commercially
successful station. The geographical areas that DAB multiplexes cover
are significantly greater—often two to 10 times
greater—than those areas covered by many local FM-operated
stations.</hs_Para>

take this issue very seriously, being a passionate radio listener
myself. We have 1 billion hours of radio listening a week, and it was
clear to me when I became Minister that people took their radio
listening very seriously; they are passionate about it. The last

plan to reach it. The key criterion was that digital radio’s
share of the listening figures should be at least 50% before we set out
the timetable for switchover.

get to a stage where we can consider switchover, we have put together a

Jane Ostler and Laurence Harrison. Substantial progress has been made.
I note what my right hon. Friend said about wanting not to scrap

launch of national digital services in Germany in 2011 and the
Netherlands this year, which has a target switchover date of 2023.

radio stations. Ofcom’s research shows that local radio still
holds value for listeners: it is important and valued. Although some
measures have allowed greater networking between local radio stations,
we still require local programming both at peak time and outside it.

for securing a digital future for local commercial and community
stations, let me first make it clear that we have never said that we
require small stations to go over to digital. We have always said that
if and when there is a switchover, we would maintain their presence on
FM. It is also true that FM can work in tandem with DAB, as AM has with
FM for many years. Many of the manufacturers of DAB radios have agreed
a minimum specification, which includes FM. However, I take on board
the point—I think it was made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T17:23:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for High Peak (Andrew Bingham), who talked about
remote-controlled radios—that even where we have an FM-DAB
station, switching between FM and DAB can be complicated. We are going
to see more sets that switch seamlessly as the FM and DAB buttons are
pressed, but that does not mean that we do not have to look for a

commercial radio to DAB. I said to my officials, and to Ofcom, that I
wanted to find a cost-effective route to digital broadcasting for our

Friend alluded, although she rightly pointed out that this was an early
initiative and that more work needed to be done. It has developed a new
approach to small-scale, low-power digital transmission, using
open-source software which makes it possible to get on to the local
multiplex using an existing FM antenna. That approach was developed
initially by Rashid Mustapha, an engineer working at Ofcom, and it must
be a brilliant solution, because I do not normally have an opportunity
to name people who work at Ofcom during a debate. It has been tested in
Brighton with the support of Daniel Nathan of Juice FM. The initial
results are promising, and I hope that smaller stations that are

am a fan of digital radio, and I think that it is the future, but my
criteria have always been about coverage. We want digital radio to have
the same coverage as FM. This is about the consumer, otherwise known as

will effectively have converted themselves to digital radio. That means
cheap digital radios, which are now on the market. It means cheap car
conversions, which are becoming cheaper all the time. It means digital
radios being fitted as standard in new cars. It means good content,

may involve an immediate risk of self-harm or suicide, extreme anxiety,
panic attacks or a psychotic episode. How we treat the most vulnerable
in society lies at the heart of our values. We made a decision not to
hide away the sick and disabled, as we had hidden them away in the past
in asylums and institutions, but we still have a long way to go in
granting them equal status in society and equal access to
justice.</hs_Para>

report “At risk, yet dismissed” shows that those who
suffer from mental ill health are three times more likely to be victims
of crime. Shockingly, 50% of people with some form of mental ill health
have experienced a crime in the past year, and severely ill women with
mental ill health are 10 times more likely to have been assaulted.
Crimes are less likely to be reported and prosecuted, because people
with mental ill health fear being dismissed or disbelieved. Sadly, the
evidence shows that more often than not they are. How does the Minister
plan to improve police understanding of mental ill health and ensure
more accurate recording of such crimes, and will he give a commitment
to greater investigation and prosecution for such offences?</hs_Para>

reason for not reporting is fear of police powers in relation to mental
ill health. Too often, between 5 pm and 9 am during the week, at
weekends and on bank holidays, police officers are the only first
responders available in a mental health crisis, despite the fact that
they lack the medical knowledge, skills and training to resolve and
manage the crisis. They respond not because there is a real and
immediate threat to members of the public, but because mental health
services are understaffed, under-resourced and overstretched, and lack
facilities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000014">For
example, Miss P, who is 23 and a size 8, is a sweet, loving young girl
who has suffered mental ill health for most of her life. She finds it
difficult to build relationships 
<?notus-xml column=140?>and she is lousy at keeping appointments. She does not drink alcohol,
except when she is in mental health crisis, and when she does, she
turns into a violent and abusive person. Local mental health services
concede that she needs a specialist placement, but they cannot find
one. In the past five years, police have been called to 130
incidents and attended court to give evidence for 81 offences,
resulting in 18 terms of imprisonment. The gaps between her prison
sentences are becoming briefer—days, not weeks—and her
self-harming and suicide attempts are escalating. The cost to that
young girl, her family, the police, the courts, the probation service
and the Prison Service is huge. I am told that it approaches £1
million, all for one young girl.</hs_Para>

Moon:</Member></B> As always, my right hon. Friend makes excellent
information available to the House. I am delighted to hear of the study
to be made next year by his Committee, which is highly regarded across
the House. He is right to focus on mental ill health among police. It
is little surprise, given the amount and range of incidents with which
we require them to deal. That is why we must ensure that the police are
called to attend only incidents that they can deal with and that they
have the skills and capability to manage, so they do not go home at the
end of their shift feeling guilty and bereft about an incident that
they may perceive they dealt with badly. My right hon. Friend made a
most helpful intervention, and I thank
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000019">The
Centre for Mental Health states that police are the first point of
contact for a person in mental health crisis and that up to 15% of
police incidents have a mental health dimension. Other people have told
me that mental health interventions occupy up to 30% of police time.
The Royal College of Psychiatrists recognises that in some areas police
cells are the routine place of safety, under section 136 of the Mental
Health Act 1983, when a mental health crisis requires urgent
assessment and management. Many of those detained come from socially
deprived backgrounds, and some black and minority ethnic groups are
over-represented.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000020">The
Royal College reports considerable geographic variation in the use of
police cells. During 2012-13, five police areas recorded more than 500
uses of police-based section 136 places of safety, while four areas
recorded 
<?notus-xml column=141?>10 or fewer uses, and one had zero. The difference was that the latter
areas had better health-based services and facilities. Will the
Minister undertake to talk with the Department of Health about the
urgent need for commissioning boards to provide an adequate number of
staffed health-based places of safety in every part of the country? At
present, 36% of all places of safety under section 136 are thought to
involve police custody. In 2011-12, an estimated 8,000 to 11,000 orders
were made, with 347 involving under-18s. Will the Minister ensure that
accurate figures on how often and in what circumstances police officers
are called to deal with mental health crises are available, so that we
can get a clear picture of the
problem?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000021">People
held by police under section 136 are, as I have said, the most acutely
vulnerable. One study found that in 81% of cases involving police-based
places of safety, the person was self-harming or suicidal. The
Independent Police Complaints Commission found that 35% of deaths in
police custody involve people with mental ill health. Alarming reports
from Inquest show that a number of those deaths are linked to police
restraint techniques, and that 65 people took their lives within two
days of leaving a police place of safety. Between 20% and
30% of people held on section 136 detentions in police cells
were subsequently
sectioned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000022">The
impact on time and costs associated with police engagement in mental
ill health has never been calculated accurately, but it is clear that,
in a variety of ways, health service costs are being passed to the
police services. It is common for police officers taking people in
mental health crisis to accident and emergency or medical-based places
of safety for an assessment to be told, “There’s no bed
available”, “The person is too drunk”,
“They are under the influence of drugs”, “They are
aggressive”, “They are a child”, or, “They
have a learning disability”, all of which condemn that person in
crisis to a night in police custody. How much longer can we allow these
informal exclusion criteria around drugs, alcohol, aggression, children
and learning disabilities to

want briefly to focus on what is a growing area. We need to be sure
that we have clear guidance and responses in place for the 800,000
people in the UK diagnosed with dementia. A 91-year-old man suffering
with psychotic dementia was living at home with the support of his
family and the mental health team. One evening, a neighbour called the
family to say he was wandering the street looking for his wife, who had
died six years previously. His son went immediately to his father and
at around 9 pm called the out-of-hours health service for advice. The
doctor took the details and asked whether the son wanted to bring his
father to the hospital or whether he wanted the doctor to visit the
house, but the son said, “No, it’s okay. I’m on
top of things. Dad’s okay. I’ve given him a cup of tea
and he’s heading for bed.” By 11.30 pm the gentleman was
in bed, fast asleep and his son went
home.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000036">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:47:12"></hs_TimeCode>
2.30 am, the family had another call from the neighbour, saying,
“The police are breaking into your dad’s house.”
Why? Because the out-of-hours doctor decided to watch his back and had
sent an ambulance, but it did not arrive till three hours after he
called it. The man was fast asleep and the ambulance crew felt they had
to get a response, so they called out the police. The police climbed on
to the ledge over the front door, looked in and saw the man in bed,
fast asleep and said, “He’s fast asleep”. The
ambulance crew said, “No, we must see him.” The police
broke in, terrifying the man, who was greatly distressed—as can
be imagined—so they took him to A and E, because they could not
handle the
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:48:01"></hs_TimeCode>. That
is an appalling situation. The family tried ringing the ambulance
service and the police, saying, “Leave him alone. He’s
fine,” but they carried on. He was highly distressed when he got
to the hospital, and thought he had done something wrong and felt that
he was the criminal. This was an appalling
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000037">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:46:26"></hs_TimeCode>

it is estimated that up to 40% of police activity is related to mental
health issues. In my region of the west midlands, West Midlands police
estimates that 20% of all incidents that it deals with involve
individuals with mental health
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000041">Police<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:50:56"></hs_TimeCode>

As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:50:53"></hs_TimeCode> the hon. Lady
pointed out, they have specific powers under section 136 of the Mental

wording:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13112857000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000202">“If

latest figures show that some 21,814 people were detained using section
136 powers last year. As the Royal College of Psychiatrists has pointed
out—the hon. Lady mentioned this—far too many of those
individuals are still detained in police custody suites. The Royal
College of Psychiatrists talks about 36% of those people being detained
in police cells, which are essentially a proxy for a health care place
of
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000043">There
were 15 deaths in police custody last year, of which seven could be
attributed to, or were related to, specific mental health concerns. A
number of the deaths followed the use of the police’s section
136 powers. A number of the deaths are currently being
investigated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:52:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000044">Section
136 is part of the 1983 Act, which built on the Mental Health Act 1959.
In 1959, there were still a considerable number of asylums in Britain;
the whole complexion of our approach to mental health care was
completely different from today’s. Thankfully, we do
not have asylums and we are making huge efforts to treat people in
appropriate settings and in the community.</hs_Para>

for section 136 is essentially to give the police powers when someone
has absconded from an asylum-based setting. There is a strong argument,
which I put to the Minister, that we should consider reviewing the
section 136 power in the context of how we approach the treatment of
crisis care in mental-health settings in the 21st century. I am not
saying that the police should not have the power, in certain
circumstances, to detain people, but we should have a full review of
how that power is used.</hs_Para>

relationship raises a number of important issues, not just about how
the police are using the power but about how they interact with the

136<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:54:23"></hs_TimeCode>. As 
the hon. Lady said, we should work towards ensuring that places of

Lady also said, we must ensure that the police have
adequate training to deal with the often difficult and challenging
situations that they face. However we reform the system, there will
always be circumstances in which the police have to deal with people
suffering from severe mental anguish and difficulty. The police need
the appropriate intensive training necessary to deal with such
difficult and challenging circumstances, but it is also true that other
agencies and public bodies, such as the national health service and the
ambulance service, have a responsibility to work with the police. We
must ensure that all those agencies are working in
alignment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:55:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000048">In
the west midlands, for example, West Midlands police has developed a
good working relationship with the West Midlands ambulance service such

severe mental issues under section 136, an ambulance, rather than a

creating the context of criminalisation.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:56:06"></hs_TimeCode> is a good
working relationship in my area, but I know there are many examples
across the country of where that is not the case and of where there are

Brown is a particularly interesting police inspector in the west
midlands; he tweets under the name MentalHealthCop. He has been writing
on his award-winning blog about some of the police’s
difficulties when interacting with the national health service and
about some of the blockages in the system. As the hon. Lady pointed
out, one of those difficulties is often the reluctance of local NHS
staff, particularly in A and E, to play a role in the section 136
pathway, if I may use that phrase. Staff are reluctant to take
responsibility, and there are often confused lines of responsibility
between the police and the NHS about who will take responsibility for
the care of an

hon. Lady alluded to the assumption in certain parts of the NHS that
the most clinically complex patients, who are often suffering from a
mental health problem related to the overuse of drugs and alcohol,
should somehow be left in a police cell until they sober up or recover.
That situation is not acceptable in any circumstances—no one
suffering from a complex mental health condition should normally be
placed in police
cells.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000051">Police
cells are simply not the right environment for such people to end up
in. I am not saying that there are no circumstances in which such a
person should be held in police cells—there may be particular
circumstances in which they should—but we should move to a
situation in which we do not, in a civilised and compassionate society,
house people in police cells when they are suffering some of the most

This is ongoing work about which many Members are concerned, but we

working on a crisis care concordat, which will outline the roles and
responsibilities of all agencies in relation to crisis care. One way of
reducing the police’s use of section 136 is to ensure that we

lost in the system. The relationship between mental health
services—I think it was the Birmingham and Solihull Mental
Health NHS Foundation Trust—police, probation and social
services was not close enough and Simelane was lost to the system. That

He probably deserved to win it again this year as he continues through

I was preparing for this debate, the stand-out fact that jarred with me
was that 36% of all people subject to place-of-safety orders find
themselves in a police cell rather than a hospital. On the most recent
figures, that is 7,761 place-of-safety orders. According to Her
Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary, the average
length of stay in a police cell is over 10 hours and
32 minutes —more than 10 hours!</hs_Para>

have not committed any crime, but have been judged under section 136 of
the Mental Health Act 1983. They are not criminals; they are
experiencing a mental health emergency and are being let down by a
health service that institutionally discriminates against those with
mental health problems. There are many ways of measuring whether we
have achieved parity of esteem between physical and mental health, and
the 
<?notus-xml column=148?>numbers we lock up in police cells must be among the starkest measures
of progress. Today’s debate is about the role of the police
service in addressing the needs of people with mental health problems.
The police cannot completely be removed from the equation and do have a
role to
play.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000068">One
in four of us will experience a mental health problem at any one time.
We are talking about something commonplace, but often hidden in plain
sight in our society. That is why Victor Adebowale, in his report for
the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, was right
to say that mental health issues are a part of the core business of
policing. The current situation is not properly serving that
purpose.</hs_Para>

not peripheral. Rates of mental health conditions among offenders range
from 50% to 90%. There is no escaping the fact that the police, often
as first responders, are and will continue to deal with people
suffering from mental health problems. In London, according to
estimates by the mental health unit of the Metropolitan police, 15% to
25% of police activity is related to mental health issues. Some
estimates put the level much higher—40% has been cited in the
debate already. Either way, that amounts, in London alone, to more than
600,000 calls a year related to mental
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>

is important to stress that people with mental health problems are much
more likely to be the victims, rather than the perpetrators, of crime.
That fact all too often gets glossed over in how our media report such
things. The impact of crime on people with mental health problems can
be far more profound, with deeper consequences, than for those with
greater resilience. That is often not reflected fairly or appropriately
in how such matters are
reported<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:10:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000071">In
October, Victim Support and the mental health charity Mind published
their study of the victimisation of people with mental health
problems—“At risk, yet dismissed”—and it
challenges many of the popular misconceptions. Some of the facts from
that report have already been referred to, but the ones that stand out
for me are the facts that women with severe mental illness are 10 times
more likely to be assaulted and that almost half of people suffering
from a severe mental illness were victims of a crime in the past year.
The impact of such crimes on the victim is
huge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:10:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000072">As

on the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:10:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Bridgend, it is also right to recognise that the police
themselves are in a stressful occupation, which is often distressing
and a cause of real difficulties for them. Estimates suggest that in
London alone the mental illness costs to the Metropolitan Police
Service are equivalent to £1,000 per employee—a huge,
unmanaged
cost.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000073">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:11:10"></hs_TimeCode>
nature and role of police work, however, also require the police to be
in control and psychologically robust. All police services, and the MPS
especially, are therefore in a unique situation, in which the mental
health and well-being of staff require particular attention. The
statistic we were given earlier—the 56% of staff working in
custody suites who are themselves reporting anxiety and
depression—is a stark reminder that our debate is not only about
them out there, but about all of us experiencing mental health problems
in our
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:11:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Adebowale’s report included 12 recommendations. Incidentally,
although the report was commissioned by the Metropolitan Police

will pick up six stand-out common themes from the report: first, the
lack of mental health awareness, touched on in earlier contributions;
secondly, the lack of guidance and training on suicide prevention,
which is an important element; thirdly, the lack of adequate care for
vulnerable people in custody, which goes to the heart of the debate;
fourthly, poor inter-agency working—without doubt one of the
keys to unlocking so much of what does not work; fifthly, the
disproportionate use of force and restraint; and finally, the failure
to communicate with families, which all too often sits at the heart of
failure on these
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000076">Much
of that is echoed in the report “A Criminal Use of Police
Cells?” by Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary,
which found that the use of police custody as a place of safety varies
from 6% to 76% of the total number of people detained under section
136. As a result of a shortage of the right staff in the right places
at the right times, people who have not committed a crime are often
treated as if they were criminals. HMIC put it this way in its
report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:12:52"></hs_TimeCode>:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13112857000204" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000204">“those

report also found multi-agency working to be patchy, as was awareness
of training resources and activity—they are clearly the areas
where relatively small changes could lead to big differences in
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:13:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000078">The
recently published experimental analysis of police data offers some
important insights. It bears out the HMIC finding that there is huge
variation in the use of police cells as a place of safety. The Sussex,
Devon and Cornwall, West Yorkshire, Avon and Somerset, and Hampshire
forces all recorded more than 500 uses of section 136, while
Lancashire, Merseyside, Hertfordshire and City of London recorded 10 or
fewer
uses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:13:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000079">Drilling
down into those figures and using them to understand why things are so
different and what best practice might look like, and to ensure its
better spread, we can see why the Government should be commended for
having the statistics collected and such analysis done. Buried a little
deeper in the experimental data, however, is something else. For the
first time, there are estimates for the number of under-18s held in
police cells under section
136<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:14:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000080">In
the past year, according to the most recently published statistics, 263
children and young people were held in police custody. The report urges
caution about that figure, because of the experimental nature of the
data, and I can understand that caution. It should still be a source of
shame and a spur to act, however, that we are locking up children at a
time of deep and acute mental health crisis.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:14:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

issue—she raised it in Health questions—and I hope that

hope that the soon-to-be-published concordat on

something—more than something—to stop the barbaric
practice of children being held in police cells when they are having a

will be conducting a themed inspection, looking at the whole pathway of
crisis care—the role of the police service and of various
aspects of the health service—and I hope that it will also cast

have some questions for the Minister. There has been good progress on
rolling out the liaison and diversion services in custody suites. That
early identification, assessment and referral can result in much better
outcomes. Will the Minister give some indication of when the
Treasury will sign off the outline business case for national roll-out
of the service? Given the numbers of young people in the criminal
justice system with mental health needs, does the liaison and diversion
service cover them as well? Will it ensure that they are
always
included<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:16:04"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000083">Street
triage is being piloted by the Home Office and the Department of
Health, and we have heard how that can make a significant difference by
bringing health professionals into the equation. How will the street
triage model fit with liaison and diversion? Also, to repeat a rightly
put question, how is that model being evaluated, and what are the time
scales for a rapid roll-out should the evaluation show that street
triage is working well, which I understand it is showing? How quickly
therefore can we get it out throughout the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:16:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000084">In
the report on police custody as a place of safety, HMIC recommends that
if there is not significant reduction in the inappropriate use of
police custody by April 2016, the Mental Health Act should be amended
to remove police stations as a place of safety, except on an
exceptional basis. HMIC goes on to state that “exceptional
basis” should be written into the law and defined. Will the
Minister set out the Government view of that recommendation? If that
was signalled as an intention of the Government, would it serve as a
further spur to action throughout government, the NHS, social care and
police
services?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000085">Finally,
sitting at the heart of the disparity between mental and physical
health and of the institutional bias and discrimination that people
with mental illness suffer is deep-seated stigma. The Government
deserve much credit for funding the Time to Change anti-stigma
campaign—a global leader in such campaigning that is making a
real difference in this country. So far, a number of Departments have
signed up to play their own part in the Time to Change campaign. I
understand that there are discussions with the Home Office, and it
would be good to know from the Minister today when the Home Office will
be signing up to Time to
Change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:17:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
Furthermore, the attitude to and awareness of mental health problems
remain an issue in the police service. One way in which forces could
address that is by working together to sign up to Time to Change. Will

Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow), and I pay

me put what I want to talk about in a little context. As I think most
Members know, I am Member of Parliament for Plymouth, Sutton and
Devonport. My constituency contains a naval garrison that is the base
for 3 Commando Brigade, Royal Marines, as well as a base for the Royal
Navy. Members may be interested to know that Charles Cross police
station, in Plymouth city centre, is the busiest police station in the
whole of England, so I do quite a bit of work with the police station
and go to talk to the police there.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000092">The reason
for how busy the station is may well be the size of its catchment
area—it goes over to Tavistock and also to Torpoint and
Saltash—or it may be because Plymouth is a military garrison
city, as there are certainly significant cultural issues that go with
that. We also have more licensed premises in Plymouth than there are in
the whole of Liverpool—in fact, it is nearly double the number.
There are several really big issues crowding in on the police in
Plymouth. I pay real tribute to the police officers who work at the
custody suite in the Charles Cross police station, who find themselves
under a fair amount of pressure.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000093">My right hon.
Friend the Minister will find a number of themes going through the
debate today, reflecting the great concerns we have across the House on
this issue. Since the previous time we discussed this matter, real
progress has been made and I pay tribute to him and his colleagues,
including those in the Department of Health, for that
progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000094">The
last time I talked in a debate on a similar subject, I told the story
of a 17-year-old girl who was highly autistic, and who had kicked off,
for reasons of mental ill health, in one of the retail centres in my
constituency. She was taken to Charles Cross police station. I have to
say that the police found the situation very difficult, and were rather
challenged by what happened. I want to talk a little about what we can
try to do about that sort of situation. When the girl’s mother
arrived to pick up her child and help her, she found that the girl was
banging her head against a wall and having real difficulty with the
situation she was in. To my mind, that shows that we need to make sure
not only that there is better training for our police but, much more
importantly, 
<?notus-xml column=152?>that community health nurses are located in our police stations, to help
the police identify situations such as that one.</hs_Para>

spoke on the issue, Glenbourne unit, up at Derriford hospital in my
constituency, has been refitted and reopened. I am delighted that that
work has happened and that there is now much better co-ordination
across the divide. However, the story I have told is not unique. I
suspect that it happens in every single town and city up and down the
country. Local progress has been made, but we have further to
go.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000096">I
want to make another brief point. Plymouth is  a naval military
city, so we need to ensure that we have a much better understanding of
how military veterans are treated. They have been through some pretty
difficult times in Afghanistan and Iraq. My right hon. Friend the
Minister will know that I have been pressing him to consider the use of
military courts, not to put veterans in front of a court martial or
anything like that—they have of course retired from the
military—but because we need to act with much more sympathy when
dealing with veterans who find themselves in the justice
system.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000097">I learned
about that matter when I went to the United States of America with the
Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. There we saw at first hand how the
US deals with veterans. There is a specific Department of Veterans
Affairs, which is able to assess people and keep in much closer touch
with them. The Department gives all veterans a mobile telephone, so it
can ring them up at least two or three times during the course of the
year to make sure that they are getting on well. The US also has
specific courts for veterans that are staffed by people who have
military experience. I urge my right hon. Friend to consider whether,
in a similar way, we could use those of our magistrates who have
experience in the military and will have much better understanding of
what can happen to veterans. We visited a court in Little Rock,
Arkansas, that has been highly successful and has found that veterans
do not reoffend once they have been through that process. There are
mechanisms in place in the US to ensure that veterans are looked
after.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000098">My
final point is that we need places of refuge and safety. In my
constituency, there is a brilliant organisation called Twelves
Company—if my right hon. Friend is interested, I would be very
willing to bring up members of that organisation to have a conversation
with him—that deals with sexual health. One of my constituents
was raped by her husband and had real mental health problems; I hope
that I played a small role for her by taking her to see Twelves
Company. Since then I have not noticed her tweeting quite so much on
the issue, so I hope some balance has been found for her and that we
have helped her.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000099">I call for a
more joined-up approach to this matter. We need to ensure that the
police have alternatives signposted to them, and that the health
services and the courts and justice system recognise that mental health
is an issue to consider. Frankly, it is not rocket science, it is
mental health.</hs_Para>

Sarah Wollaston</B> (Totnes) (Con):</Member> I congratulate all the

relevantly to today’s debate, I should point out that I have
been in a police cell in the middle of the night. I hasten to add that
it was in a medical capacity, but I congratulate the Secretary of State
for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for South West Surrey (Mr
Hunt), on advocating work experience for MPs. I would advocate more MPs
spending a night in the cells. If they did, they would realise that
that is absolutely the last place someone should be if they are acutely
distressed by a mental illness.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000102">That is
particularly the case for an acutely distressed 12-year-old. Can we
imagine a situation in which a 12-year-old child with a broken leg
would be taken to a casualty department because there was no specialist
orthopaedic surgeon or facility to assess them? That would be utterly
unthinkable, yet in Devon and Cornwall alone, on three occasions since
the start of this year 12 and 13-year-olds who have been acutely
distressed with mental health issues have been held in police cells.
That is utterly unacceptable for anyone, but it is particularly
unacceptable that on 25 occasions—I would point out to the
Minister that this is in Devon and Cornwall alone—children of 17
or under have been in that situation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000103">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:19:49"></hs_TimeCode>
we look at the situation for adults, we see that, shockingly, there
have been 674 occasions on which people have been assessed in cells. As
we have heard, the average time detained in that situation is 10 hours.
On only 277 occasions have those assessments taken place in an
appropriate place of safety. Devon and Cornwall is second behind Sussex
in that terrible league of
shame.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000104">The
situation is not the police’s fault. I want to stress that, and
I pay tribute to the members of the police alongside whom I have worked
in the past, as a forensic medical examiner, for their professionalism.
Many police officers have sent me really heartfelt e-mails describing
the difficulties they face. The situation is putting huge pressure on
the police. It is a totally inappropriate use of resources. As Lord
Adebowale has pointed out, it represents very poor inter-agency
working, but there is no financial incentive for the NHS to change
because the burden of resourcing falls on the police
services.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000105">The situation
is totally unacceptable on any clinical level. I am disappointed that
there is no Health Minister sitting alongside the Minister today,
because ultimately the situation requires a total refocusing of
services. If we look at the statistics, we see that 82% of those who
are detained under section 136 do not go on to compulsory admission to
hospital. That highlights the point that many of these situations could
be avoided in the first place.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000106">I am sorry to
say that some general practitioners will not see patients unless they
have registered. Someone who is acutely distressed and has paranoia as
a result of mental illness might not recognise that they are unwell and
therefore might not register or go to see a doctor. Consultant
psychiatrists might refuse to see a patient without a GP referral.
Those are all hurdles in the system. Time and again, carers may be
desperate to access help for people who are really unwell, but
they  
<?notus-xml column=154?>must fall off the cliff and become acutely unwell in a public place
before the police can step in with a section 136
order that could have been avoided.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000107">I thoroughly
welcome the pilot project using triage, but street triage should not be
necessary because we should pick up such situations much earlier. I
would like volunteers who work with the homeless, for example, and who
may be aware that someone is slipping into a distressed state, to be
able to refer them directly to psychiatric services and bypass primary
care. Of course, I would like all primary care doctors to ensure that
they deliver the right care at the right time to all their patients, as
the good ones do, and directly and actively seek out people who are
homeless and vulnerable but who may not come forward to seek
help.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000108">Much
of the problem is about funding—it would be wrong not to make
that clear. The funding of units where people can be seen in an
appropriate place of safety is crucial. It is no surprise that the
local authorities that have most use of police cells are often in rural
areas, where there are additional geographical challenges in providing
appropriate places of safety. But if parity of esteem is to have more
than just a hollow ring to it, we must ensure that within the NHS cake
there is fair distribution of funding for mental health, and we must
recognise in funding formulae that rural areas sometimes face extreme
challenges. Sparsity must be recognised in funding if there is to be
fairness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000109">Another
problem is that mental health beds are running “too hot”.
The CQC has said that in 50% of areas bed occupancy is 90%, and in 15%
of areas it is 100%. That causes delays throughout the system.
Ultimately, there is a problem not just with appropriate places of
safety, but beyond that with having beds available when people need
admission. On four occasions in Devon and Cornwall, the process of
assessment has taken so long that a bed that was provisionally booked
was taken by the time the assessment had been made. All those causes
delays in the system must be addressed: the availability of suitably
qualified section 12 approved doctors; the availability of psychiatric
beds; and, crucially, the availability of appropriate places of
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000110">Will
the Minister examine the effect on children when medical facilities are
not suitable? There may be secure children’s homes— my
preference, of course, would be to have a medical facility available,
but I can say from personal experience that anything is better than a
police cell. Police cells in the middle of the night are desperately
frightening places. They are often full of people who are drunk and
shouting. It is unthinkable that a child should be in that environment
in a police cell. I hope that the Minister will say that if by next
year children as young as 12 are still being put in police cells,
Parliament will legislate to abolish

role of police officers is to ensure the safety of the public and deal
with individuals who pose a threat to others or themselves. In an

and staff must deal with people with complex mental health needs alone,
instead of with the support of experienced and trained medical
professionals. They are required by the law, when appropriate, to take
the individual to a place of safety. More often than not, the only
option is to take them into custody. It is not right that people with
mental health issues who have not committed a crime are treated as

are already stretched incredibly thinly, without the unnecessary
pressure of having to act as stand-in social workers and mental health
nurses because those vital services have also been cut back. Police
officers are clear that they are not the right people to deal with
those who need complex medical intervention for serious mental illness

Lord Bradley’s report acknowledged, good training and support to

street triage team pilots, such as those operating in Newham and
Birmingham, and I encourage further working between mental health

Bradley’s report also recommended—through joint training
packages for mental health awareness and learning disability issues,
with community support officers and police officers linking with local
mental health services. Crucially, we also need to work towards moving
away from the use of custody cells for those detained under section 136

health illness are dealt with sensitively and appropriately, and are
given the correct medical treatment.</hs_Para>

appropriate support. Innovative local strategies such as that are
welcome, leading the way with new approaches to police procedure and
mental health issues. However, three years after the Bradley report,
recent reports and calls from those in the police about the problem
getting worse, not better, are cause for concern that not enough has

with mental health difficulties get the support they need. It is also
vital that a clear, strategic framework across all Departments is put
in place to help to drive and improve

cutting crime, and we believe that officers should not be expected to

principle, which has been expressed by many hon. Members on both sides
of the debate, it is impossible to argue that people facing mental ill
health should not have their health needs met by professionals who are
able to provide appropriate support and treatment. The police are not
best placed to provide that, but they may have a key role to play in
identifying vulnerabilities among people with whom they come into
contact.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000131">Essentially,
the police come into contact with four groups of people who may have
mental health problems. First, there are people who have committed a
crime, or are arrested on suspicion of committing a crime. For those
people, it is essential that we strike the right balance between
bringing offenders to justice and helping people get access to
appropriate interventions in order to tackle factors, such as mental
health problems, that may be contributing to their offending behaviour.
In the second group are those who come into contact with the police
because a member of the public has concerns for their safety or for the
safety of others, but when no crime has been committed. In the third
are people who may have been reported as missing. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:45:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bridgend pointed out, they may be elderly and have a history of
dementia, or they may be people known to mental health services whose
families or carers have reported them as missing. The fourth category
is victims of crime or witnesses who may themselves have mental health
problems and need support at every stage of the criminal justice
system, as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:45:57"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport (Oliver
Colvile) pointed out.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=158?><hs_Para UID="13112857000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000132">I will go
through those groups. We have heard about the review by Lord Bradley,
who highlighted that a significant proportion of prisoners have some
form of mental health problem. One key recommendation was that to make
that contact with the criminal justice system work, we needed to put
offenders in touch with treatment and other support services that can
help stop their behaviour escalating into more crime. There are
currently more than 50 adult and almost 40 youth liaison and diversion
services working with offenders with mental health problems, substance
misuse problems or learning disabilities at the earliest point of
contact with the police and courts.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112857000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000133">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>
answer the questions that my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton
and Cheam asked about what is happening next, from April 2014 we will
introduce an enhanced core model across a number of selected areas. The
aim is to ensure that those services can lessen health inequalities and
improve justice outcomes for people who come into contact with the
criminal justice system and for whom a range of complex needs are
identified as factors in their offending behaviour. My right hon.
Friend was right to say that a business case has been submitted to the
Treasury. He asked the eternal question of when we will hear back, and
I can tell him that the decision is imminent.</hs_Para>

also know that there is a clear link between mental health problems and
deaths in custody. That is a very serious issue. Obviously, every death
in police custody is a tragedy, and that is a priority matter for the
Government. Work in the area is overseen by the ministerial council on
deaths in custody. The council’s independent advisory panel has
recently awarded a two-year research contract to the university of
Greenwich, which will be working on a number of projects to consider
the impact of mental health problems on deaths in custody. Those
projects will cover a wide range of the issues that have been brought
up in individual cases in this debate and elsewhere. That is one stream
of work.</hs_Para>

the Independent Police Complaints Commission has a vital role to play
in the investigation of deaths in custody. It must be notified of any
death that occurs in police custody, and it is currently carrying out a
review of how deaths in or following police custody are investigated. A
progress report on the review was published in September, and the final
report is due to be published early next year.</hs_Para>

is one group of people affected, most of the debate has rightly
involved another group with whom the police regularly come into
contact: people suffering from mental ill health who have not committed
and are not suspected of committing any crime. There may be concerns
for their safety or for the safety of others, and they may need to be
detained in a place of safety for that reason. However, all too often,
those people, who are ill, find themselves in police stations. Many
contributors to the debate made that
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000137">Her
Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary’s report on the
use of police cells as a place of safety for individuals detained under
section 136 of the Mental Health Act found that in a number of areas,
the use of police cells remained unacceptably high. Again,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:49:29"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam made that point. We know that
during 2012-13, almost 8,000 section 136 orders were made for which a
police station was the place of safety. As has been said, that is 
<?notus-xml column=159?>more than one third of the total number of section 136 detentions.
Straightforwardly, that is unacceptable,  other than in truly
exceptional circumstances. Those are people who are likely to be in
crisis, and they need and deserve proper care and support from people
qualified to provide
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:49:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112857000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112857000138">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:19:39"></hs_TimeCode>

hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, to ensure that people
with mental health problems receive the care, support and treatment
that they need, and that police officers are freed up to do their job
of fighting and preventing crime. That work has made significant
progress. The most visible sign of it will come shortly when the

criteria that exclude individuals, although their safety and the safety
of others is the paramount consideration. She and others, including my
hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis, mentioned the
street triage pilots, which have obviously been extremely beneficial.
The pilot by Sussex police went live on 16 October and other forces are
having their launches in December. West Midlands police is moving along
with this, and so is the Metropolitan police. Rather than all the
pilots coming to an end at once, and there then being an assessment and
then something else happening, what seems to be happening is that other
areas are picking up the benefits and expanding the system. I am

point has been made that too often, the police end up transporting
people who ought to be transported by ambulance. The Association of

important issues surrounding mental ill health and policing. In its
short period in existence, it has already held an awareness event with
deputy chief constables. They have agreed on the need not just for
clearer guidance about the use of restraint—again, I take the
point made throughout the debate about the difference between mental
health restraint and police restraint—but for better capture of

third group that I mentioned was missing people. It is estimated that
four out of every five adults who go missing are experiencing a mental
health problem when they disappear. If those people have dementia, they
may be frightened, be unable to find their way home or exhibit

someone goes missing, so in responding to such calls, the police need

Coffey</B> (Stockport) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr Walker. I am pleased, together with the hon.
Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson), to have secured the
debate. As co-chair and vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group
on retail, we understand that thriving town centres and high streets
are the living face of our communities and vital to their economic and
social well-being. Town centres influence how people see, experience
and relate to their local areas. They are, and always have been, places
where we re-affirm our place in our communities by meeting and talking
to each other. The familiarity of the high street can give us a sense
of belonging.</hs_Para>

is the building block of our high street. More than 3 million
people—more than one in 10 UK workers—are employed in
retail. In my constituency, retail is by far the largest private
provider, and it is responsible for more than a quarter of all jobs.
There are many important issues facing the high street, such as
employment, retail skills, business rates and rents, finance for small
businesses, car parking and town centre management.</hs_Para>

I do not underestimate the seriousness of those issues, my debate will
have a slightly different focus. The visibility of the high number of
empty shops scarring our town centres, with one in seven shops empty
nationally and one in five empty in the north-west, can give us the
impression that our high streets are slowly shutting down. I do not
believe that the situation heralds the final demise of the high street,
but it demonstrates the extent of the challenge faced by the private
and the public sectors to reinvigorate that public space.</hs_Para>

online sales of non-food products reached a new record rate of 18.3%.
M-commerce grew by a staggering 300% last year alone, and it will rise

the old days, not long ago, when there was only one way to shop? We
walked down the high street and into the shop we wanted, spotted the
item that we wanted to purchase, bought it and carried it home. With
mobile phones, we can now go into a shopping centre, examine goods,
scan barcodes, compare goods online, read reviews and buy either in
store or online. Developing mobile technology means that in the future,
we will also receive real-time, tailor-made messages from companies
about myriad offers and discounts in nearby shops.</hs_Para>

thousands of empty shops up and down the country cannot all go back to
being traditional shops. As a result of the impact of mobile
technology, future 
<?notus-xml column=163?>town centres will no longer simply be about physical shopping; they will
be about socialising, entertainment services and cultural events. That

stores are responding to new technology by bringing together online
services with physical shops. Many businesses are equipping their staff
with iPads or installing kiosks to allow for easy in-store customer
ordering. A good example of the bringing together of the physical and
the digital is Amazon’s introduction of collection lockers on
the high street, which allow people to collect their orders rather than
waiting for deliveries. eBay has set up a pilot system allowing
“click and collect” orders to be picked up at Argos
outlets. John Lewis has already launched a service that allows
customers to collect their order from one of 1,500 local Collect+
shops, so customers start their shopping journey online and finish it
in the town centre, which creates additional footfall.</hs_Para>

shops already have free wi-fi for tailored marketing, which also allows
shoppers to read detailed reviews and compare prices—something
that 33% of smartphone users are already doing. Apps or scanable QR
codes and barcodes help stores to target shoppers for special deals and
extra branded content on their mobile devices as they browse the shop.
QR codes on shop windows can divert custom to a website outside normal
opening hours, which is particularly useful for a small

technology is already transforming our high street, but let us try to
imagine what the high street of the future might look like. In Spain,
people can already use phone identification to check in to their local
high street, after which a host of real-time events and offers flash up
on their smartphone to alert them to what is happening there and then.
Such technology can even direct people to a free parking space, and
Westminster is already pioneering a new app for that. In years to come,
we will also see many stockless shops, which aim to sell their brand.
In such shops, customers will sit on sofas and view new collections
through high-definition touchable holograms, which allow them to feel
the texture of a fabric and have an item delivered to their home
immediately.</hs_Para>

technology will identify people from an on-street face recognition
account that they can opt into, which will alert key shops and services
to the fact that an individual is coming, to allow them to prepare a
tailored offer in store. That means that we will receive tailor-made
messages and offers as we walk down the high street. Things that seemed
ridiculously futuristic a short time ago will be here soon, such as
Google Glass, a head-computer worn like glasses, which an individual
can speak to. It will project images and information on to the glass,
and will function like an interactive search engine. It is difficult to
predict the effect of such technological changes on consumer behaviour,
but we must understand how transformational they will be.</hs_Para>

have already mentioned the Portas and Grimsey reviews. I think it is
unfortunate that they seem to be in conflict with each other, because
essentially they both say the same thing about innovation and
partnerships. Stockport is a Portas pilot. Our pilot is based on
regeneration of our market and Underbank, and it is creative
industry-led. It is fair to say that it has been a bumpy ride, but that
is what pilots are about. It has illustrated the difficulties faced
when two very different 
<?notus-xml column=164?>cultures—public and private—try to work together. The good
news is that footfall is up in the markets, new shops are opening and a
unique Stockport brand is emerging.</hs_Para>

pilot demonstrated that we need a different kind of public-private
partnership to support regeneration projects based on small retailers
and markets. Such projects should always have a business plan based on
hard evidence and proper analysis of strengths and weaknesses, to
arrive at a unique high street offer for a particular town. If public
money is to be spent on business rate relief, buying and letting
property to preferred leaseholders, transferring public services to
empty shops or converting empty shops to residential use, we need to
see value for that money, especially as resources will become
increasingly scarce. I would like the Minister to do what he can to
spread the evidence from the Portas pilots and similar innovative
schemes across the country, to provide local councils with information
that will help them develop business plans for their high street. We do
not want to be constantly reinventing the wheel.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=166?>Regent Circus is taking shape by the day, and it will have a new cinema

300,000 shoppers within 20 minutes of it and 3 million within an hour.
That is one reason why we were able to secure £65 million of

authorities have a key part to play. Many areas have an opportunity to

why certain buildings need to be protected, but a lot of towns need to
accept that when a developer says the whole town centre needs to turn

Suddenly, cutting charges to £2 for four hours led to a

other area where local authorities and, arguably, the Government can go
a bit further is super-BIDS—business improvement

Swindon, and they do a great job. We also have the McArthurGlen outlet
village, which is a huge success; it is about to have its umpteenth

removed. How many high streets can say that?</hs_Para>

key to the centre’s success is twofold. First, it has fantastic
car parking, which is a no-brainer. Secondly, there is a single point
of contact. If a retailer is thinking of going there, they know who to
speak to. If they want to go to a town centre, do they speak to the
local authority, the BID company or the landlords? There are all sorts
of different things, and there is a lot of confusion. I would love to
see a lot more of our towns give the BID companies full control of the
town centre so that they get on with things—whether that is
street cleaning, entertainment or planning. That would help to
transform huge swathes of our town centres.</hs_Para>

me now turn away from what the Government can do. Often the temptation
is to say that we can do everything, but retailers actually have a lot
to do, as Mary Portas highlighted. Retailers must accept that they have
to adapt to changing customer expectations, whether that involves the
growth of the internet or the growth of supermarkets and out-of-town
shopping centres.

saw that in my parents’ shops when I was growing up. My parents
always took time to thank customers. If the normal closing time was
half-past 5 but a customer who came in after work had not finished
shopping by that time, they did not shut; they kept going while there
was someone there. All too often, and particularly in some chains, that
attitude is lacking. In any Mary Portas television programme, that is
always the first thing to be highlighted. Customers will vote with
their feet. If they get bad service, they go

something different is another thing to consider. We have Bloomfields
deli in Highworth. Everyone said that it was mad to open
it—“The supermarkets own the world; you have no chance of
surviving”—but it offered innovative products that could
not be found in the supermarket, and good quality. The shop sells
fine foods and the staff will wrap things up and put them
in hampers. The Christmas deluge of business, allowing the
deli to sell products that it could not otherwise, is about to start,
and that is all because of going the extra mile.</hs_Para>

have to think about opening hours, because the internet is 24/7. Amazon

same day? My 
<?notus-xml column=168?>mother delivered things: it was a wool shop, so there were a lot of
older customers, and on the way home she would drop things off to some

final element of what I am talking about is the role of young people,
and encouraging them to start in retailing. The number of young people
going to the high street has dropped dramatically. When I was growing
up, the town centre was the place where young people went, by default,
to buy music or computer games, to socialise and, when they got old
enough, to take advantage of the night-time economy. Nowadays, there is
a generation of young people who never set foot in the town centre
because they are the ones who embrace internet and out-of-town shopping
the most. We must get the mix right, as

must encourage young entrepreneurs to think about retail. We run
entrepreneur challenges in schools, which I have just talked about in
the business debate in the main Chamber. I am talking about providing
real, tangible experience in a retail environment. I did that in the
Blunsdon market. The young people run a market stall and the mentors
talk to the successful businesses afterwards and explain, “If,
after you finish college, you want to do this, we can talk to landlords
and get you a space in a unit, or you can come back to the
market.” From small acorns, businesses grow. All big businesses
today were small businesses once, and young people can be the best
retailers, because they will challenge convention. We should do more to

Whitley Bay chamber of trade constantly promote the interests of their

Retail Consortium survey of December 2012 reported that the cost of
retail crime in 2011-12 was about £1.6 billion, 83% of which was

that in 30 of the police force areas there is evidence that
crime—particularly acquisitive crime, and, within that category,
particularly shoplifting—is increasing. There is a danger of an
overall rise in crime. I hope we shall not return to what was
traditionally viewed as the link between recession and
crime—albeit with something of a lag. I accept that the annual

are on the front line. Newsagents and general stores stock perhaps the
most transportable and resellable goods of all: alcohol and tobacco.
Shoplifting is not a victimless crime. It adds to the retailer’s
business costs, as well as to customers’ costs at a time when
the cost of living is rising. Often, independent retailers are the
hardest hit, if not because of the sheer volume of the problem, then
because of the effect on their business costs.</hs_Para>

Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill is currently being

low-value shoplifting as being when the value of the stolen goods does

stores. There is a perception, and even greater concern, that people
arrested for shoplifting are sometimes being cautioned again and again,
and that any recompense for the retailer is missing.

retailers I speak to have been asking whether the Government intend to
review the guidance on shoplifting. We read almost daily about people
stealing household goods—including, increasingly, food.
Sometimes that is, obviously, to feed a family. There could be numerous
reasons for what is happening, such as benefit changes, worklessness or
just criminality. However, it could also be part of organised crime,

Organised crime gang members may individually steal goods worth less

and it is hardly something that warrants a caution.

internet and what almost amounts in some cases to the migration of the
town centre to a different location on the edge of town or urban retail
parks. We have all witnessed what starts simply as an edge-of-town
supermarket expand until a cluster of other retail units form around
it; in a short space of time, we have a competing town centre or high
street. Whether or not those changes are for the better, we cannot
alter the fact that the customer has decided that they are here to

Portas review was established and, as I stated in previous debates, I
see little in it that does anything more than apply a sticking plaster
to a gaping wound. I do not blame the Government for using a celebrity
to front the review. Sometimes celebrities can draw more attention to
issues than any politician or businessman can. To be fair to Mary
Portas, her report recognises that retailers need fewer shops and
recognises the onward march of the supermarkets, which is of course the
main reason why we need fewer retail units. She is half right when she

suggest that in most cases the communities are still there, but they
shop elsewhere. I look back to my early childhood in Fuller street in
Cleethorpes. It still exists and the same 80 or 90 houses are still
occupied, but Mr Marrows, the grocer down the street, and Mr Nocton,
the butcher round the corner, along with the baker, the hardware shop

every town in the country, Cleethorpes simply has too many retail

main road between Grimsby and the adjoining town of Cleethorpes. It is
also the main entrance to the resort of Cleethorpes, and
the  many bricked-up, derelict properties do not
enhance  the reputation of what I am pleased to say is still a
thriving resort. Property values and rents are low. Many sole traders
are surviving without necessarily thriving. 
<?notus-xml column=171?>Whether the property owners are the traders themselves, a local landlord
or indeed an absentee landlord, an incentive is needed to convert many
of the now empty retail units to residential use. With the powers
granted to local authorities by the Government’s localism
agenda, councils have sufficient powers in their armouries to embark on
regeneration schemes. The reality is that very little is happening.

initiatives that perhaps allow local authorities to spend that sort of
money on compulsory purchase, rather than repave vast areas or patch up
one little area. I have served on a local authority, so I know how
difficult compulsory purchase is to achieve. It often takes two, three
or more years to accomplish for a relatively small group of properties,
and we need to make it easier. The resources spent on various
initiatives would be better spent on buying up properties. Councils
could then sell them at a knock-down price—perhaps even give

fewer and fewer, to be a key part of that. The debate is critical
because it is about communities, which are usually created with

can continue to do so. My first two jobs were in shops in Scotland, so
the topic is close to my heart.</hs_Para>

in west London. People think of London as a city, but apart from the
inner city, London is made up of little villages. I have several

for people to shop and go to the restaurants there. A lot has been
done. Of course, we have heard already about the Portas review. In
fact, Mary Portas opened a shop on my local high street, Living and
Giving, which is a shop for Save the Children—it is a charity
shop on Chiswick High road. Some interesting points came out of that
review, and the pilots have been set up. Also, in London after the
summer of unrest and riots that we had, there is a high street
innovation fund, and a lot has been done to encourage local markets. A

chosen as an exemplary model of good and joint working of all five town
partnerships in my constituency—Alsager, Congleton, Homes
Chapel, Sandbach and Middlewich. They are not competing against one
other, but supporting each other to maintain vibrant local communities,
including their high streets. I spoke at the conference and afterwards
conducted a Q and A session with the delegates. I want to bring back to
this debate and to the Minister some of the comments that delegates
made about what more the Government could do to help to boost market
towns and other smaller communities, with a particular emphasis, of
course, on the high street.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112861000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112861000041"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>One
of the first points that delegates made was that local enterprise
partnerships could offer more opportunity to help to diversify town
centres, as part of their wider local economic growth strategies.
However, the feeling was that LEPs tend to focus on supporting big
business, not on places, and that LEPs perhaps need to focus more on
supporting market towns or working with groups of smaller businesses.
The question to the Minister, therefore, is: how can individual towns
and their businesses influence and access LEP funds more effectively?
Is there perhaps a need or an opportunity for Government to inform LEP
strategy development at national and local level, to ensure that LEPs
listen to and respond effectively to community representatives,
including those representing smaller retailers?</hs_Para>

second point relates to developing the policy for multi-purpose town
centres. I think we all acknowledge the need for town centres to
diversify, so that they can provide retail alongside community services
and play a stronger leisure, culture and amenity role. There is also an
acceptance of the potential to deliver that through neighbourhood
planning. There is the future high streets forum, but comment was made
that although this holistic view of town centres is accepted, it does
not seem to be proportionately represented on the forum. I have looked
at the proportion of representatives on the forum,  and there
certainly seems to be a preponderance of representatives from big
business and big retailers, with relatively few representing the
smaller high street retailers. The question is: are there real
champions of small businesses to make their voices and views heard on
the future high streets forum, providing an holistic view of
multi-purpose and sustainable town centres to be delivered through
localism and the right to plan or community
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:48:44"></hs_TimeCode>? Is the
balance right on that forum to ensure that this will
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:48:50"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112861000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112861000043">Thirdly,
there is the issue of the reuse of public assets in towns. Maintenance
of public services and employment in and around town centres is, as we
know, vital to local well-being and prosperity. However, there is
concern that empty public buildings could be made more readily
available by authorities for social and community enterprises, perhaps
at below market value if they are 
<?notus-xml column=175?>lying empty. That was something that the delegates really wanted me to
draw to the attention of the Minister. Perhaps wider local economic
benefit could be taken into account in calculating best
value—using the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, for
example—in the sale and reuse of such public assets in and
around town centres. How can we achieve this?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112861000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112861000044">I wish to
touching briefly on charity shops. Their role in the vibrancy of town
centres was something of a controversial subject among the delegates,
perhaps shrouded in anecdote. It was suggested that more informed
research was needed. Although there are negative aspects, including
rate relief—especially relating to the sale of new
products—and the clustering of charity shops in prime retail
locations, on the positive side, charities and social enterprises
occupy empty units, diversify town centres and, in some instances,
provide a broad range of services beyond retail. I have been involved
for several years in a charity shop in Widnes that occupies a former
empty jeweller’s shop. At the back of the town centre, we
provide drug addiction advice, debt advice, pregnancy counselling and
free legal aid. To inform the work of the future high streets forum,
what objective research is undertaken to understand and inform policy
and good practice on the impact of charity shops and social enterprises
on town centre
vitality?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112861000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112861000045">Finally,
I am sure that the Minister would not want me to speak in his presence
without referring to local plans, the national planning policy
framework and town centres. The delegates acknowledged the potential
benefit of new funding sources through the community infrastructure
levy, which they welcomed, but there was strong consensus that the
application of localism through neighbourhood planning and wider
community rights could provide new opportunities for local businesses
and community groups to determine the vitality of their town
centres.</hs_Para>

there were concerns that local proposals for sustainable business
development were being overruled by proposals from large retailers and
housing developers. I know of a situation near me in Tattenhall, west
Cheshire, where a neighbourhood plan on whose creation local groups
spent an enormous amount, including for a local referendum, is now
being challenged through the courts by a major
developer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112861000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0001.htm#13112861000047">There
is widespread concern that the continuing lack of agreed local plans
leaves communities open to any development that is
proposed—developments need only meet the NPPF
requirements—and about the fact that town plans are being
ignored when planning appeals take place. I refer the Minister once
again to the plight of Sandbach, where some 500 properties will now be
developed on the wrong side of the town centre, causing considerable
congestion and other difficulties. Sandbach townsfolk do not object to
development, but they want it in the right place. If only we could have
waited until the local plan was finalised, that development would have
been in the right place. What can be done to ensure that local
community and business engagement in neighbourhood planning for
sustainable growth is not overruled by the inconsistent application of
the NPPF, and particularly by the financial resources of major
developers?</hs_Para>

although it is not in my constituency, is incredibly important. Like
other Members, I am committed to our town centres. I spent some time
working in the US many years ago, and I was staggered when I asked the
people I was living with, “Where is the town centre?” and
they looked at me and said, “What do you mean?” I said,
“Where is it? There must be one. I’ve walked and walked
until the pavement ran out”—the town was Hamilton, New
Jersey. The community just did not have a town centre. I was on a

“Edinburg street” in New Jersey.</hs_Para>

the thought that town centres in many places had either closed down or
simply did not exist was alien to me, but that was a number of years

jobs. I concur with other Members about the importance of retail jobs.
My first job at 12 was being a paperboy, but at 15, I got a job in a

local town centres have been supported strongly by the local council. I
want to highlight several examples from North Lincolnshire council that
could be applied nationally and that show what can be achieved for our
town centres when local authorities and town centre retailers work in
partnership. When we took control of my town council in 2011, we were
swift in removing parking charges in Brigg. Since then, the council has
introduced free parking periods, with the strong support of the
<I>Scunthorpe Telegraph</I>, an excellent local newspaper. We have
extended free parking into Scunthorpe, and I hope we can go further. It
was the previous Labour council, sadly, that imposed charges in
Brigg.</hs_Para>

of those measures came home to me during the first Christmas after we
removed the charges in 2011. I went to open Santa’s shack in
Brigg, in one of our famous hardware stores—other options are
available, of course—and the manager of the shop said to me,
“You wouldn’t believe the impact the free parking period
has had.” People are not fearful of being ticketed. They
understand the rules, and they know that they can come into Brigg and
shop for two hours, so they do not drive to an out-of-town centre on
the edge of Scunthorpe or elsewhere; they come into Brigg to do their
shopping. We should not underestimate the value of free
parking.</hs_Para>

underestimate the value of reasonable parking attendants. Epworth is
having a big problem, and retail businesses are struggling. Retailers
have been to see me, and I have got the council to agree to review the
aggressive enforcement of parking rules that is driving people out of
our town centres. Free periods are a good start, but after two hours
when the free period expires, parking attendants must be
reasonable.</hs_Para>

to a little campaign that I ran with Goole town centre, a local council

the East Riding of Yorkshire part of my constituency. I took the idea
to North Lincolnshire council, which has agreed to roll out wi-fi to
all our town centres to support local businesses. Many of our towns,
such as Epworth, have burgeoning café and food outlet
environments, which I strongly support. They have said to me that
having free wi-fi has been important in Goole. People come in, sit
there and use it with their tablets out, and they buy an extra coffee

small retailers. We had a bit of a spike in Epworth not so long ago. I

to get £45,000 out of the council to install CCTV cameras in
Epworth town centre, which retailers have welcomed. We also got the

Sometimes, retailers say, “The council is not doing enough for
us,” and sometimes the council says, “Oh, well, retailers
are just complaining about parking, yet again. It’s the usual
thing,” or, “They’re complaining about
litter.” When we park all those traditional tussles and replace
them with proper partnership working, we can achieve a great deal. We

museums, bowling alleys and so on put together, but the situation is
not inevitable. Positive interventions can be made, and we should not
accept the automatic decline of our high street due to trends of online
shopping and so on. We have to make the right interventions, and they

address the challenges facing the sector. Grimsey set an objective to

housing, education, arts, entertainment, business and office space,
health and leisure provision and, of course, shops.
He<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:07:35"></hs_TimeCode> also

of the answer, undoubtedly, is to enable change of use for premises.
What the Government are doing on change of use, however, is making
things worse, not better. We know that the consequence of the
Government’s changes, particularly those since May, has been to
allow more bookies and payday lenders to set up shop on our high
streets. The Government are taking away from local authorities the
ability to shape what is happening on their high street and to respond
to community demand, yet we know that communities want their local
authorities to have more control of high street
improvement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112861000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0002.htm#13112861000079">A
recent survey by Deloitte shows that 73% of people want customers to
have a strong role in shaping the high street, and 47% want local
authorities to be able to do that. Only 13% want landlords to be able
to shape what happens on the high street, yet that is exactly what we
have ended up with under this Government. Because planning permission
is no longer required for many changes of use on our high street, our
local authorities and communities have no ability to shape what is
happening. That is the exact opposite of the approach that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:11:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers) suggests, which is that local
authorities should have powers to shape what happens on the high

hon. Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) made an excellent point on
local authorities using social value clauses to help, for example,
local people set up start-up units—there would be more pop-up
shops. That is exactly the set of uses that local authorities might
want on their high street, but if it is simply left to the market to
say how empty properties will be used or changed, we are not likely to
get the sorts of premises that local people
want.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112861000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0002.htm#13112861000081">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:12:46"></hs_TimeCode>
is likely to happen, as I witnessed when I visited Woolwich high street
last week, is that in a row of 16 shops, nine will be payday loan
companies or bookies. Local people told me that they are very unhappy
with the situation. They said that, in the past couple of years, the
council had indeed spent money on the town square but that it was being

diversification on our high street. People are telling us clearly that

hope the Minister will help us to understand how the
Government’s approach will assist with that diversification,
because I cannot see that approach operating in practice. In fact, we
know from across the country that the opposite is happening. The
Government could do more. The Government must urgently address change
of use and the relaxation of permitted development, and they must give
local authorities and communities real powers to shape their high
street. That is urgent, but the Government need to do other things.

recent report by the Centre for Cities claims that the biggest factor
affecting the success or failure of our high street is the overall

rates, increasing rents and higher energy costs, all of which are

hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes described the changing shape of
the high street. He mentioned the small business rate relief, and I am
proud that the Government have trebled that to over £900 million
to help businesses right across the country. He makes a fair point
about how retail is changing and how retail spaces in many areas need
to shrink. I am pleased that we are consulting on the flexibility to
change retail spaces back to residential use, which would increase
footfall in our town centres and allow them to reflect the change
towards leisure and
hospitality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:22:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112861000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/halltext/131128h0002.htm#13112861000100">Hair

streets forum. I am looking at its membership and want to change it
slightly to reflect the hospitality and leisure aspect of high streets,

did  we proudly cut our costs by 60%, but we also have a 
<?notus-xml column=184?>pop-up shop, which I recommend for hon. Members’ Christmas

Great<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:23:38"></hs_TimeCode> Yarmouth,

rates, about which I do get comments from time to time. We must
appreciate that not only do we have the autumn statement next
week—I would not want to prejudge what the Chancellor will
say—but that retail is only one part of business rates. When we
looked at the revaluation, we found that there would have been 800,000
losers and just 300,000 winners, of which retail would have been one,
as would much of the hospitality and leisure industries. We must be
cautious when making presumptions about business rates, but we can
discuss that another time. I outlined the matter during Communities and
Local Government questions on

partnerships, which should, where relevant, consider town centres as

the town centre can actually be part of what will attract a company to

the Member for Congleton mentioned research, and Demos is currently
carrying out some on this very issue. Good charity shops can play an
important role in the community. They receive both good and bad press,
but any kind of retail outlet on the high street can be good or bad
depending on how it is presented and looked after. Charity shops
sometimes offer coffee facilities and can also get involved running

The town centre is an important source of employment in the community
and can provide a fantastic career path. Despite the numbers of people
employed in hospitality and retail in this country, we often undervalue
the sector and do not promote enough just what a fantastic career it
can be. Someone starting out in retail could end up in the House of
Commons, which could happen to anyone, or they could have a fantastic
career in retail, which goes across many different organisations, or
they could be an entrepreneur running their own independent
business—hopefully benefiting from the Government’s small

conclusion, our town centres have a really good opportunity as we move

tread a careful line. We want not to interfere and create false

problem facing our cattle farmers today, with more than 305,000 cattle
slaughtered in Great Britain in the past decade alone. These plans are
designed to address the risk of cattle-to-cattle transmission of the
disease. They form part of the Government’s wider strategy for

I am announcing our approach for addressing a number of long-standing
weaknesses in our bovine TB controls. The first concerns the problem of
late TB tests by a small minority of cattle farmers. Late testing is
unacceptable, so from 1 January 2014 anyone who fails to complete their
test by the set deadline, even by one day, will see their CAP scheme
payment reduced. The reductions will vary, depending on the seriousness
of the case, but the outcome I want to see is no late testing at

am also launching a consultation on proposals for further tightening of
cattle controls. Our proposals build on the raft of enhanced cattle
measures that have been in place for many years, a number of which were
enhanced in 2012. They include abolishing the pre-movement testing
exemption for movements of cattle to and from common land. In doing
this, we will need  to find ways of ensuring that the testing
requirements do not prejudice the very important part that grazing on
some commons plays in protecting and maintaining valuable
habitats.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13112851000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/wmstext/131128m0001.htm#13112851000053">The

final proposal in this consultation is designed to respond to the
Members of this House, and their constituents, who have pressed the
Government to make available information on the location of bovine TB
herd breakdowns, so that livestock farmers are better equipped to deal

trading scheme launched earlier this month, which encourages farmers to
share details of the disease history of any cattle they sell so buyers
are better able to manage any disease
risks.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13112851000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/wmstext/131128m0001.htm#13112851000056">I

Cairo. Former Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, right hon.
Alistair Burt MP raised the issue during an official visit to Israel in

following up on these discussions by looking at the possibility of
providing practical support to Eritrea’s anti-trafficking and

One of the working groups of the Action Group will be mandated to

remittances to Somalia through secure, legitimate and accessible
channels. This working group will consider, among other things, the
impact that changes in the money service business sector might have on
Somalia's wider stability and economic development. In the meantime,

so significantly in the near future. Nor is there any evidence that the

identified on cattle farms in the Lune Valley of North Lancashire. The
first case was detected at the end of last year near Kirkby Lonsdale.
In line with DEFRA's new policy for the low TB risk areas of England,
the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) instigated
a programme of enhanced TB testing of all cattle herds situated within
a 3 km radius of the index infected farm. The additional targeted TB
testing has revealed a small number of additional infected herds in the
area and the 3 km cattle testing zone has been widened as a result
across North Lancashire and south Cumbria. At the end of July, a total
of five “confirmed” TB breakdowns had been identified in
this cluster, including the original case. Epidemiological
investigations by AHVLA into the origin of these TB breakdowns are

problems of fly grazing, but no specific assessment has been made on
the extent of the problem in the north-east. There is a range of
existing legislation that can be used to deal with the issues,
including the Animals Act 1971 and the Animal Welfare Act 2006. In

existing anti-social behaviour legislation and forthcoming measures in

by-catch mitigation measures and protected species licensing) are
likely to be the most effective tools in conserving widely dispersed
and mobile species. However, Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) for such
species would be considered if there is clear evidence that the
conservation of a highly mobile species would benefit from site-based
protection measures in English waters. The need for MCZs for seabirds
will be considered when work to develop Special Protection Areas for
birds under the EU Wild Birds Directive has been completed. The mobile

issues raised by the Age Cymru campaign. As was discussed during the
recent Westminster Hall debate, we have put a number of measures in
place to address the criminal behaviour behind these postal internet
and doorstep scams. This included a round table meeting on 25 November,
chaired by my noble Friend Baroness Randerson, which brought together
organisations from across Wales, including enforcement and consumer
protection agencies, Royal Mail, BT and Ofcom, to discuss how we can
work together to reduce older people's exposure to such

broadly, the National Trading Standards Board has set up the National
Scams Hub (NSH) which is hosted by East Sussex Trading Standards
Service. The NSH are working with partners including Action Fraud, the
Royal Mail and the Metropolitan police to identify and to support the
victims of mass marketing fraud. Once identified, the NSH works with
the victim's local Trading Standards service, local police forces and
other agencies to provide support which addressed the victim's
behaviour. The home authority reports to the NSH at four and 26 weeks
on the result of the

this, the Consumer Protection Partnership, which brings together the
government-funded consumer organisations, has identified mass marketing
scams as an area where there is significant consumer detriment and,

reviewing the level of resources it requires to examine local plans,
and as part of this it monitors the expected date for the submission of
plans for examination. It carries out these ongoing assessments with a
view to closely matching the number of trained inspectors and other
staff to anticipated workload. Current information suggests an ongoing
requirement of about 25 full-time equivalent inspectors. The Planning
Inspectorate is currently recruiting additional inspectors on fixed
term contracts to ensure it can satisfy forecast demand, and help local
councils finalise their up-to-date local plans to shape where
development should and should not
go.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13112883000290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/text/131128w0001.htm#13112883000290"><B><Member PimsId="1576" UID="13112883000619" xid="371" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/text/131128w0001.htm#13112883000619">Peter

are currently examining 80 local plans. These plans include core
strategies, comprehensive local plans, area action plans, minerals
plans and other more focused development plan documents. A total of 44
inspectors (some of whom are part-time) are working on these
examinations, 23 are conducting more than one examination concurrently.
For example, some inspectors are examining more than one plan within a

Brokenshire:</Member></B> The coalition agreement is clear that the UK
will not participate in any European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO).
The UK has also not opted in to the European Commission's parallel
proposal to reform Eurojust. One of the Government's considerations in
taking that decision was to ensure that we have clarity about the
relationship between Eurojust and the EPPO, including any exchange of
personal data between the organisations. The Government has undertaken
to review its decision on participation in a reformed Eurojust, in
consultation with Parliament, at the point the new regulation is
adopted. The future direction of the EPPO is currently unclear pending
a decision by the Commission on whether to maintain, amend or withdraw
the proposal following the yellow card issued by national Parliaments
challenging the proposal on the grounds of
subsidiarity.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13112883000043" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/text/131128w0001.htm#13112883000043">Flexible

energy bills in three basic ways: through direct financial support,
with energy efficiency initiatives and by boosting competition. With
the winter fuel payment, with the warm home discount, and with cold

billion on direct subsidies to reduce bills. With the Energy Company

suppliers to incorporate the costs of contracts for difference in the
charges made for the supply of electricity to EIIs as contracts for

the most expensive legal aid systems in the world and in the current
challenging economic climate we cannot continue to sustain this type of
spending. It is essential that resources are focused on cases where
legal aid is most needed—that is where people's life or liberty
is at stake, where they are at risk of serious physical harm or
immediate loss of their home, or where their children may be taken into
care. Even after all of our changes we will still have one of the most

Poulter:</Member></B> The financial cost of missed appointments is very
complex to calculate, for example resources wasted or time lost due to
missed appointments can be offset by national health service staff
using the time productively in other ways, such as seeing other
patients. The cost of introducing a system to gather information would
therefore be disproportionate. Locally, NHS organisations should be
seeking to understand and address how best to achieve reductions in
missed appointments in their

and have recently made a visit. The rains started late and the current
estimates are that the number in need of food assistance may rise from
the existing 850,000 across Kenya. UKAid is already supporting
programmes in Northern Kenya to address this vulnerability by providing
regular cash payments and livelihood support to some of the poorest
families so that they can better cope with droughts and supporting
health facilities so they have capacity to treat and prevent acute
malnutrition in children. There are plans in place to scale up these 
<?notus-xml column=420?>programmes if the situation worsens. The region also hosts some 525,000
refugees and UKAid is providing £39.2 million over three years
to support their assistance needs (including £3.2 million in

malnourished children and mothers). DFID is pressing other donors to do

Gambling Commission. Betting in-running is legal under the 2005
Gambling Act and the Gambling Commission's current position, after much
consideration and public consultation, is that the risk to the
licensing objectives is adequately mitigated by ensuring that consumers
are warned about the potential disadvantage to which they may expose
themselves if they choose to bet in this way. However, the Gambling
Commission continues to monitor evidence in this area and to observe
developments which might have a bearing on that

October, the BBC announced plans to extend coverage for its national

have always said that FM will continue to be an appropriate platform
for smaller commercial stations and community radio. The vast majority
of digital radio sets have FM included and this is mandated in the
minimum technical specifications drawn up by industry as part of the
Digital Radio Action Plan. This means that listeners who switch to
digital radio will still be able to get local services on FM. We
recognise the desire from small local and community radio stations to
have a pathway onto the DAB platform and are working with Ofcom on
examining the potential of new small scale DAB solutions following a

Vaizey:</Member></B> Slamming, when a fixed-line telephone service is
transferred by a gaining provider without express knowledge and consent
is prohibited under General Condition 24 of Ofcom's General Conditions
of Entitlement (GCE). GCE is the regulatory framework under which
telecommunications network and service providers are required to
operate in the UK. Section 45 of the Communications Act 2003 provides
Ofcom with the power to set such binding conditions and Section 96 of
the Communications Act 2003 provides for Ofcom to issue penalties for
breach of General Conditions. Ofcom can, and do, fine companies for
slamming and most recently fined Supatel (trading as TimeTalk)
£60,000 in June of this year for breach of General Condition
24.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112888000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/text/131128w0002.htm#13112888000258">Ofcom
rules explicitly prohibit all telephone companies from engaging in
inappropriate sales and marketing activity, and include requirements
around obtaining consent and the type of information that needs to be
made available to consumers when selling services. Where Ofcom
identifies clear breaches of the rules, it can take enforcement action,
and has powers to fine companies and require them to remedy the
consequences of any
breach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112888000259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/text/131128w0002.htm#13112888000259">There
are also a number of safeguards built into the switching process which
are specifically designed to protect consumers from both slamming and
erroneous transfers, including that consumers should receive a letter
informing them of the imminent takeover of their service, with a 10-day
switchover period during which the order can be
stopped.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112888000260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/text/131128w0002.htm#13112888000260">Ofcom
is also carrying out a review of switching processes to ensure that
switching is easy, hassle-free and works well for consumers. Better
protection for consumers from the risks of slamming and erroneous
transfers is a key focus of the review and Ofcom has put forward
proposals for mandating two key requirements on telephone companies
which are designed to address erroneous transfers associated with home
moves. Ofcom has also committed to look at this issue further in the
next phase of its work on
switching.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_28_PT_1/1DFA58275F1886AF8AF75E13702B53A2AB5AAEFB" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="28 November 2013">Thursday

an immediate investigation was launched following a precautionary
landing of a Sea King Mk 5 aircraft from HMS Gannet on 13 October 2013.
The investigation was carried out by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and
AgustaWestland, the Design Organisation for the aircraft, and concluded
that the risk of this type of fault leading to a serious safety issue
is very low. As a precaution, an inspection regime has been instigated
to inspect and monitor the gearboxes of all of the MOD Sea King

Secretary of Defence have not discussed the UK building ships for the
US Navy. The UK is inhibited by the restrictions imposed by US Act of
Congress 7309. This Act forbids the construction of a military vessel
(or any substantial part thereof) at a foreign yard unless authorised
by the President, in the interests of national security. Legal
restrictions also exist on the leasing of foreign vessels by the US
military.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311291000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131128/text/131128w0003.htm#1311291000334">The
