steps to make it easier to make a lasting power of attorney. First, the
Office of the Public
Guardian<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode> has
released a test version of a digital tool which allows donors to make
lasting powers of attorney online. Secondly, it has redesigned its
paper forms to make them easier to follow and is consulting on
proposals to combine the application processes of the two types of
lasting power of attorney and to introduce a digital signature. The fee
for registering a lasting power of attorney has been reduced from
£130 to £110 from 1 October this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000004"><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Trumpington" PimsId="4341" UID="1311117000238" xid="1165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000238"><B>Baroness

who has told who about that reduction because I was quoted £200
by the lawyers. Many women, and maybe men as well, are thoroughly put
off by the amount of money it will cost simply to do what one used to
do. If the Minister asks his more elderly relations he may find out
that one used to get a bit of paper, write on it “I give you
power of attorney”, sign it and send it to the bank—that
is all you had to do. This whole business seems to me unnecessarily
expensive and time-consuming. I ask whether we might return to having a
simple piece of paper.</hs_para>

Baroness that the number of older relations I have is becoming
increasingly small. I take the point that she made, but we also have to
be careful in dealing with matters where often quite considerable sums,
in terms of inheritance, are in question. There has to be an orderly
process that can be much better checked than the noble
Baroness’s scrap of paper with a line on it. We are
trying—and the Office of the Public Guardian is making every
effort—to consult on this, and the consultations end on 26
November. We are trying to simplify and make it easier for people to do
this without having to pay expensive legal
fees.</hs_para>

Boothroyd (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, this is the document to register
power of attorney: it is 12 pages chock-full of questions, cautions and
warnings. It is the most verbose document that I have had to deal with
either for myself or for those I have represented in over 30 years in
public life. Of course there must be safeguards in all this. A doctor
has certified in this document that I am capable of making
decisions—I have all my marbles. Why then do I have to name from
two to five people to be told that I am registering power of attorney
so that they can object to it? Why? Can this bundle of red tape and
jargon not be withdrawn, consolidated in a new draft and put in the
Library so that I and people such as the noble Baroness, Lady
Trumpington, who said it all, and lots of other people who might want
to see this—solicitors and what have you—can inject some
common sense into it?</hs_para>

emphasise ends on 26 November. The reason for the

there were, and continue to be, complaints about how complex this

Turner of Camden (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very glad to hear
from the Minister that simplification is intended. Recently I have had
to deal with these complications because unfortunately my sister is in
the early stages of Alzheimer’s and it has become necessary for
me to find somebody to assume the power of attorney in that case. It is
not easy. It is not only complicated and expensive but the person whom
you nominate, and who has been nominated by me via our lawyers to
handle the power of attorney, has his own job to get on with. It is
also very time-consuming for the person who assumes it. I am grateful
that a relative of mine has taken on this task, but it needed a bit of
persuasion. It is not only the expense; it is also the time involved in
doing it. It is important that it be really simplified so that people
can take this job on. This is increasingly important as we are dealing
with an older population in which people require this kind of service
as simply and quickly as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000009"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T14:49:55"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="1311117000243" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000243">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Baroness has put her finger
right on it. We all know the change in the structure of the population
that is going on. I am always amazed when I am in the corridor and pass
a colleague who I know is as old as I am and who says,
“I’ve got to go and visit Mother this weekend”.
That is one of the responsibilities; and because of these increasing
responsibilities, we have to make sure that as well as making this
process simple, we also make it fraud-proof. That is the balance that
we are trying to

Phillips of Sudbury (</B><B>LD</B><B>):</B></Member> My Lords, I am
taking my life in my hands a bit by confronting the two noble
Baronesses but, as an old solicitor, I wonder if my noble friend Lady
Trumpington has taken account of the fact that the piece of paper that
she so rightly 
<?notus-xml column=503?>said she could sign and waft off is still available to her. She can
still go to a stationer and buy a general power of attorney for a
pound, and that is all that she will need to pay. The problem is that
the lasting power of attorney created in 2007 deals with people who
have lost their capacity to command and deal with their own affairs.
That is a hypersensitive issue, and within a family many people might
be deeply uneasy about who gets that power, particularly in terms of
life and death issues. Perhaps the answer is not as simple as it might
at first
appear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="1311117000245" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000245">Lord

Accounts Act was passed in November 2008 and included a requirement for
the Government to undertake a review. The legislation set out the
specific questions that the review should cover: for example, how many
banks and building societies have transferred balances; how much money
has been transferred and how promptly; and how effective the
arrangements have been for meeting claims. HM Treasury is currently

between protecting civil liberties and reducing burdens on business and
enabling enforcers to tackle rogue traders. Requiring enforcers to give
48 hours’ notice before carrying out routine
inspections will benefit businesses by making it more convenient for
them to accommodate these inspections. However, notice need not be
given, for example, where it would defeat the purpose of the visit, as
when a breach is suspected, such as with counterfeit

UK’s nuclear new-build programme. Investor confidence continues
to grow with projects being taken forward by three consortia. These

Recently, one of the EDF executives called into question the competence
of the UK to supply high-tech equipment for the Hinkley C power
station. This contradicts a current capability report of the Nuclear
Industry Association, which maintains that, apart from a few
large-scale items, the UK could supply almost all of the mechanical and
electrical equipment, including the controls and the instrumentation.
There are some essential misgivings concerning the possible wilful
exclusion of competent UK suppliers. Will the Minister declare more

a key growth industry that provides highly skilled jobs. The 16

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:58:22"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, the
Government are investing £470 million during this spending
review period to help prevent and to tackle homelessness. This
investment has meant that the average time spent in temporary
accommodation by those families who are at risk of becoming homeless
has reduced from 20 months at the start of 2010 to 13 months as of
September this

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for that reply, which, frankly, I do not believe addresses the
seriousness of the current situation. Shelter estimates that this
Christmas 80,000 children in Great Britain will wake up homeless. The
number of families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation is the highest
for nearly 10 years, with some 40% having to stay beyond the legal
limit of six weeks, and more than 11,000 homeless households have been
based in temporary accommodation in another area. All of this is
damaging and disruptive to children’s health, to their education
and to family life. I ask the Minister how the costs of all this to
families, communities and society are weighed against the benefit
restrictions that are fuelling the homelessness
crisis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:07:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" PimsId="5900" UID="1311117000281" xid="2111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000281">Baroness
Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, all of us are concerned to
protect children and, thankfully, in this country we have a strong
homelessness safety net, which is protected in law and ensures that
families with children at risk of being homeless always have a roof
over their head. As I said in my original Answer to the noble Lord, we
have invested £470 million in preventing homelessness. Our
effort is very much around preventing and avoiding people being put at
risk in the first instance, but we are also working very closely with
councils to ensure that they are properly equipped to provide the
support that is necessary to anyone who is at risk at any time, never
mind whether it is at Christmas or
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:24:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:08:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000046"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Brinton" PimsId="5945" UID="1311117000282" xid="2149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000282">Baroness

considerable anecdotal evidence of the health and education problems

unacceptable would be for any child to have no roof whatever over their
head. If a child is at serious risk and the only option available to a
local authority in an emergency is bed-and-breakfast accommodation,
then, as long as it is for the barest minimum time possible, that is
preferable to no accommodation whatever. However, clearly it should be
for the very minimum amount of
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:10:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point, and of course we are working very hard to ensure that there is
as little disruption as possible. It is perhaps worth saying to your
Lordships that there is clearly great pressure on London versus the
rest of the UK. I think that the term we are talking about is
“out-of-district placements”, where people are moved from
one district to another. However, it is worth noble Lords being aware
that information collected by London Councils shows that, of the moves
from one district to another, most are within London and only a very
small percentage are necessarily outside

Crosby who his clients within the company are. That is because, as the

between government and the lobbying industry. We have just heard about
the appointment of a former lobbyist, who also happened to be a
Conservative campaigns officer, to oversee public appointments, which
sounds to me like double jeopardy. The Civil Service Code states that
Whitehall mandarins should be politically independent—a former
Conservative worker does not look too independent. The lobbying

Textor this morning and I can assure the noble Baroness that it would
be caught by the new register, since it has offices in both Sydney and
London, and would be forced to register and declare its clients under
the new Part 1. That is part of what the Bill is about and Crosby
Textor would therefore be entirely covered by it. The question of what
happens when a member of a consulting company is employed under a
contract part-time—as he is—by one of the political
parties in government, takes us close to the difficult area of how far
political parties in government should be covered by this scheme. I
have checked and I can assure the noble Baroness that he has not
discussed the tobacco question with the Government. I realise that the
tobacco question—I was not so aware of the alcohol
question—is very sensitive in government. I merely say that Part
1 of the Bill would catch Crosby Textor. We would then know exactly who
its clients were; that is part of the justification of Part

who then leave government and go back into these sorts of activities,

making the same declarations as we are now asking for from Ministers. I

had two days of intensive negotiations with Iran which finished in the

Government are firmly in favour of reaching an interim agreement with
Iran as an essential step towards a comprehensive settlement, but given
the extensive nature of Iran’s programme and the history of its

agreement has to be clear and detailed, cover all aspects of
Iran’s programme and give assurance to the whole world that the
threat of nuclear proliferation in Iran is fully addressed. Such a deal
is on the table and there is no doubt in my mind that it can be
reached. I am convinced that the agreement we were discussing would be

22 October I hosted a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the 11
countries of the core group of the Friends of Syria, as well as the
president and the senior leadership of the Syrian National Coalition.
We gave our united support to the UN-led Geneva II process, which
should establish a transitional governing body with full executive
powers, formed by mutual consent. There was unanimous agreement that
Assad and his close associates can play no role in a body formed by
mutual consent. We also agreed to provide the national coalition with
additional political and practical support to give the Geneva

done that, which I strongly welcome. Last night, its members agreed by
consensus at a general assembly to attend the Geneva talks, on the
basis that this meant that Assad and those with blood on their hands
would have no role in a transition. They also rightly called for
humanitarian access and the release of detainees ahead of Geneva II. We
continue to push for a date for a peace conference to be agreed, and

light of that decision by the coalition, we will provide practical and
political support to help them prepare to lead the opposition
delegation. I will shortly lay before Parliament a proposal to increase
our non-lethal support to the Supreme Military Council of General
Idris. This life-saving equipment will take the form of communications,
medical and logistics equipment. There can be no peaceful settlement to
the conflict in Syria without a strong role for the legitimate,

also particularly determined to ensure that the peace talks include a
direct role for women’s groups, in accordance with Security
Council decisions on women, peace and security. It is vital that women
participate fully in the future government and institutions of Syria,

reconciling Syrian society. We are ready to work with Mr Brahimi, his
team, international NGOs and other countries to make that a reality. We
will also work with the UN and its agencies to ensure that we give the
women’s groups the support they need to participate effectively.

Bach (Lab):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
repeating the Foreign Secretary’s Statement in another place,
and I also thank the Government for advance sight of the Statement
itself. On both issues there have been some significant and important
recent developments, and we very much welcome the fact that the Foreign
Secretary chose to come to Parliament today to update the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000104">On Iran,
I start by also paying tribute to the efforts of our colleague and
former Leader of the House, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of
Upholland, who, as the Minister said, clearly played a crucial role in
driving forward these latest talks. I also pay tribute to the clear
commitment shown by all of the P5 plus one leaders in attendance at
Geneva. We remain of the view that the UK Government should continue to
pursue the twin-track approach of sanctions and diplomacy. President
Rouhani campaigned—and, of course, was elected in June this
year—on a platform of taking the steps necessary to ease the
pressure that sanctions are currently putting on the Iranian economy.
We believe that sanctions have been effective, and continue to be
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000105">Of
course, alongside continued sanctions, sustained diplomatic engagement
remains key. We welcome the Government’s announcement today that
a chargé d’affaires has been appointed, and we wish him
well. Yet it is a matter of real regret that, despite historic progress
at this weekend’s talks, they did not succeed in producing an
agreement. The Minister knows that reports emerged over the weekend
describing a French veto which prevented any deal from being signed,
and yet this morning Secretary of State Kerry said of the
deal,</hs_para>

signed off on it, we signed off on it, and everybody agreed it was a
fair proposal. There was unity, but Iran couldn’t take it at
that particular moment, they weren't able to accept that particular
thing”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="1311117000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000106">In
the light of these differing reports, I wonder whether the Minister
would set out what the British Government believe were the key barriers
which prevented a deal being reached this weekend. Can she also set out
what steps are now being taken to help agree a deal that is likely to
secure the support of all parties in the next round of talks? In
particular, given the reported disagreements over Iran’s
plutonium production capabilities, can she set out whether she expects
that stopping or simply delaying the development of Iran’s
reactor at Arak will be a component of any future deal?</hs_para>

understandable that as the terms of a deal begin to emerge, it will
become increasingly called into question by those parties which have a
higher stake in these important issues. In the light of 
<?notus-xml column=520?>that, can the Minister set out what assurances have been offered to
regional partners, in particular to Israel, which are concerned that
the principle of an interim deal will by definition not provide
sufficient guarantees that Iran will cease all activity which could
contribute to developing a nuclear weapons capacity? Is there any
possibility that a deal is in principle achievable and does that mean
that there is an urgency to test what is now deliverable in practice?
We welcome the commitment, of course, to renewing talks between
negotiators on 20 November. Can the Minister set out whether any plans
are in place for renewing talks at Foreign Minister
level?</hs_para>

the Minister made really clear in repeating the Statement this
afternoon, the humanitarian situation in Syria remains desperate and
continues to worsen. Only today, Human Rights Watch published a report
documenting the continued use of incendiary weapons in Syria and last
week the UN confirmed that 40% of Syrians are now in need of
assistance. Clearly, the most effective way to ease the suffering is to
end the war itself but while efforts to broker a peace deal continue,
it is vital that the international community lives up to its
responsibilities to protect those most in need. We on this side welcome
the important work that Her Majesty’s Government have been doing
but, despite our country’s contribution, the United Nations
appeal is still less than half funded. Can the Minister set out what
steps the Government will be taking to try to help ensure that other
donors now deliver on their unfulfilled pledges?</hs_para>

However, given that the OPCW team confirmed that it was not able to
visit two out of the 23 chemical weapons sites in Syria because they
were too dangerous, can the Minister say what assurances are being

their further significant work in conflict zones across the

real breakthrough needed that would improve the situation on the ground
is, of course, a diplomatic one. That is why we welcome the recent
focus that the international community has shown on trying to secure a
date for the next round of the Geneva talks. It is indeed welcome that
the SNC has today voted to accept the invitation to attend Geneva 2 as
the representatives of the Syrian opposition. However, as its
acceptance is conditional on the granting of humanitarian corridors by
the Syrian regime, can the Minister set out the Government’s
present assessment of the likelihood of that condition being
met?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311117000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000111">In the

still offers the best prospect for securing a more stable

this stage we do not recognise such a right, but we have repeatedly
said that once Iran addresses the international community’s
concerns, its nuclear programme will be treated in the same manner as
that of any other non-nuclear weapons state that is party to the NPT.
This is the position of the E3+3. I shall not be drawn into the detail
of the discussions on Arak at this stage. We want the negotiations to
reap results and have agreed with Iran that proceedings will remain
confidential. We are clear that there are a number of areas where gaps
between the positions of the parties remain, but as I have said these
gaps are now narrower and we need to maintain the momentum for
negotiations. Iran needs to reflect seriously on its position before
the next round of talks later this
month.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000115">We are
also clear that we will agree a deal only if it offers us real
assurance regarding the whole of Iran’s nuclear programme. A

diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue and vital now to
maintain that momentum. Partners in the region understand that this is

relation to Syria, the noble Lord is right. There is still a severe
shortfall in humanitarian access and support. We pushed successfully
for further progress at the G20 and at the UN General Assembly, where
more than $1 billion of new funding was pledged by the international
community. This was a step in the right direction, but we accept that
more needs to be done. The presidential statement has been helpful to
some extent in supporting this progress, but the noble Lord may be
aware that there is a further donor conference taking place in January
of next year. The UN has announced that that pledging conference will
be hosted by Kuwait around mid-January—on the 15th and 16th, we
think—and the UK will push for it to raise significant finance
to meet urgent humanitarian 
<?notus-xml column=522?>needs for Syria and the surrounding region. We will continue to lobby
our donor partners to put forward high and ambitious pledges to support
the Syrian people, but I accept that we are constantly playing catch-up

inspectors incredibly seriously, and we have seen real support and
assistance from the Syrian regime for the work that was set out for the
OPCW. Syria has declared a formal destruction plan and the OPCW is
analysing the documentation and seeking clarification where necessary.

Falkner of Margravine (LD):</Member></B> I, too, thank the senior
Minister for repeating the Statement in such a timely manner. Does she
agree that Iran is more relevant to securing international peace and
security than it has been for some time? This is a pivotal moment in
the history of the Middle East. Were a deal secured on the NPT, it
would give us an opportunity to restart discussions on a nuclear-free
Middle East. The Minister mentioned Syria, and Iran is key to a
negotiated settlement there. Is she able to tell the House what
discussions the Government are having with the United States? We hear
very disturbing reports about how the Senate is preparing to have
tougher sanctions against Iran here and now, in the next 10
days, before we can agree to the next round of discussions, and that
Congress and the Senate are prepared to continue to obstruct a deal. In
that case, should an obstruction of that kind occur, are there any
plans for European Union countries to move away from UN sanctions into
some other method of helping Iran, should a deal be
available?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000120"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="1311117000304" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000304">Baroness
Warsi:</Member></B> My noble friend makes an important point. We must
remember that it is because sanctions were imposed and were biting that
we have reached this stage. Sanctions have brought Iran to the
negotiating table in a serious way, so it is important that sanctions
remain until we reach agreement. I hear what the noble Baroness says
about the politics of what is happening in the US, but we feel that at
this stage we need to push to reach agreement, at least on first steps,
before any substantive discussions can take place in relation to
sanctions.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311117000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000121">I
accept that Iran is an important and vital issue on which we must move
forward, not just in the light of the nuclear issue but because of its
role in Syria. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, asked about the role of Iran
in any further discussions at Geneva II, and I think I did not answer.
No decision has been made at this stage about the participation of Iran
in Geneva II. 
<?notus-xml column=523?>The UN Security Council has agreed that the Geneva II
conference should implement the Geneva communiqué. At this
stage, Iran has not publicly endorsed the Geneva communiqué or
made it clear that it supports the purpose of Geneva II; it is hard to
see how it can play a constructive role without endorsing that
communiqué. We continue to have concern about fighters,
including the IRGC Quds force, which continue to operate within
Syria.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000122"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Elystan-Morgan" PimsId="3108" UID="1311117000305" xid="1811" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000305">Lord
Elystan-Morgan (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, like everyone else in this
House, I warmly welcome the fact that the negotiations gap between the
two parties seems to have narrowed very considerably. I shall make two
points to the Minister and ask her to regard them as chilling
realities. First, for 20 years, Iran has cheated time and again over
all negotiations relating to nuclear development—as far Arak is
concerned, there is no heavy water facility and, with regard to Natanz,
no question of enriching uranium—up to the point when it would
have been impossible and childish to have maintained such
denial.</hs_para>

thrust of negotiations in relation to Iran, with all that has been very
properly said about human rights, is to see to it that it does not
become a nuclear power. If it becomes a nuclear power, the Middle East
will be jeopardised with a ticking bomb under it. That must be avoided
at all
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000124"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="1311117000306" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000306">Baroness
Warsi:</Member></B> I take on board what the noble Lord said. Exactly
these kinds of concerns are uppermost in our minds when we are in
negotiations. I think that I can give the noble Lord some comfort by
saying that we feel that the new Iranian regime, following the election
of President Rouhani and the appointment of the new Iranian negotiating
team led by Foreign Minister Zarif, has taken a constructive approach.
We believe that Mr Zarif wants to resolve this problem and that he is
out to do a deal. We feel that Iran is under serious political and
economic pressure and that it recognises that it is in its interest to
reach an agreement with the E3+3. I hope that we will be able to reach
that point soon, but we take part in these negotiations with our eyes
wide open, and take fully into account the context in which we are
operating and have been operating for a number of
years.</hs_para>

Symons of Vernham Dean (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, is there not a
much more difficult problem about Iran? There are effectively two
Governments there. The Minister is talking about discussions taking
place under the Rouhani leadership, but back in Tehran, there is a
religious leadership that has already tried to rein in the new
Government back, in respect of the steps that they have taken towards
rapprochement with the rest of the world. What confidence can the
Minister—and, indeed, negotiators—have that any eventual
settlement will not simply be rejected by the religious leadership in
Iran, as it has already tried to distance itself from some of what is
going on?</hs_para>

question about Syria. In a former life, I was the envoy to Bashar
al-Assad and I had to deal with a lot of the people around him who were
deeply unpleasant, very sinister and, in many ways, far 
<?notus-xml column=524?>more unyielding than Bashar al-Assad. Can the Minister give us an
assurance that none of these people will be left to wield any power
when eventually we see the end of this regime? There have been
suggestions that the vice-president would have a role; the
vice-president whom I met was certainly not a man I would want to see
having any power in Syria in
future.</hs_para>

Warsi:</Member></B> The noble Baroness comes to these matters with
great experience and expertise. She has made valid points about the
different seats of power within Iran. At the moment, we feel that the
Foreign Minister and President Rouhani have a mandate under which they
are operating. We have had a number of meetings with them; the Foreign
Secretary has met the Foreign Minister on three separate occasions, and
we genuinely feel that progress was recently made in Geneva. The offer
on the table now being considered by the Iranians is something that
they will have to come back to discuss; it may well be that on 20
November we will be much clearer about how committed all aspects of the
Iranian seats of power are in taking this matter forward. At this
stage, however, we feel that progress has been made and that there is
an acceptance that this is in Iran’s interests.</hs_para>

the noble Baroness made an important point. It is why the statement
from the national coalition issued only yesterday said clearly that the
transitional council must not include al-Assad or others who have blood
on their hands. I think those are exactly the kind of individuals to
whom the noble Baroness refers.</hs_para>

Stirrup (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, it is of course right that we
should negotiate with Iran, with a clear eye and a suspicious mind.
Surely the point of the sanctions in the first place is to get the
Iranians to the negotiating table so that we can find some diplomatic
solution to their nuclear programme. We should, therefore, be
enthusiastic about the process, while being very suspicious about the
detail. With that in mind, the Minister has emphasised the united front
that our negotiators put up to Iran. That is not the perception one
gains from the media. Does the Minister agree that that is very
unhelpful, particularly as regards people such as the Israelis and the
US Congress, who are already suspicious of the process, and that
unhelpful and unguarded remarks made by people, such as those made by
the French Foreign Minister to journalists, are likely to damage our
cause rather than help
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000130"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="1311117000310" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000310">Baroness
Warsi:</Member></B> The noble and gallant Lord will be aware that a
number of tracks—sometimes bilateral and at other times
multilateral—usually take place before these
negotiations are finally concluded. It was important that the E3+3 came
to the same place and that they presented a united front. I assure the
noble and gallant Lord that that offer is now clear and that the E3+3
are all behind that united position. On sanctions, we are clear that
Iran needs to take concrete steps which give assurance and build trust;
by that I mean not words but actions. Once we see that change in
actions we will be ready to act proportionately and
respond.</hs_para>

Anderson of Swansea (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, on Palestine-Israel,
no doubt the noble Baroness will

Kerry, which warned of a possible future intifada. Is it correct that
because of the impasse, the Palestinians are now demanding that the
Americans take the lead, put their own proposals on the table
and press for them? On Syria, the noble Baroness spoke of
the legitimate moderate opposition. However, is
not the bulk of the fighting, and certainly of the effective fighting,
done by jihadists? How representative, in her view, are the people who
now speak for the opposition? Is it at all realistic to seek to have
peace talks without Iran, a key regional player, being

this Dispatch Box on a number of occasions over the past 12 months and
have said that this year is in many ways a definitive year for real
progress to be made. I am heartened by the incredible amount of
personal time and energy that Secretary Kerry has put into moving this
forward. I think we all accept that the Middle East peace
process is an intrinsic element of resolving the
tensions in the region. At this stage, we continue to support the
initiative led by Secretary Kerry in any way we can and are
asked to. The noble Lord makes an important point on the
opposition. Of course, I have read many papers and briefings on the
make-up of the opposition. There is the national coalition, the

negotiations with Iran, the Syrian conflict and the Israel-Palestine
negotiations. Is there scope for expanding the Geneva process to be
much more inclusive and to take these various things together because
they are interconnected? The Minister mentioned, for example, that the
Syrian National Coalition has recognised the Kurdish Syrian party and I
am sure that the Turkish Kurdish party and the Iraqi Kurds are also
trying to get together. We might be at a crucial juncture in the Middle

effect of the Bill is to ensure that voting papers and other
communications reach union members, and so give greater confidence that
members have the chance to participate in union affairs. There will be
a new statutory duty to provide the certification officer with an
annual membership audit certificate that provides an opinion on the
union register, with the larger unions having to appoint an independent
“assurer”—I have not come across that interesting
title before—and a duty for the certification officer to appoint
inspectors to investigate and make orders, and for those officials to
issue declarations and enforcement orders for non-compliance.

records defective? They are not perfect; I would be the first to
acknowledge that. How can they be? Unions collect their money in one of
three ways. The traditional way was through regular cash collections by
voluntary officials such as branch secretaries, shop stewards and
others. That is very difficult in some circumstances—in
construction, for example, with a fluid workforce and many people on
very short-term contracts. It is difficult in many other places, too,
as anybody who has ever collected money for a political party or a
voluntary organisation
knows<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:37:14"></hs_TimeCode>. The

second way to collect subs is by the so-called check-off
method<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:39:28"></hs_TimeCode>, using
deductions at source by an employer, for which the union usually pays
the employer a handling charge. In one of my other roles, helping to
secure auto-enrolment for pensions, we are having a lot of trouble with
the quality of employer payrolls. With some of them, as many as one in
four workers is not properly reflected on the payroll. I know that
unions and employers together have big problems handling the check-off.
In certain sectors, such as retail, there is a high turnover of labour:
a third of the members of USDAW, the main retail union, have to be
replaced each year just for membership numbers to stand
still<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:38:39"></hs_TimeCode>. Keeping
those records up to date is a huge administrative job. The employer is
probably paying a quarter in arrears anyway, so for a significant part
of the quarter a union may be some way out with its membership
register<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:38:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
third method is by direct debit and standing order. They tend to be

take into account the necessary changes to rule books. Some unions have
to have rules revision conferences and some have them only every five
years or so. It does not reflect the continuing cost of having the
assurer and annual audit done year after year. It is not only unions

information on union membership is very sensitive. Blacklists do exist.
Eight major construction companies have recently admitted that and more
than 2,000 workers are in line with legal cases against some of the
biggest household names in British construction. There are worries
about membership information finding its way to the unscrupulous end of
employers. Worries have been expressed by parliamentary committees
about breaching the confidentiality of union membership records. There

Part 3 in fact confers powers on state officials in relation to
voluntary organisations that seem odd in a liberal
democracy—organisations which, under these international
obligations, are protected from too much state interference. Only if
there is a proportionate need, is the theme running through them,
should curbs be brought in. I have not seen anybody yet demonstrate
that there is any sort of proportionate need. Therefore, in the period
between now and Report stage, we will be trying to raise general
awareness about Part 3 and its rather vindictive,

make the Bill less onerous, complicated and costly to unions and

on a Bill based on anti-union prejudice or are open to constructive
ideas. It seeks to do this by deleting the requirement on a union in
relation to these reporting periods—a duty to submit the

Turner of Camden (Lab):</Member></B> I rise to support these
amendments. This section of the Bill is yet more evidence of the
opposition of the Government to the interests and desires of ordinary
working people—to their need to organise to represent their
legitimate interests at a time when employment rights are constantly
under government attack. Now we have this attempted legislation, which
is a direct attack on unions and their ability to represent their
members and provide a service to them. There is already legislation in
place as we have heard, in the 1992 Act, which requires unions to
maintain a register of members with a certification officer in charge
of implementation. As my noble friend has pointed out, there have been
hardly any complaints under that legislation and only one with any
substance requiring further examination. The Government have not
produced any evidence to support the amending legislation they are now
proposing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000165">Government
spokespeople often stress the importance of voluntary organisations,
but unions are among the largest voluntary organisations in the
country. Although 
<?notus-xml column=532?>the media, most of which seek to demonise unions, refer only to union
bosses, most local and workplace work is done by willing volunteers.
Yet unions are the only voluntary organisations to have this kind of
internal bureaucracy imposed upon them and at their expense. The CBI,
employers’ organisations, organisations representing bankers and
the fiscal industries do not have this; only unions are to have this
additional expensive official, an allegedly independent person, who is
not voted for by them but is imposed upon their internal
administration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000166">What
of the privacy of ordinary members? What of their confidentiality? It
is clear that the Government are intent on making things much more
difficult for a union affiliated to the Labour Party. However, not all
of them are. Most are affiliated only after a ballot of those who pay
the political levy, which is surely a matter for union members
themselves. The TUC has made substantial criticism of the Bill, which
it regards as an attack upon democracy. It believes that it would make
organising a conference in advance of the general election, even its
own congress in 2014, a criminal offence, because it would be in
advance of an
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000167">The
campaigning organisation, Liberty, has also opposed this section of the
Bill, believing it to be a breach of Article 11 of the European
employment rights legislation. The Government, of course, disagree. I
regard this section as undemocratic and a further attack on the
employment rights of ordinary people. The Government pretend that it is
not. However, to weaken the ability of the unions to adequately do the
job for which their members belong weakens those members. Strong unions
mean better pay and conditions, which is one of the reasons why
millionaires do not like them much.</hs_para>

not be misled by media misrepresentation of unions and should recognise
the contribution that they make to the support and welfare of ordinary
working people. This section of the Bill should therefore be opposed. I
fully support what my noble friend said in his introduction to this
section.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000169"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Whitty" PimsId="4591" UID="1311117000324" xid="1139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000324">Lord
Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest in that I
have been a member of the GMB for 40 years this year and was a member
of other unions prior to that. I therefore have an axe to
grind—not a pecuniary one—and I share that interest with
millions of our fellow citizens and with many who are not in trade
unions but who, nevertheless, benefit from the way in which trade
unions operate in the
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000170">My
Amendment 118C seeks to delete from the clause the reference to this
peculiar new invention of an assessor. The Government have seen fit to
invent a whole new profession and office for reasons which, as my noble
friend Lord Monks said, are not entirely clear. The role of the
assessor is dealt with in more detail in Clause 37, and I will return
to make more detailed remarks in that respect. The central point is why
the Government think that they need to invent a relatively costly new
bureaucratic structure when they already have the powers in the role of
the certification officer, who can deal with any complaint received,
intervene and censure a union if inadequate documentation is provided.
As my noble friend has said, there are already substantial penalties
available 
<?notus-xml column=533?>to certification officers if ever one of the few complaints they receive
is upheld. In this section of the 1992 Act, there is also the
possibility for individuals to complain, not only to the certification
officer but to the courts, about the failure of trade unions to
maintain proper records and many other provisions of that
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000171">So why is
a new structure being proposed? As my noble friend Lord Monks has said,
there are problems in maintaining a register of trade unions with names
and addresses and accurate records. By and large, most of the
population moves every four years, and the impact assessment recognises
this. People change their address every four years and tend to move job
slightly more frequently than that. In some cases, they change the way
in which they pay their union dues, or the name of the company for
which they work changes. At any given point, it is difficult to
maintain a 100% accurate register, but the Act rightly
says,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1311117000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000172">“so

practicable”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="1311117000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000173">That
is the basis on which the certification officer makes a
judgment.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1311117000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000174">It
is not clear in this Bill whether the Government intend to invoke more
stringent principles of how to decide whether or not it is an accurate
register. If they are, it is not in the Bill. Is the assessor, or
whoever advises them, to develop new codes? If so, the House should be
told before we proceed. I will return to the role of the assessor,
which appears in the next clause.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1311117000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000175">I also strongly support
the aim of the amendment of my noble friends Lord Monks and Lord
Stevenson to delete this clause and this whole part of the Bill. We
have looked at the impact assessment, which estimates the costs to
unions, the Government and employers. For unions, it is assessed at
around £400,000. I have had representations from all sorts of
unions—my own, the National Union of Teachers, which is not
affiliated to this party, and the Royal College of Nursing, to which my
noble friend has referred and which is not affiliated either to the TUC
or to the party. These indicate clearly that the cost of implementing
these provisions and initiating the changes in procedure and rules that
is required would be substantially more than
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000176">Even more
interesting is that only £140,000 is allocated to additional
costs to the Government, whereas if they were really trying to enforce
this, they should give the certification officer significantly more
powers. It is arguable that under the present rules the certification
officer may need more resources, but that is not what this Bill is
about. It is about an entirely new approach to this area. The even more
interesting part of the impact assessment is that the benefit at one
point is described as nil. That is a pretty telling internal report on
a proposal from Ministers: at a cost of £400,000, which I think
will be rather larger, plus £100,000 or so to the Government,
the benefit is
nil.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000177">My noble
friend Lord Monks has already cited the Regulatory Policy Committee,
which basically says that this is one of the daftest proposals that has
ever come before it, and there is no justification for it. Even the
Government, who have been scraping around for supporters of this Bill
during a rushed consultation period over the holiday month, could not
get more than lukewarm support from the CBI, which said that 
<?notus-xml column=534?>it would not be its first priority. Where are the Government coming from
on this? The benefit to restating and providing a bureaucratic
infrastructure to enforce the requirement of unions to keep membership
records effectively is not justified in anything the Government have so
far said about this, either in the impact assessment or in speeches in
the House of Commons, which was of course very late in the
proceedings.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/4AE0471182AD68B1D607EDF1B9985066BF0B541E" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 November 2013">Monday,

has naturally given rise to various levels of paranoia from the trade
union movement. I should say on behalf of me and my colleagues:
“Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean
they’re not out to get you”. There are some
hints in the impact assessment that they may really be talking about
strike ballots, which are not relevant, as my noble friend Lord Monks
said. The issue in a strike ballot is whether the people who are
balloted are those, and all those, in a particular bargaining unit.
That depends on the definition by the union and the employer; it does
not depend on the totality of any union’s register of members
and their addresses. An alternative suggestion was that the proposal
relates to internal elections within unions because the
Government, in some way or other, do not like the people who are being
elected. Occasionally the Labour Party leadership does not like them,
either<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:00:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The fact
of the matter is that if something is wrong with an
election, the defeated candidate can complain to the certification
officer, as happened in a recent case to which my noble friend
referred. If an officer finds in favour of the complainant, then the
election is run again. What additional powers do the Government see
coming out of these changes that would affect that
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:00:58"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

perhaps the most sinister. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has
left the Chamber, even though he made remarks at Second Reading that
suggested that the Liberal Democrats in particular were on about trade
union political funds, which, of course, are dealt with in entirely
different legislation. I agree that decent membership records are
required but political funds are not dealt with in this part of the
Bill. Even if the Government were out to bankrupt the Labour Party,
this proposal would not do so. I therefore have to say to Ministers
that if those more Machiavellian motives were their real motives, they
have got it wrong. If, however, the proposals were a reasonable and
fair-minded attempt simply to improve the situation, then again they
have got it wrong because the present powers are
sufficient<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:01:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

introducing something which, if they had imposed it on any other entity
within our civic society, would have been regarded as otiose or even
oppressive. We shall come later to the oppressive aspects of these
proposals. We have yet to hear from the Minister today on this; we
certainly did not hear from him at Second Reading. Unless he can give
us a more coherent and persuasive argument as to why these matters need
to be addressed and why this new structure has to be imposed, this
clause—indeed, this whole section of the Bill—would be
best left out and we should not proceed further with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:02:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

measure but there is time in which the Government could think up some
new reasons as to why they are making these proposals. 
<?notus-xml column=535?>There is a pause in relation to Part 2: if the Government use that time
to engage in a proper consultation, they may conclude that these
proposals are unnecessary, or they may be able to concoct more
convincing reasons as to why they are necessary. However, for the
moment, as it stands, the Bill is nonsensical and unnecessary, and
imposes a cost on trade unions and their members that does not deliver
any benefit, as the Government’s impact assessment suggests.
That is good reason enough for them at least to pause but possibly
abandon this part of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:03:41"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:03:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311117000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000182"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lea of Crondall" PimsId="1443" UID="1311117000325" xid="1309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#1311117000325">Lord

just on these Benches, will recognise that it is an outrageous

take this opportunity to list the very onerous administrative burdens

require unions to submit to the certification officer a membership

Secondly, it would require unions with more than 10,000 members to
appoint a qualified, independent person to act as an assurer who will

the Bill will give new, substantial investigatory powers to the
certification officer who will be entitled to: require the production
of relevant documents or authorise another person to do so; require
explanations of those documents from their producer or any person who
is or has been an official of the union, including assurers; and
appoint an inspector to investigate compliance with the duty to
maintain a register of names and addresses of members if circumstances
suggest that the union has failed to comply with that duty or the
duties relating to the membership audit

the Bill will give new enforcement powers to the certification officer,
who would be able to make a declaration of non-compliance with duties
relating to the register and subsequently to issue an enforcement order
that would impose requirements to take steps to remedy the failure.

go in a democracy to find out an evaluation of such a lengthy list of

but there are different ways in which you can skin this cat during the
pause. One of them is the report from the House of Commons Political

Committee’s damning report is the way it puts the finger on
Ministers who, for political reasons, make use of Whitehall expertise

assessment statement—I have pity on those who have to draw it
up—“What is the problem that we are trying to

postulate what the problem was. It finds itself going around in
concentric circles. In the words of the

the costs. It finds that the impact assessment probably underestimates
the cost to trade unions by 100%. In other words, instead of being
£400,000 it is probably £800,000. It depends to some
extent on the cost per hour of a typical person responsible for those
matters in a trade union. The IA puts it at £12 an hour, in line
with a voluntary organisation. I may say that the houses that trade
union officials live in are not palatial, but trade union officials
with those responsibilities get more than £12 an hour. It is
that on which we base the rest of the edifice of cost, which the

corrected if I am wrong, but in terms of the number of unions, I think

Party, but not all unions are affiliated to the TUC. In a later
amendment, I will be presenting some of the detailed concerns about the
Bill from the Royal College of Nursing. It is not 
<?notus-xml column=537?>affiliated to the TUC. I do not think that it will ring the same bells
in the mind of many members of the Conservative Party as unions which
are part of the TUC. It makes a point, which is well made in
the TUC’s main submission, that people jump to the conclusion
that there may be civil liberties issues in Part 2, but there are not
civil liberties issues in Part 3. That is not the case at all when one
thinks about the circumstances in which people can be identified in

or whether people on the other side of the House are right. It will not
be easy to judge this today, but I think that the case we are putting
forward, and will continue to put forward, will prove
overwhelming.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/8313180A6A4DFE452DC8665AD37969B86104E876" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 November 2013">Monday,

points which have already been made by other noble Lords, but two
points do bear underlining. First, the consultation period has already
been mentioned, but I am not sure that noble Lords know its exact
dates. It opened on 17 July this year and closed on 16
August. I would like to ask any fair-minded person whether they thought
that to be a sufficiently long period for consultation, and whether
that was the right time of year to have such a serious constitutional
consultation. My second point, which has already been made but bears
repeating, is that the Regulatory Policy Committee stated
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13111122000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#13111122000107">“The

me repeat that. This impact assessment—which the Government
expect us to take seriously, even though it was not actually published

finances are also way out of line. We are told that independent

would get out of bed for those sorts of figures. I could go on. The
intellectual base and the rationale for this proposal are absent, but

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend asked at the
beginning of her speech whether the Committee thought that a 30-day

It is quite clear that the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad,
which has reported on consultation matters, thought that such a period
is inadequate and that a six-week period ought to be regarded as a
working minimum. As my noble friend pointed out, the period in question
partly covered a holiday period as well. That is just one flaw in this
process, which is another example of this Government’s

there were unsavoury ingredients; I have to say in connection with this
part of the Bill that these are certainly unsavoury ingredients. It is
strange, is it not, that this is a Government who have taken so long to
begin to do anything about the massive scandals in the banking
industry, the regulation of letting agents—my noble friend Lady
Hayter has been pursuing that for some years—the energy
companies or payday lenders, none of which are effectively regulated
but are all matters of huge public concern? Yet they do not get

this Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#13111122000012">The
Explanatory Notes give some justification for Part 1, the part of the
Bill that was contained in the coalition agreement. I think it was also
in the Conservative manifesto. It was certainly the Prime
Minister’s intention to deal with the “next

lobbying. Three years on we get a Bill which deals with that, after a
fashion, but with these additional elements thrown in—and in a
quite unjustified and unexplained way.</hs_para>

do not touch on the rationale for these proposals. Just as the
anti-social behaviour Bill includes such matters as dangerous dogs,
firearms, 
<?notus-xml column=539?>court fees and policing, all dragged together in a Bill which is
supposed to be dealing with anti-social behaviour, in this Bill we get
proposals, out of nowhere, affecting trade unions in a way that is not
imposed on any other sector. It is not imposed on professional bodies
or, in anything like this form, on the world of charities. It is purely
a question of singling out trade unions. As others of my noble friends
have said, perhaps these proposals were intended to convey the
misguided<I> </I>view that these are all political organisations
pledged to support the Labour Party, which is palpably not the case. It
is an unfortunate example of recidivism on at least the Conservative
part of this coalition Government that they should hark back to that
kind of divisive and inaccurate view of the trade union movement, which
is much broader than they would like people to
think.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#13111122000014">There
is no justification for Part 3. We have yet to hear from the Government
why at the last minute they have chosen to add this dubious ingredient
to the legislative omelette to which I have referred. It will be
interesting to hear what explanation the Minister can give over and
above the flimsy grounds that have been referred to by my noble friends
already, particularly my noble friend Lady Donaghy, and the handful of
responses that conditionally seem to raise concerns that have not been
adequately explored or explained. This is an unworthy addition to a
Bill that should have dealt with the much more serious problem of the
impact on our parliamentary democracy of lobbying, which the Prime
Minister identified all that time ago. This is hugely
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#13111122000015">When
it comes to compiling information, perhaps the Government should give
more attention to ensuring that we have a fully complete electoral
register underpinning that parliamentary democracy, while expressing
their concerns in this very party-political way about the membership of
trade unions organisations, which are already significantly regulated.
I hope that this debate will persuade the Government to have second
thoughts. I am not over-optimistic, but they really ought to have
second thoughts about pushing forward a measure that is irrelevant, in
this part anyway, to the needs of our country, to the role of the trade
unions and to industrial
relations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0001.htm#13111122000016">It
also imposes a significant financial burden on the sector.
In local government, we have something called the new burdens theory,
under which, if new responsibilities are laid on local authorities, the
Government are supposed to make financial allowance for them. There is
no indication whatever that they will do so here. Yet this is a
Government who, in their legal aid provisions, scramble round to find
areas for cutting back on access to justice for minimal savings. They
are prepared to inflict on organisations representing millions of
people costs in excess of those that they are seeking to achieve by
legislative measures in that area. It is a disgrace and the Government

the equal treatment of part-time workers; the financial
assistance

can readily seek injunctions if they are unhappy with the information

Bill provides the certification officer with extensive new powers to
access and retain the registers of members’ names and addresses,
and several other documents that he may wish to get his hands on when
he has reason to decide that he needs them. It is a fact of
life—I have gone to factories in my coat when it is 
<?notus-xml column=541?>quite cold and spoken to employers and union members—that
employees are frightened of letting their employer know that they are a
trade union member. Even if there is not black-listing, it is quite
scary when you feel that your company, your factory or your workplace
is getting really bad, with random redundancies and wages being cut.
You cannot articulate that as an individual, so you take the initiative
to try to find a collective voice or some lady or man who will come to
speak for you, because it is quite frightening to speak to your
employer. People say, “I want to join the union, and I want the
union to come, but don’t tell them I’m a member because
I’m petrified of the consequences. When you’ve got enough
members and you’ve got recognition, fine—but I
don’t want it to be known that I’m a union
member”. That is the reality in some workplaces. They are not
all colossuses, striding around; a lot of it is about
frightened people without a voice, and sometimes the trade union is
their only prospect of getting a collective voice. I have had it said
to me, and I have done it myself. You have to put their details on the
central membership record, but you take action to make sure that their
details are not circulated; you promise that you will not bandy around
the details of their membership but will protect them. I worry that
with third parties and whoever—and who knows how the provisions
of the Bill could evolve, when we start getting into the granularity of
challenging membership records—things might be done to
vulnerable individuals that were never intended as a consequence of the
Bill. We may start to undermine the freedom of association and the
right to the collective voice of which, I hope, we are all so proud and
which are such an essential part of an independent
democracy.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/97539AE64918CFF096B25DD867F7F88949AC807C" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 November 2013">Monday,

reasonably practicable. This legislation has stood the test of time
since the days of Mrs Thatcher. In recent times, unions have always had
a legal obligation to maintain accurate membership lists. As it
happens, it is in their own interests to do so, and the certification
officer already has sufficient powers to deal with inaccurate

118A—and Amendment 118D, which is consequential on

certification officer and he investigates, he will want to be satisfied
that there is no breach of the duties in relation to the register. If

remedy as soon as is reasonably practicable, rather than to impose a
reporting
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:48:54"></hs_TimeCode>. If

achieve the level of routine assurance that we want for union members

<?notus-xml column=546?>members have the right to check their details on the membership
register, and they must be predisposed to do so. Even if the member
does this, he or she has no right to see all of the register and, in
any case, cannot know whether other names and addresses are up to date.
Nor can the member know who should or should not be on the register.
Therefore the member cannot ascertain or guarantee the accuracy of the
register in its entirety. If the member checks the register and finds
problems with the accuracy of his or her details, they can make a
complaint to the certification officer. However, only the member has
the right to do this and, as I have said, they will not be able to
determine the accuracy of the register as a whole. If anyone else has
reason to believe there might be inaccuracies, they could not make such
a complaint. Even if the certification officer received allegations

union does not regularly update its register, it could quickly become
inaccurate. We propose a modest and proportionate approach to providing
greater assurance that registers are as up to date as is reasonably
practicable. We are not changing the way in which unions record member
details, nor are we changing the existing duty to keep a register. Our
focus is on the reporting requirements and effective enforcement. That
means greater confidence that union members are receiving all necessary
information, including the opportunity to vote on key matters such as a
new general secretary. That also means greater confidence that when
unions decide that they need to take industrial action—which is
entirely their right—those affected know that members have been
contacted and given the opportunity to vote. Membership audit

individual members and more widely enhance the credibility of their

otherwise, send a qualified certificate to the certification officer

discretion to require an assurer to allow the union to comment on any
draft certificate or to discuss concerns before it is issued to the
certification officer. However, we believe that it is reasonable to
require that qualified certificates are sent to the certification
officer as soon as reasonably practicable after they are given to the

a union is required to appoint an independent assurer to provide a

Clause 36 also sets out what is necessary for unions with
10,000 members or fewer. Those unions will be able to authorise a union
officer to sign off the certificate, with a statement that, to the best
of their knowledge and belief, the union has complied with its duties
under Section 24. As we expect smaller unions to have a less complex
register, we think it is reasonable to consider that a union officer
will have sufficient familiarity with the content to be able to make
such a statement. Amendment 118C seeks to alter Clause 36 so that the
assurer would no longer provide the membership audit certificate for
unions with more than 10,000 members. That would mean that all unions
would provide a self-assurance that they are complying with the
statutory obligation under Section 24 of the Trade Union and Labour
Relations (Consolidation) Act. This amendment would not give sufficient

some unions can be extremely large organisations. For example, as many
noble Lords opposite will know, UNISON has 1.3 million members and
Unite has 1.5 million. To put that in context, the NHS has around 1.7
million employees. Record-keeping for such large organisations is
likely to be complex, and maintenance will need to be ongoing to ensure
that the register is up to date, particularly given the high level of
reported churn in union membership. Equally, where a union consists of
many individual branches with individually held membership information,
regular and diligent maintenance of the membership register as a 
<?notus-xml column=548?>whole will be critical. The noble Lord, Lord Monks, recognised that. We
acknowledge that these lists cannot and will not necessarily be 100%
accurate. In addition, the larger the organisation, the more probable
that communication between the union and its members relies on being
written rather than oral. Branch secretaries are unlikely to know all
their members and may not even have met some of them. It is therefore
appropriate that there is independent assurance for larger
unions.</hs_para>

amendment could also have the unintended consequence of placing
additional burdens on larger unions. In defining the independent
assurance, we have focused on the assurer awarding the membership audit
certificate to larger unions on the basis that they have adequate
systems in place to allow them to comply with Section 24. That is
because we considered it unduly burdensome and unreasonable to expect
the assurance to be an audit of every individual record. The effect of
the amendment, however, would be to require these unions to give
assurance that they have complied with Section 24 to the best of the
union officer’s knowledge and belief. That means that the
officer who signs the certificate essentially guarantees, to the best
of their knowledge, that the register is accurate and up to
date—again, so far as is reasonably practicable. We believe that
this could be much more onerous for larger unions than what the

was<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:49:58"></hs_TimeCode> about to
attempt to answer the many questions that were put to me. However,
before I come to answer the noble Lord’s question, I wanted to
say that the noble Lords, Lord Monks and Lord Beecham, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, basically said that they considered
Part 3 to be a politically motivated attack on the unions. I think the
noble Lord, Lord Monks, used the expression “vindictive
attack”. Perhaps I should not be surprised at their reactions,
as we are perhaps being accused of placing our tanks on their lawn.
That is just not the case; if anything, it may be only the front of the
front wheels. However, this is not intended to make it harder for trade
unions to operate. They are membership organisations, and as such have
a responsibility to their members to keep their register of
members’ names and addresses accurate and up to date so far as
is reasonably practical. That general principle is already a statutory
obligation, and it is right that the Government should try to ensure
that these requirements on unions to fulfil this responsibility are
adequate. As I said earlier, trade unions are vital participants in the
economy. They work with employers to maximise employee engagement and
deliver practical solutions to workplace issues. This is why we
currently 
<?notus-xml column=549?>engage with trade unions on key policy areas, much more widely than we
are talking about today, such as employment rights, skills and
manufacturing strategy. The Business Secretary regularly meets the
general secretary of the Trades Union Congress to discuss current
policy
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:59:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

would like to address the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Lea
of Crondall, and by the noble Lords, Lord Monks and Lord Whitty. That
concerns the RPC report on the BIS impact assessment and the shortfalls
and the evidence base, as it was put to me. I am aware that the RPC has
argued that we have underestimated costs, particularly with regard to
changing union rules. We have received no information on this from
unions, despite seeking their estimates on impact. We would be pleased
to take any figures into account should they wish to supply them, but
we anticipate that unions will have routine written communications with
members and also an annual conference and that should allow them to
include those routine activities to make steps to make the necessary
changes. Perhaps I can reassure noble Lords that we will continue to
work with the RPC to see how we can improve the evidence base further
and we will take into account any further data that unions and others
can supply and choose to
supply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:00:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000058">The
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, raised the issue of whether there would be any
change to the definition of the phrase “so far as is reasonably
practical”. The test for unions that they maintain a membership
register that is up to date and accurate so far as is reasonably
practical has actually existed since 1984 and has been interpreted by
the certification officer in decisions made under Section 25 of the
Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. We do not intend statutorily to
define it further. It is important that the legislator recognises that
the duty takes account of the fact that unions of different sizes and
types compile and maintain their membership data in individual and
varying ways. At the moment, we anticipate that an assurer will want to
check how the union collects data from new joiners, how they remind
members about keeping records up to date, the ease with which members
can notify changes and how quickly changes are made. We would also
expect that an assurer would be interested in the data cleansing
processes that larger unions use for electronic
databases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:01:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000059">The
noble Lord, Lord Monks, raised the issue of the cost to unions. I would
like to say a word or two about costs. He said that they would add
considerable burdens on the unions. We have assessed the average annual
cost as being 6p per union member. I think the noble Lord would have
read that earlier. That equates to an average of half a penny a month.
However, union monthly subscriptions vary but typically they range from
£1 per month to something around £35 a month. We have
sought to take an approach which is proportionate and seeks to minimise
the burdens on
unions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:02:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:02:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Monks:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for giving way. Is it not
quite incredulous to use the cost in that way, breaking it down person
by person in that way? We are  
<?notus-xml column=550?>talking about half a million pounds to be spent on a purpose which he
believes gives confidence, assurance and so on but, if there is no real
problem in the first place, the whole thing is built on a piece of
tissue paper. That 6p becomes even more important to people like me. It
is not so much that you have your tanks on our lawn, you have your hand
in our
pocket<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:03:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:03:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13111122000137" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000137">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> These are the figures that I have
presented, and it is fairly natural to break it down on a per-head
basis. I would like to focus on costs. As set out in the impact
assessment, I expect the cost to the public purse of implementing the
provisions to be around £150,000. The additional
responsibilities of the certification officer will mean hiring two to
three extra staff members in his office. Some expenses may also be
incurred if a complex investigation has to be undertaken, although it
is likely that those investigations will be rare. We believe that the
changes we are making are relatively modest. The new powers for the
certification officer are largely consistent with activities that he
undertakes at present. The Government have no plans to make wider
changes to the role of the certification
officer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:04:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Monks, raised the issue of, as he put it, state intrusion into unions.
That goes back to the first question that I answered for other noble
Lords. The Data Protection Act will apply to the certification officer,
his inspectors or assurers and they will be required to use any
personal data, including data on union members, consistent with the
protections that it contains. The Information Commissioner has powers
to enforce the data protection principles and can impose substantial
fines for some breaches. In addition, there are confidentiality
obligations contained in the Bill so that an inspector or assurer can
use or disclose information only if they do so consistently with the
exercise of functions in relation to the membership register or
criminal investigation or proceedings or where consent has been
given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:05:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

two further questions. The noble Lord, Lord Monks, raised the issue of
a perceived breach of Articles 8 and 11 of the ECHR and the report of
the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, which I believe I
have answered already. The Government have responded to the
committee’s report, explaining that these do not breach rights
to privacy or freedom of association. That is because there are legal
safeguards in place already. The Data Protection Act will continue to
apply and the Bill introduces new safeguards as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:05:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000064">The
noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, challenged the length of consultation.
Perhaps I may address this directly. BIS published a discussion paper
which received 42 written responses from a range of groups, including
trade unions, legal firms, businesses and charities. The Deputy Prime
Minister, BIS Ministers and BIS officials have discussed the proposals
with the TUC at various points throughout the progress of the Bill to
date. The evidence base in the impact assessment is based on what
unions have told us and we will continue to listen. The Minister for
employment relations has already said in the other place that the
Government will consult further on the role of the assurer; for
example, we are committed to allowing unions flexibility 
<?notus-xml column=551?>in the implementation of these new measures while supporting a smooth
transition. We are also committed, as I said earlier, to continuing to
work with the RPC as well on the evidence base for the impact

Monks:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to those who have taken
part in what has been a wide-ranging debate, at least from this side of
the House, which I suppose is only to be expected on this kind of
subject. I ask fair-minded Members of the House, of which there are
many on all sides, to consider this measure. The case for it is
extremely flimsy. Are there not better things for the people from the
department and the Minister to be doing? In a period of economic
difficulty, the business department is messing about getting extra
confidence and extra assurance about union membership records when,
over many years, the complaints have been negligible. The existing
requirements, which have been put in place during and since Mrs
Thatcher’s time, have proved robust and effective. In a sense we
are adding something on. As I mentioned before, it is almost like a
right of passage for every Conservative Minister in this place to have
at least one kick at the trade union movement. I think that is very
much what is happening
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:08:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Incidentally, I rather liked the earlier comment by my noble friend

with each of the amendments. The Bill has been much criticised by civil

is it absolutely clear that the Bill contains any suitable safeguards

118F seeks to ease the requirements on the union to appoint or
terminate the appointment of the assurer and to put it in line with the
terms under which scrutineers are employed to oversee union elections

notwithstanding that, the Bill’s provisions override the rules.
An assurer could be removed only by resolution of a general meeting or
conference. Not too many people have that requirement on them as far as
auditors are concerned. It is not necessary to call a special
shareholders’ meeting to get rid of KPMG or Deloitte or whoever,

improve a union’s ability to remove an assurer who had breached
the confidentiality of the union or breached certain other

to give confidence to the wider world. As it stands, this provision

rather important for employers, and I am surprised that some of them
have not made more noise about this. The check-off system operates when
the employer deducts the union’s subscription from the

payment and an administrative charge off to the union. If the assurer
finds any inaccuracies in some of the information and data that a union
is holding, they may well be traceable to the employer—they may
well be traceable to the payroll system or the way it is administered.
In a sense, under Amendment 118J, we are asking, “What about the
employer having to comply with investigations in this area launched by
the assurer or the certification officer or one of his proposed
inspectors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:14:17"></hs_TimeCode>?”.

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Monks has made a
sophisticated case to the Government for making this whole clause and
the invention of the assurer more palatable, or at least more workable.
He has had to do so in a very complicated way because of the nature of
the proposition. My opposition and that of my noble friend Lord Lea to
the clause standing part is a more straightforward proposition: we are
basically seeking to delete the
clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:17:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

proper explanation of why there should be an assurer. Incidentally, I
need to apologise to the Committee and to <I>Hansard</I>: on occasion
in the previous debate, I referred to an “assessor”
rather than an “assurer”. I also apologise to the
Minister. It was almost certainly down to my writing. The term
“assurer” has a nice touch about it; it is as though the
man from the Pru is coming round to collect your life assurance every
now and again. However, it is not quite like that. What qualifications
and what legal requirements does the assurer have to have? He or she is
going to be employed by the union but approved by the state. This
person may well be somebody with auditing qualifications but he or she
is not an auditor, an accountant, a lawyer or a scrutineer in the sense
of the ballot scrutineer, to which my noble friend referred. The post
is an entirely new
invention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:18:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point. Why do we need this new invention? If the Government’s
intention is to tighten things up, why do they not do that? Can we not
rationally look at a proposition saying that the certification officer
should have more powers or that the requirements on the union should be
clearer or more stringent? However, that is not what the Government
have proposed. They have simply proposed this intermediary, which is
very
strange<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:19:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

general public will take to this. What is the assurer? It sounds to me
like a third-rate television series: “The
Assurer—Licensed to Check Membership Records”. Even more
sinisterly, as in <I>Nineteen Eighty-Four</I>, it could be the kind of
person who meticulously took notes of the proceedings of a committee in
the old Soviet Union. He sat in the
corner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:29:31"></hs_TimeCode> and
nobody quite knew who he was, but you knew he was reporting on you, and
you knew he was reporting to the Central
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:20:03"></hs_TimeCode>. Such
a role is not of the organisation; it is not of the state; and it is
not of a recognised profession; it is a new invention. To do exactly
what? I do not think that, in all their interventions so far, or in
what they have done with their advisers, the Government have come up
with a clear definition of what this person is to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000084">For
the smaller unions—those with fewer than 10,000
members—the requirements in Clause 36 relate to an audit
certificate. That is slightly more understandable. It has to be signed
off by senior officers of the union. That is a procedure that many
organisations know about. They have to bring in external auditors to
check it and, if it is complicated, they have on occasion to ensure
that their lawyers have seen

profession is not known to science or to society—or, so far as I
am aware, is it known to legislation. If the Minister can point to a

Government, I would think that that best thing would be to delete this
whole new proposition and instead get around to telling us clearly what
this part of the Bill is supposed to do. Then we could have a rational
debate. We might still disagree, but at least we would know what we
were talking about. The main proposition here is to introduce into a
very delicate and sensitive area—the issues of human rights and
data protection have already been touched on, and will be
again—an entity and a role that is unknown to all the players
and unknown to the courts. If the Government were sensible, they would
approach this in a cleaner way. They would make a proposition as to how
they want unions to change their behaviour and what standards they want
them to meet, and we would be able to see whether those were
reasonable, rather than putting things in the hands of an entirely new

Turner of Camden (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment
moved by my noble friend. One point struck me particularly, from my
recollection of my own work as a full-time official in connection with
recruiting in areas where there was no trade union membership. I am
referring to people who were new to the trade union movement. The lack
of confidentiality implied in this part of the Bill would be a
deterrent to recruitment. Obviously, if you are trying to recruit
people who have never been in a union 
<?notus-xml column=555?>before and are not organised, the last thing they want is for their
details to be made available to anybody. They want to keep things close
to themselves until they have recognition. Obviously that is important
to them. A number of us have raised the issue of confidentiality, which
is threatened unless this provision is either removed entirely or
substantially
amended<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:24:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

should have to vote for yet another official—this so-called
assurer. Where is he to come from? What sort of background is he to
have? What kind of voice will the ordinary members have in relation to
this individual? We do not want this new individual. We do not think
the role is necessary, and I personally oppose this clause
altogether—although the amendments tabled by my noble friends
would undermine to some extent the opposition that some of us have on
grounds of confidentiality. This is very important to new members,
particularly those who have not been in a union before and who need
some assurance of confidentiality if they are to remain with the union
and support it as it struggles for membership and recognition. I
therefore completely support my noble friends in their opposition to
this part of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000090"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lea of Crondall" PimsId="1443" UID="13111122000143" xid="1309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000143">Lord
Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my support for the
amendment. Orwell has been mentioned, and I have mentioned
Kafka—but now I shall give a more homely sort of picture. One of
the children says, “Mummy, what does Daddy actually do?”
and Mummy replies, “Well, he’s an assurer.” I

whether she had actually answered the

investigatory branch investigating and then doing something about it. I
do not know what it would be able to do if it is true that the
rationale for the action, and the analysis of why there is a problem,
is the changing nature of the economy and the churning of people in the
trade unions. When would you have won the game? If that is the analysis

Tyler (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have to confess that my experience
of the unions is obviously much less extensive than that of opposition
Members. I suspect that it is also out of date and rather specialised.
I was a member of the National Union of Journalists for a decade or so.
I never aspired to be an officer of the chapel, although I attended
regularly, so my contribution 
<?notus-xml column=556?>to our consideration of this part of the Bill will have to be very
limited. But it is genuine. I am really interested and concerned to

carefully to the debate on part 3—not least the two
extremely important clauses that we are now looking at—and I
want to speak specifically on whether Clause 37 should stand part of
the Bill. I believe that we should retain it until we have seen
something better, and I am not yet persuaded by the amendments. From
what noble Lords on the other side of the House have said, I am not
clear whether their principal concern is with the direction of Part 3
or the detail. Is it with the principle or is it with the practice?
Different Members of your Lordships’ House have touched on both.
Is it the intention or is it the impact? It may be both, but it is not
entirely clear to me yet whether they think that the problem does not
exist or that it is not being addressed in an appropriate
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:28:45"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Lords, Lord Monks and Lord Whitty, said that accuracy was a problem. So
it is not a problem that does not exist. There is a problem; the

am not yet entirely clear, either, why those opposite seem to have so
much fear of what is proposed. It seems to be an effective process for
auditing membership records annually and having them independently
signed off. That, surely, is healthy. Is there a problem with it?
Surely it is not a burden for the smaller unions either. I am not quite
sure where the National Union of Journalists is these days in the
league table of membership; I suspect that it is not very big. I do not
think that 10,000 members is an unreasonable cut-off point in Clause 37

be not only a reasonable, moderate approach with benefits for ensuring
that the electorate for ballots and other union processes are accurate,
but a measure with potential future constitutional benefits. As other
Members of your Lordships’ House may recall, I
recently published a draft Bill with input from a number of
parliamentarians at both ends of the building, and from across parties,
to reform comprehensively the whole issue of party funding, including a
donation cap. Labour Members have said to me regularly and consistently
that for such a cap to work it would have to exclude affiliation fees
from individual trade union members. If that is the case, surely it
will be essential that everyone can have confidence in exactly how many
of them there are before we can know that they have consented to pay
into a political fund and that they want their money to go to the

of course, is not the purpose of this clause or this part of the Bill,
since the Government are not yet committed to radical reform of party
funding. But since the cross-party talks on that issue concluded in
June, there have been some important signs of real progress that could
make real development possible. After all, Mr Ed Miliband, having had
his emissaries refuse to budge on the relationship with unions during
the funding talks, has now made it clear that he does want to reform
that relationship. Noble Lords will recall that he courageously made an
important statement to that effect in July. He said:</hs_para>

individual to be paying money to the Labour Party in affiliation fees

party unless they have chosen to do so. Men and women in Trade Unions

by year if they do not know that those records are up to date? Like
many other measures in this Bill, I think that they will pave the way
to make serious reform of party funding easier and more effective in
the future. I hope, therefore, that the Leader of the

make a point. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, was out of the
Chamber at an earlier stage when I said that I did not believe that it
was the Bill’s aim to attack the funding of one political party.
The Minister should respond to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. I agree with
him on most of his issues, including potential reform of party funding.
However, he suggested in his intervention here that the Bill is not
about better measures for trade union members and more transparency but
about taking a serious step towards undermining the funding of the
major opposition party. If that is indeed the case, this is an entirely
different sort of Bill and one that raises even more important issues
than have been raised so far. I should like to hear the
Minister’s views on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:34:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111122000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000101"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tyler" PimsId="4859" UID="13111122000146" xid="1879" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111122000146">Lord

remarks with , “before the noble Lord sits down”, so I
presume that I am still on my feet. I do not think that the noble Lord
was listening entirely to what I was saying. I was saying that if the
Leader of the Opposition’s proposal for a new relationship
between his party and the unions is to be on solid foundations, surely
one of the most essential elements of that new relationship has to be
accurate membership records for the unions. This part of the Bill is
important in that new relationship. I hope, therefore, that the Labour
Party and its leader will think very carefully. If they want to improve
this part of the Bill, I am sure that the Government would be
interested—although I cannot speak for them. It is important
that everybody should have confidence in the accuracy of membership of

internal constitution of an independent political party. There may be
all sorts of things wrong with the constitutions of all the political

when the Government presented the Bill, that is not what they said it
was about. We have now gone into huge new territory as a result of the
intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and we need the Minister to

but rather interesting comment, that he resisted the idea that he had
planted tanks on our lawn—presumably the trade union
lawn—but that the wheels were on the lawn, even if the whole
tank was not. I know about tanks, and they can fire very large and
rather dangerous weapons; they do not have to be on your lawn to do

well, well. Here we were thinking that we were talking about important
issues such as rights, civil liberties, and so on, when the real debate
was about trying to establish a hegemony in terms of party activity
that would perpetuate the Conservatives and possibly the Liberal
Democrats—I have my doubts about that—against the
opposition party as it is presently constituted. Presumably, that gives
credibility to the theory that I have heard advanced around the place,
which is that this part of the Bill was originally considerably longer
and dealt with the question of party funding in relation to the unions,
but because of the demarche by the Leader of the Opposition.
Mr Edward Miliband, it had to be changed considerably, and
all we have left is a warming pan in the political bed that we are
addressing. It keeps the issue on the table so that, when and if the
parties opposite get their act together, they will move in on party
funding in a way that, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord
Tyler, is so crucial to the future of both his party and, presumably,
the Conservatives. Okay, they can change the rules—but at least
that is helpful to us in knowing how to address the Bill in more detail

really important issues. For many employees, their membership, or lack
of membership, of a trade union is an extremely private choice, and one
which they desire to keep confidential for many legitimate reasons.
Indeed, the strength and legitimacy of these concerns was recently
underlined by HMRC’s decision to back down in a dispute with
Equity about providing personal information relating to its members
following a strong response by the union, supported by Liberty, calling
in aid Article 11 of the ECHR protections. The knowledge that under the
new powers, trade unions could be required to provide their membership

act as a disincentive for workers to join unions, particularly in light

particular individuals have joined unions, and under proposed wording
will be legally entitled to inspect registers under the guise of
checking whether the register has been properly updated to include the

happen? It is evident that the stated aim of ensuring public confidence
in the status of union registers is already adequately addressed by the
current system, which gives members the power to challenge registers at
any time and requires the appointment of independent scrutineers at the
key points when ensuring accuracy of the registers is important.
Introducing wide-ranging powers of investigation by Government bodies
and third parties that do not owe any duty of confidentiality to trade
unions, coupled with a second layer of external auditing, is surely an
overly intrusive measure, which will have an unwarranted detrimental
effect on the members’ trust in the confidentiality of the union

greater visible assurance of the maintenance of trade union membership
registers to members, employers and the wider public. Clause 37 gives
credibility to that assurance by requiring independent scrutiny.
Increasingly, a number of unions have become large organisations,
serving a membership that frequently covers a variety of employers and
workplaces. With this comes administrative complexity, as well as
increased public interest in a union’s scope of influence. The
nature of union membership data means that it decays easily, as has
been mentioned. It is reasonable to think that someone moving house
might forget to notify their union, for example. This is recognised in
the existing duty for a union to maintain an accurate membership

currently provide assurance in relation to financial matters. Their
accounts are given credibility as they must be validated by an auditor.
I believe that when in future a large union provides an annual
membership audit certificate assurance, it should constitute a
similarly independent assurance. Clause 37 therefore 
<?notus-xml column=561?>requires trade unions with more than 10,000 members to appoint a
qualified independent person—an assurer— who will issue
the annual membership audit certificate, stating whether the
union’s membership system complies with the duties set out in
Section 24. The assurer owes a duty to the union to provide the
certificate and to carry out inquiries as necessary. They have the
right to access the membership register and other relevant documents,
and to require information from the union. Exactly which information
may be relevant will vary between individual unions. It will be for the
union to agree terms with the assurer. Clearly, the union does not have

of several amendments that reflect concern regarding the handling of

their concern here is misplaced. The assurer will not be able to
provide assurance of a union’s compliance with the duty in
Section 24 without access to the membership register. However, this

attempt to clarify the role of the assurer. It is essentially to give
an assurance. It is important that the assurer has widespread
credibility with unions, their members and the public. They will

out by trade unions, are listed in an order made by the Secretary of
State. In the other place, the Minister for Employment Relations and
Consumer Affairs committed to consult on the order setting out who
would be eligible to be an 
<?notus-xml column=562?>assurer. Clause 37 provides an order-making power for the Secretary of
State to set out who is qualified to be an assurer. A person is

has been slightly more explicit about the role of the assurer, but why
is it not possible just to add it to the role of the auditor for the
trade union? I am grateful for the offer of help to sort out the Labour
Party’s internal constitutional matters, but the Minister did
not reply explicitly to the point I was making. I would like to have it
on the record that the Government do not intend this Bill to be the
paving stone for reforming political funding; that is, an attack on the
funding arrangements of the major opposition party. Can we have it made

but they have distinctly different roles. The best thing is for me to
write to the noble Lord to clarify the position of the assurer. I
should re-emphasise that the union has a say in choosing the assurer
from the approved list, which is originally approved by the Secretary
of State. The role is currently being drafted and put together. We have
some clear key powers and safeguards that are laid out as part of that

some on that side of the House have other motives in mind. It is rather
difficult to follow the track. The Minister shakes his head, but that
is not what he said. He had the chance to rebut the noble Lord, Lord

territory to the previous debate, so I shall not go over all that
ground again. The amendments continue to emphasise the extent to which
the Bill engages with both Articles 8 and 11 of the European Convention
on Human Rights and EU and UK data protection requirements. Amendment
144 limits who can be directed to comply with requests from the
assurer. We emphasise the need to do that centrally rather than it
being done by some voluntary branch secretary or district office. The
responsibility should be at head office with the person who controls
data.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000052">Amendments
147 and 150 would allow an inspector to request information from

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, this group of amendments
is different from the others we have considered this evening because it
does not contain a clause stand part. The reason for that is because we
think, certainly in relation to the ones in my name and that of my
noble friend Lord Monks, that they are sensible safeguards and measures
that we would recommend to the Government as being appropriate and
proportionate in relation to the aims set out for the Bill. I gather
from the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Whitty, and to a certain
extent from those made by my noble friend Lord Lea that they shared
this approach. So we are not, in this mode, trying to be as
aggressive—as it could perhaps be considered—in relation
to the Bill as we were in Clauses 36 and

from our side the feeling that these provisions are still aimed in the
wrong direction, and that they lack a sensible underpinning in terms of

relation to the generality of the proposals, there is a case for the
Government to move a little way towards us. I suggest that even if they
cannot accept every one of the points made in this group, they might
consider taking them back and reconsidering them. That would certainly
give us a little more confidence that they were taking us seriously in

jest of course—I think. The point is well made. This is not
something that is happening over there and far away. This is happening
to real people in real time and it is affecting lives and blighting
careers. Its cause is largely due to the circulation of lists, and
therefore, by following back that logic, it is something that we are
very concerned about. Everyone should be concerned about that and we
should do everything in our power to make sure that datasets of the

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, at the outset I want to
address the issue of blacklisting that was raised by the noble Lords,
Lord Whitty and Lord McAvoy, as we take any allegations of blacklisting
very seriously. It is unlawful under the Trade Union and Labour
Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 to refuse to employ a person because
they are a member or not a member of a trade union or because they
refuse to join or leave a trade union. It is equally unlawful for an
agency to refuse employment services on those grounds.</hs_para>

2010, in response to the Consulting Association blacklist uncovered in
2009, the Government strengthened anti-blacklisting legislation and
increased the penalties for unlawful processing of data. Data
controllers can now be fined up to £500,000 for serious
offences. Despite several allegations of new evidence of blacklisting,
to date we have seen no evidence of this practice recurring. As noble
Lords will know, the Scottish Affairs Select Committee and the
Information Commissioner are both currently investigating the potential
for ongoing offences, and the Government continue to take a close
interest in this issue. I thank noble Lords for raising this particular

me now turn to the individual amendments that have been proposed.
Amendment 144 seems intended to prevent the certification officer and

be necessary or desirable. The

used elsewhere in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation)
Act 1992, for example in the context of financial investigations. I
would imagine that a union would want the certification officer to make
every effort possible to obtain relevant documents. If its record

there is a
problem.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111131000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000073">Amendments
145, 146, 148 and 149 are probing the protections for unions with
regard to the new investigatory powers of the certification officer and
any inspectors he may appoint. These amendments all seek to restrict
access to a union’s register of member names and addresses.
Clause 38 gives the certification officer the power to require a union
to produce relevant documents where he believes there is good reason to
do so. If the certification officer has appointed an inspector to
investigate, the inspector can also require documents relevant to the
investigation. In both cases, “relevant documents” is
defined as including a union’s register of members’ names
and addresses.</hs_para>

Lords are proposing instead that “relevant documents”
should “not normally include” the register. They go on to
propose that production of the register may be required by the
certification officer only where the High Court has concluded there has
been a criminal offence, a breach of human rights, or substantial
danger or damage to third parties or to national security. The noble
Lords also state that the registers shall not be available to third
parties. This represents a significant set of constraints. I fully
understand the concerns driving the amendments. Sensitive data on 
<?notus-xml column=572?>who is a member of a trade union must not be treated lightly, but I hope
that I can offer reassurance about the legislative protections already
in place, as well as those included in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000075">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:26:23"></hs_TimeCode>
the first place, however, I need to be clear that access to the
register by the certification officer or his inspector is an essential
requirement of providing assurance. Establishing compliance with the
legislation would be impossible without either the certification
officer or the inspector being able to exercise a right to access the
register itself. Without this, they are wholly reliant on what the
union tells them. This is inadequate in circumstances where there is
reason to believe there is a problem. Access to union membership data
by third parties is something that already occurs. Both the
certification officer and independent scrutineers, who are responsible
for ensuring the propriety of ballot processes, often need access to
membership data, but there is no suggestion this has led to any
misuse.</hs_para>

me explain what protections are in place. The certification officer is
an independent officeholder. He is also under a duty to exercise his
powers consistent with rights conferred by the European Convention on
Human Rights, including the rights to privacy and freedom of
association. The certification officer is well placed to deal with
sensitive data and there have been no problems in the history of the
office of which we are aware. The Data Protection Act also applies to
the certification officer and his inspectors so that they will be
required to use any personal data, including data on union members,
consistently with the protections it contains. The Information
Commissioner has powers to enforce the data protection principles and
can impose substantial fines for some
breaches<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:28:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000077">Amendments
147 and 150 would specifically allow the certification officer or his
inspector to require names, dates of birth and national insurance
numbers held by the employer to allow for cross-referencing to complete
an investigation. It is not clear why the certification officer would
need to request this information or why the inspector would require it.
None of the comments we received during our targeted consultation over
the summer suggested that this information was necessary. In practice,
the duties under Section 24 of the 1992 Act do not require the union to
keep members’ dates of birth or, indeed, national insurance
numbers. More importantly, this could have the unintended consequence
of widening the scope of sensitive information handled by the
certification officer and the inspector for no particular reason. There
is no reason why they should automatically have access to dates of
birth and national insurance numbers during an investigation. Nor is
there any reason why they should be able to require it from an
employer.</hs_para>

151 and 153 share a common goal of ensuring that there are appropriate
protections to ensure that the inspector handles sensitive membership
data properly. I will therefore speak to them together. I would like to
reassure noble Lords that there are already strong safeguards in place
to ensure that union membership data will not be compromised by an
inspector’s investigation. The certification officer will use
his discretion to appoint an inspector—as he does at the moment
for inspectors appointed to investigate 
<?notus-xml column=573?>a union’s financial affairs. It will be for the certification
officer to ensure that he appoints someone capable of fulfilling their
responsibilities. The inspector will owe a duty of confidentiality to
the certification officer. Extending that duty of confidentiality to
the trade union could have the unintended consequence of interfering
with the independence of the
investigation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000079">Should
the inspector breach the duty of confidentiality owed to the
certification officer, it will be for the certification officer to
decide how to deal with this. The officer will want to consider the
circumstances and severity of the breach to decide what is appropriate.

officer’s staff—as they could be—the certification
officer will have a range of options, from retraining to
dismissal.</hs_para>

psychoactive substances are natural or synthetic substances
that act on the central nervous system and modifying mental functions
in similar ways to illicit drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. They
are often referred to as “legal highs”. As many Members
noted in the debate in this House on 17 October in the name
of my noble friend Lady Meacher, when we debated
wider issues of drugs policy, new psychoactive substances have the
potential to pose serious risks to public health and safety. Despite
often being marketed as legal alternatives to illegal substances, users
can have no certainty as to the health risks that can arise from using
them, nor the legal status of those substances.</hs_para>

wider issue. Debates about that are going on in many countries around

this debate, and in this Motion, we are concerned with who should have
the power to ban those substances and why. On 20 September,
the European Commission published proposals for a directive and a
regulation with the stated aim of improving the functioning of the
internal market regarding the legal use of new psychoactive substances.
It argues that many new psychoactive substances that are used
recreationally have, or could have, various uses in industry which are
hindered by market restrictions. The Commission considers that member
states alone cannot reduce the problems caused to the internal market,
given their divergent responses to new psychoactive substances. It also
argues that EU-level action is necessary to ensure that potentially
harmful new psychoactive substances can be identified, assessed and, if
necessary, withdrawn quickly from the market across all member
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000095">The
committee shares the Commission’s concerns about the risks of
harm posed by these substances to the health and safety of EU citizens.
In our 2012 report, <I>The EU Drugs Strategy</I>, we concluded that the
EU has an important role to play in strengthening and adding value to
the actions of member states in tackling the negative effects of these
substances. However, we concluded then, as we do now, that action to
deal with them is best taken in the first instance by member states. We
part company from the Commission when it proposes to take that
responsibility for taking such decisions away from member states, and
transfer it to the Commission itself. In our view, the two proposals 
<?notus-xml column=576?>include some provisions which are best left to member state action, and
so are not consistent with the principle of
subsidiarity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000096">The
proliferation of new psychoactive substances is influenced by regional,
national and international forces. These manifest themselves quite
differently in different member states, depending on the speed at which
the substances become available and the severity of their impact on
public health. In any case, member states have different systems for
dealing with harmful drugs in general, and for addressing new
psychoactive substances. They require flexibility to respond rapidly to
local situations. Therefore, member states are best placed to decide
how to respond to the proliferation of these substances in the manner
that best fits the circumstances in their
jurisdictions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000097">This
would not—and I underline this point—preclude EU-wide
action being taken by the Council with respect to a particular
substance or group of substances, if the Council felt that such general
measures were needed across the European Union. We support those parts

Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and of Europol in the

should add that we received evidence from the Government that leads us
to conclude that the legal trade in psychoactive
substances—which is the reason given by the Commission for
basing these proposals on single market provisions—is not in
fact large enough to justify the Commission’s view that its
proposals are needed to protect the single market. We therefore
concluded that, in addition to our concerns about subsidiarity, the
measure was in any case disproportionate, although there is no formal
reference to that point in the reasoned opinion, which is of course
about subsidiarity alone. The House of Lords EU Committee therefore
does not agree that these matters justify transferring member
states’ decision-making power in respect of new psychoactive

follow the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, as it is to serve under his
chairmanship on your Lordships’ EU Sub-Committee F, which
produced the report which forms the basis for this debate. New
psychoactive substances, or so-called legal highs, continue to be a
serious concern. Not only are many of these substances very dangerous,
but more of them are invented and marketed throughout the world every
year, which of course includes within the EU. The number of new
psychoactive substances detected tripled between 2009 and 2012. The EU
Commission reported in September that so far in 2013, more than one new
substance has been reported every week.</hs_para>

urgent concern and urgent action, because many of these new substances
may well turn out to be very dangerous. Every week, the UK news media
report tragic stories involving the use of these substances. Three
weeks ago, the <I>Daily Mail</I> reported the case of a 20 year-old boy
from Gravesend 
<?notus-xml column=577?>who died within hours of taking a legal high. He was found next to a
plastic bag from the legal high shop, UK Skunkworks. A teenager in
Southampton died in August after taking alpha-methyltryptamine. There
are many similar stories. These drugs are generally easy to get hold
of, both on the net and on the high street. The<I> Sunday People</I>
reported last month that UK Skunkworks, a retailer of legal highs, now
has 21 shops in the UK, including one in Maidstone which is

problem of legal highs is of particular concern here in the UK. Britain
accounts for nearly a quarter of Europe’s entire legal high
market, compared to France at 14% and Germany at 12%. There are drugs
which are common here in the UK that are rare elsewhere in the EU, and
vice versa. As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said, in general the market
for these drugs is characterised across the EU by rapid innovation
locally, and by differing levels of the presence of different drugs in
different member
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000102">The EU
already has in place a mechanism for dealing with and banning new
psychoactive substances, but this mechanism is widely acknowledged to
be cumbersome, slow and not especially effective. The new regulation
proposed by the EU is intended to replace this with an improved
version, but we already have an improved version in operation in the
UK. Here, Ministers are able to issue temporary class drug orders,
which ban a drug for 12 months to allow the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs to report on whether a permanent ban should be put in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000103">We
already use this mechanism to react very quickly to the appearance of
new, worrying legal highs. In the past 12 months we have used this
power to ban substances called NBOMe and Benzo Fury. We also now
control mephedrone, naphyrone, BZP, GBL and synthetic cannabinoids.
These were all previously legal highs. All of this is driven by the
Home Office forensic early-warning system, which has the job of
identifying early new psychoactive substances which are potential
threats. In fact, in the past year the forensic early-warning system
identified 10 new psychoactive substances not previously seen in the UK
and, importantly, not present elsewhere in Europe. Of course, here in
Britain we also have an extensive education programme aimed at alerting
people to the dangers of the drugs that are found here. The Government
deserve particular praise for their 10 year-old
“Frank” programme, which has a new advertising campaign
beginning in
January.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111131000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111131000104">The
question we are addressing this evening is whether we should give up
control of our system of policing and controlling new psychoactive
substances, which works well, and hand it over to the EU. There is no
compelling evidence to suggest that this would be a good or even a
sensible idea. The new EU regulation proposes a power to impose a
temporary measure, restricting new psychoactive substance sales for a
year, to be introduced within weeks of an alert. We already do this,
and we can do it when the problem is not present elsewhere in the EU.
The new EU regulation proposes permanent measures that can be
introduced within 10 months to restrict the sale of new psychoactive
substances to consumers. We can already do this, too. Again, we can do
this for substances that may not yet be present in the rest of the
EU.</hs_para>

simplifies the existing EU procedure, but the new procedure will still
be relatively slow and complex. According to the EU’s own
description of the procedure, a substance must raise concerns across
the Union before EMCDDA and Europol draft a report on the substance. On
the basis of this joint report, the Commission then decides whether
there are grounds to require a fully fledged risk assessment. This is
too slow, too complex and too coarse-grained, and it is not necessary
here. We already do better than this. This would certainly not help,
and would in fact be a retrograde step. Giving competence to the EU, as
in the proposed regulation, would add nothing at all. The proposal
fails the test of subsidiarity, which is why I strongly support the
Motion to issue a reasoned opinion to that
effect.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/AD17C35706C9233CB663645DDBED0BF3DA123E39" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 November 2013">Monday,

Agency, ACPO, the ACMD, experts and front-line specialists on the
subject. What was surprising was the degree of consensus about the
challenge of new psychoactive substances to our country, and the fact
that our current drug laws are not fit for purpose to deal effectively
with these new drugs. Our report, <I>Towards a Safer Drug Policy</I>,
sets out our conclusions, which resonate well with key points in the
draft regulation. I feel bound to pick up a point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Sharkey, who said that our laws are working well. The
reality is that all those experts, whether they were from the Home

recognition that the EU has an important role to play in helping to

NPS, if I may call them that. The fact is that we cannot deal
effectively with these drugs at a national level. I note that the EU
committee does not support acceptance of the regulation on the grounds
that flexibility will be important, but I would like to put on record
reasons why the thrust of the regulation should be supported even if
the proposed status of regulation might be rejected. I will comment on
just three issues: first, the consultation undertaken before producing
the draft regulation; secondly, the role of the EU in assessing new
psychoactive substances; and, thirdly, the focus on the supply side of

undertaken an incredibly widespread consultation, as we did in our
inquiry, to ensure that the draft regulation reflected people’s
views— 
<?notus-xml column=579?>that is, experts’, doctors’ and scientists’ views.
Large numbers of member states view the lack of alternatives to control
and criminal penalties in the current instrument as inadequate and
suggest that a wider range of options should be considered, backed by
the administrative law. Obviously, that is for the lower-level
substances. This is something that the All-Party Parliamentary Group on
Drug Policy Reform agrees with most strongly. The fact is that bans and
criminal sanctions are not effectively stemming the flow of new
psychoactive substances into Europe, nor indeed into the UK. Of course,
the UK has a problem with NPS twice the average for the European Union.
We are the leaders in this field. This is where the drugs come from
China and India before flowing across
Europe.</hs_para>

Its rationale is that if low-harm, properly labelled substances were
available for young people to take and if it was clear what those
substances were, with their risks and so on, those people might be more
likely to avoid the much more dangerous substances, which would need to
be banned. Some warned that blanket restrictions on entire groups of
substances could have adverse effects and that restriction measures
should be proportionate to a better determined level of risk of
substances. All the evidence presented to our APPG on Drug Policy
Reform’s inquiry supported these views from the EU. All the
experts were saying that we need a proportionate response and a
risk-based policy.</hs_parafo>

effects of punitive measures are familiar to us. First, there is the
displacement of one set of drugs by new substances that are possibly
even more harmful. Indeed, they are more harmful because they are even
less known. When something just arrives from China, you have no idea
what it is. As we ban one, along comes another, or maybe another two.
Secondly, rendering such substances inaccessible for research and legal
commercial activities presents major problems.</hs_para>

gathering and exchange, and the assessment of risks of new psychoactive
substances. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
was established by regulation in 2006 and has done an excellent job in
generating information about drugs and drug use across the EU. The

battle. If all EU countries contributed to resourcing the
EMCDDA—which to an extent they do already, but clearly it needs
more support—it could then co-ordinate this work on behalf of
all, avoiding duplication. More substances would be analysed and
sensible policy decisions could then be made based on

third point is on the focus of the regulation upon the supply side of
the market. The proposal for the regulation refers to the fact that
restrictive measures vary significantly in different member states.
This is a major problem for legitimate economic interests. In the case
of the same NPS, they have to comply with different requirements such
as pre-export notifications, export authorisation or import and export
licences. All this hinders the functioning of the legitimate internal
market for particular products which happen to have one NPS as an
ingredient. New psychoactive substances should be able to move freely
within the Union when intended for genuine commercial purposes, as well
as for scientific research. The research professors who gave evidence
to us were certainly worried about the control of these substances
happening in a thoughtless way that was not based on evidence. At the
same time, NPS that pose a medium or severe health, social or safety
risk should be addressed at the Union level by controlling the supply
appropriately and fairly across the EU. I support the EU regulation for
two reasons: it concentrates upon the supply side and it highlights the
importance of proportionality of the response.</hs_para>

the Government on the effective decriminalisation of the possession and
use of new psychoactive substances for a 12-month period under the
temporary class drug orders, which focus on the supply side. If the UK
adopted the EU regulation or the ideas within it, the 12-month limit to
drug orders should no longer apply. This would be a positive step
forward. According to the evidence, decriminalisation of the possession
and use of drugs does not lead to an increase in drug use and can lead
to a reduction in drug dependence. It also has the benefit of enabling
resources to be transferred from criminal justice to treatment, thus
raising the prospects of people recovering and getting back to
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000011">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T20:09:51"></hs_TimeCode>

has been said, psychoactive substances are natural or synthetic
substances that affect the central nervous system, and induce a
stimulating or depressing effect in the same way that illicit drugs
such as cocaine or ecstasy do. They are often marketed as legal
alternatives to illicit drugs, which is why they are called
“legal highs”. Like illicit drugs they can cause
considerable harm to those who use them, including severe physical or
psychological harm, or even
death.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000017">Many
new psychoactive substances have or could have other uses in, for
example, the medical, chemical or high-tech industries. Around a fifth
of the substances notified through the EU-level mechanism of exchange

response proportionate to the level of risk involved. The

the EU and, in cases of severe risk, even their use in industry. They
would be directly applicable in the member states and would not need to

assessed and, if necessary, withdrawn quickly from the market across
all member states. The EU committee report disagrees with the
Commission’s assessment that its proposal satisfies the
principle of subsidiarity, which provides that in policy areas that do
not fall within the exclusive competence of the EU, but where

the functioning of the internal market in respect of their legal trade,

the process is, I believe, a letter from a Minister to the Advisory
Council on the Misuse of Drugs—the ACMD—but with the
letter seeming to take some time to be sent. The second reason is the
resource capability of the ACMD that apparently can assess only two or

recent years, new psychoactive substances—NPS or, as already
referred to in this debate, legal highs—have rapidly changed the
nature of the global drugs market. 
<?notus-xml column=584?>The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, made this point very well. Substances that
are not under international control but mimic the effects of controlled
substances are now widely available. They have the potential to pose
serious risks to public health and safety. My noble friend Lord Sharkey
highlighted recent cases and the tragic responses. The speed at which
the market has developed, the wide availability and accessibility of
NPS legal highs and the concern about their increasing use makes this a
significant issue that is not just national or European but global in
nature and requires collective action at all levels. We have a
comprehensive and well recognised response to new psychoactive
substances that covers early warning, legislation, demand reduction and
treatment, as well as galvanising international co-operation and
activity. I will come to that in a
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000033">In
our legislative approach, we have deployed generic definitions whereby
entire families of drugs are brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act
1971. This approach has continued to place the UK in a much stronger
and more durable position. Temporary class drug orders enable us to ban
NPS in weeks rather than months where there is an immediate concern.
Through these mechanisms, we have controlled the majority of NPS seen
in the EU since 2005. Since 2010, we have controlled in excess of 200
new psychoactive substances including 15 currently under temporary
control. That point was also made by the noble Lord, Lord
Rosser.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000034">While
the EU-wide NPS identification and monitoring component has been very
useful to us in complementing our own drug early warnings systems, it
is harder to see the benefit of the risk assessment and banning
process. To date, the requirement for member states to ban certain NPS
has had little impact for the UK. Just 13 risk assessments have been
conducted, and only nine NPS have been subject to this requirement, of
which eight had already been controlled in the UK, including
mephedrone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000035">As
my noble friend Lord Bridgeman pointed out, the principle of
subsidiarity is that decisions should be taken as close as possible to
the citizen. As such, the EU should act only where it would add value.
The Government are concerned that, as drafted, Article 4 of the
regulation would fetter our discretion to respond flexibly to national
issues with NPS as they arise. All noble Lords have made this point.
The proposals are currently drafted under the Article 114 legal base,
which is about internal markets and makes this a harmonisation measure,
rather than setting out minimum standards under Title

only 13 risk assessments have been conducted under the existing NPS
instrument since 2005, it is difficult to see how, without significant
additional resources in the early warning and risk assessment
processes, the proposals will impact in any notable way on the NPS

in extensive domestic measures to control such substances, the value of
the potential control measures under the new proposals is
unclear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000037">Beyond
the concept that there is a legitimate trade in NPS that needs to be

Commission’s argument is that one in five NPS has a legitimate
purpose, for example, in industry. However, the UK’s experience
is that such substances are the exception rather than the rule. In
fact, out of more than 300 substances, we can identify only a handful:
two as industrial cleaners and a few others, called piperazines, used
in the preparation of medicines. Our current legislation has the
flexibility to accommodate these substances by enabling their
legitimate use in industry to continue while restricting wider
availability. We are looking to challenge the Commission’s
evidence base to understand how it came to its conclusion that there is
a substantial legal use for NPS.</hs_para>

evidence for a legal trade in NPS, the Government believe there are
strong arguments that the regulation, as well as the directive, should
cite a JHA legal base. We also take the view that both of the proposals
build on the police and judicial co-operation elements of the Schengen
acquis and that our opt-out therefore applies. That said, it is
important for me to emphasise that this does not necessarily mean we
will opt out. We will need to look at the proposals on their merits.

should like to pick up on one or two points made during this debate. As
my noble friend Lord Sharkey pointed out, the UK has a strong position
in dealing with these issues of NPS. For example, the Misuse of Drugs
Act provides a flexible legislative framework to tackle immediate or
potential health risks. Of the three main groups, more than 80% are
banned in the UK. The latest annual report of the European Monitoring
Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction said that in 2011, there were 49 new
drugs, but only 17 were reported more than once in the UK, out of which
14 were already controlled. In 2012, as the noble Lord, Lord

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T20:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>a couple of
other measures. From 2011, the Home Office set up a response to legal

Meacher:</Member></B> Will the Minister accept that the UK Border
Agency, leading ACPO officers and many other officials and experts in
the field will say that even if a new psychoactive substance is banned,
that does not mean that children and young people all over the country
are not getting it? They are. The UK Border Agency, for example, talked
about its great big warehouse with mountains of little packages; it has
no idea what is in those packages—just lots and lots of white
powders. Those packages are seized from the post, but the UKBA says
that it is a drop in the ocean: it is not touching it or scraping at
the edge of the thing at all. Will the Minister accept that we do not
and cannot 
<?notus-xml column=586?>control these new psychoactive substances because they are purchased on
the web and delivered direct to children’s and young
people’s homes? Therefore, we need a more sophisticated approach
to this, which is why the European Union has come to the conclusion
that we need to think about the low-risk substances—to
differentiate, have a proportionate response and so on. It is just not
good enough to say, “We have a system; it works”. The

intervention and, of course, for the excellent work she does in her
chairmanship of the APPG. I do not for a moment suggest—nor do
the Government take this position—that everything can be
controlled through such measures. She pointed to the internet: internet
purchasing of NPS is quite low. I understand it is at the rate of about
2%. That said, there has to be an acceptance that, of course, banning
something does not mean that a substance or a derivative of one will
not get through. After all, these are derivatives of what already
exists in the market and, as all noble Lords acknowledge, this is
unfortunately a dynamic market and you can never control what new
substances are coming. It is only possible when something is
identified. However, currently we take account of the different
representations made by different agencies and we work with EU partners
in sharing information and good practice. That is something that the
Government subscribe to. However, as the noble Baroness herself
acknowledged in her contributions, the UK is far ahead of others in
identifying and dealing with some of these matters. Of course, we
ultimately need to ensure that we try to stop as quickly as possible
these drugs that are coming on to our markets and streets and appearing

provide for ACAS to be able to intervene when there is a dispute about
a register. ACAS has a very high reputation for intervening in
difficult situations and finding its way through them. We think that
there could be some difficult situations if the assurer gets going in a
number of circumstances. With the agreement of the parties and the

the Committee will know, I was chair of ACAS from 2000 to 2007. To that
extent, I suppose I have an interest in attracting work to my former
organisation. If the Minister is correct in saying that the Government
are not looking for confrontation in Part 3 of the Bill—some of
us still need convincing of that—they will be looking for ways
of avoiding the ultimate sanctions that are contained in Part 3. I
think this offers a way out of an impasse. It might help the parties,
particularly if there are difficulties in agreeing factual statements,
if ACAS were to be invited to intervene. The Minister will know that,
if this is not specified, ACAS will not be able to intervene. There
needs to be a statutory requirement before it can become involved. It
is important that this is written into the Bill. I support my noble

My Lords, it is not entirely clear why this amendment is being
proposed. I imagine that there could be concerns in relation to
vexatious allegations or allegations by an employer seeking to
undermine a trade union’s ability to take industrial action. In
practice, where an inspector conducts an investigation, there is no
complainant or respondent with respect to that investigation. It is not
clear why ACAS conciliation between a union under investigation and a
potential witness would ever be appropriate in the context of an
investigation to establish whether a union was in breach of its duties
under Section 24. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able

Monks:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 155 and 156 stress the need to
give unions adequate opportunity to make representations before
enforcement action is taken. It gives them the chance to see what is in
an inspector’s report before the certification officer is called
upon to declare that a union has failed to comply with its duties. In
other words, they are given a chance to put things right before being
arraigned before the registrar of trade unions, who is the
certification officer. Providing a chance to put things right before
things become public and perhaps more entrenched seems to us to be a
matter of good procedure in this kind of case. I think it is a useful
suggestion and I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about
it. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, during the break I
had a look back over the points that we have been making to the
Government. A bit like my noble friend Lord Monks, I am slightly
surprised that the Government have taken such an aggressive line
towards what we are saying. If the Minister recalls my contribution to
the debate on the group before this, I was saying—I thought in
as conciliatory a manner as possible—that we were trying to
offer a series of improvements to what we think is a bad Bill. However,
not a single one of them was taken up.</hs_para>

debates, I asked a total of, I think, 14 questions. I have not had
answers to any of them and I am under pressure from my colleagues here

which was meant in the spirit of support—there was no particular

can’t really understand why the Opposition would bother putting

Minister. Although he did not accept all of them, he did accept one or
two points, and at 
<?notus-xml column=590?>least there was a sense of dialogue and debate. I am very disappointed

respond to Amendments 155 and 156, which seem intended to make it
explicit that before the certification officer may make a declaration
that a trade union is not complying with its duties in relation to the
membership register, the trade union must know the reasons why. The
amendments also require the certification officer to disclose an
inspector’s report to the union. This is so that the union can
make effective representations on the case against it before the
certification officer makes any decision. I am happy to reassure noble
Lords that this is already covered by current law and what is in this
Bill. A union will have the opportunity to present its case in written
representations to the certification officer before a declaration is
made. The certification officer may also allow the union to make oral
representations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000059">Unions,
like other bodies, are entitled to a fair and public hearing, within a
reasonable time, by an independent and impartial tribunal. This is
required by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights,
and is met in the Bill’s enforcement provisions. In practice, a
union may have several chances to reply to any allegations and put
forward a defence. Any inspector appointed is likely to make a series
of inquiries, which will include dealing with the union directly,
before providing a report to the certification officer. If the
inspector’s report suggests that there is evidence of a problem,
the union still has a formal opportunity to present its case before any
declaration is made. The union would not be able to do this without
seeing the evidence, including relevant sections of the
inspector’s report. So this is the practical effect of what is
already in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000060">Finally,

unions adequate time to comply in a way that is cost effective,

line with the Regulatory Policy Committee that we discussed earlier at

fact that unions have these procedures for making changes in their
constitution, and it will be necessary, as the Bill recognises, that
unions will have to make some changes to the rules. In the union that I
was familiar with, a rules revision conference was held every few
years. Often the Government of the day were sensitive to the union
timetables, and so on, particularly on a matter such as this. It hardly
seems a matter of life and death, even to the aficionados on the other
side, in terms of the importance that the Government attach to it. We
know already that the BIS estimate of around £461,000 
<?notus-xml column=592?>is an underestimate. It will cost unions a lot more than that. Before
the Bill is enacted we need a better idea of the costs that will be
incurred. We need an approach that is reflective of the union’s

am sympathetic to the amendments in the name of my noble friends. They
seek to specify a time limit, which would be useful. Some unions have
longer timescales for making changes. I mentioned one that did it every
few years. I hope that we will get sympathetic and sensitive
understanding, especially given the complete lack of information in the
impact assessment, as pointed out by the Regulatory Reform Committee,
on the Government’s figures and the regulatory burden being put
on unions. They are shoving a load of red tape on to unions and it is
important to give the unions at least a period of digestion that errs
on the side of minimising a little bit of that red tape. I beg to

Lea of Crondall (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in the course of thinking
about this last week I went to the Public Bill Office. I do not know
whether I should mention the clerk’s name, but it was Simon
Burton and he is right there. I wrote something down and asked whether
we could put 1 January 2116. He said, “2116?”. I said,
“Yes”, and he said, “Don’t you mean
2016?”. I said, “Oh, I probably do, but hang about a
minute, why not make it 2116?”, but I chickened
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T20:53:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000067">Anyway,
the more this discussion goes on today, the more obvious it is that we
are juggling lots of timescales and deficiencies in the procedure so
far, such as no pre-legislative scrutiny, no scrutiny by the
Constitution Committee of the House of Lords, no discussion of
post-legislative scrutiny, and so on. Yet, everybody knows, and the
Minister has said it several times, that ostensibly it is because of
the difficulties that unions have in getting their membership lists up
to date. I wonder why that is not true of electoral rolls, but let us
stay with what we are on. This will take some time, so what is the
connection between that and commencement
dates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T20:54:02"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000068">The
other point that I want to bring into this discussion concerns the
pause. The pause for Part 2 has been for a particular purpose, but the
pause in Part 3 is simply a consequence of the pause on Part 2. I do
not know why the Minister is looking puzzled, but there is de facto a
pause before we have the next discussion at the same time as Report of
the Bill? Am I not right? Yes, of course. That is how it is. So,
between now and the new year all sorts of people, including the
Cross-Benchers and so on, will be thinking about all sorts of
ideas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000069">In the
middle of this I happened to read, being an insomniac, a very
interesting discussion in the Moses Room led by the noble Lord, Lord
Norton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T20:55:14"></hs_TimeCode> of Louth,
on the importance of commencement dates. Indeed, I noticed that my
noble friend Baroness Royall took part in that discussion. I was quite
amazed that commencement dates are a key part of our constitution, but
even Ministers sometimes do not know who takes the decision. Certainly
as often as not there is no further parliamentary discussion or
decision on them, yet I suppose that we could find, for the anoraks on
these matters, some reference to the Joint Committee 
<?notus-xml column=593?>on Statutory Instruments and so on. Therefore, I think that we could
bring into the mix the problems that have been mentioned for our
consideration between now and the new
year.</hs_para>

half-baked. One of the reasons it is half-baked is that it should be in
the oven for at least an hour but has only been in for 20 minutes. That
is one of the reasons it is half-baked. We should take this in the
spirit that it is intended—namely, where should commencement
dates come in the Bill? Obviously, we are not advocating that we pass
legislation that is never implemented. That is, however, not as stupid
a comment as one might think because apparently a huge amount of
legislation is never implemented. Just read the report of the noble
Lord, Lord Norton. He was the chairman of the commission on this very
question. That might be nice, as I say, or implemented in
2116.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111144000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000071">De
facto, I thought somebody might notice that there is a general election
coming up between now and 2016. All I would say about that
is—and it cuts both ways—in 2016 and those sorts of
periods, people will at least not be thinking all the time about how
these matters may affect a general election. They are matters that have
a serious footprint into the trade union movement, as we demonstrated
this evening, including all the different timetables of changing union
rules. The Minister may not have tried to deny that, but he did not
appreciate that one cannot simply go to the next conference in
Blackpool and say, “We’ll put a rules revision on the
agenda”. There are rules for the procedures and timings of rules
revision conferences.</hs_para>

the moment—there is no voting this evening—we would like
to link this proposition with the one that my noble friend Lord Monks
referred to. We are trying to relate this, with considerable
difficulty, to the realities on the ground. If something in this field
is to be done, it has got to be done within a timescale that allows for
post-legislative scrutiny. I will ask the Minister a specific question
about that. Where does post-legislative scrutiny now fit into his

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Government would be wise to
accept at least some of the spirit of these amendments. The first of
the amendments deals with the whole issue of getting a better grip on
what the impact really is. We have had a pathetic impact assessment put
before us—one that bears no relation to any costs that any of
the trade unions, whatever their persuasion on other matters may be,
would recognise. We have not managed to assess what the impact would be
on the resources and costs of the certification officers. We have a
pause now in which the Government could put that right so that the next
time we come to debate the issue we will have more robust figures,
perhaps some degree of consensus about what it means and at least a
range of figures we could sensibly talk about. At the moment we have
virtually none of that.</hs_para>

it has been the Regulatory Reform Committee’s view that all of
this is unsupported in the normal way in which we approach new

Government have got to get out from under that 
<?notus-xml column=594?>at some point and they have time to do it. Therefore the requirement in
the amendment of my noble friend Lord Monks that more information
should be put in the Library before we return to this issue on Report

that of the

to the commencement date, obviously the Government are reluctant to put
in a later commencement date than they would like. On the other hand,
put at its gentlest, we know that the Bill is a bit of a
mess—and not only this part. There is serious criticism of the
scope of Part 1 and very serious criticism, concern and widespread
apprehension about Part 2. By being gung-ho and requiring that nearly
all of the clauses within the Bill should come into effect immediately
the Act is passed, the Government do not serve their cause well. They
certainly do not serve well the cause of implementing any part of the
Bill because they will need to take a large chunk of civic society with
them, including in this respect the trade unions and in other respects
a wide range of organisations.</hs_para>

is therefore not sensible for the effect of 90% of the Bill to start on
day one. The Government will come back and say that that is not really
what it means because from day one they can draw up the secondary
legislation, and so in that sense it is the secondary legislation that
will have a commencement date. That is all very well but, given that
there are controversial issues such as this in all three parts of the
Bill and that we have not seen any draft secondary
legislation—and will not see any by the time we reach Report, as
I understand it—a judgment by ourselves cannot be made and, more
importantly, cannot be made by those organisations that are affected by
each of the three parts of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:03:06"></hs_TimeCode>. A later
commencement date for the whole of the Bill, with proper consultation
on the secondary legislation, would be a sensible

course, there is such a thing as a general election. I hesitate to
return to an earlier discussion, provoked by the noble Lord, Lord
Tyler—I nearly called him “my noble
friend”—that revealed that there was at least some
suspicion or understanding that this would affect political funding.
However, if that is the case and it is an important motivation for the
Bill—and if the Government refuse to go further than the rather
Delphic statement that the Minister repeated at least twice, which got
us no further down the line—we know that there is not going to
be a deal between the parties on political funding this side of the
election. However, whatever our backgrounds, we all recognise that
there is a possibility at some point we will have to change the rules
in relation to political funding generally. The only way we can do that
is by consensus. We will not do it before an election but whoever wins
the election might be in a position to do it afterwards. That is an
important consideration. If, so close to an election, the Government
appear to be taking pre-emptive action on this front, affecting one
party only, the possibility of a multiparty agreement will become more
remote after the election.</hs_para>

separate argument. I am trying to look at it in part from the
Government’s point of view, as they seek to deliver this with a
reasonable amount of support from civic society. In any case, they will
need to think of a fairly long timescale for 
<?notus-xml column=595?>implementation. If they do not, they will be in trouble not only with
the trade unions, but with a large chunk of civic society and those who
expected this Government to deliver on lobbying in way that actually
adds up to something. In that case, the Bill will be seen as a damp
squib on the one hand and a provocation on the other. I do not think
that this is in the Government’s
interests.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, as has been made evident
from the speeches that we have heard, this is about ensuring that,
should the Bill progress and be brought into law, it will operate with
a reasonable chance of success. As we have heard, it puts additional
red tape on a number of bodies which are technically independent. They
are part of civic society admittedly, but not those which are
necessarily controlled by any one group. They are self-governing or
self-operating, so it will take time for it to be
absorbed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000081">There
are new procedures and assurers—if that is what they are to be
called, it is an ugly name—who will need to be nominated on a
list to be promulgated. There have to be appointments made, new
reporting processes brought in and inspections, and all sorts of
procedures relate to that. We have a plethora of activity and burdens
on trade unions that need to be bedded in. If the Government were
thinking about the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations, it
makes sense to give it time to bed in and get the best
chance.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111144000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000082">We
have also heard from those who know—and perhaps they know a lot
better than those who are advising Ministers—about the practical
difficulties of trying to get changes into all these independent bodies
in sufficient time and on an appropriate scale in order that the
legislation can be made to work effectively. What does a bit of a delay
cost us? We might return to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0002.htm#13111144000083">This is
also about trying to do legislation properly. I made plain in my
earlier remarks that the Minister’s letter-writing needs will
prey heavily on his mind over the next week or two, because of all my
questions. About seven of them were about the report from the
Regulatory Policy Committee on the impact assessment. I will run over
one or two of them, because they raise issues that are not susceptible
to the timescale to which we are told the Bill is being progressed. In
effect, what was called for was a new impact assessment. I asked the
Minister whether we will have one, but he did not
respond.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0003.htm#13111144000084">Will
there be new figures? Will the RPC be able to look at and make comment
on them? Will the figures do what the RPC requests of the Government
and involve those stakeholders and others who were not properly
consulted before? Will there be an opportunity for the Bill to be
refined, to answer the question that the RPC asked about how accurate
an updated membership register would have to be for a union to be
considered compliant with the new recommendations? Unless that is made
clear, it is very hard to assess or 
<?notus-xml column=596?>even guess whether the costs that will be placed on the trade unions are
worth the additional assurances available to those who will in time
wish to depend on that
register.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0003.htm#13111144000085">All
this is criticised to a great extent in the impact assessment report
and, therefore, we assume a new report will need to be put in. The
Minister said that part of the blame for this was because those
carrying out the impact assessment did not get sufficient responses
from the trade unions. That may be because trying to consult with a
body in a four-week period starting at the end of July and finishing
before the end of August is not likely to maximise the chances of
getting a good response.</hs_para>

reasons, but it is more that there is a lack of understanding about how
independent bodies such as trade unions operate and how to get the
information that is available within them for compliance. It does not
exactly fill one with confidence to read in the report from the RPC
that the impact assessment provides figures in relation to small unions
that seem to have been based on one respondent. The Government could do
better than that. That will take time and compete with the other issues
that we are talking about and, therefore, again plays to a suggestion
in the amendment that there should be a delay in commencement until
such time as the Secretary of State has placed in the Libraries a
review of the burden of regulatory responsibility. That is just one
proposal but others that have been discussed by my noble friends
suggest a date that would allow sufficient time for the legislation to
bed in. I recommend that proposal also because it would provide an

noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, that it makes sense to allow time for
bedding down or bedding in—I am not sure which but we will go
for both for the moment. Unions will be required to amend their rules,

will be part way through a reporting year if the provisions were to
come into effect immediately. This would mean deviating from standard
legislative practice whereby provisions are not applied

retrospectively. Unions will be required to submit their certificate
for the first full reporting year after the changes become law. Given
that unions can have different reporting years, the point at which the
changes take effect on each individual union will vary. However, all

2014, it is likely that the provisions in Part 3 may come into effect
later. The Minister for Employment and Consumer Affairs in the other

I have to concede was a bit more interesting than some of his others,
there were one or two chinks of light. There was something of interest
in the timetabling and lead dates, although they are well short of
where unions need to be to do this in an economical and sensible way.
There is still quite a lot of pressure for some unions in particular to
get these things done. The view on our side, which has been
consistently expressed, is that this is a remedy that is looking for a
problem to solve. There is no requirement for it. As the impact
assessment says, there is nil effect and nil impact. For a Bill that is
so marginal to anything important, it is extremely disappointing to see
a department that is committed to economic growth and stirring the
British economy to a higher level of performance wasting time
addressing a non-problem. We thought the suggestions from this side,
about giving us plenty of time to make adjustments and explain it to

out that the ‘total amendments [run to] 116 pages and government

second issue of coherence, we have a Bill, statutory orders and a
regulatory authority. As a result, we will have ensuing codes of
conduct, memoranda of understanding and banking standards, all of which
have to gel. The absence of interrelation is what the bankers, and
particularly the lawyers, will look for. If we pass this legislation
with its present level of complexity and absence of clarity and
coherence, this reform will be next to useless. It will be the lawyers
who will win on this; the Minister has heard that from all sides of the
House. That is because we have to superimpose the present Bill on at
least two other statutes and extract as best we can from that
superimposition of a notional, generic Bill for banking reform. So
difficult will that be that it will keep the lawyers and accountants in
business from here to eternity, while reform of financial services goes
by the board.</hs_para>

Commission on Banking Standards was charged with, “Changing
banking for good”. That was very clear and it is on the front of
our document, but we will have fallen down on our job and our effort on
culture and standards if we rush this. There will be little change in
that culture and those standards. In June 2012, 10 of us from across
parties in both the House of Lords and the House of Commons came
together to use our best collective efforts to deliver a unanimous
report. We all had to put a lot of effort into ensuring that that
report was unanimous, but those 12 months were worthwhile. If I might
quote the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger, again, he said in his

cannot be the case because of the Government’s decision to rush
this legislation since, on Monday 18 November, the most

Not only is that decision discourteous to the most reverend Primate and
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards; it does not do

complexity and opaqueness of these legislative proposals is widespread

Andrew Tyrie, has been hugely conscientious in his deliberations over a

have been a Whip in the House of Commons, both in opposition and in

to the objectives of this House—that is, in being a rigorous,
revising Chamber—we really need to abandon this rush to have
Report on Monday 18 November and commence it after the Christmas

Royall of Blaisdon (Lab):</Member></B> I support my noble friend Lord
McFall of Alcluith and the Motion that he has moved. The vast number of
amendments to the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill
are extremely complex. Clearly, more time is needed to
consider the amendments before Report. As my noble friend has pointed
out, the banking commission, which includes the most reverend Primate
the Archbishop of Canterbury, is joined by the President of the Supreme
Court, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger, and the former
Governor of the Bank of England in suggesting that that is the best way
forward to delay the Report stage of this Bill until after the
Christmas
Recess.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0003.htm#13111144000125">The
noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, the Chief Whip, said in our exchange of
views on Wednesday that the increased length of the Bill was due to the
Government responding positively to the recommendations made by the
banking commission. Undoubtedly that played a part, but in a Bill of
such importance for the future well-being for our financial system, it
is critical that noble Lords have a longer opportunity to look at the
Bill as a whole to see how the many amendments to the amendments to the
amendments, as my noble 
<?notus-xml column=603?>friend pointed out, work together to provide a clear, cohesive and
coherent system. My noble friend is right to point out that good
legislation is critical, and the critique of the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Neuberger, is salutary in this respect. Bad legislation is
often complex legislation. In such situations, it is always the lawyers
and accountants who win, and our country’s citizens who
lose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0003.htm#13111144000126">The
Deputy Chief Whip is aware that my strong preference for business next
Monday is to have debates on non-legislative reports. That seems to be
a simple solution to the problem that was not, as I acknowledge, of the
Government’s making, but the result of the will of the House in
relation to the lobbying Bill. As I have explained to noble Lords and
others inside and outside this Chamber, it is not possible to have the
Second Reading of the Pensions Bill on 18 November, because the
opposition spokespersons are not available. I stress that they are not,
as some have suggested, on holiday. They have long-standing commitments
that cannot be changed, and I respect their diary
commitments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0003.htm#13111144000127">As
my noble friend said, we do have a duty to ensure the necessary
transformation of our banking system. This requires longer
consideration before the Report stage of the banking Bill. However, I
recognise that the House is anxious not only to try to ensure that
Report is put off until after Christmas, but also to ensure that all
Members of your Lordships’ House who are members of the banking
commission can participate at Report, including, of course, the most

suggest therefore that, even if it were not possible to delay the
commencement of Report until after Christmas, there may be other
legislative options that could be discussed in relation to business on
Monday. I know that my noble friend Lord Bassam is happy to discuss
other suggestions with the Deputy Chief Whip. I trust that this can be
taken forward outside this Chamber. I am sure that most noble Lords,
although clearly they are not in their place this evening, would be
anxious to ensure that all members of the banking commission can
participate in the Report stage and that proper consideration can be
given by all Members of this House with an interest in this most
important

of the matter. I will address two further issues. The first is that of
the Chief Whip adjusting our future business in response to events. The
Chief Whip had to rearrange our provisional forward business but, as
she made clear last week at the Dispatch Box, she did so only because
of the pressure in the House to delay Part 2 of the lobbying
Bill—a position not initiated by the Government. In order to
have a proper pipeline of parliamentary debate and proper progress of
government business, it is necessary to have legislative business next
week. The Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill was waiting for
Report. It was well beyond the necessary minimum interval between
stages, and the Opposition Chief Whip made no alternative proposal. I
think the Chief Whip not only did the best she could in the
circumstances but acted entirely properly and
reasonably.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111144000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-0003.htm#13111144000133">I

As a member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, I was
left in the dark regarding the Chief Whip’s negotiations with
the usual channels. I was informed on Friday of the
situation. I got on to the Table Office at about 1.30 pm and one of the
first things I said was, “Contact the Government Whips so that
they know this is going on on Monday”. I would have not needed
to have done that if there had been proper channels of procedure
between the Whips’ department and our department, and also the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards under the chairmanship of
Andrew Tyrie, who has expressed deep regret at this situation. This
Bill is different from all other Bills. The Government set up the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. This is not government
legislation; this is legislation that the Government are implementing
as a result of a year-long inquiry that they set up. It is unique and
different from all other
aspects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:42:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

been a Whip as long as a number of noble Lords in their places at the
moment—is that if a noble Lord wishes to bring a Motion of this
sort, the normal practice is to discuss it with the usual channels
before laying it. That did not happen in this case, and I greatly
regret it. It is for the good order of the House that that is how we do
our business. That is not the substance of our debate this evening,

amendment, to enable us to have a full debate. I will, of course,

proposed new clause in Amendment 241 was announced formally in a
Written Ministerial Statement from my right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Education on 8 October. It gives effect to the
stated intention of my honourable friend the Minister for Children and
Families during debates in the other place. He undertook to consolidate
and simplify legislation relating to young carers’ assessments,
and ensure that children’s legislation works with adults’
legislation to support the linking of assessments, as set out in the
Care Bill, to enable whole family approaches.</hs_para>

proposed new clause makes the following important changes to young
carers’ legislation. It extends the right to an assessment of
needs to all young carers, regardless of who they care for, what type
of care they provide or how often they provide it. Local authorities
will have to carry out an assessment of a young carer’s needs
for support, on request or on the appearance of need. The proposed new
clause also enables local authorities to align the assessment of a
young carer with an assessment of an adult whom they care for, by
making express provision in relation to combining
assessments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000010">This
last point is perhaps the most important of all. My noble friend Lord
Howe and I agree that enabling local authorities to consider the needs
of the whole family is the key to achieving our joint aim of protecting
children and young people from excessive or inappropriate caring roles.
The proposed new clause enables the necessary links to be made between
a young carer’s assessment and, for example, an assessment under
the Care Bill. This, together with planned future regulations and
guidance under the Care Bill on whole family approaches to assessing
and supporting adults, will provide a clear and joined-up legislative
framework that will enable early identification and assessment of needs
for support.</hs_para>

the summer, we have worked closely with interested parties from the

Amendment 224, to which we have added our names, and to Amendments 225,
226,  227, 228, 229 and 230, as well as to government
Amendment 241. I echo the comments already made—that
this is a very welcome breakthrough in the Government’s approach
to young carers. I am very pleased at this unusually effective
twin-track approach, with the Department of Health and the Department
for Education coming together to address these issues from both
aspects. That is a welcome

rehearsing all the arguments, we can all identify with the overwhelming
evidence that there are an increasing number of children and young
people caring for a family member, parent or sibling and that that is
affecting their education, their chance to socialise and their health.
We have not had the processes in place to identify these young people

now moving
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:36:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

key to this new requirement is the duty on local authorities to
identify young carers. As we know, they are often hidden from view. Our
amendment places parallel duties on schools, social care and health
providers to play their part in finding these young people,
and  in putting in place co-ordinated support packages 
for the children and for those for whom they care.  Our
amendments spell these out in some
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:36:51"></hs_TimeCode>.
Amendment 225 also specifies a duty to provide sufficient
resources to improve the well-being of all young carers in the

have now had an opportunity to consider the government amendment to the
Bill, and I appreciated the chance to attend the meeting with the noble
Lords, Lord Nash and Lord Howe, and with representatives of young
carers’ charities. As the Minister has said, there was a strong
welcome for the steps that have been taken and for the
Government’s recognition of the importance of this issue. We
feel that the government amendments provide a useful outline framework
to address the issue. We also accept that some of the detail will
inevitably have to be spelled out in regulations. However, our
amendments go one step further in stipulating the specific duties
required of health, social care and FE institutions. I would be
grateful if the Minister could explain how his amendments—which
impose a much more general duty—relate to all those different
aspects of the combined package that is meant to apply to young carers
in
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:38:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

have acknowledged previously that you can only go so far in driving
change from the centre. There also has to be the political will at
local level. Concern remains about the appetite of local government for
embracing these extra duties. Their representatives were noticeably
absent from the meeting we attended, though at the time we were assured
that they were supportive of the changes. Would the Government look
again at Amendment 225? This goes one step further than simply putting
in place whole family assessments—it places a duty on local
authorities to provide a range and level of service sufficient to
improve the well-being of young carers. We are not just talking about
the structure; we are talking about the resources as well. Without the
sorts of amendments that we have 
<?notus-xml column=190?>put forward, there would be a concern about the level of resources made
available locally. In other words, we would ensure that the resources
were in place to make a real difference to these young people’s
lives. Could the Minister clarify whether he agrees that there is merit
in such a
duty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:39:33"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000017">We
also have residual concerns about the split between adult and
children’s services in local government and their inability to
work together in a co-ordinated fashion. These structural problems
still need to be addressed going forward. How, if not in legislation,
might we make some progress on these issues so that all sides of local
government are talking and working
together?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000018">There
is also a big training need. For example, schools and other education
institutions, which often have no knowledge that their pupils are
carers, need training to identify the symptoms of young carers and in
the skills needed to champion their needs. As we have previously
identified, teacher training has a big role to play here. Could the
Minister address the issue of training, particularly at school
level?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000019">Finally,
an issue came up in the Care Bill: that of parent carers. It was raised
by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley. On Report, in response to her
concern the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said that it was the
Government’s view that the main provision for assessing and
supporting those caring for disabled children should be in the
children’s legislation, so that the family’s need for
support could be looked at holistically—in other words, it
should be in this Bill. It feels as if we are addressing
everybody’s needs in this wonderful new holistic arrangement
apart from the parents of disabled children. How has that read-across
from what happened in the Care Bill to this Bill been followed
through?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000020">Nevertheless,
we feel that the Government are on the right track and support their
amendment. We accept that this is a unique opportunity to improve the
lives of young carers. Obviously, we should grasp that. I very much
welcome the steps taken so far but would like answers on the points I
have raised with the noble Lord this afternoon. That could help to make
a lot of difference to young carers, in terms of the reality of their
experience on the
ground.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Tyler of Enfield" PimsId="5931" UID="1311116000077" xid="2143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000077">Baroness

agree with other noble Lords who think that today is a landmark moment
in what has been a very long journey for young carers to get the
support that they need. More than a year ago, the Government announced
new rights for adult carers. Those were extremely welcome but no
equivalent provisions were put forward at the time for young carers. I
pay tribute to the Government today for the very hard work they have
done over the summer, across government and working with the sector, to
get to this
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000023">Like
many other commentators at the time, I was particularly surprised a
year ago at that omission, given what we know about children and young
people who care for someone. They are particularly vulnerable to poor
outcomes and life chances. Obviously, the 
<?notus-xml column=191?>reasons for that are straightforward. It was clear that for far too long
young carers had not been sufficiently protected by the law. Indeed,
very few young carers had received statutory assessment and support.
Where they did, they often continued to undertake inappropriate levels
of caring, simply because the adult that they were looking after
continued to have unmet needs. The law was so confusing for young
carers that it often was not even clear who had responsibility for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000024">These
are critical points in what we are looking at today because young
carers’ well-being was directly affected by how far the adult
they looked after was supported. That is why the whole family approach
to assessment, which we have heard about already from the Minister, is
so important. If this is to make a difference in practice, it is
absolutely critical that children’s and adult services are able
to work together. That sounds obvious but any of us who have been
involved in the sector know that in practice it is often quite the
reverse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000025">As
my noble friend Lord Storey said at the beginning, the two Bills are
scheduled at the same time. Originally when I saw that, I thought
“Oh my goodness, I do not know how I will cope running between
the two”. Actually, I think the opportunity provided to link the
Bills is rather important. It has felt quite a complex process at times
but I think we are almost
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000026">I
have a final couple of points to make. What it really comes down to now
is regulations. In addition, the Government have made it absolutely
clear in various briefing sessions that the Care Bill provides a whole
family approach to assessment, and this will need to be set out in the
regulations. I would very much welcome any further assurances the
Minister can give today that all those loose ends will be tied up so
that the jigsaw is absolutely complete. One of the reasons that I
attached my name to Amendment 224, before the government amendment was
tabled, was to make it clear that adults’ support needs should
be met in order to protect children. I would particularly welcome
assurances that the Government intend to look at how regulations
relating to the Care Bill will make this crystal
clear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:45:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I, too,
commend all the collaborative work that has taken place. I pay
particular tribute to the expert advice and real-life experience that

only remaining point I would like to highlight concerns the respective

would like to see picked up in the
guidance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:45:52"></hs_TimeCode>. These
amendments, particularly the government amendment, together with the

pick up a point made by my noble friend Lady Jones of Whitchurch about
parents caring for disabled children. Carers UK points out that: it is
three times more costly to bring up a disabled child than a
non-disabled child; parent carers are more likely to be reliant on
income-based state support; 34% of sick or disabled children live in
households where there is no adult in paid work, compared with 18% of
children who are not sick or disabled; parent carers are more likely to
suffer relationship breakdown and divorce, and three or more times more
likely to suffer ill health and health breakdown than parents of
non-disabled children; and more than half the families who responded to
its survey felt that a lack of statutory services  was the key
factor contributing to their feelings of isolation. A recent study by
the Office of the Children’s Commissioner carried out with
disabled children found that for many disabled children and their
families the impact of low income on basic needs was compounded by
inadequate services, personal support and information. In some areas
necessary housing adaptations were hard to obtain, long
delays were experienced and appropriate provision was achieved only
through persistent parental
pressure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:48:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311116000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#1311116000030">Will

from the noble Baronesses, Lady Jones and Lady Tyler. I am concerned
that, even if a local authority had a duty in this regard, there would
be extreme difficulties in continuing this journey. We are on the first

do not get those services for disabled children, or a proper

said this before, but I sometimes think I am living in a parallel
universe where our aspirations and our joy at achieving excellent
legislation cannot be matched by reality. My own local authority is
about to face further cuts of £145 million on top of previous
ones. Every noble Lord in this Room should know 
<?notus-xml column=193?>what their own local authority faces and what the implications will be

is an answer. If we had good, co-ordinated family assessment and family
workers with no duplication—I speak as a trained family
case-worker in the past—where one worker undertakes the
assessment and knows which experts to call on when other expertise is
needed, and much more focus in terms of the work, we might actually
save resources. However, I do not know how that gets into regulations.
I would be very interested to see whether or not we can do that because
we could revolutionise some of these services by the approach we take
in implementation. We have legislation that says that disabled children
should receive X, Y and Z for particular conditions, but I fear that
the services are simply not there to meet the need. I am sorry if that
sounds a slightly sour note—it is not meant to, as I am utterly

what my noble friend has said in terms of the practical implementation
of this very welcome work that the Government have undertaken. I remind
the Committee of the difficulty posed by having continually changing
professionals. We debated earlier the issue of children making their
transition to adult services. On several occasions, parents have raised
with me the difficulties posed by the fact that they will have several
changes of social worker just as the child comes to access adult
services, such that the advocacy for that child as it goes into the
adult services is lost. I am very familiar in children’s
services, particularly those for looked-after children, with people
complaining and saying, “Look, I have had five social workers in
the past two years”. People have had multiple social workers,
which is very disadvantaging. When we talk about working together to
improve outcomes for children, as we are here, we need to keep a good
eye on the practicalities and ensure that there is more continuity of
professional care. We need to keep and retain our social workers and
other professionals, and not keep moving them around all the

I would just like to raise the concerns that I have heard in the past

that the service is changing and being reformed so often—with
the best of intentions—that, once they get to build
relationships with partners in other disciplines, they or the partner
are moved on. They do not know the other people and cannot work in the
kind of way I think we are talking about at the moment. I make a plea
that we avoid more large-scale reorganisations of, for instance, the
health service in the near future. The same story comes from social
workers in local authorities, who continually experience
reorganisations of their local authority, which overburdens them and,
again, breaks up the relationships necessary for them to be able to

Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, which seeks to insert a new clause headed
“Duty to secure sufficient support”, particularly so far

Governors’ Association. To what extent has the association
passed this message on to all governing bodies? Do a sufficient number
of schools have an individual governor from a background that reflects
the training, knowledge and awareness to recognise the support that
will be needed, and will they have specific responsibilities and duties
in this respect in order to see that the policy is properly applied?
This is particularly important. I go back quite a long way so far as
governing bodies are concerned. Even in the context of the education
Bills we have seen in recent years, it has taken some time to make it
clear that governing bodies are expected to play an important role, yet

wholeheartedly that the effective identification of young carers and
assessment of their support needs is best achieved by social care,

proposed new clause supports the combining of assessments. This enables
the necessary link to be made between a young carer’s assessment
and, for example, an assessment of the adult they care for made under
provisions in the Care Bill. This will support practitioners to take a
whole family approach to considering the effect of the adult’s
support needs on the rest of the household and provide appropriate
services that address the needs of the whole family. I also
agree that it is necessary to have sufficient local services available
to meet the needs of young carers. That is why we are building on the
existing general duty on local authorities to safeguard and promote the
welfare of children in need in their area by requiring them to identify
the extent to which there are young carers in their area with needs for
support.</hs_para>

do not agree, however, that a new duty to provide services to young

necessary or appropriate. Our aim is to start by ensuring that the
eligible support needs of the person being cared for are met. Most
commonly this is an adult, and the provision of services to that adult
will prevent young people from having to undertake or continue in a
potentially harmful caring role. If the young person still has needs
for support, services can be provided under the existing general duty
to safeguard and protect the welfare of children in need under the
Children Act 1989.</hs_para>

are in the realm of what actually happens in practice. The key issue is

GPs and those working in primary health services have a vital role to
play in identifying carers of all ages. For 2012-13, the Department of

231 has two purposes. It seeks to guarantee for all children and young
people an education, in whatever establishment the education takes
place, that will equip them with the skills and knowledge to succeed
both now and in the future. It also seeks  a guarantee that
their well-being and protection be safeguarded. Further, I put forward
the view that 
<?notus-xml column=199?>personal, social and health education, PSHE, is only partly a discrete
subject in the curriculum. These issues form part of the whole school
life; they are not just topics. Ofsted stated recently that PSHE is
patchy in schools and not always of high quality. I want to try to
describe how school policies, pastoral care, the school ethos,
curriculum and democratic principles all contribute to enhancing
opportunities for children and young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Minister will agree with me on this, but I suspect that he may read out
all the duties on schools and academies, and perhaps even on free
schools, which are currently set out in legislation and guidance. I
hope that he does not do that because we have gone through all this
before. Yes, there is guidance and, yes, there is legislation, much of
it couched in indirect language that is vague and aspirational. I
suggest that that is not good enough. I hear a good deal from Ministers
and the media about the rights and freedoms of schools, about league
tables, and about what the curriculum should contain. However, I hear
very little about the importance of fostering personal development and
self-confidence in children, and how that often underpins the ability
to learn. This is about the rights of the

prescribe what schools should teach or what might be their policies and
practices. It simply requires them to state what they provide in
relation to their policies, pastoral care, ethos, curriculum and
democratic principles. In other words, I seek to make explicit for
pupils, parents, governors and those otherwise connected to a school
what that school delivers. There are no cost implications to
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:13:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in the view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, about two
weeks ago, when he said that custodial institutions for young people
should follow the practice in schools. I believe that the principles I
have set down here would be very pertinent to young people in custody.
I also maintain that in a safe and well ordered school, based on
respect for self and others, learning and academic results will be
improved. I have seen this happen often in schools that were at risk,
which were turned around by placing an emphasis on respect, order and
clarity of
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:14:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

first about school policies on bullying, behaviour, young carers and
pupils’ health needs. It is reassuring that the Department for
Education has recently announced that schools must have in place a
policy on the long-term health needs of their pupils, but
children—perhaps it is only a small minority of
pupils—also suffer from the effects of bullying and bad
behaviour. Pupils being bullied and those who do the bullying both need
appropriate help. Expected standards of behaviour need to be clear to
pupils, teachers, parents and governors. If no one knows what the
school policy is on this, how do they know what  to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:14:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111134000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111134000084">4.15

will move on to pastoral care that focuses on the safety and well-being
of pupils. Schools can often spot a child who is in difficulty: they
may be physically 
<?notus-xml column=200?>marked, sullen and inattentive, or absent. Schools can call on help from
medical and social services, the police and so on. However, we know of
examples where children attending school have slipped the net and been
harmed. If no one knows what the pastoral care policy is, how does
intervention for the child
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:15:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111134000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111134000008">You
can smell a school ethos when you walk into the school. How are you
greeted? What does the school look like—for example, is any
children’s art or poetry on the walls or displays about school
visits, wildlife or achievement in sport? Do the children walk down the
corridors in an orderly way? Are they confident and polite with each
other and with adults? A positive school ethos does not just happen but
is something the leadership and staff—all staff, teaching and
non-teaching—create. That is what good schools do, in both the
public and private sector. They are proud of the qualities that they
encourage in staff and pupils. You only have to look at the evaluation
of UNICEF’s Rights Respecting Schools programme to see how a
whole school ethos encourages good learning and good citizens. If no
one knows how to encourage a positive school ethos, how will they know
that the ethos is
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:16:28"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111134000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111134000009">On
the curriculum, we all know that structured learning is at the heart of
a school and develops—or should develop—at each stage of
the child’s development. For example, a child learns to read and
he or she goes on to read more and more complex material. Children read
simple stories, then more complex literature, before they read
Shakespeare. That might be in sex and relationships education, drug
education or alcohol education, which dovetails with the amendments of
my noble friend Lady Hughes and Lady Jones. Young children can learn
about parts of the body, friendships and respect for others before they
go on, as older pupils, to discuss changes in their bodies, sexual
feelings and emotions, and risk-taking. Learning is, in all subjects, a
spiral. Subjects such as sport, music, drama and art all encourage
teamwork and respect for others.
Teachers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:17:31"></hs_TimeCode>, of
course, do not do it all—I certainly never did. They invite
specialists in to enhance pupil learning in areas such as drugs,
alcohol or sexual
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>. Parents
and governors have a right to know what children in a school are
learning at each stage, while pupils need structure. If that structure
is not there, how does anyone learn and how do they know what they have
learnt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

principles, which some would call citizenship. I am delighted to see
the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, sitting opposite, who introduced a most
excellent debate recently about the importance of citizenship in
schools and in higher education. Again, young children can learn in
school about participation in a group, respecting the views of others
and taking responsibility. I have seen many primary and secondary
schools with a school council, which contributes to the school’s
thinking on, for example, discipline, school meals and so on. As the
child matures, they may learn about national and local structures of
decision-making. If we hope that people will vote and take part in
democratic processes in this country, early introduction to the
importance of democracy is surely important.</hs_para>

believe that all children and young people have a right to a broad
education that encourages excitement in learning and joy at being in a
school community where they feel safe, respected and nurtured, and
where principles of self-discipline and respect for others and self are
paramount. If children grow up with these principles, they will surely
be better equipped to be better citizens and parents and to enhance
that most important quality, home learning. Home learning and parents
are the key to confidence and success for children. Sadly, that is
sometimes
lacking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111134000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111134000012">The
cycle of deprivation still exists: all pupils do not have the benefit
of a stable, nurturing home, where expectations are clear and learning
encouraged. Schools can help to counteract that, not by trying to
“teach” children of two or by pouring in more so-called
academic learning, but by having clear purposes on how children will be
helped to be secure and motivated to learn. Most schools are proud to
make public their policies and practices on personal development and
learning, but some do not. If schools receive state funding, then they
surely have a duty to the state to demonstrate that they provide a
good, broad education for our children. That is all I seek: not to
prescribe what they teach or what should be in a policy, but to
advocate that schools make provisions and policies transparent and
visible with regard to how they intend to develop pupils’
personal, social and health needs as well as their academic
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111134000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111134000013">My

232(Rev) is a detailed amendment which would place PSHE in the national
curriculum at all four key stages, covering primary and secondary
schools. It aims to broaden and update the curriculum to ensure that,

might not therefore be based in science

233 concerns the need to update the statutory sex and relationship
guidance issued by the department to schools. It would require the
Secretary of State to convene a round table of experts to update the
guidance, which was last updated in 2000 and which contains no
reference to the impact on the lives of young people of mobile
technology, the internet or online bullying. This update is, therefore,
long overdue. We have all been appalled by the recent cases of child
grooming, which have highlighted the urgency with which government
authorities and agencies need to act to prevent abuse of children and
young people. In recent court cases, it became clear that the young
girls concerned had no idea what they were getting into or how easily
they could be exploited. Meanwhile, research by the Children’s
Commissioner has found that too many young people do not know what a
healthy relationship looks like any more and do not even know what
consent means. In the absence of effective education, they are,
literally, modelling themselves on internet images
instead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111134000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111134000020">There

want a comprehensive, high-quality programme of PSHE. Teachers
themselves are campaigning for it, a large percentage of parents want
it and most of the children’s organisations are also campaigning
for it. That is why I also support the 
<?notus-xml column=204?>amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, to make PSHE part of the
national curriculum and, indeed, to put an expert group together to
look again at the guidance. An enormous amount of expertise is

preamble to the national curriculum is not enough but the Government
have stated what they want to do or rather what they do not want to do.
The noble Baroness, Lady Massey, has considered a duty that schools
already have. Hardly anyone could disagree with the wording of her
amendment. Frankly, it occurs to me that no school could comply with
this amendment without teaching a comprehensive programme of

wish to comment on two of the five important paragraphs in proposed new
subsection (1) of the noble Baroness’s amendment. As regards a
school’s ethos, she mentioned rights-respecting schools. It is
very important for children’s own protection that their personal
self-respect is built up by a programme of PSHE and by everything which
happens to them within the school. I have visited a rights-respecting
school where I saw some of the most mature young people that I have met
in any school. The pleasant, relaxed and respectful relationship that
existed not only between the young people themselves but between the
young people and their teachers was outstanding. That is the sort of
relationship that is conducive to high-quality learning. Paragraph (d)
in the amendment refers to the duty of schools to

who have self-respect and confidence and feel comfortable and happy in
their school environment are good learners and that will help them to
achieve academically as well. We are not talking about a soft subject
here; we are talking about a very important underpinning for all the
academic subjects and the high-quality qualifications which we hope all
young people will get in their schools, given good-quality teaching.
The noble Baroness, Lady Massey, is absolutely right that it is
important that this issue is in the curriculum but it is also important
to understand that this is not just about the curriculum but about the
development of the whole child across the whole school. Many schools
put PSHE right at the very heart of everything they do. They do not
just teach it as a subject; it is a fundamental underpinning of
everything that the children do. However, it is also important to teach
them all the things they need to know to help them develop into well
balanced, confident adults and to protect them from all the dangers
that there are out there for
them.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/7CE89A9CE00926F56A1AB74CAC472F6A0A5202DC" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 November 2013">Monday,

I thought that the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, made some
very telling points in her speech. I often wish that we had never had
the internet invented but the fact is that it is there, it cannot be

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111134000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111134000032">Many
years ago, because I have been in this building for 43 years, I was a
schoolmaster for 10 years. When I talk to my grandchildren—three
granddaughters and a grandson, ranging in ages from eight to
16—I realise what a very different world they are growing up
into. The challenges and moral dilemmas they face are so different from
those of the relatively simple and stable society when I taught in a
Church of England school in the early 1960s. Perhaps the biggest
problem we had to deal with was the odd Woodbine behind the bicycle
shed. Now our young people, almost all of whom are computer literate
and equipped with mobile phones—of a very advanced nature in
many cases—have their privacy invaded and eroded in a way

even before they have properly begun. If that means being very tough
with the purveyors of this filth, and denying adults access to it, so
be it. Not a single life is enhanced by the filth and degrading
material that we know about and read about. In Parliament, we must be

Nash, knows, because he has been good enough to see me on a number of
occasions since the debate on citizenship, that I have a passionate
interest in that. I have been able to convene a group of Members of
your Lordships’ House from all parties and the Cross Benches,
and we met with the noble 
<?notus-xml column=206?>Lord, Lord Nash, just three weeks ago to discuss our desire to see
citizenship playing a much more important part in the curriculum. We
would like to think that all young people, before they leave school
have the opportunity to participate in their local communities in one
way or another. The noble Lords, Lord Clarke of Hampstead and Lord
Ramsbotham, talked about bodies such as the National Trust, which wish
to engage the services of young people. It does not matter whether
their interest is in helping the elderly or the young, or engaging in
heritage or environmental projects. Each young person is a member of
his or her community and should recognise that that brings with it
obligations as well as rights. We have suggested to the Minister that
we would like to see every young person, having engaged in community
service, having the opportunity to have a citizenship certificate. That
is not a cataloguing of academic achievement, but recognition of their
participation in the community. We base this on the citizenship
ceremony, which was denigrated before it happened. People who become
British citizens go through this, and many of them think it is a
wonderful rite of passage, which it would also be for our young people
to have something similar. That was one reason, when I saw the

spiritual dimension is, sadly, all too often neglected. Without vision,

clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:43:21"></hs_TimeCode>.
Following on from that, the pastoral care, about which she talked
movingly, really ought to be at the core of any good school’s
being. You do not know a pupil unless you know his or her home and
social background, just as a doctor who only sees people in a surgery
and never at home has a one-dimensional view. How many of the awful,
dreadful things that have happened in recent years may not have
happened if there had been a greater degree of pastoral care and real
knowledge on the part of the school. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey,
is so right to

course, this leads on to something that the noble Baroness, Lady
Massey, talked about, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, which
is the ethos of the school. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey, is quite
right: you walk into a school and you know whether it feels right.
There were some wonderful primary schools in my former constituency in
Staffordshire. When you went in, you would have what was often the very
small head boy or head girl, perhaps only 11 years old, shaking you by
the hand in greeting and proudly  
<?notus-xml column=207?>showing you works of art and so on. You knew you were somewhere where
the children both cared and were cared for. Through the Peers in
Schools programme I recently visited a couple of schools in
Lincolnshire. It was immediately apparent that there was a sense of
commitment on the part of pupils and staff. When that happens,
discipline is not a particular problem. This is something that we all
ought to realise. Discipline is a question not of wielding a weapon of
any kind—in my young days as a schoolmaster that was part of the
curriculum; not that I personally did it—but of making young
people feel they are truly part of something that is worth while and
that they are learning things that are worth while.</hs_para>

been a game-changer. It is not simply about the internet and computers;
the smartphone ensures that the adult world, in its full beauty and

interesting to note that the Mothers’ Union, the
Children’s Society and a further 70 different organisations

the proposal. It was a few years ago now, but the board of education
that I represent worked with the Sex Education Forum to try to produce
some new guidance, but unfortunately that work was not taken up. It is
clear from all we have been saying that the purpose of education is not
simply to present children who can pass exams, but to create an
opportunity for young people to take control of their lives and values,
and to realise their hopes through their approach to life. It is a much
larger task, and for that social, emotional and spiritual intelligence
is important, along with academic prowess. When the chips are down,
nothing matters more to us than our relationships and how we form them.

young people have to navigate it. A rare consensus seems to be building
around the need to update the guidelines, so it is vital that we seize
this opportunity. As part of its commitment to addressing these issues,
the board of education that I represent has been compiling resources
for use in church schools and any other schools to help combat
homophobic bullying. That is an important piece of work, but the

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, briefly, I lend my support to
all three amendments. In their different ways they are designed to do
something about which I feel absolutely passionate, which is to make
sure that all children and young people, in whatever sort of school
they are, have access to high-quality, age-appropriate and up-to-date
sex and relationships education. Of course, I always put it the other
way around and say “relationships and sex education”, for
a reason I shall come to in a moment; that is absolutely critical. We
must focus on the need for all young 
<?notus-xml column=210?>people to understand the importance of healthy relationships. It
should serve them as part of their fundamental
education going through life.</hs_para>

the evidence of what people think at the moment. We have heard it and I
do not want to repeat it. We know what the National Association of Head
Teachers thinks. We saw the reports of the consultation on PSHE
education in March this year and the Mumsnet survey. I will just quote
from the Brook survey of 2011, where one in four young people said they
did not get any sex and relationships education in schools at all and
26% of those that did said that their SRE teacher was not able to teach
it well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:00:13"></hs_TimeCode>. I
fundamentally believe that relationship education should be a

points, quickly: when I reviewed the evidence, some of the
international evidence in particular talked about the very important
protective function that sex and relationships education can have on
young people. Those who have really good experiences of this are more
likely to choose to have sex for the first time later, use
contraception and have fewer sexual partners. We heard earlier, in the
set of amendments about young carers, about links between education and
health. There is a strong correlation between young people receiving
good-quality relationships and sex education and various public health
objectives, which are so critical. They are particularly critical to
women. The evidence tells us that they have resulted in earlier
reporting of sexual abuse, and in some cases  its prevention,
reduction in intimate partner violence, reduced numbers of unplanned
pregnancies, reduced maternal and infant mortality, and prevention and
earlier treatment of sexually transmitted infections, as well as
reducing the gap in health inequalities. These are important things.
The very foundation stone of all this is good-quality relationships and
sex
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111134000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111134000055">I
had the great privilege this morning to be part of a launch event in
the House of Commons for the Relationships Alliance. That was about
emphasising the huge importance of relationships in all aspects of
people’s lives, through all stages of their lives, and its links
with public policy. It was absolutely clear there that this has to
start young, with high-quality relationship education available to all
children. I was delighted to hear this morning that in Northern Ireland
it is officially called relationships and sexuality education. That
gets it the right way round; it sets the context and then gets to the
important aspect of sex education as well. I wholeheartedly support the

Northbourne (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, my Amendment 57,

amendment which I almost—almost—entirely
support.</hs_para>

here. First, there is a decision to make. The opposition
amendment—shall we call it that?—puts the burden upon the
state to list the things that schools must do. The amendment of the
noble Baroness, Lady Massey, and my amendment both place that
obligation on the schools themselves. That has a number of
implications. I will not go into those in any detail but it will make
schools think harder and it is more in line with what I believe to be
the Government’s policy, so perhaps it is more likely to
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111134000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111134000058">The
other point about these two sets of amendments, particularly the second
set, is that they are only about sexual relationships. If you think
about life, other sorts of relationship are equally important.
Particularly in the context of sexual relationships, the relationship
between a parent and their child is crucial. I would like to see built
somewhere into these amendments a reference to other important forms of
relationship. For goodness’ sake, no one can tell me that
relationships in the workplace do not matter, or when dealing with
clients, in social life or looking after older people and children.
Sexual relationships are frightfully important and I agree that at that
stage of a child’s development it is important that they should
be given the detail and information, and be able to question and think
about those relationships, but it should be done in the context of all
interpersonal
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:05:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/9FDBAA6047653A07B4F575C8E908520DDD283A38" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 November 2013">Monday,

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, I go back a long way on the
whole business of citizenship, which is what I shall call it. When I
came into this House, a new Government arrived shortly afterwards and
my noble friend Lord Northbourne was keen on promoting something called
citizenship. Suddenly there was an idea that citizenship was actually
going to be taught. I think we assumed that citizenship would encompass
some of the less explicit things we have been talking about in the
debate, and an awful lot of them were going to be taught within this
subject. However, it did not happen. The subject was spread around a
lot of other different subjects being taught, and nothing was made of

change in the influences bearing on young people and on families more

can address this issue. I am afraid that we have moved much further up
the sexual agenda. I am grateful for the comments that have been made
about my Private Member’s Bill, but having listened to what has
been said in this debate, I almost feel that it is out of date.
However, there is a lot of emphasis on this in the redraft and it is
still awaiting its Second Reading; I hope that that will come soon.
There is a lot more about education and support of that kind in the
Bill. Judging by the number of noble Lords who have 
<?notus-xml column=212?>talked about this subject today, I hope that we shall see lots of them

specific details of what I would like to see being covered, but I hope
that the Minister has, above all, listened to what has been said. My
noble friend Lord Cormack—I call him that we because we have
known one another in different capacities for many years, although we
do not necessarily always agree on every subject—made an
extremely telling contribution. Again, I hope that the Minister will
pay a huge amount of attention to what is set out in this amendment and
to what has been debated. It is absolutely the gist of what we have to
deal with in the future if we are to bring up the next generation,
particularly young women, with sufficient self-esteem, knowledge of and
confidence in themselves to play their full role. I fear that all too
many young women are regarded as objects in today’s world, which
is a terrifying comment on what we have failed to achieve so far. This
is a major challenge, but I will not go on because we have had 
a very good discussion. I hope that the Minister will be able to
reassure us that this issue is going to be taken

get it into legislation, but what matters is how it is delivered in

has always niggled at me. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, referred to
same-sex education in particular. I had an experience some years ago
when visiting a children’s home. The manager was gay. There was
a young man there who certainly dressed in quite an effeminate way and
could have been called gay, and the manager was saying, “Well,
this young man is gay”. My concern is that it is of course a
common experience for children to be attracted to the same sex as they
grow up, but many of them grow out of it. Those who take the most
active role in this particular area are sometimes overly enthusiastic
in promoting an attitude. In dealing with these sensitive
same- sex issues, on which people get so polarised,
there  should be a recognition that young people experience
attraction to other young people of the same sex, but most of them grow
through it. There should not be a misunderstanding that if one seems to
be attracted to other members of the same sex in one’s
mid-teens, for instance, that that is one’s sexuality and how
one is now set. I am sure that that is not the intention, but it is my
sense of how this sometimes comes out. Some reassurance on this point,
not necessarily in Committee, would be

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> Can I come back briefly on that? The
noble Earl has underlined the point we were making: addressing these
issues requires specialist teachers with proper guidance. I agree that
you cannot pigeonhole young people and say that just because you are
attracted at one moment in your life to someone of the same or
different sex, then you are that for life. People have complex
emotional experiences and they need to find the terminology to make
sense of the journey they are going on. It is all very complicated, but
that is why you need really well trained teachers who can explain this.
The alternative of pigeonholing in the way the noble Earl has described
makes young people feel very confused. They do not have any
understanding of the language to express what they are feeling, or they
do not think anyone will listen to or respect them if they admit it, or
they think they will be bullied. A way has to be found to put all these
issues on the table so that people can feel confident about their

Storey:</Member></B> First, I welcome the very clever amendment in the
name of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey. Sometimes we have to remember
the journey 
<?notus-xml column=214?>we have come on and how we have created some of these problems
ourselves. We had a national curriculum with core and foundation
subjects which was, if you like, the bible of schooling. At the time it
was very progressive and a great deal of thought went into it. There
might have been disagreements about what the subjects should be, but it
laid down clearly what every pupil would be taught. It was easy for
trainers to train teachers because they knew what the national
curriculum was.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111138000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000008">As the noble Lord, Lord
Cormack, knows, the legislation laid down clearly that every school
should have a daily collective act of worship. That does not happen in
schools any more, although it is still the law of the land. Ofsted,
when it reports, has concerns about how schools try to get round it by
having a quick prayer in the classroom or whatever. So that was
covered, and inspectors came to schools knowing what they were
inspecting. It was not just a very narrow definition of inspections.
They would look at the whole ethos of a school, and in their reports
would actually use the phrase—mentioned by the noble Baroness,
Lady Massey, and the noble Lord, Lord Cormack—“feel the
ethos”. They would shadow a pupil for a whole day to see their
experience in the school. Then as a society we thought, “Hang on
a second, we are being too prescriptive here. We need to let schools be
free and decide what they want to do. Perhaps the national curriculum
is a bit too much for them; perhaps the type of school is all a bit too
organised and bureaucratic”.</hs_para>

went down the route of academies, particularly for schools that were
failing pupils. Academies had slimmed-down curriculums where they did
not have to teach the national curriculum so they did not have to do
some things which they did not think important, whether that was PSHE
or sex and relationship education or whatever. We have built on that
tradition and, as political parties have coalesced round it, we have
said that we want a slimmed-down curriculum. There is a lot of merit in
that because in the past more of society’s concerns have been
pushed on to schools, which could not cope. We now have a slimmed-down
curriculum so that schools can breathe and build on their strengths.
Certain schools, such as free schools or academies, do not have to
follow it. What is more, we will move to being more flexible on who can
teach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111138000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000010">We have
got to a situation with the national curriculum where it is not
actually a national curriculum. It does not have to be taught in
Scotland and Wales, in academies or free schools. It is not a
curriculum for all, so I do not know why we still use that phrase.
However, we are now realising that children have a right to learn and
teachers have a right to teach. Pupils have a right to be respected and
understood. We suddenly realise that some of the pillars of our
educational establishments are in danger of being taken away or need to
be developed

noble Baroness, Lady Perry, was absolutely right to say that it is not
just about looking at what needs to be taught, it is how you teach it
and the quality of the people who teach it. I can tell noble Lords from
bitter experience that there are hundreds of schools that proudly say
in the school prospectus 
<?notus-xml column=215?>that they teach PSHE. You go in and it is a tick-box exercise; they do
not teach it. The same is true of sex and relationship education. We
have got to realise that. It is all very well sitting in Committee and
saying, “This is what we believe in; this is what we
want”. It will not change unless we change the foundations of
how things
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:21:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111138000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000012">I
say to the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, that I do not know what has
gone wrong here. I had always thought that schools produce a school
prospectus that sets out the aims and values of the school and states
clearly what it does. I remember my vision and the phrase we used. We
said that we wanted to, “Ignite the imagination of
pupils”. We listed everything we did in the school, and why we
have lost that, I do not know. Parents should be able to look through a
school prospectus and see exactly what the school is doing and how it
is done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111138000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000013">This
debate is absolutely fascinating and I will make just one other point.
When I first started teaching we had sex education. We followed the BBC
“Merry-Go-Round” radio and television programmes and we
starting teaching it at the age of seven. If you leave it until
children are aged 11 and 12, it becomes a bit of a joke. They get
embarrassed and giggle, but if you do it when they are six and seven,
it becomes a natural progression. I hope that we realise in our
deliberations, and in how we build on this debate, that other
fundamentals have to be put in place as

Benjamin (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support these amendments
and congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, on her persistence on
these matters and issues. Like my noble friend Lord Storey, I believe
that the right teaching for vision and delivery can make a difference
and change lives in schools. I know this from personal experience,
because I often visit primary and secondary schools across the country
and always speak about philosophy to children; some as young as four
years old but right up to 18 year-olds. I tell them to practise the
philosophy of what I call my three
Cs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111138000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000015">Consideration
is about having respect and empathy for other people and being able to
put yourself in the place of others without being judgmental. The more
privileged you are, the more consideration you need to show others. The
second C is for contentment, which is about having a happy, contented
heart and not being jealous and envious of what other people have. The
more contented you are, the more ready you are to receive what is right
for you. The third C is for confidence, which is about having high
self-esteem and high self-worth. If others do wrong to you, it is not
your fault. It is about feeling worthy and being able to love and give
unconditionally, and practising that at that very young age. I teach
children how to deal with temptation and to learn to say no, whether
that is to joining a gang, having sex, drinking or bullying
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111138000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000016">This
philosophy really empowers children. It makes them feel worthy and
gives them the spiritual guidance that children crave in the
materialistic world in which they live today. It helps them to cope
with adversity; to feel as if they belong. Children need that feeling
deep in their souls. It gives them the confidence to face the world: it
opens up their minds to the world. I have 
<?notus-xml column=216?>been doing this for the past 30 years or more and I have seen the
results. However, more needs to happen: children need to feel as if
they are somebody.</hs_para>

life I receive a letter from someone or meet someone in the street who
tells me: “What you did for me in school saved my life. What you
did showed me I could be somebody. You showed me how to lead my life
the way I wanted to, to be who I should be”. I met a woman who
said: “I was a crack addict when I was a young teenager. When
you came into school and spoke to me, you saved my life. You showed me
I was worthy. You made me look at it and see it in a different
way”. We need to give that kind of philosophy to children in
school: they desperately need that
help.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111138000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000018">I also
agree that we need to have meaningful sex and relationship education as
part of PSHE, to demonstrate what loving, respectful relationships are.
Too many of our young people are learning from, and being influenced
by, online pornography. Girls think they have to behave like porn stars
to be liked by boys. Boys expect the girls to behave in a sexually
explicit way. They both think this is what love is. Some young people
are even raping and sexually abusing very young children—five
year-olds are being raped—because teenagers are putting into
practice what they have witnessed in online pornography. Children need
to have a balanced influence about sex and to learn what love and
respect are.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111138000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000019">After one school visit,
when I spoke to 13 year-old girls, I received several letters from
girls who said that no one had ever told them that they were loved
unconditionally. Years later, I met one of these girls who told me that
she had not got pregnant and was going to sixth-form college. She
wanted to be somebody: she felt worthy. We must not assume that
children know how to cope or deal with the hard slog of life. We have
to teach them so that they can lead the happier life that some are so
desperate for. They can then pass that knowledge on to their children.
It all starts at school, where they spend most of their early life.
They do not always receive that guidance from home, so let us make sure
that those who do not get it do not miss out. That is why I support
these

Lister of Burtersett:</Member></B> My Lords, I hesitate to speak after
such a powerful speech, but I want to make three brief points in
support of these amendments. First, my noble friend Lady Jones referred
to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is important to
have a rights-based approach to sex and relationship education. People
sometimes say that there is too much emphasis on rights these days and
not enough emphasis on obligations. However, we must remember that this
about the right to safety—a very basic right for children and
young people. A few years ago, in Leicester, colleagues and I did some
interesting research about young people’s transition to
citizenship. We were quite surprised that the young people found it
much harder to articulate their rights than they did their obligations.
They knew what their obligations were: many of them had expectations
about paid work and knew their obligation to be good citizens in the
local community. However, when we asked them about 
<?notus-xml column=217?>their rights they did not know what to say: they did not know about
rights. It is a myth that we have got too much into
rights and not enough into obligations.</hs_para>

second point which links to that, to which we have perhaps not paid
enough attention in my noble friend Lady Massey’s amendment, is
about democratic principles and citizenship education. I am glad to say
that my party now supports votes at 16. If we are to have votes at 16,
or even votes as we have them now, it is really important that young
people have good citizenship education which prepares them for that
and, as has been said, infuses the ethos of the school. There has just
recently been quite a bit of debate about whether there is any point in
voting. The comedian Russell Brand has been saying,
“Don’t vote, it encourages them”. Well, we want to
encourage young people to vote. We want them to know why they are
voting and what is at stake. That is another reason why this education
is so
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:30:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of an informal parliamentary mindfulness group. I know that mindfulness
is now being taught in schools and is one path into the three Cs that
the noble Baroness, Lady Benjamin, referred to. All of us, whether we
are young or older, face difficulties in our life. We have bad days,
and mindfulness helps us to steer a path through that and helps to
achieve the contentment to which the noble Baroness referred. I hope
that that will also be part of the mix when we think about citizenship
education and sex and relationship

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, we agree about so much here. Everything
that noble Lords have mentioned is what a good education is all about,
and is what a good school does. I agree that it is so important that
all schools do this. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey, is of course
right that we have debated this many times before. We just disagree
about how we ensure that it happens.</hs_para>

read out a long list of things that schools should do. All schools
should have a behaviour and bullying policy, and Ofsted will inspect
against it. She talked about ethos, pastoral care, self-confidence and
raising aspirations. I agree that all schools should provide their
pupils with the right to an education which delivers these. All schools
will, of course, state their ethos and their approach in their
prospectuses, as my noble friend Lord Storey has said, and at
parents’ evenings, and be inspected by Ofsted. This is what good
schools do. However, making the schools write all this down in lists
will get us nowhere.</hs_para>

believe that politicians, Peers or bureaucrats are the best people to
dictate what should be delivered in schools in this regard and how it
should be delivered. We believe that writing lists of what PSHE should
cover, this kind of central prescription, is a recipe for failure, for
minimum prescription and for a race to the bottom; a race which we have
just successfully won by following this approach with the shocking OECD
statistics which show that our school leavers are among the most
illiterate in the developed world.</hs_para>

Government trusts teachers and head teachers to tailor their PSHE and
general provision to the individual needs of their particular pupils.
Many of these needs are specific and cannot be delivered by teachers. I
speak with some experience here. We took over a school which was
failing on just about every measure. The behaviour was awful. The
morale and the results were very poor. There were gangs and riots; it
was just a mess. We brought in a head teacher and a new senior
leadership team, and they introduced a totally new behaviour management
policy which was clear, consistently applied, and required the teachers
to be in evidence at every turn. We brought in a raising aspirations
programme and, by letting the team get on with it, they turned the
school around in record time. They did not do this by following
lists.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111138000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000027">I am
sad to say that we still have gangs in the school, as do most
inner-city schools in this country. Their students often join gangs
because of the complete absence of male role models in their lives.
They are often brought up in maleless households; have been to primary
schools where there are no male teachers—which is the case in
just over 27% of primary schools in this country. When we identify
these pupils, when they come in at age 11, we seek rapidly to give them
male role models but, sadly, the gangs have often got there before us.
These children are not going to open up to their teachers whom they see
as authority figures. The only way to counsel them out of
gangs—which is a highly skilled job—is to introduce them
to mentors, often mentors whom they see as being of their own kind.
That means black boys to black men; white boys to white men; Asian
girls to Asian women.</hs_para>

other issues. I have just been involved in a school where there is an
issue with forced marriages. Examples such as this confirm us in our
belief that enforcing more prescription on teachers is not the way
forward. The kind of education that the noble Baroness, Lady Massey,
and my noble friends Lady Walmsley and Lord Cormack, refer to, is being
delivered in schools up and down the country which failed for years and
which have now been taken over and turned around by successful academy
sponsors. They are developing the whole child and putting them at the
centre of the school. I hear no desire from them, or the mentors, or
the counsellors I work with, for a list of things to do. Frankly, they
think this completely misses the point.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Storey for his observations. I also agree with my
noble friend Lady Perry that teachers are at the heart of this and that
there may be some provision where they need to bring in outside
agencies. Because they are very much at the heart of this, we have
developed more than 350 teaching schools and are expanding SCITTs,
which are much more highly rated by
Ofsted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111138000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000030">The
underlying sentiment of much of the new clause proposed by Amendment
231 is one that the Government would support. We want to see all
schools accountable to their pupils’ parents for what happens.
That is why, in 2012, we amended the School Information (England)
Regulations. Schedule 4 of those regulations contains a list of the
minimum information that maintained schools are required to publish,
including 
<?notus-xml column=219?>their ethos and values, with parallel provision included in academy
funding agreements. This includes the content of the curriculum to be
followed for each subject during each school year and details of how
additional information relating to the curriculum may be obtained. On
this basis, schools must publish information about their PSHE provision
as well as about any other subjects they teach which are not part of
the national curriculum. We expect all schools to make provision for
PSHE, drawing on the good practice to which I have referred. This is an
expectation which we have made clear in the introduction to the
framework of the new curriculum and one which I make clear to all
academy sponsors and academies whenever I meet them. This expectation
is not set out in the statutory requirement. However, as I say, this
Government believe strongly that teachers need the flexibility to use
their professional judgment to decide when and how best to provide PSHE
in their particular local circumstances.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111138000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111138000031">One of our core aims in
reviewing the national curriculum was to slim it down and to reduce
prescription, thereby allowing teachers more flexibility and freedom to
exercise professional judgment at a local level. They can, for
instance, create space in their curriculum for bringing in outside
agencies or for teaching specific matters in PSHE. To place new and
wide-ranging duties on governing bodies and head teachers would run
counter to this approach. Through the school inspection framework,
Ofsted inspectors continue to be required to consider pupils’
spiritual, moral, social and cultural development when forming a
judgment of a school. This enables important aspects of PSHE to be
considered in a proportionate and integrated way, linked to the core
inspection areas. We consider that publishing the information set out
in the current school information regulations and academy funding
agreements is the best way for parents to have access to the key
information, and that teachers should be given more freedom, not less,
to decide the content of the school curriculum and how it is
taught.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/E31F2139C38C11D42B4BEA347774BF536B562F07" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 November 2013">Monday,

to Amendment 232(Rev), I have already indicated, but will stress again,
that the Government want to see all schools provide a high-quality and
broad programme of PSHE that includes sex and relationship education.
Where we differ is how such provision is specified and delivered. As I
noted previously, placing new and wide-ranging duties on governing
bodies and head teachers, and furthermore requiring that the Secretary
of State issues new guidance to be followed by teachers, would run
counter to this Government’s whole approach. International
evidence shows that the best school systems in the world give
considerable autonomy to those professionals working on the
ground.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111143000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000002">Sex
and relationship education is already compulsory in maintained
secondary schools. All schools, when providing it, must have regard to
existing guidance issued by the Secretary of State. Amendment 232(Rev)
proposes that all schools teach sex and relationship education,
including at key stage 1. It specifies that such education should
include information about sexual and domestic violence, for example. I
agree that it is vital that schools cover such issues when providing
sex and relationship education and that they do so in an appropriate
manner. However, to specify that pupils in 
<?notus-xml column=220?>key stage 1, including those as young as five, should be taught about

Currently, parents have the right to withdraw their children from

science and acts of collective worship. There is no need to amend any
of the provisions in existing legislation as this proposed new clause

to Amendment 233, I agree with the noble Baronesses on the importance
of high-quality teaching in this area and on the need for young people
to have reliable and well informed sources of advice and support.
However, I do not consider that the best way to achieve that is to
revise the statutory guidance on SRE. The existing guidance was
considered as part of the recent review of personal, social, health and
economic education that I mentioned earlier. In March 2013, the review
concluded that the statutory guidance continued to provide a sensible
framework for schools to use in developing their own SRE policy. We
agree that sex and relationship education should be informed by both
current and expert advice. However, our clear view is that that advice
is best provided by expert organisations which can make available to
schools up-to-date materials and advice on changing technologies that
fit within the framework of our guidance. This means schools can always
access the most current advice and guidance on every emerging issue and
teachers can make informed decisions about which resources best meet
the needs of their pupils. We have directed schools to sources of
information, including the Sex Education Forum, which has already
listed 24 pages of further resources that are available to secondary
schools for teaching SRE. There are other organisations with which
schools can engage in relation to this such as Brook, the Family
Planning Association and the SRE
Project.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111143000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000005">A
number of noble Lords referred to access to pornography and online

When I was first looking into this, I spoke to a number of people and
was struck by the fact that when I spoke to people who were highly IT
literate and had children, the more IT literate they were, the more
concerned they were about this issue because they appreciated how, with
three clicks, children could look at the most appalling images.
However, we are doing a lot in this regard. Through the UK Council for
Child Internet Safety, we are working with social networking sites and
internet companies on developing a safer online environment, which I
agree is essential. Good progress has been made with the main ISPs,
which are putting in place systems to encourage customers to use

conclusion, the best people to help schools deal with changing

schools to draw on the up-to-date advice produced by experts for use in

expert organisations and professionals have an essential role to play,
but in our view that does not require the Government to revise existing
guidance. We consider that publishing the information set out in the
current school information regulations and academy funding agreements
is the best way for parents to have access to the key information.
Teachers should be given more freedom, not less, to decide the content
of the curriculum. However, we do not disagree at all about what we are
trying to achieve here. I would like to reinforce that point: we do not
disagree at all, it is just a question of methodology. I would be happy

one-half and two-thirds of training is in schools. We are expanding

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend for raising the point about the training of teachers. During our
earlier debates on child development, the Minister said something that
I certainly found quite comforting, about there being, in the standards
for teacher training, a requirement that teachers have a good
understanding of child development, which will be helpful in this area
as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:50:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111143000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000016">I
listened with great interest to what the Minister said about his
personal experience in this area and about why he thinks that it is
unhelpful to be so prescriptive about what teachers do. Although that
does not instantly change my point of view, I have sympathy for his
position. I think of the situation, for instance, in Finland, where
they have a very loose national curriculum. The Minister for Education
there has described his teachers as “researchers” who
develop their own kind of education base. However, in Finland, of
course, teaching has been of very high status for many years. They have
competition to teach and to get 
<?notus-xml column=223?>on to teacher training courses—it is a different culture. I
suppose the question might be where we are today in this country with
moving towards raising the status of teaching. We have only started
that in the past few years. The question is one of getting the balance
right between prescription and freedom, and empowering teachers to do
the best they can with all their
capacities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111143000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000017">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:52:03"></hs_TimeCode>
welcome what the Minister said, particularly with regard to mentoring
and the recognition that so many boys are growing up without fathers in
the family, which was a theme of the debate on Friday on the age of
criminal responsibility. One of the very encouraging parts of the
Minister’s response then was that the Home Office is putting so
much energy and investment into mentoring for these young people.
Two-thirds of young black men in the United States are growing up
without a father in the home. The proportion of lone-parent families in
this country is even higher than in the United States and about twice
the level, I think, in Germany and Denmark. We have a real issue that
we need to address. I often wonder, when thinking about this topic,
whether there might be a more strategic push on mentoring: a sort of
big society approach, with something like a national service
commitment, to think about how we could mentor young men who do not
have fathers in their families. I was encouraged by what the Minister
said in that

responses and will come on to those later. Meanwhile, I sincerely thank
all noble Lords who have taken part in this fascinating, very
knowledgeable and passionate debate about the well-being and education
of children and young people. Two key things have perhaps come out for
me today. One is, as several noble Lords have mentioned, how the world
has changed and how we need to address that change. We all have to
tackle this, not only by helping children to have self-respect and
respect for others but by tackling the dangers of the internet and
other
technology.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111143000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000021">Secondly,
the issue of child development has been central to many of our points.
It is very important to understand child development. As my noble
friend Lady Jones has just said, of course you do not teach five
year-olds about the intricacies of sex. However, they can learn about
friendships, respect and parenting: of course they can. Not a single
person in this Room has even mentioned, as the Minister did, teaching
children of five about sex. We have all learned our lesson about age
appropriateness.</hs_para>

because it encompasses—as the noble Lord, Lord Storey,
said—what should be good practice in schools: policies, pastoral
care, school ethos, curriculum and democratic principles. I am not
being prescriptive: all I am asking is that schools should make their
approaches on these explicit to parents, staff, governors and, very
importantly, to pupils. What does a school expect of its staff and its
pupils? The noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, talked interestingly about the
protective function of education and the use of experts. I have never
said that teachers should be able to do everything. They cannot, of
course, but teachers and schools can—and most do—create a
climate for good relationships and learning. My noble friend Lord
Northbourne quite rightly said that this is about all relationships,
not just sexual relationships. One example of this is that if children
learn respect for themselves and others—if they have
opportunities to explore spiritual, moral and emotional issues and
learn about the importance of security, well-being and
safety—then they may well become better parents and know how to
relate to and guide their own children. This is different from maths,
English and so on in the formal
curriculum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111143000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000023">I
am sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, is not in her place; I
take her point about trained teachers. However, my view has always been
that teachers go into teaching because they want to relate positively
to children. I am not asking for miracles: I see generally trained
teachers who, if they do not know something about a particular issue
like drugs or first aid, will call in an expert to help them. That is
what trained teachers do: teaching is about relating positively and
sympathetically to children. If teachers do not do that then I really
do not know what they are doing. Amendment 231 calls for schools to
make clear how they are promoting things: it is not about making lists.
I thank all noble Lords who have contributed their thoughts.</hs_para>

by much of the Minister’s response. The amendment is not about
writing things down in lists and I do not understand why he thinks it
is. I find it quite insulting that the issues I raised in this
amendment should be considered as a long list of things to do. It is
not that: it is about what schools should be about. I am not being
prescriptive and the noble Lord’s good example of turning a
school round was exactly what I am talking about: heads and
teachers—and, perhaps, pupils and governors—sitting down
together and working out what policies they need and how those policies
will be carried out to make the school better. That is not about making
a long list: it is about having policies. Nothing is achieved, in any
organisation, without policies.</hs_para>

that all care leavers, including young asylum seekers and migrants who
came to the UK as children, are given the support that they need while
they are in the UK by amending Schedule 3 of the Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 so that it does not apply to people who
initially came to the UK as children. It would not create an automatic
right to support but would make sure that a young person is not
discriminated against on the basis of his or her immigration

concern is that young people are leaving care and being made destitute.
Another point to make clear at the outset is that while being so harsh
to these children, it is unlikely that they will be returning home to
Eritrea, Afghanistan or anywhere else earlier, and it may well make it
more difficult for them to return home as they disappear into
prostitution, disappear from sight, and go

immigration status of a separated or unaccompanied child does not
affect their entitlements while they are in care and as care leavers
under the Children Act 1989, a young person’s entitlements after
18 will depend on their immigration status. There has long been concern
about the forced destitution of former separated asylum-seeking
children when they turn 18 and a recent report from the
Children’s Society found a sharp rise in the number of young
people who are experiencing destitution. The majority of 
<?notus-xml column=226?>unaccompanied children in the UK are seeking protection from violence,
abuse and persecution from places like Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran.
Some of these young people experience destitution because they are
discharged from children’s services at 18, and have been refused
asylum and exhausted their rights to appeal, often despite significant
barriers to their return or continuing protection

continue to be supported by the local authority. However, in practice,
this still happens as the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
prevents some categories of migrants from accessing certain types of
support, including leaving-care provisions, and practice among local

the provisions under Schedule 3 have precisely this effect by
withdrawing vital leaving-care support from young people while they are
still in the UK. This is at odds with the Government’s policy on
supporting British care leavers. As I say, there is also no evidence
that withdrawing support is effective in encouraging young people to
return to their country of origin. A growing body of evidence
demonstrates that forced destitution is an ineffective policy. In fact,
severing contact between refused asylum seekers and the authorities is
likely to make returns more
difficult.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111143000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000033">Destitution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:04:49"></hs_TimeCode>
has severe consequences for young people’s safety as these

into criminality. It also has an impact on a young person’s
physical health, for example, through their being malnourished and
unable to travel to see their GP or get warm clothing in the winter, as
well as having adverse effects on their often already fragile mental
state. Various systematic reviews estimate that 19% to 54% of separated
children suffer from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder
compared with 0.4% to 10% of other children in the UK. Being able to
access education and safe housing—two key protective factors for

in England until they are 18. Some may be asylum seekers. The latter
were referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. However, some are
not asylum seekers and the minute they turn 18 they become illegal
immigrants under Schedule 3 to the relevant Act, and there is no one to
protect them. If they remain in this country, they are particularly
vulnerable. They have no status, no access to public funds and no
housing. Some of them sleep on the streets and are dependent on soup
kitchens. They are destitute. Others are at real risk of being sent
back to the abusing situation in the country of origin from which they
had escaped, having been trafficked here. Some of them are terrified at
the prospect of going back because they may be retrafficked or may well
be very ill-treated for having escaped the traffickers, so to go back

that those with whom they had been privately fostered were not in fact

to sort out their status before they reach the age of 18. Some of these
young people clearly could go back to their country of origin, and
there are voluntary organisations which work in that area. Others,
however, clearly cannot do so. Recently I met a young man at a

intelligent, and wanted to get on with his life. I asked him about his
immigration status, and the answer was, “I have not yet got a

have used quite often. That, of course, has many implications for
physical health, as a result of being malnourished and not being able
to get access to a doctor. It leads to illegal work, sexual
exploitation and all kinds of problems. There must be another way, a
more humane and civilised way, of handling vulnerable young people who
have all their lives before them. It seems crazy that, at the age of

youngsters had been through school, some of them having come to this
country when they were seven, eight or nine years old, but they had no
clue how to go through the legal system or get a solicitor—there
were free lawyers in those days. It would have been extremely difficult
for them to establish a life in their own country again. Many had lost
touch with their parents, or their parents had died. They did not know
what they would be going back to and, in many cases, did not speak the
language. It is incumbent on us—this is maybe part of the social
care aspects of the Bill—to see that social services ensure that
their immigration status is settled before they are 18, so that when

Unaccompanied children who apply for asylum are supported by local
authorities under the Children Act 1989 and under similar legislation
in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the same way as any other child in
need. As children their immigration status is, rightly, irrelevant to
their entitlement to support, and remains so until they reach
adulthood. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, made an extremely cogent
set of points, especially on picking up at an early stage the
challenges for some of these children. Local authorities already have a
duty under the Children Act to plan the transition to adulthood of care
leavers. She made an implicit point about when that ought to be
examined and not left until the young person is about to turn

unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in care, this planning should
include the different steps required in response to different
immigration outcomes. The guidance is clear that local authorities
should work with dedicated case workers at the UK Border Agency. As we
set out in our letter to noble Lords on 1 November, the
Department for Education is currently developing an action plan to
drive forward improvements—which I think is what the noble
Baroness was flagging—in the way local authorities identify
children in, for example, private fostering who are at risk and where
there may be concern about a child’s identity and immigration
status. The noble Baroness specifically mentioned schools. We are
currently exploring options with interested agencies and partners and
hope the noble Baroness and any other noble Lords who are interested

young people reach the age of 18, the position may be different from
the one I have just described for under-18s. If they have been refused
asylum, have not been granted any other form of leave to remain in the
UK and have had an opportunity to appeal against the decision to an
independent judge, then automatic access to further support from the
local authority ends. That is what we are addressing here. It is
important to recognise that support may still continue where it is
necessary to avoid a breach of a person’s human rights. Whether
this is necessary will depend on an assessment of the individual
circumstances, but should include any failed asylum seekers who are
taking reasonable steps to return to their countries of origin but need
time to make the necessary arrangements because they are awaiting the
issue of a passport. Equally, those who face a temporary barrier to
departing because, for example, they are too sick to travel, should
continue to receive
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111143000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000051">I

<?notus-xml column=231?>We will have further discussions on it, both in the Chamber and outside

issue and other noble Lords picked it up. In the case of potentially
trafficked children, the first step is to assess whether there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the person is trafficked. If the
answer is yes, in practice it is likely to be considered as a breach of
the child’s rights to refuse leave to remain. I hope that

apply for asylum. This is a problem that local authorities already
struggle to deal with. It could even put more young people at risk by
providing an incentive to make dangerous journeys to the UK to claim
asylum in order to receive extended support. The dangers of these

committed to ensuring that young care leavers whose immigration appeal

that any genuine barriers to preventing return are identified. In
response to the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, I emphasise that the local

considers that stopping support would breach a person’s human
rights, it should
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:26:42"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Home Office provides funding to local authorities to cover the cost of
extended support beyond the point at which a person turns 18. It
already continues for three months after the person’s
immigration appeal rights are exhausted, specifically to allow the
local authority time to make the necessary assessments of individual
cases. If an assessment shows that additional time is needed to
complete the practical arrangements to leave, or where there are real
obstacles to leaving the UK, further support should continue. However,
we are aware that some local authorities are unsure of the practical
steps they should take to assess individual cases
properly. Young people in different areas may experience
different levels of support.

of this country really feel that that is of great importance. However,
I am not aware of any evidence that the policy in this area acts as a
pull factor or that the way we treat these young people encourages more
young people to come into this country. Indeed, my understanding is
that we currently treat these 18 year-olds more harshly than adults of
similar status but who have not come through the care system. This
needs to be looked at carefully. I will take away what the Minister

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:41:42"></hs_TimeCode> Lords,
Amendments 235 and 236 would simply place in the Bill the current
permitted staff/child ratios for childminders and nursery settings
respectively. The current ratios are at the moment in regulations which
can be changed by order of the Secretary of State. I had hoped I would
not have to speak to these amendments, which were precipitated in the
Committee deliberations of this Bill in the other place by the
Government’s attempt earlier this year to increase the permitted
staff/children ratios for childminders and nurseries. Noble Lords may
recall that, after strong resistance from many parliamentarians but
particularly also from childminders, daycare providers and
children’s organisations, and after Mr Nick Clegg made it clear
that the Liberal Democrats could not support these changes, eventually
they were dropped in
June.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111143000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000062">However,
in the last 10 days the Government have launched what I have to say is
a very strange online survey using Facebook and Twitter to ask parents
what they know about ratios in childcare settings and the
qualifications of staff. Entitled “Ratios in Nurseries and Other
Childcare Settings”, it asks 10 questions of parents with three
and four year-olds in nurseries. All the questions are about ratios and
qualifications. The Pre-school Learning Alliance described the survey
as “biased”, “unscientific” and easily open
to manipulation. Clearly, the understandable concern is that
Conservative 
<?notus-xml column=234?>Ministers are trying to revisit this issue. There is suspicion about the
motives behind the survey, particularly when, inevitably given its
nature, the results will be random, unsystematic and potentially open
to
abuse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111143000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000063">Therefore,
we felt we had to explore the support for putting into primary
legislation the current requirements on staff ratios. As I said, that
is the intention behind Amendments 235 and 236. We have done this for
two reasons. First, the current ratios have, for the moment, stood the
test of time in balancing on the one hand the quality of provision for
children and on the other hand the costs to providers and therefore to
parents. The evidence from Holland, where ratios were increased in
2005, was that this led to significant worsening of the environment for
children and a much impaired responsiveness by staff to the children.
They have now reversed those increases in the Netherlands. There is
currently no evidence to support an increase of
ratios<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:34:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111143000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0001.htm#13111143000064">Secondly, we also
believe, given recent events, that if at some point any future
Government were to feel that that was evidence to support a change to
these ratios one way or the other, this issue is sufficiently important
to require close parliamentary scrutiny and debate. The well-being of
the youngest children in our society will depend on getting this right.
At one level, the subject of staff/child ratios in nurseries could be
taken to be a very dry subject, but I know that noble Lords will
appreciate that it is critical. It is the most fundamental factor in
shaping the daily experience of children in those settings: how happy
they are, how well cared for they are, whether that setting is
contributing positively to their development or
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:35:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

set out the current regulatory requirements. Amendment 235 covers
childminders. To set out what we are talking about, a single
childminder can currently care for up to six children aged eight,
including a maximum of one baby under 12 months and another two
children under five. In practice, then, a childminder can now have a
baby of six months, two children aged 18 months and three children aged
five. In addition, he or she can exceptionally look after a baby
sibling of one of the other children and her own baby if parents and
inspectors agree. That is up to eight children: three babies, two young
children under five and three children under eight. One would think
that that was already more than enough to ensure quality of
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:36:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

experience. I regularly—with my husband—have my three
granddaughters for whole days at a time, at least once a week. They are
aged three, two and one. I can tell you, at the end of that day, all we
can do is flop back and put our feet up. Getting the three of them out
with coats on, in separate buggies or whatever, is a logistical
challenge in itself. I think that, normally, six children—one
baby, two toddlers and three others—is quite a challenge for a

must be one member of staff for every three children under two, one
member of staff for every four children aged two to three, and one
member of staff for every eight children who are over three, with
minimum standards of qualification set out in regulations. In 2008,
when my party was in government, the ratios for three and four
year-olds 
<?notus-xml column=235?>were increased. Providers were given the option to increase the ratios
to 1:13 for three and four year-olds, provided a qualified teacher had
direct contact with the children. These ratios already seem to be as
far as one would want to go. For example, a 22-place nursery with six
babies, eight toddlers and eight three year-olds would be required to
have just five members of staff. Again, that seems fairly
challenging<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Nutbrown, who was appointed by the Government to undertake an
independent review, opposed increasing the ratios and restated the well
evidenced facts not only that good-quality childcare benefits young
children’s development, but that that quality is also directly
related to the numbers and the qualifications and training of the staff
concerned. These amendments do not mean that the ratios could never be
changed, but they would mean that the Government would have to bring
forward legislation to change them that would precipitate the detailed
scrutiny that we think that they
merit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:39:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

pretty sure that the Government will say that putting ratios into
primary legislation would make it too difficult to change them.
However, when it is judged to be a very important issue, this and
previous Governments do and have put detailed requirements into primary
legislation. We have at least one example in this very Bill, where the
Government have include the maximum time limit for care proceedings,
over which courts cannot go. They have put that time—a
number—in the Bill. This is an equally important issue,
justifying primary legislation. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/E52C411F3EE7271A98900531B7ACD70F46E8A7DF" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 November 2013">Monday,

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, I am one of the Peers who is
concerned about the government proposals to change the ratios and I
tabled an Oral Question on this which the Minister answered. I admire
the work that the Government have been doing through Iain Duncan Smith,
working in partnership with Graham Allen, on recognising the importance
of the earliest years of a child’s life and ensuring a good
attachment between the child and the parent. Andrea Leadsom MP is the
chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Sure Start
Children’s Centres and a leader of the 1001 Critical Days
campaign, which looks at the period covering pregnancy and the first
two years of a child’s life. It is thinking about how that time
can be made into the best possible experience for both the parent and
the child.</hs_para>

therefore very worried about the proposal to change the ratios for
babies in baby rooms, particularly because one tends to have the least
experienced and least educated young women working in them. I recognise
that the Government are concerned about affordability, and we all want
children to have the benefit of both good quality group care and
childminding. In terms of affordability, three or four months ago an
interesting editorial piece in <I>Nursery World</I> looked at the
various factors that contribute to making childcare expensive or
affordable. One of the things the editor emphasised was that the
Government need to fund the entitlement properly—the entitlement
that had been available up to three years old but has now moved down to
two year-olds. The Government should come up with the full whack, and
that is an aspect that needs to be 
<?notus-xml column=236?>addressed. The editorial highlighted that several different factors make
this a complicated issue, which means that it is difficult to make
childcare profitable.</hs_para>

when the Government decided not to go ahead with the changes in the
ratios, and I hope that the Minister can now assure us that, for the
foreseeable future, we will not see them changed, particularly for the
very youngest children.</hs_para>

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, not for the first time the noble Earl,
Lord Listowel, has hit the nail right on the head. There is more than
one way of making childcare more affordable for parents; properly
funding the free entitlement is one of them while increasing the ratios
is not. I was also concerned about the proposal and I am very pleased
that the Government did not go ahead with it. It is not appropriate to
put these ratios into the Bill. But, having said that, if the
Government come up with another proposal to increase the ratios between
now and 2015, I will be writing to Nick
Clegg.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I can assure the noble Baroness, Lady
Hughes, that as a mother I would never regard child/staff ratios as
being a dry subject. No doubt other noble Lords have had the same
experience as she of what it feels like to look after three
under-fives. However, coming home to find a childminder reading
<I>Captain Pugwash </I>to my two spellbound little boys while at the
same time spooning food into my baby girl, and everything being
peaceful and quiet, demonstrated that some considerable skills are
required. That was not quite how I managed it.</hs_para>

to set out ratios and minimum qualifications in primary legislation. As
the noble Baroness and my noble friend Lady Walmsley have pointed out,
staff/child ratios are currently set out in the Statutory Framework for
the Early Years Foundation Stage and are made under powers in the
Childcare Act 2006. Ratios are currently linked to other welfare
requirements which are also set out in secondary legislation. To put
this into primary legislation would separate it from all the other
welfare requirements covering child protection and the suitability of
staff. These include health, the safety and suitability of premises,
the environment and equipment. These are all equally important and
interrelated areas concerning the well-being and safety of young
children. In our view, all aspects of the welfare requirements are
intrinsically linked and should stay together in secondary
legislation.</hs_para>

aware—again, reference has been made to this—that the
Government brought forward proposals in January of this year to amend
ratios where staff were more highly qualified; there is always a
balance between how you make child care cost effective and how you
ensure that it is safe. However, as my honourable friend the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Childcare,
Elizabeth Truss, made clear in the other place on 11 June,
the Government are not proceeding with the proposals to change the
staff/child ratios for childminders and non-domestic providers. We do
not believe that it is right to put staff/child ratios in primary
legislation. I assure noble Lords, and especially the noble Earl, Lord
Listowel, that the Government have made it clear that we do not intend
to proceed with the previous proposals to amend the existing ratios. I
hope noble Lords find that reassuring.</hs_para>

Lady Hughes, flagged up one or two issues such as the survey. The
survey was intended to inform our understanding of what barriers might
be preventing early-years providers from using an existing flexibility
that is already there for three-to-four year-olds. We wanted to know
why that arrangement, which would no doubt have come in under the noble
Baroness’s Government, was not being used. Social media was used
for that; it is a cost-effective and quick method of gaining some
responses that might help to inform that. It was limited; it was live
for just under a week and received 260 replies. The department will
have a look at that as part of its ongoing work. It was looking at why
the existing flexibility was not used.</hs_para>

Baroness and other noble Lords that the Childcare Act 2006 provides a
framework for the regulation of childcare which prescribes the detail
in secondary legislation subject to the negative resolution procedure.
These powers contain a simple but effective safeguard in that there is
already a requirement that my right honourable friend the Secretary of
State for Education must consult Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector
of Education, Children’s Services and Skills and any other
appropriate persons before making welfare regulations. The existing
process achieves the right balance between an appropriate level of
parliamentary scrutiny and taking into account the views of providers,

have listened patiently for weeks to the deliberations of this
Committee and have been very impressed with the standard of expertise
and knowledge. I have been asked to speak to these amendments relating
to childminders and childcare agencies because, when we started to
discuss this, I became very animated. I felt that noble Lords were all
at the grandparent stage while I am still at the mother stage. Having
served as an MEP, rushing off to Brussels every week while my children
were very young, and now abandoning them again to come to your
Lordships’ House, I confess that I am utterly dependent on my
childminder, Margaret. There are hundreds of thousands of other parents
in the same situation. We all, of course, want the best for our
children. We need to feel confident that they are in a safe and secure
environment, especially if we are not there to protect them. Getting
this right is critical, not just for the well-being of the children,
but for the piece of mind of countless parents throughout the land and
to ensure respect for the
profession.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000003">I
will focus on the issue of childminder agencies, as mentioned in Clause
74. It is essential that a high standard of care is maintained and
important to note that there have been many improvements over the
years. In 2008, the early years foundation stage was a welcome
development in the professionalisation of childminders, leading to
increasing standards and better qualifications. However, I remember
watching my own childminder despair at the paperwork that mounted up; a
new and challenging part of her job. The purpose of this clause is the
introduction of agencies which would take away the paperwork burden and
allow childminders to concentrate on what they do best. 
<?notus-xml column=239?>At first, encouraging childminders to join agencies might
seem like a sensible suggestion, as these agencies can give advice,
share best practice and provide a useful network as well as lessening
the burden of paperwork. The problem is that, however competent the
agencies are, much of the paperwork involved is about observation,
assessment and planning for the individual child. So I am not quite
sure what they will bring to the party, other than an extra tier of
bureaucracy and significant additional cost. This goes directly against
the Government’s recently published paper <I>More

inevitably, be passed on from childminders to parents, adding to their
burden. Childcare costs are one of the key issues causing the cost of
living crisis under which so many are currently suffering. In addition,
as this is a dramatic departure from the current system, it would make
sense to wait until this proposal has been properly piloted and
consulted on, prior to putting it in the Bill. We seem to be putting
the cart before the horse here. This is the general gist of what we are
trying to address with Amendment
237.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000005"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>On

threefold. If the nature of your private business—the
agency—is to attract more people to use your service but you are
at the same time policing the people who pay you on the quality of the
service that they provide, there is a clear conflict of interest. Paid,
privatised regulation should be regarded with a degree of suspicion. Is
there not a chance that standards of care will be reduced if agencies
are inspecting their own people? How can the Government ensure
standards when individual childminders are not inspected? We all know
the pressures that Ofsted is already under. In time, it is likely that
fewer and fewer individual childminders, signed up to agencies, will be

the current system, the costs of inspection are borne by the local
authority. In future, these costs will inevitably and dramatically fall
on parents. The costs of childcare are already seriously impeding many
from returning to the workforce, in addition to putting immense
pressure on already hard-pressed families. Is the Government seriously
suggesting that, in future, they will have to cough up significant
extra money to pay for childminders to register with an agency? We are
creating a two-tier system, and a lack of reference in new Section 51D
to individual childminders being inspected seems to underline this.
Amendments 239 and 240 draw attention to this two-tier system, and
ensure that all childminders are treated equally, with no temptation

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, I have considerable concerns about
this clause, which is why I have given notice of my intention to oppose
the Question that the clause stand part of the Bill, to initiate a
probing debate. As I understand it, the Government’s objectives
are to recruit more people to childminding, to improve quality and to
make childcare more affordable for parents. Those are all laudable
objectives with which I have no argument. I am yet to be convinced that
these objectives will be achieved by setting up for-profit childminder
agencies. I realise that it would be voluntary for childminders to sign
up to an agency. If that was where it ended, that would be all very
well. However, I fear that the existence of these agencies could affect
non-participating childminders, parents and children. That is of great
concern to me. I am aware that pilots are being carried out, but this
measure will be in place before they have reported. In addition, when
the pilots are assessed will that assessment cover just the agencies
themselves, how many childminders they sign up and how satisfied the
parents are, or will it go wider than that and study whether there has
been any adverse effect on other early years provision in the
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_time UID="1311123000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000083">7

the Government’s perceived objectives in reverse order. First, I
cannot for the life of me see how this measure will make childcare more
affordable for parents. These are profit-making organisations and they
will have to set up a whole administration system, provide quality
improvement services for childminders and comply with all the
regulations. To pay for all that, they will either charge childminders
to be registered or charge parents a percentage of what they pay the
childminder. Both options will fail to cut costs for parents since
childminders are low paid. If they pay the agency, they will have to
pass on the costs to parents by increasing their fees. Alternatively,
the agency will have to pay the childminder less if they are to keep
the cost to parents the same. Childminders cannot afford to accept less
money for their services. The average childminder only earns
£12,200 per year and has no paid holidays or sick leave. They
may earn much less than
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000011">Let us

setting up the new business, getting registered and trained, and
complying with safety regulations. However, good local authorities
already do this for childminders so there is really no need for
profit-making agencies to take over the role. It is the fear of many
childminders, most of whom have declared that they are not interested
in signing up to an agency, that, in places where there are several
agencies, the services to independent childminders offered by the local
authority will be severely depleted 
<?notus-xml column=241?>because of issues of scale. They will eventually be forced into agencies
against their will. They are independent small businesses who decide
when and how long to work and how to go about things, within the safety
standards and the early years foundation stage. Those who have been in
touch with me say they really do not want to be told what to do by an
agency. Childminding will only become more attractive as a profession
when they are paid more, but the agency proposal does nothing to
achieve
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000012">Finally,
on the most important issue of quality, I am very concerned that Clause
74 requires Ofsted to inspect only the way the agency supports its
childminders—and a sample of its childminders. Since inspection
is now moving away from local authorities and exclusively into the
hands of Ofsted, parents will rely even more than they have done on the
conclusion of an Ofsted inspection when choosing a place for their
child. How can a parent be sure of the quality of an individual
placement if it has not been inspected? On what basis would parents be
able to rely on the judgment of an agency? Why should an outstanding
childminder sign up to an agency that has only a satisfactory
rating?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000013">It
seems to me that handing the responsibility for ensuring quality to the
agencies is simply a way to take it away from local authorities, many
of which have great expertise in assessment and improvement
services—but could always do more. Replacing the successful
Ofsted registration system for childminders with a fragmented
combination of local and national inspection systems risks undermining
standards, lowering the professional status of childminders and
reducing the transparency of information on quality for families.
Broadly, it is difficult to see a long-term future for a fragmented
early years inspection system that hands responsibility for certain
aspects of inspection to providers themselves. Some high-performing
early years systems operate successfully with regulation devolved to
local authorities, but there are no examples of privatised regulation.
This is an approach that the Netherlands, whose example the agency
model is based on, stepped back from after quality problems
arose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:04:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

possible advantage to parents, and that is when their usual childminder

can help out in an emergency, so even that is not a unique selling

how the vision and the application of this proposal will work together.
The Government 
<?notus-xml column=242?>have a laudable wish to increase the level of childcare that is
available to families—mostly women who find themselves unable to
work because they do not have good childcare arrangements. The
Government want to provide good quality childcare and ensure that the
costs are manageable. They want to reduce bureaucracy and provide a
focus for childminders so that they can share some of their
understanding together. I appreciate the last point in relation to
agencies, but the others I find very difficult. I cannot see how the
solution fits the

transparency, I share the views of other noble Lords, which is that
anyone who has been involved in inspections—noble Lords know
that I have been a regulator in at least three different
agencies—knows that asking a regulator to inspect its own is
fraught with danger. That is my major concern with regard to ensuring
that child protection issues are picked up. We know how easy it is, as
they say, to consume your own smoke within an organisation.

extremely expensive. That is because she is confident that the care is
of high quality and meets the right timeframes for her. I would like

also grateful to the Minister for hosting a meeting on this matter. The
discussion was useful, and it was particularly helpful to be reminded
that childminder agencies will be one way to help childminders feel
less isolated. I have visited childminders in the past. They were part

Government to be open-minded in terms of how they develop childcare in
this country. Perhaps I may highlight the value of nursery schools and
other things that the Government are involved in, but I should voice my
concern that an over-emphasis on private provision may not be helpful.
After all, the cost of this provision is in the pay and training of the
women—and it is women—who do this work. Historically, it
has been very difficult for these businesses to make a profit. These
nurseries have found that they just do not get enough bums on seats and
therefore it is costly to run the whole business which means that they
have to drive down price by cutting training or pay. We know that pay
in nursery care has historically been very low indeed. The risk is that
by having too much provision in the private sector 
<?notus-xml column=243?>we will move towards something which may not be much cheaper but may be
inferior in quality. From memory, the turnover of staff in nursery
schools is about 4% whereas in some of the large private providers the
figure can be 14% or 15%. I recall that the latter offer quite a
different setting. It is so important that our young children have
continuity of care and that their professionals stay around for them
for long periods. There can be stagnation but in general we want that
long-term relationship with the

There are superb childminders right across the country, but their
numbers have fallen 
<?notus-xml column=244?>significantly in the past 20 years. Through the introduction of agencies
we aim to increase the number of childminders in the market, and
provide an affordable, high-quality service to parents. This is
enabling legislation. Childminder agencies will be voluntary. No
childminder will be forced to join an agency. However, some
childminders, especially those new to the profession, may want to take
advantage of the support that agencies can
offer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000024">Securing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:14:53"></hs_TimeCode>
high-quality outcomes for children is central to the agency concept.
The noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Huyton, the chair of Ofsted, told us
when we met with Peers last week that when childminders work together,
there is a clear improvement in quality. Ofsted regards this as a way
of professionalising the sector and driving up standards. Ofsted will
play an essential role in ensuring this through its inspection of an
agency—including, for example, observing a sample of

239 and 240 seek to make all childminders registered with early years
childminder agencies subject to individual inspection by Ofsted.
However, we believe Ofsted will have sufficient powers to inspect early
years providers registered with an agency. First, the Bill contains
provisions that will enable Ofsted to inspect early years provision by
those registered with an agency, as part of its inspection of an
agency. Secondly, Ofsted retains its existing powers of entry to any
registered childcare premises to determine whether providers are
complying with requirements imposed by the Childcare Act 2006. If there
are concerns about an agency-registered childminder, Ofsted will have
the power to go in and
investigate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000032">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:20:22"></hs_TimeCode>

instead observe a sample, although they pay close attention to the
arrangements in place to secure good safeguarding. That is the approach
we wish to see. We are working closely with Ofsted to develop a robust
registration and inspection regime for childminder agencies to make
sure that agencies are providing a high-quality service to childminders

feature of the agency model is that the agency rather than Ofsted is
responsible for monitoring the quality of provision and compliance with
registration requirements for its childminders. It is the agency that
is responsible for communicating the outcome of monitoring evaluations

burdens that childminders currently face. It does not make sense for
agency childminders to be subject to two separate inspections by
different organisations. Agencies will be required to monitor the
standards of care being delivered by the childminders they register and
will be able to help childminders with training, business support and
advice, and in finding parents needing childcare. They will also be a
valuable service for parents who want to find a high-quality

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, before the noble Baroness, Lady
Morgan, withdraws her amendment, as I assume she will, I will just make
a point about the Minister’s analogy that not every
schoolteacher is inspected by Ofsted, but a sample from the school. We
have a very different situation here. Childminders are working on their
own, behind closed doors and on their own premises. Teachers in schools
are all on the same premises and their work is quite visible and open
to everybody to see. When I did my teaching practice, I was in an
open-plan laboratory and my supervisor was the other side of the
bookcase. It was terrifying. The fact is that it is very easy to know,
in a school, if a teacher is not doing the right thing or is just not
up to standard. It is not the same thing at all and I really would not
accept that
analogy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000038"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Morgan of Ely" PimsId="5924" UID="1311123000096" xid="2134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000096">Baroness
Morgan of Ely:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
addressing some of those issues. I would like to pick up on a number of
them. First, he suggested that childminders working together makes
sense. Yes, absolutely that makes sense, but informal networks exist
already. Local authorities are doing a lot of this work already. It
also seems very odd that we are still in the middle of a pilot and are
putting something into the Bill when we have no idea whether it will
work. Even if it does, the sample we have is just six private companies
out of 20. When the whole point of this is the suggestion that we move
to a private sector approach, having just six out of 20 does not seem
to make much
sense.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000039">The
Minister mentioned that Ofsted can inspect any of these childminders.
The question is: will they? The cost of inspection according to Ofsted
is £701 per childminder visit. That is quite a lot when Ofsted
is already under pressure financially. I am very disappointed 
<?notus-xml column=247?>that the Minister did not address the issue of the conflict of interest,
because that is absolutely fundamental. If a private provider inspects
childminders who are paying it, there has to be a conflict of interest.
At this time of austerity, when people are really up against it
financially, to suggest that costs will come down is fairy-tale land.
The assumption that the Minister makes is that a childminder does not
have enough children, and that they can go to an agency that will have
a whole pool of children they can pick up. That is unlikely to be the
case because we know that there is already a shortage of childminders.
The probability is that costs will increase for childminders and they
will pass that cost directly onto parents. That concerns me
but—</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Listowel" PimsId="1518" UID="1311123000097" xid="1317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000097">The

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a probing amendment because we
now have a very new and different Ofsted framework for early years
settings. Local authorities will no longer inspect them, although they
will retain their duty to help improve quality, based on the Ofsted
verdict. There is some confusion as to whether Clause 75, which allows
settings to pay 
<?notus-xml column=249?>for an additional Ofsted inspection, only applies to early years
providers operating on non-domestic premises. That would exclude
childminders and, I think, Sure Start children’s centres. I hope
that the Minister can clarify this point because I have received two
different interpretations from the
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000044">Referring
back to our debate on Clause 74, it occurs to me that childminders who
are signed up to agencies but who are not chosen in the sample of those
to be inspected by Ofsted when they inspect the agency, may wish to ask
and pay for an individual inspection in order to establish their own
standards. Can this be done? I am doubtful about how many childminders
would want to pay for an inspection if the Government decided to extend
the provision to them. They are not highly paid and may not be able to
afford it. A small nursery setting might also find it a burden. How
much are the inspections likely to cost? We do not want to add to the
running costs of settings, in order to avoid them putting up the price
of childcare for parents. Could settings that did not previously have a
“good” Ofsted rating make quick improvements and ask for
another inspection? This might give them an advantage over other
settings, since normally the inspectors turn up without notice.
However, if you have just made improvements, ask to pay for another
inspection and then the inspector comes along exactly when you are
expecting to see him, that gives an
advantage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000045">How

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, the aim of this clause is to enable
early years providers to request and pay for a reinspection from Ofsted
outside the normal inspection cycle. We are aware of the impact an
Ofsted inspection rating can have on a provider. Both reputation and
the ability to offer funded early education for two, three or four
year-olds will be affected. This could, in turn, have a dramatic impact
on the viability of childcare provision, as much early years provision
is run by private, voluntary and independent organisations.</hs_para>

balance between maintaining high standards of provision and encouraging
providers to make swift improvements in quality. While we recognise
that Ofsted has introduced changes to its inspection framework for
group providers from 4 November 2013 so that providers who receive
“requires improvement” or “inadequate”
ratings will be reinspected in six to 12 months, there are a number of
providers, for example those judged “satisfactory” prior
to 4 November, who will not benefit from these changes immediately and
may wait a number of years for the opportunity to be reinspected,
regardless of having made improvements much sooner.</hs_para>

clause is to enable providers to request a paid-for reinspection at an
earlier date, should they wish to do so. This opportunity to
demonstrate improvement sooner provides an incentive for providers to
make improvements at a swifter pace. We appreciate that it would be
unworkable if every provider requested and was given an early
reinspection. That is why the Secretary of State, working closely with
Ofsted and others, will set out in a remit letter the conditions under
which such reinspections can take place. For example, we intend to have
a minimum time between inspections to ensure that the provider has had
an opportunity to make the necessary improvements. The situation will
be kept under review and further conditions will be introduced if
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311123000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111-gc0002.htm#1311123000049">My
noble friend asked about costs. The fees will be set out in secondary
legislation and the amount will be decided based on further negotiation
with Ofsted and in the light of any consultation with the sector.
Ofsted has indicated that the cost of childcare inspections is likely
to range from around £700 for an individual childminder to
£1,500 for group settings. Individual providers would need to
decide for themselves whether or not paying for an early reinspection
is worth it financially in terms of generating future additional
income. I remind my noble friend that it is of course entirely
voluntary. On her analogy with endless GCSE resits, I would say that
costs could be a factor.</hs_para>

friend also asked about the scope. It will include childminders and
childcare within a Sure Start children’s centre. It does not
include inspection of children’s centres’ wider
functions. Childminding agencies could request reinspection, but not
the childminders registered with them. If that does not sufficiently
clarify, I am happy to write to my noble friend in answer to any of her

at the outset, this is a probing debate. The Minister has clarified one
point about the scope of the application of this power to request
another inspection. As I say, I have had briefings from two different

other that they were. Having said that, I cannot imagine many

(Con):</Member> The new national curriculum, for teaching from 2014,
includes an improved programme of study for citizenship education at
key stages 3 and 4. It is organised around core knowledge about
democracy, government and how laws are made and upheld. Citizenship
education should equip students with the skills and knowledge to
explore political and social issues and to take their place in society
as responsible citizens. Specifically at key stage 4, pupils should be
taught about: “local, regional and international governance and
the United Kingdom’s relations with the rest of Europe, the
Commonwealth, the United Nations and the wider
world”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311115000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131111w0001.htm#1311115000066">Teachers
