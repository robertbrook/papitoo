My understanding of the situation is that a Member who shouts Aye must
not then vote in the contrary direction, or vice versa. I do not think,
although I entirely respect the spirit of the hon. Gentleman’s
point, that it reflects in this case because a Member is not obliged to
vote simply because he or she has shouted. What he or she must not do
is shout one way and vote the other. But the point that the hon.

only a few years ago, in June 2004, that after a very long battle the
people of Gibraltar were rightly granted the ability to vote in
European elections. It was wholly wrong that part of the European Union
was excluded from those elections. The people of Gibraltar, as members
of the European Union, are now entitled to vote in those elections, so
it is consistent with that argument that the people of the Rock should
also be granted the right to vote in any future referendum regarding

today’s debate is not about our future in the European Union. It

did not explain the precise reason why it is vital for Gibraltar to
have its voice in the referendum. The reason is that under the treaty
of Utrecht, which—he may correct me—took place in 1713,
the United Kingdom has ownership of Gibraltar for as long as we and the
people of Gibraltar should wish it, but should we ever renounce our
ownership of the Rock, then ownership automatically passes back to
Madrid. Therefore, under the treaty, the people of Gibraltar have no
ability to seek their own independence. If they were not given their
chance to have a say in the referendum, if the United Kingdom chose to
leave the EU, they would be placed in the ridiculous situation of
having to choose whether they wished to remain part of the European
Union or to become Spanish.</hs_Para>

reflects the nature of the Bill, which in many respects—I am

is that Gibraltar does not have separate representation in its own

Horwood:</Member></B> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is wrong.
Gibraltar is not equivalent to Essex in any respect. It is a separate
territory and it has self-government. It is not represented in this
Parliament. That is a fundamental principle of our relationship with
Gibraltar. It is more analogous to Denmark’s relationship with
Greenland, which voted in its own right to leave the European Union
despite remaining a Danish territory. Greenlanders were give their
right to have control over their own destiny, but the Bill does not
explain how Gibraltarians would be given that same right should their
conclusion in a referendum differ from that of the people of the United
Kingdom. The Bill leaves a huge unanswered question, in that it
appears, on the face of it, to offer a clear scenario whereby the
voters of the United Kingdom could, in effect, expel Gibraltarians from
the European Union against their

which seems to have cross-party 
<?notus-xml column=544?>support, the people of Gibraltar will get a say in the referendum. If
Scotland chooses to stay part of the EU, it would still be bound by the
collective result and the same is true of Gibraltar, unless it chooses
to cease being part of the United Kingdom. I am struggling to
understand why the hon. Gentleman does not see it in that way. Perhaps

do not want to diverge from the substance of the debate, so I will
concentrate on the new clause and amendments in the group. It is
important to understand why there are so many amendments on the
franchise to be used in a referendum: because this short Bill is
woefully inadequate. It would create a referendum held on the basis of
the franchise for parliamentary elections, not European elections, even
though it would have enormous implications for the 1.4 million British
people living in other European Union countries. It would also affect
British people who live elsewhere in the world, perhaps working for
companies based in the UK, with families still living in the UK. Their
prosperity depends on our membership of the EU.</hs_Para>

B when we discussed at great length a series of documents about the new
relationship between the overseas territories and the EU—I have
them with me and may well quote from them. Some overseas territories
have become what is called in the jargon “outer areas” of
the European Union. For example, the French have overseas territories
that not only have the right to be represented in the French Senate,
but are defined as territories of the EU. However, the British overseas

not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110852000434" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0001.htm#13110852000434"><Member ContinuationText="Thomas Docherty" PimsId="5686" UID="13110852000837" xid="1052" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0001.htm#13110852000837"><B>Thomas

on the overseas territories. They are all different. Some of them are
completely depopulated, some have few people, such as the Pitcairn
Islands, which I think have 56 or 57 people, and others, such as the
Falkland Islands, have a long-standing British population. The people
of the Falkland Islands have expressed their self-determination in a

Committee on Decolonisation in the UN over the years, and the way in
which countries such as Argentina have behaved with regard to other
British overseas territories, we would be in a difficult position. The

to the reasons behind the many amendments that I have tabled. There is
a major problem with the Bill. For example, because the choice has been
made to have a franchise based on parliamentary elections, people who
would be able to vote in a European election in this country will not
be able to participate in the referendum. That means we are in the
absurd situation whereby the citizens of some European Union countries
will be able to vote in our referendum, but others will
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110852000454" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0001.htm#13110852000454">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T10:56:25"></hs_TimeCode>
example, a French person living in the UK who is married to a British
person and has children at school, growing up, or at university in this
country, will not be able to vote in the referendum. Someone from the
Republic of Ireland, Malta or Cyprus will be able to vote, however,
because Malta and Cyprus are in the Commonwealth, and Commonwealth
citizens, along with British citizens, are able to vote in
parliamentary elections. Because of our long-standing arrangements with
the Irish Republic, even though it is not in the Commonwealth, citizens
of the Republic of Ireland are able to vote in parliamentary elections
and to stand for Parliament in this country. The measures in the Bill
mean that we will exclude people who are settled with families in the
UK, and who have a long-standing 
<?notus-xml column=552?>relationship with this country, from voting on whether to wrench apart
the UK from their European country, yet we will be allowing other

from many parts of the world. There are British Pakistanis, British
Indians, British Bangladeshis, British Somalis—all kinds of
people. When they get British citizenship they can, of course, vote in
our elections, but some choose to retain citizenship of another state.
I have a close friend who is a local councillor in my constituency. He
has a British passport, but his wife has kept an Indian passport, even
though they have sons who are in their 30s and they have been living in
this country for decades. Because his wife is an Indian citizen, that
facilitates them when they go back to India, rather than meaning that
there are problems with visas. She is able to vote in British elections
and, as a Commonwealth citizen, she will be able to vote in 
this referendum. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that a
constituent is married to someone from a non-Commonwealth country, such
as Somalia or the United States. They are not allowed to vote in our
parliamentary elections, so they will not be able to vote in the
referendum. The Government are increasing the number of anomalies.

remarks, 1.4 million British citizens live elsewhere in the EU. Only
those who have registered as overseas voters may vote in the

no more than 15 years and specifically register as an overseas voter.
The figures I have seen show that there were fewer than 20,000
registered overseas voters in December 2012. The future of the 1.4

there are a lot of them. Some of those people gain the full benefit of
our education system and contribute to our society in many ways, just
as British people living in other European countries benefit from their
systems. We have seen recent reports that say that more British people
are on welfare benefits in other EU countries than people from other EU
countries living in the UK on benefits. If we were to leave the
European Union, what would happen to those British people’s
right to reside in those other European countries and benefit from the
facilities, social security systems and other amenities of those

living in other countries would not be allowed to vote in the

48 refers to the rights of prisoners to vote. Interesting statements
have been made recently by the Government’s senior law officers,
but the position is confused on whether some—if not
all—prisoners will be given the right to vote. The Bill is
silent on that issue, but if the Government’s position changes
in the next few months—despite the clear vote of this House
against giving votes to prisoners—we would need to discuss it in
some detail. There would be implications if the European Court
maintains its judgment that some prisoners should be given the right to
vote, not just for parliamentary elections but for the franchise for
any referendum on leaving the European Union. That is why I have tabled
the
amendment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110853000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0001.htm#13110853000026">Amendment
8 would clarify the basis on which people would be able to vote. At
present, overseas voters can register under the 15-year rule using the
address of the local authority area in which they had lived previously.
The amendment would allow people to register to vote at a British
embassy or high commission. It is deplorable that only 20,000 people
living elsewhere in the European Union have the entitlement to vote
under the 15-year rule. Some 1.4 million British people live in other
European Union countries and we should be trying to find ways to
encourage them to register. To reduce the bureaucratic hurdles, the
easiest way to do that would be to allow people in Spain, say, to
contact the British embassy in Madrid; people in Portugal to go to
Lisbon; people in France to go to Paris; and so on. Similarly, if we
were to change the franchise to allow British citizens living anywhere
in the world to take part in the referendum, we should allow them to go
to the British high commissions in Delhi or other countries of the
Commonwealth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110853000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0001.htm#13110853000027">I

that they were designed to make it clear that the underlying

European parliamentary elections in Gibraltar is determined by an Act
of the Gibraltarian Parliament and Government, rather than by this
House. In this case, however, the new clause proposes that the UK
Parliament set the terms of a franchise that, for the purposes of this
referendum, would include Gibraltar. For that reason, subsections (2)
and (3) make it clear that despite this particular instance, that
underlying constitutional relationship—the 2006 constitution
gives far-reaching internal powers of self-government to the elected
Administration in Gibraltar—remains

of those European Commonwealth countries who are legally resident here

entitled to vote in a UK general election. In respect of the hon.
Gentleman’s amendments, it would be legitimate for him to use
the vehicle of a representation of the people Bill at some stage to
seek to alter the terms of the UK’s general election franchise
in the way he proposes, but it is not appropriate to use the Bill of my

important points have been raised about the franchise. The first I

correspondence with a Danish constituent in the Hogganfield part of my
constituency who is married to a UK national, and has the right to vote
in a Scottish Parliament election, a local government 
<?notus-xml column=561?>election in Scotland and European elections in this country. He will
have the right to vote in the Scottish referendum, but under the Bill

will not have the right to vote in this referendum.</hs_Para>

up an interesting anomaly. We know that one of the implications of the
Scottish referendum is that Scotland would no longer be an EU member
state. Therefore, my constituent is being allowed the opportunity to
vote once on whether to stay in the EU but in the event of
Scotland’s voting to stay in the UK he would be denied the
opportunity to vote a second time on whether to stay part of the EU as
a citizen of the UK. Such anomalies show the mess that the hon.

discussion about the Scottish referendum. It is regrettable that we
have not been joined by the Attorney-General because we would have
benefited from his good counsel on that point. There is case law from
the European Court of Human Rights in 2008. That says that article 3 of

choice of the legislature and does not apply to the election of a Head

issues that must accompany the referendum debate is the cost and

opinion from the UK Government and the relevant Law Officer about

referendum. If it did, that would mean that there would be no money
incurred, potentially, through legal disputes

Amendment 44 deals with the question of giving 16 and 17-year-olds the

of the youngest constituencies in the UK. About a third of my
constituents are younger than 24 and just over a fifth are under the

believe that giving people the vote at 16 is the right way forward. It
would ingrain voting habits early. It is a bit like learning to clean
teeth from the age of two, because if people do something day in, day
out, or year in, year out—or five years in, five years out for
voting—they are encouraged to keep doing it, and that would be
the case for voting. We all know that one reason why the Government
have chosen not to touch some issues that would affect
pensioners—they are not affected by the bedroom tax or cuts to
council tax benefits—is the fact that people of pensionable age
are more likely to vote than young people. I do not think that anyone
in this place wilfully ignores young people, but we have to recognise
that, beneath our national party strategists doing endless work through
Mosaic and number-crunching, there is a ruthless look at how people
vote. Bringing in votes for people at 16 or 17 could make a big
difference to how young people are listened to up and down the

territory which has been ruled by Britain since 1713 under the terms of
the treaty of Utrecht. Gibraltarians are British citizens. They elect
their own representatives to the territory’s House of Assembly
and our British monarch appoints a governor. Gibraltar is
self-governing in all areas except defence and foreign policy, and it
is home to an important British military garrison and naval base. The
particular difficulty thrown up by the Bill is that should a referendum
take place under the original terms of the Bill, a vote in Britain to
leave the European Union could occur without the people of Gibraltar
having any say at all in this huge constitutional change. The people of
Gibraltar would be entirely disfranchised—ignored, in

European Parliament. As many hon. Members may recall, the Act required
the Electoral Commission to propose a region in England and Wales with
which the citizens of Gibraltar could participate in European
parliamentary elections. The region chosen was the south-west. I
understand that in European elections since that Act Gibraltarians have
been enfranchised appropriately and have taken part enthusiastically in
those elections. Indeed, they will have the opportunity to vote again
with the south-west region in the upcoming European elections next

benefits that Falkland islanders enjoy on account of Britain’s
membership of the European Union are not insignificant. I was surprised
on Monday when the Minister for Europe confirmed to me in a written
parliamentary answer that the Government had made no preparations for
the UK leaving the European Union. There are no transitional
arrangements in case the people of Britain vote no. Presumably, there
has also been no thought about the consequences of a possible exit for
the Falkland Islands or any other overseas territory. We have the
astonishing situation of the Prime Minister sleepwalking towards an
exit from the European Union with no thought of the consequences for
British citizens or for our overseas
territories<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:15:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110853000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0002.htm#13110853000162">I

Falkland Islands have in relation to trade with the European Union. As
well as the trade advantages, the overseas territories also benefit
from the European development fund. As my hon. Friend the Member for

their exclusion. If the Minister and the promoter of the Bill are not

the democratic enfranchisement of our young people. It would send a
strong signal to young people who are suffering disproportionately
under the current Government—people who have lost their
education maintenance allowance, whose tuition fees will treble, and
who are going through an often disheartening and bleak time searching

could help with that ambition. I understand that people in that section

visit schools or colleges throughout the parliamentary year—it

potential first-time voters who are carefully weighing up everything
being said and deciding in whom to put their trust. Whenever there is

weaker option, and that the Swiss option of pick-and-choose bilateral
agreements was also a weaker option for the United Kingdom. Moreover,
it said that the Turkish option of simply having a customs union with

when a similar referendum was held in 1975, this House had had the

the farming industry, exporters and workers—whose rights at work
might be diminished by the renegotiations—have not been
considered that we should put the amendments in the Bill. The

business. How can the Government believe that it is appropriate to have
four years of uncertainty before a referendum on the United
Kingdom’s membership of the European Union? Surely the same

Scottish counterpart, would be conducted on the basis of a
pre-negotiated treaty to alter the conditions of membership, which the

reform or who wants integration at all costs. I am a practical
European. I voted yes in the 1975 referendum but, as an MP in 1992, I

Europe’s first achievement was to remove the internal tariff
barriers that held back growth and prosperity across the whole
continent, including Britain. We accepted that, especially with
globalisation, our interests were best served by bringing down
barriers, which enabled Europe to act as one unit in trade and become a
more powerful, if as yet imperfect, force for trade liberalisation
under internationally agreed common rules. Again, we could be talking
to the business sector and exporters about that, if the Government had

everybody—in particular, it would give the older generation a

foes established and consolidated peace and democracy across the EU. It
is important that there be proper consultation, that this be assessed
and that Parliament have a chance to reflect upon it. For example, EU
enlargement, first to Greece, Spain and Portugal—countries that
until relatively recently were fascist dictatorships—and now to
former communist states in central and eastern Europe that were also
under a form of dictatorship, has amply shown how the zone of
stability, democracy and prosperity can be extended right across a

Turkey is a vital bridge between Europe and Asia, west and east,

against the interests of the world’s poor. However, a Britain on
the margins of Europe would not be in a strong position to reform the
CAP—I am sure that that would be revealed by a

agriculture and rural communities. Without a full commitment to the EU,
we will have less influence, too, on determining European negotiating

the question of a proper, concerted approach to the environment in the

the Earth, which is mentioned in sub-paragraph (h), the Local
Government Association, which is mentioned in sub-paragraph (i),
Greenpeace, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the World
Wide Fund for Nature. All those organisations would be able to confirm
in a consultation that Britain on its own would be unable to guarantee
a sustainable future for our citizens. We are so close to the continent
of Europe that clear skies, pure water, clean beaches and a healthy
environment can be delivered only through co-operation at European
level. A consultation on the environment would reveal the case for

reflects on the referendum that is currently happening for Scotland, he
will find that the debate has not risen to the levels he mentions,
because we have not had the in-depth analysis of issues surrounding the
Scottish referendum. The debate has left so many unanswered questions
that the people of Scotland are demanding more

same point, if it were consulted and had a proper chance to consult all

agreement with some elements, such as the successes of the single

have underplayed some of the downsides of how the EU currently

the time when it was announced that London had got the 2012 Olympics, I
made a point of talking to and chasing up Ministers and stakeholders on
the question of jobs and employment in the east end. I met the then
Mayor on a number of occasions to discuss that subject. I met the
London Development Agency. I met the then Olympics Minister,

concede to no one in my pleasure and excitement at the summer of 2012.
For those of us who are born and bred Londoners, the summer of 2012 was
one of the most magical summers in London. As a Member of Parliament
for one of the east end boroughs, I was privileged to tour the Olympic
park, which was a wonderful piece of landscaping. It was a complete
regeneration of what had been a very sad part of Stratford. I was even
fortunate enough to have a ticket for the 100 metres final. I will
refrain from confessing to the House who I shouted for, but I certainly
saw the sporting excellence that was on
display<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T14:37:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110864000269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0003.htm#13110864000269">For
me, one of the most magical aspects of the Olympics in 2012 was the
Olympic volunteers. They were a group of people, young and old, who
really looked like London and who brought their enthusiasm and pleasure
to the process. Many people who were fortunate enough to visit the
Olympic park remember those volunteers above all
else<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T14:38:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110864000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0003.htm#13110864000270">Even
though 2012 was a golden summer, I have not forgotten the promises that
were made in the run-up to the Olympics. I remind the House that the
five Olympic host boroughs—Greenwich, Tower Hamlets, Newham,
Waltham Forest and Hackney—are among the poorest areas in the
country. All five host boroughs are in the 15% most deprived areas in
the country and Hackney is in the bottom 5%. Only 55% of people of
working age in Hackney are in employment, despite the fact that the
population is comparatively young. Few places in the country are in
greater need of regeneration and a long-term economic boost. I truly
believed that the 2012 Olympics were the perfect departure point for
that boost and that regeneration. Although I know that the Olympic
legacy process is still in train, it seems to me appropriate, fully 12
months after the Olympics ended, to return to the important issues of
jobs, employment and
regeneration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T14:39:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13110864000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0003.htm#13110864000314">From
the time when work began on the Olympic park, I voiced my concerns
about the low number of local people who were working on the site.
Figures released by the Olympic Delivery Authority in October 2010
revealed that of the 6,423 workers on the Olympic park, just 130 came
from Hackney—the lowest figure among the five
boroughs—and that only seven of the 
<?notus-xml column=611?>apprentices on the site lived in Hackney. There have
been great outcomes of the Olympics, but unless we are watchful, we
will fall far short of expectations on some of the promises for the
Olympic
legacy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T14:39:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_ParaIndent><hs_Para UID="13110864000271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0003.htm#13110864000271">The
promise to London, particularly east London, was that the Olympics
would be transforming. We were told that a well planned, well managed
environment would be created, which would attract business investment
and promote recreational and cultural use in years to come; that
communities would be transformed, with 9,000 new homes being built, a
large proportion of which would be affordable; and that new sport,
leisure, education and health facilities would be provided to meet the
needs of residents, businesses and élite sport. Above all, we
were told that the Olympics would transform prospects, help 20,000
workless Londoners from the five host boroughs into permanent
employment by 2012 and create 12,000 job opportunities in the area of
the park

the case of transport, an improved and expanded London underground is
certainly one of the successes of the games. The London Overground has
also benefited, and Stratford must be one of the best-connected
sporting venues in the world. I will return to the matter of transport
in the months to come, but I wish to say now that prices on London
transport remain too high, and that Londoners cannot understand why an
underground system that was able to run almost flawlessly during the
Olympic games does not seem to be able to do so on a day-to-day
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T14:41:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110864000273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0003.htm#13110864000273">Although
we all thrilled at the élite sportspeople— Mo
Farah and the rest—the sports legacy of the Olympics is not as
good as we would like. Over the past year, there has been a decline in
the number of children across all age groups involved in sport. A
survey of 2,000 children carried out earlier this year found that a
quarter of girls between five and 10 said that they had not taken part
in any sport over the past month, up from 17% five years ago. One in
seven boys said that they had not. Even walking appears to have
declined in popularity. That can come as no surprise given the
Government’s school sport reforms, including the abolition of
the school sport partnerships scheme. We know that work is being
done—in particular, I draw the House’s attention to the
Hard Rock Café east London rugby league project—but it is
concerning that in a difficult and constrained time of austerity,
ordinary people’s level of sporting participation seems to be
going

money have been provided, and there are some excellent specific
projects, such as the rugby league 
<?notus-xml column=612?>one to which I referred. The problem is that the overall number of young
people participating in sport is drifting downwards. She is right that
there has to be a big push to make the money that is available a
catalyst for levels of sporting activity to remain constant and then
rise. Of course, sporting activity is not just for fun. As someone who
has taken an interest in public health in recent times, I know that
activity is important for our young people’s health and
well-being<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T14:43:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110864000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/debtext/131108-0003.htm#13110864000276">Housing
is the area in which we have been disappointed, given the expectations
that we had. Assurances were given that thousands of homes would be
allocated for social housing. Of the 11,000 homes scheduled to be built
over the next 15 to 20 years, the promise was that 35% would be
affordable and social housing. However, with the Government’s
changed policy on social housing, their refusal to cap rents and their
austerity-based economics, it seems that many local people will not be
able to afford that so-called affordable housing. Of the 2,818 homes in
the Olympic legacy programme, Newham will receive 350 and Tower Hamlets
just 27.Just 100 homes will be divided between Barking and
Dagenham, Havering, Redbridge, Waltham Forest and Hackney—an
average of 13 homes per borough. What kind of housing legacy is
that?</hs_Para>

notion of affordable, in the context of the Government’s social
housing policy, which means that subsidised properties can be rented at
up to 80% of market rates, those homes will be affordable only for
people earning £30,000 or more, which is above the average wage
in the east end of London.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T14:45:06"></hs_TimeCode>Shelter
calculates that the median monthly rent for a two-bedroom house in
Newham is £953. That means that a two-bedroom property in the
new development could be classified as affordable if advertised to let
at £762—beyond the reach of many of the people I
represent.</hs_Para>

we know, the Olympic village was sold to the Qatari ruling
family’s property company, and the UK property developer
Delancey Estates. That deal left the UK taxpayer £275 million
out of pocket, and also means that there will be economic and
commercial pressure to increase the buy-to-let proportion of those
properties. I believe the sum effect will be to drive those properties
out of the reach of ordinary Londoners.</hs_Para>

employment at the start of my remarks, as I take a particular interest
in that. At the beginning there was a commitment to ensure that 20,000
Olympics jobs went to residents of the games’ host boroughs, but
in the end, only 9,700 did—less than half. That was a poor
start, and things have not necessarily got any better. Given that the 5
Borough Employment and Skills project and the 2012 Employment Legacy
programme started after the Olympics, once the big bulge of job
opportunities had gone, it is no surprise that both projects
have apparently underspent. Given that unemployment remains a serious
issue in the east end, we should question how those projects can
realistically support sustained employment when they struggled to find
local people in the first place.</hs_Para>

were certainly important for industries such as construction, but when
I asked about the number of local people employed on the site in the
first place, we found that in 2010, only 20% of workers on the Olympic
site were from one of the five host boroughs. It is not evident that
local construction companies benefited from the various
contracts.</hs_Para>

number of local ventures surrounding the Olympics—notably
Westfield shopping centre in Stratford—were meant to directly
benefit locals. At that shopping centre, however, of 10,500 permanent
jobs created by Westfield, just 2,000 are filled by local people. Those
jobs do not require some fantastically high level of qualification and
skill; they are jobs in the retail and service industries, yet only
2,000—less than 20%—are filled by local people. Of course
the summer of 2012 was magical, and we have seen improvements in
transport infrastructure. However, when we consider the billions of
pounds invested in the Olympics, and the numbers of people uprooted, we
have yet to see what was promised to Londoners.</hs_Para>

regeneration will take place over the next 15 to 20 years. The issues
are evident now, and it is not too late to make the necessary changes
to meet as many of the original commitments of the Olympic legacy as
possible. For instance, although the current organisations managing the
Olympic legacy have set employment targets, they refuse to set minimum
employment targets. If we are to meet our promise to the people of
London, and particularly the Olympic boroughs, we must think about
setting minimum targets.</hs_Para>

though some of 2012 was, in my view it was disappointing that so few
local people got jobs—as opposed to volunteer
opportunities—at the Olympic park. It was disappointing that so
few local businesses got business opportunities, and I call on the
Minister and the House to ensure that the promises of the
Olympic games—increased levels of sporting activity among
ordinary people, particularly children, and employment, business,
cultural and sporting regeneration—are kept. The people involved
in managing the Olympic legacy should not believe that London MPs,
particularly MPs for the Olympic boroughs, are not watching what they
are doing. The process will take 10 to 15 years. We will watch them
every step of the
way.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_08_PT_1/A63E3EA4ED4A10841675CEFD7F86FA663D8CAAC7" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 November 2013">Friday

the Government’s policy is putting that at risk. The homes need
to be affordable for local people, and we also need to watch that they

the seconds I have remaining, I want to make a point about jobs. The
borough is working closely with local companies to ring-fence jobs

form the bedrock of a fantastic new and vibrant community in east
London. It will be a huge part of the legacy of London 2012. In fact,
the first residents are expected to move into their new homes in the
east village later this month.

new staff from the local community. I understand that it is working
closely with Hackney community college to support local people into new
jobs as they become available. Furthermore, the park transformation
programme has created 2,500 construction jobs in east London. I heard

regulator’s role is to set the quality standards expected of
organisations providing forensic science services to the criminal
justice system. These standards help ensure the accuracy and
impartiality of forensic evidence used in police investigations and in
court, protecting the innocent from wrongful convictions and ensuring
criminals are brought to justice. To date, the regulator has been
successful in securing uptake of these standards on a voluntary
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110854000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/wmstext/131108m0001.htm#13110854000044">However,
our discussions with the police, commercial forensic service providers
and the regulator, taken alongside market developments and changes in
legislation, have indicated there is a risk that voluntary quality
standards might not, in the future, provide the high level of assurance
required for forensic evidence. For that reason we now propose
introducing stronger powers, including putting the regulator’s
codes of practice, which set out the quality standards for forensic
science providers, on a statutory basis. It would then be
mandatory for every organisation carrying out forensic analysis for the
criminal justice system, including commercial providers 
<?notus-xml column=25?>to the police and to defendants, and the police themselves, to meet
these standards. There has been support from the regulator, many
commercial providers and the Science and Technology Select Committee
for these proposals. This consultation is an
opportunity to seek wider views, before determining
the most effective and proportionate regulation system for forensic
science.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110854000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/wmstext/131108m0001.htm#13110854000045">A

electrical installations are safe and in good repair. They are also
responsible for ensuring that electrical appliances provided by them
are kept in a safe condition where the property has been licensed by
the local authority. The Department has-published guidance for
landlords which recommends that they have electrical installations and
equipment regularly checked. Tenants who are concerned that their
landlord is not maintaining the safety of their home can complain to
their local authority who have extensive powers to investigate hazards
and can take action if serious hazards are detected, including
requiring the owner to remedy the defect or prohibiting use of the
property. We recently announced a review to ensure that rented
properties are safe and healthy. We also published a draft Tenants'

Immigration Bill also includes power to remove illegal migrants without
the. need for a separate immigration decision, as well as speeding up
and simplifying the appeal process reducing the categories under which
they can appeal from 17 to four. The Bill also takes action to end the
abuse of European Convention on Human Rights Article 8 (the right to
respect for private and family life). It sets out clearly what the
public interest requires and ensures that courts considering Article 8
in immigration cases will give proper weight to Parliament's view of
the public interest.</hs_Para>

still be illegally in the UK. They do so through a variety of methods.
Text messages are one of those methods. The messages do not have the
effect of terminating the right to remain in the UK. They are sent to
individuals whose right to remain, according to our records, has
already expired. Notification of refusal or curtailment of leave will
already have been sent by the Home Office by post, prior to individuals
being referred to Capita. By the end of Quarter 2 2013, Capita had sent
25,180 such text messages.</hs_Para>

voluntary forms of expression of origin, such as flags, beyond the name
of the member state. The European Commission has since given public
assurances that it was not its intention to interfere in the use of

years by the Department's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)

of scientific activity. The usual practice of the NIHR is not to
ring-fence funds for expenditure on particular topics: research
proposals in all areas compete for the funding available. The NIHR
welcomes funding applications for research into any aspect of human
health, including motor neurone disease. These applications are subject
to peer review and judged in open competition, with awards being made
on the basis of the importance of the topic to patients and the NHS,
value for money and scientific
quality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110859000524" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/text/131108w0001.htm#13110859000524">Expenditure

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.
Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the
offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>2</Sup>

employers to develop engineering skills in sectors suffering acute
shortages. We are providing funding of £250,000 for Tomorrow's
Engineers to accelerate a nationwide rollout of an employer engagement

Penning:</Member></B> The Department for Work and Pensions is committed
to ensuring that all disabled people, including those with autism, have
the opportunities, chances and support that they need to get a job and
remain in employment and there is a range of provision to help them.
Employers are key to the Department's aim to increase the numbers of
disabled people who enter and remain and progress in employment. Many
of the Department's existing programmes include support for employers
to enable employment of disabled people, with a number of specific
initiatives which are specifically beneficial for people with
autism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110859001424" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/text/131108w0002.htm#13110859001424">Under
the Autism Strategy, led by the Department of Health, the Department
for Work and Pensions had several commitments in relation to autism and
employment. The Department's Ministers are very committed to the autism
strategy. Lord Freud, Minister for Welfare Reform, is passionately
committed and set up a Round Table group with employers to look at
this. Working with the National Autistic Society and others, this work
included the publication of ‘Untapped Talent’, a guide to
spread the benefits of employing someone with
autism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110859001425" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/text/131108w0002.htm#13110859001425">Progress
has been made on delivering the commitments from the strategy, through
both mainstream services and through a suite of additional specialist
employment services. We will continue to explore the best ways for the
Department to support the aims of the autism strategy and contribute to
ongoing
initiatives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110859001426" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/text/131108w0002.htm#13110859001426">We
made a commitment to engage with employers and help them in overcoming
the barriers they face in employing people with autism. In partnership
with employers, the Department held a ground breaking conference on 18
July 2013 at which the Prime Minister launched the two-year Disability
Confident Campaign. The campaign aims to remove barriers, increase
understanding and make sure that disabled people and those with health
conditions have the opportunities to realise their potential. We are
holding a number of further events across the country, where employers
can learn from each other about employing disabled people. The first
event is in Birmingham on 21 November. We are doing this in partnership
with business and will provide campaign materials for employers and
organisations to use. Some employers are already aware of the
particular strengths of employing people with autism for certain tasks,
the challenge is to expand this knowledge and to a wider range of
employers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110859001427" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131108/text/131108w0002.htm#13110859001427">The
Department also committed to ensure that our employment programmes work
for young disabled people with autism and that the support they are
offered meets their specific needs. One of the key programmes is Access
to Work. Access to Work gives additional support 
<?notus-xml column=406?>for individuals whose health or disability affects the way they do their
job. It provides individuals and their employers with advice and
support with extra costs which may arise because of an individual's
needs. Access to Work is now available to support young disabled people
undertaking voluntary work experience under the Youth Contract offering
