is happening to child care under this Government. For the first time
ever, there are 15 hours a week of child care for every three and
four-year-old in the country. That never happened under Labour. For the
first time, under this Government, there are free child care hours for
every disadvantaged two-year-old in the country. That never happened
under Labour. Also, to come, there will be tax-free child care under
this Government. That never happened under Labour. And the child tax
credit has been upgraded by £420 under this Government. That is
what is happening, but let me be clear: there is one policy that we
will not adopt, and that is Labour’s policy of funding more
hours through its bank levy. I will tell you why: Labour has already
spent the bank levy 10 times over. The youth jobs guarantee, VAT cuts,
more capital spending—Mr Speaker, that is not a policy; it is a

Of course, the Opposition do not want to talk about the economy. They
told us that we were going to lose 1 million jobs, but we gained 1
million jobs. They told us growth would be choked off, but growth is
growing in Britain. That is what is happening. The nightmare of the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs (Mark Simmonds):</Member></B> On 19 and 20 November
2013, RV Ramon Margalef, a Spanish Government research vessel made an
unlawful incursion into British Gibraltar territorial waters that
lasted 22 hours in total. During that time, the vessel
undertook significant survey activity. Vessels of the Royal Navy
Gibraltar Squadron challenged the vessel with radio warnings and
continued to shadow the vessel until it departed. The Ramon Margalef
was joined in British Gibraltar territorial waters by three vessels of
the Spanish Guardia Civil, which attempted to act as escorts to this
vessel. The Guardia Civil vessels were also challenged and shadowed by
the Royal Navy until they left Gibraltar
waters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112076000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0001.htm#13112076000209">Yesterday
evening, the Foreign Office summoned the Spanish ambassador to the UK
in order to underline the British Government’s serious concerns
regarding this provocative and unlawful incursion by a Spanish state
research vessel. During the meeting, the ambassador was again reminded
of our continued concerns regarding border delays, which continue on a
near-daily basis, and our desire to move relations on to a more
positive track through ad-hoc talks, as proposed by the Foreign
Secretary in April
2012.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112076000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0001.htm#13112076000210">Yesterday’s
incursion occurred despite repeated diplomatic protests to Spain in
recent months, and comes only two weeks after a dangerous manoeuvre by
Guardia Civil vessels put lives at risk and resulted in a minor
collision. According to the United Nations convention on the law of the
sea, the waters around Gibraltar are indisputably British territorial
waters, under United Kingdom sovereignty, in which only the United
Kingdom has the right to exercise jurisdiction. We remain confident of
UK sovereignty over the whole of Gibraltar, including British Gibraltar
territorial
waters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112076000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0001.htm#13112076000211">The
British Government strongly condemn this provocative incursion and urge
the Spanish Government to ensure that it is not repeated. We stand
ready to do whatever is required to protect Gibraltar’s
sovereignty, economy and security. We believe that it is in the
interests of Spain, Gibraltar and Britain to avoid incidents such as
this, which damage the prospects for establishing dialogue and
co-operation. The UK wants to maintain our strong bilateral
relationship with Spain, which stretches across a range of areas and
delivers support for UK and Gibraltarian interests. However, the
Spanish Government are wrong if they believe that they can advance
Spain’s position on sovereignty by increasing pressure on
Gibraltar, whether at the border, through unlawful incursions or by
other actions, such as complaints and posturing in the
EU.</hs_Para>

Does he agree that this is just the latest incident in an escalating
and cynical campaign of harassment of the people of Gibraltar by the
Government 
<?notus-xml column=1235?>in Madrid for their own domestic reasons? Will he conclude that it is
now the time not only to make strong diplomatic representations, but to
take specific legal action against Spain through the international
courts for the clearest possible breach of international law?
Furthermore, does he think that we should discuss with Her
Majesty’s Government in Gibraltar the possibility of reinforcing
the naval presence that supports our forces in Gibraltar by means of a
larger, deeper depth patrol boat or of an ocean-going tug that will be
able to remove offending vessels from British territorial waters in a

Simmonds:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for articulating the
concern of many people both inside and outside this House, across the
United Kingdom and in Gibraltar. It may be helpful if I give the House
the most up-to-date information and the facts. It was not a Spanish
naval vessel that went into British territorial waters, but a
Spanish-owned oceanographic vessel. It did not get to the entrance of
Gibraltar harbour, but was about 250 metres from it. It
needs to be reiterated that an escalation of this matter is in
nobody’s interest. A political solution to the dispute is
required. Of course nothing is taken off the table. We constantly
review the naval presence in and around Gibraltar, and we are certainly
doing so now. We are keen to return to the ad hoc talks, from which the
current Spanish Government withdrew in 2011, involving both the British
and Spanish Governments and also the Government of
Gibraltar<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T12:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Benches that further Spanish ships entered British Gibraltar
territorial waters yesterday without authorisation and stayed for more

Simmonds:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman asked a series of questions.
I first became aware of this incursion yesterday morning. The House
will not be surprised to learn that there were contacts between the
British Government and the Spanish Government to encourage the Spanish
Government to ensure that the vessel was removed from British Gibraltar
territorial waters. I can give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that, as
far as I am aware—this was the situation when I came to the
House to answer the urgent question—the vessel had not returned
to British Gibraltar territorial waters as was its intention yesterday,
so those contacts have had some impact. The discussions about whether
the naval presence in and around Gibraltar is correct are ongoing and
the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised that I will not go into the
detail at this stage. We are also in constant contact with the
Government of Gibraltar to ensure that the information being provided
is available to the Governments of both the UK and Gibraltar.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112076000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0001.htm#13112076000220"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T12:45:10"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me also address the point that the hon. Gentleman made about the
European Commission and its role in trying to settle this political
dispute. He will be aware that the Commission visited the border on 25
September and will not be surprised to hear that there were few delays
during that visit. The Commission has committed to monitoring the
situation and possibly to returning in six months’ time. We
continue to provide evidence to the Commission about what we believe is
the unlawful Spanish activity. We also urge the Spanish to implement
the recommendations made by the Commission to the Spanish Government
about how they can improve ease of access across the border. Those
recommendations are to optimise physical space on the Spanish side,
including increasing the number of vehicle lanes; to carry out more
targeted checks, particularly as they relate to the significant problem
of tobacco smuggling, and to develop a mechanism to exchange
information with the United Kingdom specifically to target tobacco
smuggling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T12:46:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Menzies Campbell</B> (North East Fife) (LD):</Member> I commend my hon.
Friend for his measured and carefully considered answer to the
question. He will be well aware that the purpose of provocation is to
provoke—that is, to provoke a reaction that justifies the
initial action of provocation. I hope therefore that his policy will be
to ensure that the United Kingdom does not fall into that trap. May I
go back to the question of NATO, however? Under article 5 of the north
Atlantic treaty, all members of NATO are obliged to regard an attack on
one as an attack on all. Under those circumstances, is not the NATO
route perhaps one of the most effective diplomatic routes that could be
followed in this case to bring some sense to the attitude of the

Spain and approximately 14 million UK citizens visit Spain each and

The Commission is still clearly concerned by the situation and is
committed to remaining engaged and following up in the way that I
outlined. Interestingly, it has reserved the right to reconsider its
position and has explicitly offered the possibility of a further visit

a British overseas territory in special social union with us, but
regardless even of that, international law must be respected. As Spain
is a democracy, in the EU and in NATO, should it not start behaving
accordingly, and certainly not fire shots at a young man on jet skis in
Gibraltar harbour? Finally, is there any hope of making the European

that happened a little while ago with the jet ski. He will be aware of
the strong protestations that we made at the time. To clarify the
position, our policy on Gibraltar is crystal clear. The people of
Gibraltar have repeatedly and overwhelmingly expressed their wish to
remain under British sovereignty and we will respect their wishes. This

Since the great recession of 2008, concern has been raised repeatedly
across the House about access to finance, particularly for the smallest
companies. The contraction in support for small and medium-sized
business lending following the financial crisis led to a sharp drop in
the growth of lending to, and support for, small businesses. All
Members will recognise the constraints facing aspiring entrepreneurs
across the country trying to access finance.</hs_Para>

problems were a consequence of an overreliance on bank finance compared
with our international competitors, a hollowing-out of business lending
units in the big banks and too much concentration in our banking
system, followed by the biggest banking bust ever faced in this country
and the biggest bank failure in the world in 2008.</hs_Para>

calamity of that scale cannot be addressed by a single policy, so since
2010 we have engaged on a comprehensive programme of bank reform:
splitting retail and investment banking; requiring greater capital;
introducing a tax on leverage; introducing much stronger requirements
to check that the people running banks are fit and proper persons, so
that we do not get the likes of Fred Goodwin and the Rev. Paul Flowers
sitting atop our banks in future; and introducing criminal charges for
those who behave negligently in charge of big
banks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0001.htm#13112092000016">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T13:17:45"></hs_TimeCode>
changes are part of a wider drive to change the culture of banking so

alone they are not enough. To help companies access finance, we have
introduced the British business bank, doubled the seed enterprise
investment scheme, expanded the enterprise finance guarantee, and last
year we introduced start-up loans of up to £25,000 per

£6,000—to help budding entrepreneurs access the seed

start-up loans can help to bring even more of those in this age group

businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, so the £50 million
that has been lent to 10,000 new entrepreneurs is an important symbol
of the enterprise spirit that runs deep through the proud history of
our great island people. The Minister was right to broaden his remarks
to address the broader context of the scheme. As we examine the
performance of start-up loans in the context of the broader picture for
small businesses and the support available, we will see that James Caan
is right to say there is still much work to be

this scheme have a default target and, if so, how is it performing
against it? A key lesson from the start-up loans programme is that
access to finance schemes is only as good as the infrastructure that
supports them and that the schemes rely on a wider system of business
support, mentoring and signposting—the very fabric of support
that is so lacking in many parts of the country in the
absence of Business Link, the abolition of the regional
development agencies and the impoverishment of local

is borne out by the statistics that we are welcoming today. In every
recession, there has been an increase in business start-ups. People
faced with a flat job market and low demand for their skills will often
seek to create their own job by setting up a firm. Desperation is not a
bad motive for launching a firm—I have done it myself—but
it is noticeable that far and away the most loans have been given where
businesses support networks are strongest, namely
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T13:25:32"></hs_TimeCode>: 15% of

the Minister recognise the links between an integrated business support

years ago, the late Frank Cook, a former hon. Member, brought together
a group of senior MPs to take evidence and examine widespread concerns
about the operation of the growing laser eye surgery industry. Those
concerns included high-pressure sales tactics, variable standards of
service and a failure to provide adequate aftercare, particularly if
the treatment had had unfortunate side effects. At the time, the
consumer group Which? and the then National Institute for Health and

years ago, we found that many of the corporates in the sector employed
aggressive sales tactics to secure clients. Recent evidence from
clients and former salespeople shows that the problem continues and has
got worse. It often starts with a phone call, the offer of a
time-limited discount or entry into a competition for free treatment.
Patients visit the shop on a no-obligation basis for a consultation;
then the phone calls start. We have evidence of people receiving 20
phone calls in a single day. Some salesmen are described as counsellors
or refractive technicians, but have minimal training in what the
surgery involves and come under intense pressure from their managers to
clinch deals no matter what. Patients are often not given adequate
information on the potential risks. One former Optical Express salesman
described pressure from managers not to give customers all the
available information for fear of scaring them off.</hs_Para>

continue to be expressed about the quality of patient assessment.
Assessments are often undertaken by a different person to the surgeon
who performs the operation or who provides aftercare—there is no
consistent approach. Good practice in any surgery recommends that a
patient’s consent is assured. A cooling-off period 
<?notus-xml column=1258?>is recommended between the assessment and advice provided, and the final
decision. Many companies state that a 24-hour or 72-hour cooling-off
period is built into consent procedures, but we have evidence that that
is not the case. Complex documents are placed in patients’
hands, and they are pressurised into providing a signature on the
actual day of the surgery.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112092000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092000108"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T13:55:46"></hs_TimeCode>There
is no legal requirement for a surgeon to be qualified or experienced in
this field of surgery. There are no regulations to that effect: any
doctor can undertake this surgery. The Royal College of
Ophthalmologists introduced a certificate in laser surgery, but only
half of practising surgeons have it. It is worrying that certification
is on a downward trend: in 2009, 29 surgeons took the exam; in 2011,
13; in 2012, five; and this year, none. Worries have been expressed
about the number of surgical operations an individual surgeon is
contracted to undertake in one day: sometimes 17 to 20, sometimes more.
There is no limit on the number of procedures a surgeon can undertake.
That puts time pressures on assessments, pre-op procedures, operations
and aftercare.</hs_Para>

are definite risks involved in this surgery. Some estimate that one in
20 patients experience post-operative problems, including dry eyes,
blurred vision, starbursts and glare. In many cases, patients have
found it extremely difficult to secure aftercare from companies. Many
are forced to resort to the law, and it takes months—in some
cases, years—to receive effective remedial action or
compensation. On many occasions, they are forced to sign compromise
agreements including gagging clauses so that they do not expose what
has happened to them. In addition, in some instances they later find
that the cost of corrective surgery is deducted from their
compensation.</hs_Para>

could go through many case histories, but there is not time to do so.
Many hon. Members have also brought cases to my attention. Ex-staff
have talked about company patient satisfaction surveys being heavily
influenced, or even filled in, by staff. On at least one occasion, an
expression of dissatisfaction never came to light. I will quote what
one person said to
me:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13112092001718" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092001718">“I

needs to be done? Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, examined
laser surgery practice in his recent report on cosmetic surgery. He
concluded that action needed to be taken to regulate the industry. His
report was published in April and the Government are yet to
respond.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112092000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092000112">The agenda
that the Government need to address is set out in Frank Cook’s
Bill, which I have updated. First, the industry needs statutory
regulation, as voluntary mechanisms have failed. At minimum, all
surgeons must be qualified, certificated and have regular competence
assessments from here on in. There should be openness and transparency
so that the success rates of individual surgeons and clinics can be
published. Patients will then be able to make considered choices. The
Government should consider limiting the number of operations that
surgeons can undertake in one day: we restrict the hours of lorry
drivers and pilots; we should also restrict the hours surgeons work,
because patients are being put at risk. We should ensure that
high-pressure sales techniques are made illegal in this area. There
should be a legal requirement for companies and surgeons to provide
full information, in a comprehensible form, on all risks to
patients.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T13:59:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T13:59:32"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

also be heavier sanctions for breaches of advertising standards and
mis-selling by such companies, because the result of their actions is
to expose people to serious health risks. There should be a seven-day
breathing space, enforceable in law, between the initial decision and
final consent. There should also be guaranteed aftercare and, if things
go wrong, remedial action at the expense of the company, not the
individual. Finally, there should be a compensation scheme. The
mechanism for securing compensation for individuals who suffer loss and
damage as a result of such actions should be swifter and less
litigious. We have argued this case before, but perhaps it would be
easier and less litigious if there was an industry-funded scheme to
provide compensation to those who can demonstrate that they have been
harmed by such surgery.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112092000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092000114">It is
difficult to get a
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:00:24"></hs_TimeCode>figure for how
many such operations take place, but it looks as though between 100,000
and 120,000 people a year undertake such surgery. That is too many
people. Even if the figure for those affected is one in 20, as I
suggested, that means that thousands of our constituents are being put
at risk by an industry that is completely unregulated. I therefore urge
the Government to act now. There are many former patients, excellent
practitioners and Members of this House who are willing to work with
the Government on a programme to secure action based on the Keogh
principles, which are about ensuring high standards of service,
openness and transparency, accountability and a proper sense of care
for such patients in the long term. This is a serious matter. I know
that the Government are currently considering their response to Keogh.
I hope that it will be imminent and that this part of the cosmetic
surgery industry and the surgery industry overall will be covered in
that response.</hs_Para>

1908, when that great reforming Secretary of State, Haldane, set up the
Territorial Force, as it was then called, on its modern basis, it was
recognised that if the force was established simply under the Regular
Army, it would not prosper. Therefore, the county
associations—what we now call the RFCAs—were given
control of recruiting and property management for the TF, as it then
was. Just six years later, at the outbreak of the first world war,
there were 250,000 Territorials stood to arms. Thirty units went over

as its chairman General Sir Robin Brims. The RFCAs elect people to such

RFCAs are not party political. General Brims commanded the remarkable
capture of Basra. Getting into the centre of the city was an almost

statistics should be a statutory matter, but the fact is that the
Government have made a perfectly clear pledge that they are going to
publish them. The crucial thing from the point of view of the ordinary
Reservist is that this body, which is elected by former Reservists and
respected by them as a body that effectively looked after their
interests for nearly a century, is back with a really crucial position,
able to make this report. When it visits the Army Recruiting Group, it
will be heard with considerably more authority when it is known that it
will be put on a permanent statutory basis and will be able to tell us
what is really going on. I would like to say, however, that

plain fact is that when the Regular Army took over recruiting in 2006,
the numbers collapsed. The collecting of statistics collapsed, too, and
the structure made no serious effort to address the challenges it was
taking on. It simply raided the budget and used it for Regulars. To
provide just one example, from 2006 to this day—it is now seven
years on—Army recruiting offices are open only from 9 to 5.30

number of other things happened at the same time. There was a steady
reduction in the flow of equipment to the Reserves. There was a huge
cut in the training budget. In 2009, we almost lost the whole training
budget for the Reserves for six months, and I pay tribute to a small
number of colleagues on both sides of the House who supported us in
that battle. Worst of all, from 2009, all deployments of formed bodies
to Afghanistan stopped—echoing the argument that had taken place
at the outset of the first world war—and units were effectively
told, “You are just here to act as part-time personnel agencies
for the Regular Army”. That really destroyed much of the
Territorial Army’s officer

strongly support what the Government are trying to do with the
Reserves. The House will know how much I am in favour of a rebalancing.
I also commend many things that have taken place: the equipment is
improving; there has been a huge increase in the funds available for
training, particularly for collective training; and there have been
some interesting initiatives at Sandhurst, under the charismatic
leadership of the recently appointed Commandant, General Tim Evans. He
started a number of improvements in officer training, one of which was
the personal brain child of the Chief of the General
Staff—taking people through the training in a single eight-week
package, timed to coincide with the summer vacation in universities.
The pairing of units is another initiative.</hs_Para>

Army Recruiting Group, however, has not got its act together; it is
every bit as disorganised as it has always been. I hope the House will
forgive me if I give just one example in detail to show just how
hopeless it is. When the RFCAs lost their recruiting brief, the
requirement for medicals, which had been very efficiently organised,
disappeared. Suddenly last year, as part of 
<?notus-xml column=1265?>common selection, it was announced that the Territorials were to do
medicals, too. A system was set up, using the NHS as the old one had
done, but in a fashion that had not even been cleared by the lawyers in
relation to the Data Protection Act 1998. It was completely unworkable.
People were told to take a form to their GP and get him to sign it off
and send it in. So inefficient was this system that GPs did not know
what to do. If units rang up to see what was going on, they were
breaching the Data Protection Act. The system was so hopeless that a
unit I know well—for obvious reasons, I will not say
which—that had had an average of 48 successful enlistees per
quarter in the months up to that change, saw a rising trend in
applicants turn into just eight enlistees per quarter in the subsequent
quarters.</hs_Para>

the case for a distressingly long time—that there has been a
very unsatisfactory attitude between the Regulars and the Reservists.
This has got to end. It has to end in a proper way, with the new

raises about recruiting are correct? Things got off to a bad start; it
has not been a success. However, I am told that my right hon. Friend

that point. Not only is it good for the veterans to be integrated into
the call centre while remaining in a military environment, but,
crucially, the fact that the job is being done by people with military
experience makes a huge difference. That is a message which, in a

do not want to speak for too long, because a great many other Members

a moment. It is no accident that the Haldane reforms came just after
similar reforms in America which established the National Guard Bureau,
just three years before the power was given to the forerunners of the
RFCAs by the House of Commons. I have been privileged to visit National
Guard units on operations in Afghanistan, and to see them doing various
kinds of work. One airborne cavalry unit was mentoring the police, and
an infantry unit from Virginia—whose origins, incidentally, date
back to before American independence—was deploying its
platoons along the Pakistani border, protecting aid posts
there. Those units were able to bring to those jobs something that
regular soldiers could not have brought to them.</hs_Para>

Small Wars” is a book by Frank Ledwidge, who served in both Iraq
and Afghanistan. It refers to a catalogue of things that went wrong
with the British presence in Iraq and, in the early years, in
Afghanistan. One of the saddest aspects of the book is that it paints a
picture of the Army not as it used to be, when it was quintessentially
good at dealing with civilian populations all over the world. The fact
that our Army was entirely unable to relate to the population in
Iraq—in particular, it failed to recognise the murderous nature
of the Iraqi police—was fundamental to our problems there. By
contrast, National Guard units, which contain, for instance, police

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:22:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
at this point. In fact, the experience in Iraq was often that the
British Territorial Army units had considerably more expertise than the
National Guard units. In al-Amarah, for example, they had water
engineers serving as majors and development specialists serving as
corporals. I think that we should take much more pride in what the TA

and put me right. I was not drawing a parallel between the National
Guard and the British TA. By the stage when things were starting to
unravel, the TA deployment, which had been large at the beginning, 
<?notus-xml column=1268?>was very small. It is true that the TA punched above its weight. I have
heard General Abrahams, who currently leads the transition process, pay
tribute to a military police TA sub-unit which was briefly under his

presence was all-Regular most of the time.

at one stage just over half the American deployment consisted of
Reservists, and because, typically, the Regulars would capture the
ground—and provided the surge—but the National Guard
would hold ground, it was possible to introduce a range of different

my hon. Friend moves on to new clause 2, may I make a point about new
clause 1? The principle behind the change in the proportion of Reserves
to Regulars was exactly right: it brought us into line with many more
contemporary countries. The proviso, in practice, was that the
reduction in the number of Regulars would not take place until we saw
the necessary improvements in training, equipping and numbers in the
Reserves. The problem for the House of Commons was that we had very
little information to go on when it came to assessing the decision. I
therefore congratulate my hon. Friend on tabling new clause 1, which
will provide the transparency that will enable the House to make that
assessment. I also congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State on his wisdom in accepting a new clause that will give the House
a good deal more pertinent information than it would have had

I—and, I am sure, the Secretary of State in his private heart of

question of the cash envelope within which any Government are likely to
operate. If we wound up the whole Territorial Army tomorrow, it would
be possible to pay for only 6,000 or 7,000 regulars rather than 20,000,

our greatest general in the last war, Bill Slim. People fondly imagine
he was a Regular officer who went to Sandhurst. He was not; he was a
Territorial who sneaked in through the back door of the Birmingham
officer training corps because his brother was a student there and
nobody realised he was not a student too. There is also David Stirling,
who founded the SAS. Again, people think of him as a Scots Guards
officer. Yes, he was; he was a Scots Guards Reservist. He had done his
officer training at Ampleforth combined cadet force and then, through
mountaineering, he had developed the qualities of character and team
leadership that were so vital for setting up the

are three reasons why we need Reservists. First, because we can keep

RAF and Navy and to make a whole force that is properly integrated. If
we do not have that consent, we will not achieve that. If the amendment

subject to the scrutiny of this House and a vote, but the fact that the

level until the Reservists were able to take their place. That plan has
changed. To return to a point that several Members have already made,
by the end of last year a good number of the Regulars had already
gone—the 
<?notus-xml column=1276?>final tranche may be next year; we are not sure—and by the end of
next year most of the Regular units and battalions will have been
disbanded. Meanwhile, the Reservists are not due to reach adequate
strength to take their place until 2018, if present plans are met, but
there is every indication that, because we are struggling, we will not
even achieve that. That was not the original plan, as the former
Secretary of State said. It would be good if, for once, we could get an
adequate answer to this question, because we have asked it many times
in this House and have not got

me talk about the recruitment problems. Last Thursday, figures
confirmed yet again that TA numbers are in decline—not rising,
but in decline. We also know that the Army Reserve recruitment targets
are being badly missed, as confirmed in a spate of reports, some
derived from leaked MOD documents. Figures due last Thursday regarding
Army Reserve recruitment were not released in full. It is clear that
the required recruits are not coming forward and that computer problems
have added to the problems, as confirmed by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:57:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Canterbury (Mr
Brazier)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:56:01"></hs_TimeCode>. As
everybody can imagine, there has been no shortage of texts and e-mails
about this debate, and I have learned in such messages from the
north-east that raw recruits to the Reserve have been told that it
could take up to 15 months for them to get into uniform once
they sign up. These are the sorts of delays we are talking about and
which Parliament has every right properly to scrutinise. As even
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:57:42"></hs_TimeCode>the Secretary of
State may not be aware, the Army Reserve courses for January and
February have had to be cancelled in their entirety because of lack of
recruits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:57:46"></hs_TimeCode>. The
fact that the Government are offering significant payments to
businesses underlines the reluctance of many businesses, particularly
smaller businesses, to let valued and key employees go on more frequent
and extended deployments. All that is part of the cycle which in itself
is adding to
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:58:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092000227">Our
concerns are not just about Reserve targets not being met; we also have
deep-seated concerns about the resulting capability and manpower gaps,
which are getting worse as we miss the Reserve recruitment targets. Let
us take as an example the mobilisation rate. At present, the MOD
confirms that the TA mobilisation rate is 40%. In other words, for
every 100 Reservists there are on paper, the MOD deems that 40 are
deployable. That can be to do with fitness, kit, sickness or all sorts
of reasons. In order to make the Army Reserve plans work, the
mobilisation rate has to double from 40% to 80%. I see nothing in the
plans about how that massive increase in the mobilisation rate can be
justified or whether it has been costed. It is a massive ask to go from
40% to 80% mobilisation. These questions need to be
answered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:59:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092000228">There
are also concerns about the plan risking capability gaps. The nature of
conflict is changing. Many countries that are not necessarily friendly
to the west are increasing their military spending, and war is becoming
more asymmetrical. Gone are the days of binary conflicts involving good
guys versus bad guys—terrorism has ensured that things are much
more complex nowadays—and we need professional, mobile,
high-readiness, agile forces that are ready to respond to the threats
that we face.</hs_Para>

encroachment of the Human Rights Act 1998 also puts pressure on the
plans, because we will now have to ensure that the same standard of
training and 
<?notus-xml column=1277?>equipment is available to reservists on deployment as is available to
regulars. It is not clear whether the extra cost of that has been
accommodated, given recent developments—this is a relatively
recent ruling.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:00:42"></hs_TimeCode> is no wonder

concern must also focus on the real possibility that rising costs and
flawed assumptions could easily lead to false economies. I suggest that
the Government have yet to produce a fully costed plan, and that is
what lies at the heart of new clause 3. It is clear that costs are
rising: the extra resources being poured into boosting Reservist
recruitment are an example. In addition to that, and to the extra
payments to small and medium-sized enterprises, other rising costs
include the £5,000 bonus, the Reservist award, pensions and
mental health costs. To the best of my knowledge, none of this has been
properly costed. The charity Combat Stress has said that Reservists are
twice as likely as Regulars to suffer from some kind of mental
disorder, but I am not sure that that kind of extra cost has been fully
accounted for in the plans.</hs_Para>

should also question the underlying assumptions in the Army
Reserve’s plans. I think the Secretary of State is willing to
admit that it costs more to deploy Reservists than to deploy Regulars.
I do not think that there is any disagreement on that. It is therefore
crucial, in costing the plans, to identify the central case regarding
projected usage rates. The lower the rates, the lower the cost will
appear, because, as I have said, it costs more to deploy Reservists
than Regulars.</hs_Para>

us look at the figures in the impact assessment. The case for deploying
Reservists centres on the figure of 3,000 annual deployments. That
sounds somewhat low, given that the original purpose of the plan was to
replace 20,000 Regulars with 30,000 Reservists, and that we would be
using those Reservists more frequently. Here, however, we have a
projected usage rate of 3,000 annual deployments. Of course it will
bring the projected cost down if we artificially bring usage rates

of the Front-Bench position. I am not saying for one moment that the

said. My point is that the plan under the previous Secretary of State
was very different only two years ago. I do not want to labour this
point, but we heard from

the original plan was not to wind down the Regulars until the
Reservists were able to take their place. We heard that from his own
lips. I do not want to enter into a war of words between the present

that they would be ready to be deployed in theatre, however. In many
cases, it will mean that they are ready to begin training. I had five
months of additional training before I was deployed in theatre. That
kind of training involves additional costs, as does the Reservist

</B><B>Ainsworth</B><B>:</B></Member> I offer profound congratulations
to the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier), not just for the
concession he has achieved today but for the formidable way he has
pursued this issue over the years. He harassed me when I was in
office—I perhaps remember that with a fondness I never felt at
the time—and has continued to harass his own Government and the
defence establishment on the issue of the Reserves and the role they
can play in the country’s defence. No matter who wants to claim
credit for some of the changes now being brought about, he can feel
real satisfaction at something very few Back Benchers can say they have
been able to do: profoundly to change a significant area of Government
policy. He has most certainly done that through his work on the
Reserves over the
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092000252">I
totally support the hon. Gentleman’s new clause 1 and am
enormously pleased that the Secretary of State has accepted it. I also
support new clause 3, and I have to say that I believe the Secretary of
State is being a little heavy-handed in suggesting that to support it
is somehow to sabotage the direction of the Army or to play politics
with the defence of the realm. I say that as a former Secretary of
State who had to put up with allegations by the then loyal Opposition
that I had deliberately delayed life-saving vehicles getting to our
troops in Afghanistan. It is enormously important—particularly
in the field of defence, where there is such a degree of cross-party
support—that the Government’s own defence of their
policies is somewhat measured, but I am not at all sure it has been in
this regard. We can all read: we can see what new clause 3 says and
does not say. As I say, my respect for the hon. Member for Canterbury
is about as high as an Opposition Member’s can be for a
Government Member, and I have not heard from him, or from anybody else
here today, anything to suggest that the new clause does all the
terrible things it is said to bring about.</hs_Para>

calls for a report within a particular time frame after the Bill has

may have an agenda that is not mine—I do not know—because
I support the general direction of policy in this area wholeheartedly.

for his generous treatment of me, as leader of the all-party group for
the Reserve forces and cadets, which made the campaigning possible. The
effect of this would be to send a message to those Regular officers,
many of them serving, who have rubbished this proposal for the past
year and a half to the press off the record—they are a minority
within the Regular Army but a significant one, some of whom the right
hon. Gentleman will know—that if this can be kept down for just
a little bit longer, they may get some Regular manpower back
instead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092000255"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Ainsworth" PimsId="3608" UID="13112092001900" xid="6" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092001900">Mr
Ainsworth:</Member></B> The effect can and should be that this House is
enormously interested in the development of the Reserves and wants to
see their capability properly developed and scrutinised—and no
more than that. That should be the message, and I do not think there is
anybody in the House who is responsible for another message that I know
of, other than the defence being offered by Government Front Benchers
in the overreaction, as I see it, to new clause
3.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13112092001740" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092001740">3.15

“Secretary of State.”] Former Secretary of State; I beg
the right hon. Gentleman’s pardon. He obviously has great
knowledge of these issues, but on one he is quite wrong. He says that
new clause 3 calls only for a report, but it does not. It is quite
explicit: it calls for “Further implementation of the
plans” to be “halted”. Why does the Labour party
appear to be supporting the interruption of access to better pension
provision and explicitly interrupting access to paid leave for
training? Surely, that is not what he
intends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092000257"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Ainsworth" PimsId="3608" UID="13112092001902" xid="6" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0002.htm#13112092001902">Mr

Madeleine Moon</B> (Bridgend) (Lab):</Member> Let us be clear: we are
not talking about any conflict or preference for Reserves or Regulars;
we are talking about numbers, competency and capability for the defence
of the realm. What we need to be assured of—but which this
House, largely, is not confident we have—is that the
Government’s plans will provide us with the necessary numbers,
competency and capability. That is what the pause is about. It is not a
throwing away of the plan: it is a pause.</hs_Para>

Ainsworth:</Member></B> The growth of the Reserve element in all the
services has huge potential benefits, such as a connection with the
population at large that the small Regular armed forces that we
inevitably have today and will have tomorrow can never achieve on its
own. Equally, as other Members have said, it brings skills into the 
<?notus-xml column=1281?>armed forces that cannot be kept up to date within the Regulars
themselves. So there are those potential
improvements.</hs_Para>

Members have talked about a potential gap of three years, but it is not
just a question of that: I am worried about the potential ongoing
downgrading of capability if we do not get this right. In order to get
into the Reserves the calibre of people that will be absolutely
necessary for the kind of operations we have unfortunately had to carry
out in recent years, and will undoubtedly have to carry out in future,
the skills required by every rank must not only remain at their current
level, but must improve. That is for the obvious and simple reason,
which everybody knows, that the huge reputational damage to such
operations, to our armed forces and to our nation, of errors in such
operations can be profound. We must therefore ensure, given the
cut-backs that are inevitably taking place, that we maintain within the
Regulars the quality of not only the original recruits but of the
training given to them, in order to lift capability. We are blessed
with armed forces with a capability level that, in some ways, is higher
than that in any other nation on earth, in my opinion, but it will need
to be higher still.</hs_Para>

Ellwood:</Member></B> I have a lot of respect for the right hon.
Gentleman and the experience he gained as Secretary of State, but I
genuinely worry that he is fighting the last war. The conduct of
warfare has changed. I hope he would agree that we will not be doing
“boots on the ground” in the manner in which we have done
so badly in Afghanistan and Iraq. The size of armed forces
concertinas—it has done so over the past 400 years. I hope he
would agree that withdrawal from Afghanistan will have a huge impact on
the size of the standing Army, both Regular and Territorial, and
batting for the old numbers that we had five years ago is out of
touch<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:20:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Ainsworth:</Member></B> I totally accept that. I like to study history
and I know that after conflicts, the services—generally the Army
more than the other services, but those, too—have generally been
decimated in times of peace, only to have to be regenerated in times of
danger thereafter. So I am not trying to fight the last war. I am
saying that as we struggle with these enormous economic challenges and
the cuts that are almost inevitable, we have to do everything we can to
maintain the quality of our personnel. That applies to the Regular
forces as it applies to the Reserves. Even at a time of downsizing, we
can surely do that—we have to try to do it because of the
reputational damage that inevitably flows from our failure to do so.
There is nothing “yesterday” or “last war”
about that approach; this is about the kind of operations we could be
involved in tomorrow, of whatever scale, and the need for quality
personnel.</hs_Para>

disbanded in any case. Let me be clear about what my proposal says,
because motives that I do not take kindly to are being attributed to
it. The proposal is about saying that these plans are not working and

amendments tabled by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:39:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron), why we have tabled some similar
amendments, such as new clause 4, and why we have supported similar
motions before. As the Secretary of State will realise from the tone of
the debate, this House, including Her Majesty’s Opposition, will
always put Britain’s security and national interest first. One
of the first things I said when I was appointed shadow Defence
Secretary was that when I thought the Government were doing the right
thing on defence, I would work with them in a constructive and
reasonable manner, and that is what the shadow Front-Bench team and I
have done throughout the passage of this Bill. To be fair, the tone of
the debate, notwithstanding the disagreements that exist between
Members on both sides of the House, is one of reasonableness and
constructiveness. We have been debating the best way forward with
respect to these reforms and the proper defence of our
country.</hs_Para>

am sorry to have to say to the Secretary of State that he should not
try to turn the debate into a party political row. It is disappointing
and unnecessary. Contrary to what he said, we have raised
this issue in parliamentary questions, in Committee and, as recently as
last month, on the Floor of the House, when we passed a vote to approve
a motion almost identical to the new
clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>.
Importantly, the Secretary of State knows that we are not calling for
the reforms to be reversed. He knows that we are not saying the reforms
should be shelved. Like Members on both sides of the House, we want to
see an enlarged Reserve force with an enhanced and more heavily
integrated role alongside Regular forces.</hs_Para>

me once again praise and pledge my support, and that of the House, for
our armed forces and the work they do. What we need is evidence that
the reforms are progressing as planned and promised, and we
are trying to get the Defence Secretary to take more responsibility for
that. There is clearly an issue about viability. All signs coming from
the MOD suggest that the plan has, to some extent, fallen off course.

Gentleman’s concerns, but does he not see that this is a

have put in place is a mechanism by which there will be an annual
independent report, which will be laid before
Parliament and which we fully expect to give rise to a debate. That
will allow the progress of this programme to be tracked over many
years. New clause 3 would create a one-off hurdle, which sends a

understand that the downsizing of the Army and the Government’s
stated policy mean that as the Regular numbers downsize and reduce an
uplift in Reserve numbers should go alongside that. The central thrust

in Reserves will be sufficient to conform to the policy on the

who has said that reservists have performed a singularly valuable task
in recent operations—something like 25,000 have been
deployed—whether by augmenting existing units or by contributing
specialist skills that would not have been available to the regular
armed forces. I remember very well visiting Basra with the Select
Committee on Defence just a couple of months after the war ended, and
finding that the entire Iraqi economy was being put right by an Army
officer who, in civilian life, was a banker. He was responsible for
putting Iraq’s finances in order. Clearly, he had more success

financial constraints in which we have to operate, so it seems to me
that we are making the best of a difficult situation. I hope, though,

a pause while we examine whether rising costs will lead to false
economies and whether we are opening up unacceptable capability gaps.

State will support new clause 6—his Liberal Democrat colleagues
will, for reasons I will explain in a moment—because it seeks to

many Conservative Members take the same view. The difficulty with
legislating for that now in the manner the hon. Gentleman is suggesting

military pay will be provided for that period of time. I dearly hope
that this Government or a future Government will at some point be able
to find the resources, but a gargantuan effort has been made to balance
the Ministry of Defence’s books and the resources are not there.

professional recruiter. My last job in the Army was as a colonel in the
Army training and recruiting agency. I use the word
“agency” with a curl of the lip: it was not a command or
a military formation of any sort, which was one of the reasons why I
resigned from the Army—because of its disgraceful conduct,
particularly over recruiting. I will return to that in a moment. I also
had the privilege to belong to and to command a battalion that, at the
height of the Territorial Army, had to find permanent staff
instructors, adjutants and the like for up to four Territorial
battalions—our third and fourth battalions, and what were then
called the 1st and 2nd Battalions the Mercian Regiment.</hs_Para>

which my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:27:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Canterbury made such clear reference, from the
first and second world wars, and so on. I am a little out of date now,
but in my experience that was a deeply divisive and extremely unhelpful
view. In the Regular Army, we had to provide a lot of those
individuals, which absolutely was a nuisance. None the less, anybody
who looked at the colours of my regiment—or, indeed, of the
fusiliers or any of the infantry or cavalry regiments in the British
Army—would have seen that the majority of the battle honours on
those colours were won by battalions and regiments from the Territorial
Force or the Territorial Army. It is a fact; we cannot get away from
it. Any Regular Army individual who ignores the importance, the
potential or the sheer enthusiasm of the Reserves—the TF, the TA
or whatever we want to call them—is simply daft.</hs_Para>

strength and that we could not recruit more than that, which, in a
recruiting famine, would be quite impossible. I talked closely to what

the particular conditions of the Reserve forces and the Territorial
Army were understood and sent those recruits straight to the TA rather
than try to confuse them with the Regular Army. I make no pretence of
fully understanding the impact of social media, on which Capita and
other firms base the core of their recruiting effort—that was
different in my day—but I do know that unless we get out with
capable and experienced people, seek recruits in the places where they
are most plentiful, and physically present the Army, the Navy, the Air

will not, and I would be happy to debate that with anyone who thinks it

course there are specialisations within the Reserve forces and the
Territorial Army which are desperately important, but what our Regular

who is no longer in the Chamber, observed that there was always a
period of time before any Reservist—any Territorial—was
up to snuff. That is no criticism, but, as Members who have served in
infantry battalions know, preparing an individual for combat is akin to
training a professional athlete. The level of fitness is
extraordinarily important. I challenge any civilian holding down a
full-time civilian job—and I do not say this with any form of

a more integrated role for Reserves will come a more open and
supportive relationship between armed forces and employers. A number of
the new clauses refer to business, implicitly or explicitly, and would
have an impact on it. That is why I was so keen to speak at this point.
As a small business owner and as someone who has been in business for
more than 20 years and has employed Reservists, I understand that, for
many of them, successful service in the military depends hugely on the
support of their employers. That will become even more important given
the increased role of Reservists in the future armed forces, and it is
right for us to recognise the valuable contributions that employers
make to our national security by hiring them.</hs_Para>

however, it is important that trained-up Reservists are provided with
accredited qualifications that the armed forces can provide, and these
will give a real service to employers. We must recognise the skills
employees will gain from Reserve service and how that will benefit
employers and society as a whole. Ultimately business needs one thing
more than anything else: certainty. It just wants to know what is
expected of it with sufficient notice and what it can expect in return.
I am delighted that this Bill commits to providing employers with full
information about what hiring a Reservist entails.</hs_Para>

many businesses currently have no experience of hiring a Reservist and
the establishment of a national relationship management scheme will
strengthen the partnership between the armed forces and employer
organisations, leading to a much more open and predictable relationship

them.</hs_Para>

of my concerns with new clause 3 is that it will provoke confusion. It
will delay or prevent payments being made to small enterprises when
their employees are mobilised. This extra finance for small and
medium-sized enterprises, who find it most difficult to plug the gap
when their employees are away, is
vital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:41:04"></hs_TimeCode>. These

other concern with new clause 3 is about the delay in the delivery of
the transferable skills. This Bill does not just compensate firms; it
provides them with real benefits for deciding to hire a member of the
new Army Reserve. Time with the Reserves can greatly enhance an
employee’s effectiveness through high-quality training, leading
opportunities and the chance to gain specific civilian-recognised
qualifications while on duty. By accrediting Reservists with recognised
qualifications, we not only help them progress their careers, but
provide real incentives for employers to take them on in the first
place. Businesses will know that while their employees are away on duty
they will not be engaged in unnecessary training exercises, but will be
gaining tangible and valuable skills. This will also encourage more
people to consider serving with the Reserves. The fact that they will
be able to make a genuine contribution to our national security while
increasing their employability in their chosen career path will be a
real pull, attracting high-quality individuals into the Army
Reserve.</hs_Para>

Reserve service can help provide people who are currently out of work

them on to the job ladder.

industry-led apprenticeships will provide unemployed young people with

It is excellent news that this Government will be placing clear

all deeply regret the reduction in the Army from 102,000 to 82,000
soldiers. It is appalling; personally, I think it is disgraceful. I am
extraordinarily concerned about the future of the globe if we have an
Army of 82,000 soldiers and about the reductions in the RAF and Royal
Navy. One or two of my colleagues have expressed that concern very
well. This is a very uncertain world, and facing it with this reduced
defence spending is extremely worrying. As a Back Bencher, I have no
personal responsibility for these matters, but I accept that the
financial position in which the Government found themselves when they
came to power three years ago necessitated these cuts in defence
spending, in the same way as they necessitated all kinds of unpleasant
cuts in other Departments. None the less, I deeply regret them and am
extraordinarily worried about
them.</hs_Para>

believe passionately in defence would like to see the defence of the

that to one side for a moment. We all start from the position of
regretting the cuts but realising the reasons for them. On the Reserve
forces, we all hope the plans in place work. We are all committed to
making them work and believe that the Reserve forces have done a superb
job. In recent years, and as long ago as the first world war, they have
made a gigantic contribution to the defence of the realm, and we
strongly support that. Everyone in the Chamber is deeply concerned
about whether the 20,000 Regular soldiers will be replaced by the
increase in the TA that is posited. Of course, we 
<?notus-xml column=1305?>are concerned about that, about the recruitment figures and about
whether the Secretary of State’s plans will work out. Those are
common positions. I suspect that not one person in the Chamber would
disagree.</hs_Para>

disagreement arises when we consider what to do about it. The Regular
Army is already at about 86,000 or 87,000. By early February, it will
be at about 82,760. The redundancy notices have gone out. People are
already on their leaving training and getting ready to leave the
Regular forces. We cannot reverse that. No matter what we do in the
Chamber today, there is no magic wand that will reverse it. By the
middle of January, the Army will be at 82,760 soldiers. Regret it as we
may, we cannot reverse that.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:48:52"></hs_TimeCode>The second thing
for certain is that, whether or not we have confidence it will work, we

question, therefore, is: what do we do about it? That is the nature of
this debate, and it seems to me that there are two possibilities. The
first thing we could do, as my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and
Billericay (Mr Baron) seeks to do—I have to admit that I signed
his new clause 3—is to write our aims and concerns into
legislation. In recent years we have done that in this House
on a number of occasions—for example, with regard to the green
carbon targets and reducing child poverty. In such cases, there is a
law that says, “The Government will do this or do that,”
and if it does not achieve those aims there will be some penalty to
pay. It is therefore perfectly possible that we could do what my hon.
Friend seeks to do by writing into legislation—the law of the
land—something that says that the Government will improve our
Reserve forces in the way
described<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:50:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The
alternative approach would be to do what we do with regard to every
single thing in this place—to scrutinise what the Government are
doing in questions and debates in this Chamber, in Westminster Hall and
in Select Committees. We can do that in a variety of ways.</hs_Para>

of State tells me that because of my hon. Friend’s new clause
and this debate, he, the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Defence as
a whole have been entirely focused on this matter for a number of days.
That means we have achieved one of the things we wanted to achieve. We
have said to the nation as a whole—it has been wall to wall in
the media—that we are deeply concerned about these cuts in
defence spending, about the fact that we have an Army of 82,000 that
may not be able to do its job, and about whether the re-growing of the

things greatly concern me about new clause 3, despite the fact that my

Secondly, if we had a pause to examine the matter and produce a report,
one of two things would happen at the end of that pause. The report
would be satisfactory to the House of Commons and the House of Lords,
we would vote for it, and the plans would plough ahead as they were
before, or the report would not be satisfactory to us and we would turn
it down. If the latter were to occur, who knows what would happen?
Presumably we would have to start again. The one thing that would not
happen, even then, would be that somehow we magically grew the Regular
forces to fill the gap that had by then appeared. If I am right in
thinking that the House would approve the report, what on earth is the
point of a huge gap between now and then in producing it? We would end
up with precisely the same plans that we have for the growth and

very simple principle is at stake here. Let us suppose that someone
comes to a sovereign Parliament and says, “We are going to make
a significant cut in the size of the Army, but don’t worry about
it because we are going to compensate for it by building up the
Reserves to the tune of 30,000 people.” If there are any
significant or reasonable doubts at all about whether the 30,000 target
will be achieved, it is reasonable to say, “Hang on a minute,
what happens if the 30,000 is not achieved?” If the answer is
that the 20,000 cuts will take place in any case, it is absolutely
unacceptable to have promised the 30,000 in the first place, especially
as it was explicitly stated to the House that the cuts in the Regulars
would not be fully or irreversibly implemented until we knew that the
Reserves were going to be forthcoming. I do not want us to have this
debate again in a few months’ time or in a few years’
time over the fact that we have neither the number of Regulars we need
nor the number of extra Reserves that were promised. That is why,
whatever the intricacies of the wording of new clause 3, I intend to
support
it.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_20_PT_1/6A68AAB73AB1B39055300C049042E9DE258DD166" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="20 November 2013">Wednesday

Stewart</B><B>:</B></Member> I wish to speak briefly, because I am
aware that many others wish to contribute, in strong defence of new
clause 1 and against new clause 3. Both relate to the central issue,
which has been raised by almost everyone in this debate: recruitment
into the Territorial Army. New clause 1 will encourage recruitment,
because it will show that we are taking the Reserves seriously, whereas
new clause 3 will discourage recruitment by introducing an unnecessary
delay.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:06:57"></hs_TimeCode> The most
important thing, which lies behind this entire debate, is defining what
the Reserves are for—what the function of the military is about.
The best way to guarantee that we have a well-supported, well-recruited
Reserve is if we in this House can agree what the future shape of the
Army is supposed to be and what we are supposed to be doing with
it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112092000461" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#13112092000461"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:07:18"></hs_TimeCode>The
central issue, which perhaps has not been touched on enough today and
which I would like to touch on briefly, is whether we have or have not
learned the lessons of the past 10 years. Do we have the shape of
Reserves or of the Regular Army required to meet the threats of the
future? In essence, events of the past 10 years have
completely exploded, or should have done in this Chamber,
the entire consensus on nation building and counter-insurgency. For 10
years, the entire shape of our military has been arranged
around those two principles, both of which I suggest, modestly, have
been discredited. The experience of Iraq and Afghanistan should have
taught us by now that we have designed the wrong kind of Army for the
wrong kind of campaign. Those two central slogans, “nation
building” and “counter-insurgency”, have not
worked. We do not have time to talk through why they have not
worked—if we had a long debate, we could do so—but we
have to design reserve forces that meet that problem and that
challenge.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=1310?><hs_Para UID="13112092000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#13112092000462"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:08:42"></hs_TimeCode>Why
has nation building not worked? In essence, it was because it was an
over-ambitious fantasy. The jargon of “the rule of law”,
“governance” and “civil society” turned out
to be impossible to deliver. We never had the tour lengths, the
linguistic knowledge or the deep area expertise to deliver things that
require an understanding of culture and history. Counter-insurgency did
not work for even deeper reasons, which the military
predicted—in the United States and the United
Kingdom—before we deployed. We never had the requisite number of
troops, nor were we ever likely to. We never had the tour lengths we
required. We never had a credible, effective, legitimate Government in
Baghdad or Kabul to back us. We never had full control of the borders.
In the absence of such structures, those missions turned out to be
impossible.</hs_Para>

the Reserves and the Regular Army take on those lessons, we will have
the wrong kind of forces in the future. That does not mean that our
military does not have a deep function in intervention, but that deep
function needs to look at the model of Bosnia, and not that of Iraq or
Afghanistan. We need to remember that in Bosnia, our military proved
exactly what an intervention can do. It went into a country with
110,000 people under arms. It went into a country when a million
refugees had been displaced and when there were internal borders
dividing it up in 25 different ways. By the time we had finished that
intervention, the internal borders had gone, the militia had been
reduced to 5,000 and the crime rate in Bosnia had dropped; it is now
lower than that of Sweden. That is the kind of success for which we
should be preparing our military.</hs_Para>

final thing—this really goes to the heart of what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:10:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier) has raised—is the
question of how the knowledge, the imagination and the skills and the
local links of the Reserves should be adjusted to a new world. There
are small ingredients that we should insert, and I plead with the
Secretary of State to please look very hard at reintroducing the
short-service limited commission, or the gap-year commission.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:11:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Canterbury, I and a number of other Members of
Parliament are proud to claim that we have been in the military. Our
standing there was very brief, but it was an incredibly deep and
important experience for us and for many other people. It is a
relatively cheap programme, and it is one that can develop the links
between the military and the local population.</hs_Para>

imagination and skills, the biggest prize for which we should be aiming
is to fill in the gap that the Foreign Office, the Department for
International Development and the current military are unable to fill
in. I am talking about deep area expertise and deep linguistic
expertise, which the right kind of reserve forces should be able to
produce. We need to recruit, promote and incentivise the right kind of
people. We want people with other lives, other jobs and other
experiences, who should be able to develop what we have been sadly
lacking for 20 years, which is a sensitivity to other cultures and an
understanding of other environments, other local business and other
political structures. If we can get those things right, we have exactly
what we need for new clause 1, which is a template, a model or a bar to
which to hold the Government accountable on how the reserve forces
should function. We will also have a reason not to proceed with new
clause 3, which delays the most important part of rebuilding the
Reserves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:12:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

all, it seems important that our relationship with the Reserves is
characterised by one word, which is “seriousness”. We
need a plan, a direction and a confidence of Government, and that will
turn around recruitment. People do not join the Reserves for exactly
how many days they serve, for how much money they receive or for the
pension terms they get. They join because they feel that it matters.
Government are serious about them, Parliament is serious about them and
we know where we are going. The reason why I will not vote for new

the House, my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:21:24"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, was excoriating about the
recruitment process run in recent months by the Regular Army to try to
increase the Army Reserves. He is a shining example of someone giving
proper parliamentary scrutiny to the process that we are considering
because he wants it to work. He is doing that in a way that shows that
he is committed to making the proposal a success, and that is the
difference. That is why I am pleased that new clause 1 is being
accepted by the Government, and why I think that it would be damaging,
divisive and unnecessary to support new clause

Drax</B> (South Dorset) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to take part
in the debate; I have listened very carefully to it all afternoon. I
find myself in a very difficult place, particularly being a
Conservative MP, for two reasons. First, in my view, the cuts to our
armed forces have gone far too far. Secondly, I believe that the ratio
of Regulars to Reserves is wrong. Rather than going for 70:30, we
should be looking at

Drax:</Member></B> I hear my hon. Friend, and I respect him hugely for
his opinion, but it is slightly dangerous to look at other countries
and think that we can meet their expectations. I remember when an
American general came to speak to a few of us upstairs about reserves.
He had served under President Clinton and then President Obama. He was
an interesting and very decorated man who had fought in Vietnam. We
asked him about the reserves that America has. He made a rather
salutary point: he said, “In America, having a high proportion
of reserves works, because we have the money to fund them. We have
airstrips with Hercules aircraft lined up on them, just waiting for
commercial pilots to step out of their 747s into them, and to go off to
trouble spots or wars around the world.” We cannot begin to meet
that level of expenditure; that is what really worries me. We are
pushed to fund the Regulars.</hs_Para>

enough men and resources to man and protect one, with frigates and

presentation by Dave McGinnis, one of my oldest friends, but his point
was that because in America reserve manpower is less than a quarter of
the cost, America is able to afford, whatever size its budget—it
is obviously larger than ours—a much larger range of
capabilities, and more boots on the ground, albeit that some of them
are at lower readiness, by having such a high proportion of
reservists.</hs_Para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:26:14"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot) said that
there was no longer a need for the number of battalions that we used to
have. May I give three examples where boots on the ground would be
needed, quite apart from any conventional war that we might have to
fight? First, God forbid that the Northern Ireland troubles ever rose
from the ashes again. We had 32,500 men and women in Northern Ireland
at the height of the troubles. With a professional Army of 82,000
men—a large majority of whom are not bayonets, to use the Army
lingo; many are back-up forces—we would be pushed to man that
one
commitment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:26:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000492" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#13112092000492">Secondly,
the Falklands has been mentioned so many times. Baroness Thatcher was
looking at cutting our armed forces just before the war broke
out—I think my historical facts are right—and as I
understand it, afterwards she said, “Never again am I going to
take our armed forces for granted.” Thirdly, for a big
evacuation, potentially from a friendly country—let us say
Kenya—we would need, without aircraft carriers, boots on the
ground to secure an area around which our citizens could be extracted.
This takes huge resources, immediate resources, professional
resources<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:27:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000493" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#13112092000493">I

all and thank them from the bottom of my heart, as does the nation, for
what they do. All I am saying is that the ratio of 70:30 should be
reviewed and it should be 90:10 instead. Finally, my military sources

and what the armed forces, however they are comprised, will actually
do, because the balance between war fighting, stabilisation and
peacekeeping has changed. The idea that we have to win over local
support is now more central than it ever has been. Infrastructure,
development, local governance and the drive for agriculture have all
been mentioned. All that is secondary to the war fighting that takes
place, but in Afghanistan and Iraq the war fighting was conducted and
completed relatively quickly. We lost in those cases in the
peacekeeping and nation-building. That is where it is very interesting
to see the TA provide value, because it has the linguistic skills and

concern is whether this House will ever again entertain putting boots
on the ground. I would like us to have a large standing Army, as others
have mentioned, and to be that leader in the world, carrying that big
stick. I ask that question because of my concern about the vote this

participating in, yet this House voted against the Government. Others
say that perhaps that is not a yardstick for potential future
interventions, and I quite understand that, but it could be that,
because of the ghosts of Afghanistan and Iraq, interventions in future
will have a light footprint and will be very different. I simply pose a
question as to what our armed forces need to look like: do they need to
look like what we have had in the past, or should they adapt to the

easily adapt and be used in various situations, but I also have faith,
as a result of the models we have seen in America and, indeed,
Australia, that other skills sets can be used and that we can build the
Territorial Army to match our requirements, not just for the security
of our country and the protection of our overseas territories, or
because of our NATO commitments, but because the conduct of war itself

completely. This House needs to be able—very quickly—to

attrition rate—the wastage rate—of those who express an
initial interest in serving in the Reserves, the Territorial Army as
was, we should bring them into the units and give them weapons training
much more quickly, rather than wait for them to go through medical
tests and so forth. Once we have grabbed them, got their interest and
introduced them to the practical, military side of the Reservists and
their camaraderie, we can then decide whether they are fit for the role
they wish to play or whether we should deploy them in a less front-end
activity. That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:39:24"></hs_TimeCode>

hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart) made
an extremely important point that I fear was nearly missed. One could
be forgiven for thinking that the recruitment of Reserves as part of
Army 2020 is simply a question of backfilling or substituting for
Regulars, but he pointed out that as the nature of warfare changes and
we need more specialist skills, we will find increasingly that
specialists have to be recruited through the Reserves from the civilian
sector. With the creation of our cyber-reserve force, we are already
seeing the truth of that statement, as people in highly skilled
technical jobs in the private sector queue to join the cyber-reserve
and offer their skills and expertise to the defence of our
nation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:43:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000528" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#13112092000528">I
am the first to acknowledge—I have done so before, and I want to
do so again today—that increasing the size of our Reserve Army
forces to 30,000 and sustaining them at that level is a challenging
agenda. We are doing it in the face of ending combat operations in
Afghanistan, and however strange some people may find this, the
prospect of going into a combat zone is a huge recruiting sergeant for
the armed forces, Regular and Reserve alike. We are also doing it
against the backdrop, about which I have been completely frank, of
challenges with the existing IT

an attempt to block or inhibit the growth and reinvigoration of the

would like to see more capability across our armed forces, not less. As
I have made clear, we have no problem with submitting information to
the House for scrutiny. By accepting new clause 1, we will deliver the
intention behind subsection (1) of new clause 3. I believe that making
it an annual report for annual scrutiny will provide for better

cannot accept the halt that is proposed in new clause 3. That would
send out a signal now to the thousands of people who are in the Reserve
forces or are thinking of joining them. The Government have set out
their plan and are legislating to deliver it. The Army has embraced the
plan wholeheartedly. For Parliament to introduce additional tripwires
at this stage would create uncertainty, undermine the message about the
roll-out of improved terms and conditions, and cast doubt on our
intention to spend the sizeable sum of £1.8 billion that is
available to support this agenda. In short, it would make the whole
agenda into a political football.</hs_Para>

further and tell him that a review is currently underway to look at
trade skills available in Northern Ireland. Most of the Reserves
recruiting is trade skills-specific. If we find that pools of
additional trade skills are recruitable, we will consider locating
additional units in Northern Ireland to tap into them. We have to be

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:53:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Basildon and Billericay has made several times in debate
and in the media. He says that a 40% or an 80% mobilisation rate is not
achievable. We are looking at a maximum mobilisation of between 3,000
and 4,000 Reservists at any given time, out of an Army Reserve of
30,000. By my maths, that is significantly below 40% or 80%. During
Operation Telic in Iraq, 85% of Reservists responded to call
out—an 85% mobilisation rate—and Operation
Herrick had a 79% mobilisation rate, so I do not quite understand his
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092000548" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#13112092000548"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Baron" PimsId="3887" UID="13112092002063" xid="29" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#13112092002063">Mr

is the first time I have had the opportunity to serve under your
chairmanship, Madam Deputy Speaker, and it is a great pleasure to
welcome you to the Chair. I want to begin by thanking the members of
the Public Bill Committee, who did an outstanding job in ensuring that
the Bill was subject to detailed scrutiny. As a Committee, we benefited
particularly from the expertise of those who are or have been members
of the armed forces, both Regulars and Reserves, a number of whom have
contributed to our debate today.</hs_Para>

deals with important matters, some, I accept, of a rather technical
nature. In particular, I would like to thank my hon. Friend the Member
for Canterbury (Mr Brazier), who has had much praise heaped on him,
quite properly, from all quarters of the House. He brought his deep
understanding of current, and several historic, Reserve issues to our
deliberations in Committee and today. In fact, it was remarkable to be
taken back by him well over a hundred years, thanks to his knowledge of
Reserve numbers before the first world
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092001698" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#13112092001698">I
should also like to thank the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View
(Alison Seabeck) for fulfilling her promise on Second Reading to give
the Bill a fair wind. I understand that she is not with us this
evening. I completely understand why, and I ask her colleagues to pass
on my kind words and hope that she shortly becomes a grandmother again.
Her contributions in Committee were insightful and constructive, with
the enthusiastic assistance of her shadow Front-Bench colleague, the
hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones), who frequently
brought his previous experience as a Defence Minister to bear on our
proceedings. They both ensured that the Bill left Committee having been
thoroughly examined, after more than 40 hours of debate.</hs_Para>

the UK and the protection of our national interests can only be
achieved if we provide our armed forces with the capabilities they need
to operate effectively. We have a duty to them to ensure they have the
tools they need in terms of manpower, training, equipment and
logistical support. The Bill will allow significant improvements to the
way in which defence operates in the two crucial areas of procurement
of equipment and support, and of rebuilding our Reserve
forces.</hs_Para>

widespread agreement that the procurement and support of defence
equipment can and must be improved. It is clear from our debate in
Committee that there is a consensus on the need for reform. In the
past, under Governments of both parties, too often defence procurement
has not delivered the equipment needed by our armed forces on time or
within budget. By producing for the first time a balanced and
affordable equipment programme, we have already made significant
progress in improving the framework in which defence equipment is
procured. Now is the time to make further structural changes to ensure
that the ground we have already gained is not lost in the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092001701" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0004.htm#13112092001701">The
outline of our approach on procurement reform was set out in the White
Paper “Better Defence Acquisition”, which we published on
10 June. Our preference, as we expressed around the time of the White
Paper, is to transform the existing Defence Equipment and Support
organisation into a Government-owned, contractor-operated
organisation—a GoCo. But as we have explained, it not a foregone
conclusion that a GoCo will be chosen instead of a public sector
comparator, which we are calling
DE&amp;S-plus.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112092001702" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0004.htm#13112092001702">In
addition, as was made clear in the written ministerial statement by my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, the Cabinet
Office and the Ministry of Defence have recently completed a review
into the viability of the matériel strategy commercial
competition. After a rigorous examination, it concluded that a viable
commercial competition for a GoCo provider exists, albeit with risks.
We welcomed this conclusion; indeed, we have already made considerable

also recommended that any further reduction in the number of bidders
should stimulate a formal reconsideration and decision on whether to
proceed further with the GoCo option. Last week, we received through
this competition, which we have been running in parallel with the Bill,
one bid for a GoCo from Materiel Acquisition Partners, a consortium led
by Bechtel, with PA Consulting and PricewaterhouseCoopers. This is a
complex, detailed proposal, running to more than 1,200 pages, which is
currently being evaluated to understand what benefits it offers, at
what cost and with what conditions. We intend to subject the bid to run
a GoCo to a rigorous comparison with the public sector comparator,
DE&amp;S-plus. We expect a proposal from the team developing the
DE&amp;S-plus option shortly.</hs_Para>

have asked me, rightly, about what DE&amp;S-plus means. As we have
said, we believe that the GoCo option is most likely to embed and
sustain the significant behavioural change required to transform
defence acquisition, but we need to test this, and we are testing the
GoCo proposition against the best that we could do wholly within the
public sector. The DE&amp;S-plus proposition is being worked up now. I
cannot give much detail at this stage, as I would not want to
compromise its proposal. What I can say is that we are focusing on
ensuring an optimum balance between the need for an organisation that
has the freedom to run its affairs in a way that best meets Ministry of
Defence needs, and retaining and building on the values of the public
sector. Should the GoCo option be the chosen way

essential to ensure that it can operate effectively without

Secretary of State’s written ministerial statement yesterday
also announced the withdrawal of the other consortium competing to run

Defence, with the Cabinet Office and the Treasury, will now study the
detailed proposal received from Materiel Acquisition Partners. In
parallel, the DE&amp;S-plus team will continue to refine and enhance
their proposition. This analysis will inform a decision on whether it
is in the public interest to proceed with only a single commercial
bidder and a public sector comparator, and a further statement will be
made once this process is complete. All I can say at this stage is that
the bid we have on the table is substantial and from a consortium of

of the most valuable aspects of the Committee was the opportunity it
provided me to set out the GoCo proposal in greater detail than was
possible in the White Paper. We have been able to describe the
mechanisms, in addition to the legislation through which the Government
will exercise strategic control over a GoCo. For example, through both
this Bill and the contract, the GoCo will be required to protect
information that is sensitive for national security or commercial
reasons. Much of our debate in Committee centred on protecting
confidential information and on intellectual property.</hs_Para>

competition will usually be the best way of ensuring value for
taxpayers’ money. However, sometimes there is only a single
provider of a capability we require, and sometimes the need to maintain
critical national industrial capabilities or sovereign control of the
intellectual property in equipment programmes requires us to place
contracts with UK companies without a competitive process. This
so-called single-source procurement typically accounts for about
45%—some £6 billion a year—of the total that the
Ministry of Defence spends on defence equipment and support, and it is
likely to remain at that level for the foreseeable future.</hs_Para>

MOD currently uses a framework for single-source procurement that has
remained largely unchanged for the past 45 years. It is a system that
is failing the taxpayer. Neither does it help industry to remain
competitive in an increasingly globalised world. It is therefore in the
interests of both the MOD and its suppliers to create a framework with
incentives to deliver efficient and competitive behaviour. Part 2,
based on the 2011 report by Lord Currie of Marylebone, addresses this
need. It sets out a new framework based on transparency, with more and
better information on costs, stronger supplier efficiency incentives
and stronger governance arrangements. At its core is the principle that
industry gets a fair profit in exchange for providing the Ministry of
Defence with transparency on cost and better value for money. To
oversee that new framework, the Bill will create a small,
non-departmental public body to be known as the 
<?notus-xml column=1335?>single source regulations office with approximately 30 staff.
That will replace the existing pricing review board. The SSRO’s
role will be to keep the statutory framework under review and to
monitor adherence to it. The new arrangements will operate routinely
through agreement between the Ministry of Defence and industry, but
where agreement cannot be reached, the SSRO will have the power to make
binding determinations on both

the third part of the Bill relates to our Reserve forces. We have
already had a long debate on many aspects of that this afternoon and,
as has been made clear by everyone who spoke, the Reserves already make
an important contribution to military effectiveness. The White Paper of
July makes it clear that we expect them to make an even greater
contribution in the future. We need to update the legislation that
supports the revitalised Reserve forces and their contribution to
defence. Part 3 remedies that situation.</hs_Para>

title of the White Paper published by my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State last July encapsulates the Government’s
attitude towards the Reserve forces, as they are both “valuable
and valued”. The Bill reflects that and replaces the outdated
title of the Territorial Army with the Army Reserve, which not only far
more accurately describes the Reserves’ current role, but is a
change that Reservists themselves have resoundingly called
for.</hs_Para>

Bill also allows Reservists to be mobilised for the breadth of tasks
carried out by Regular forces, which is not currently the case. It

the Bill contains a measure to ensure that Reservists are not
disadvantaged by their Reserve service. Presently, Reserve service does
not count towards the two-year qualifying period for claims of unfair
dismissal. For claims where the reason for dismissal is, or is
primarily because, the individual is a Reservist, we will remove that
two-year qualifying period.</hs_Para>

conclusion, the thread that runs throughout the Bill is the need to
deliver the equipment and support that our armed forces need, while
ensuring a fair deal for Reservists, their employers, industry and the
public. The Bill makes important changes to the way in which we might
deliver defence capabilities in future and I commend it to the

make to our armed forces. I have seen them at first hand, in both Iraq
and Afghanistan; they are very brave men and women, doing a fantastic
job on our
behalf.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131120114000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0004.htm#131120114000021">On
the process ahead, I welcome the Government’s slight change of
heart on producing an annual report. May I say thank you to the
Secretary of State for including mental health in that report? If he
wishes for any assistance with the organisation involved, in terms of
how it approaches that, I am quite willing to engage, or point him in
the direction of other organisations that will be interested in knowing
how mental health can be seen as a priority, because there is an issue,
whether we like it or not, with reservists and mental health. I know
that the Government have followed through on work 
<?notus-xml column=1338?>that we did in government and have added to that, in terms of making

the overall position of reservists, after this afternoon’s
debate, I would say that the jury was still out, but we did get some
clarification from the Secretary of State on the reduction in the
Regular Army. Remember, when the strategic defence and security review
was first announced by the Prime Minister, there was to have been a
reduction of 7,000; then the figure went down from 95,000 to 80,000. I
think the Secretary of State was very candid this afternoon: that was
about money, not about what was best for our armed
forces.</hs_Para>

for Canterbury (Mr Brazier) has done a fantastic job. He has been an
assiduous champion of reservists for many years. When we were in
government, he worked closely with the then Secretary of State to try
to improve the lot of reservists. He raises an interesting point about
the issues between the regulars and the reserve forces. There has been,
in some quarters of the Army, a view that somehow the reserves are

the way forward. When we were in government, he was part of the senior

Secretary of State has moved a lot this afternoon; he has gone from
holding the position that we should not have annual reports to giving a
commitment to them. However, we need parliamentary time, so that the
report does not just sit on a shelf in the Library, but is debated on
the Floor of the House. I tell him gently that the more engagement he
has, not only with the Opposition, but with his party’s Back
Benchers, the better, when it comes to making sure that the best

realised.</hs_Para>

that we are still going through—we are being barred from
speaking to senior officers, and barred from military bases—is
not helpful. When I had a role in the Ministry of Defence, I took the

better—and not only for MPs’ understanding; members of

think that the background to the Bill is both the challenge of deficit
reduction and the greater challenge of a new military and security
landscape, to which the Bill forms part of an imaginative and strategic
Government response. Those challenges also bring opportunities, such as
the opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective defence
procurement. We on these Benches and our noble Friends in the House of
Lords have raised some questions about the GoCo model, but I think that
whichever model is eventually chosen will offer the opportunity to
improve on the past history of defence procurement. The other
opportunities are obviously those offered for Reservists by the Bill,

House, which has been rebuilt in recent years, has been in Alnwick
since long before the first of my many years in this House. The reason
we are considering this issue, which involves 40 jobs, is the Cabinet
Office’s shared service centre initiative, which began in 2004
under the then Labour Government and was refashioned in 2011 by the
present Government, and which has been subjected to severe criticism by
the National Audit Office throughout for not delivering the savings it

office has a long history. About 30 years ago it ceased to be the
regional office of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, because the Department gave up its network of regional
offices. I went to see the then Agriculture Minister, Peter Walker, who
was the kind of Tory we do not see many of these days. He was extremely
helpful. I suggested to him that he find other work for the office from
the central work of the Department, and he did: library functions were
transferred to Alnwick and in subsequent years the staff moved on to
other work, in particular the handling of civil servants’
expenses. They could have given a lesson or two to the House
authorities and the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority on
the efficiency with which they managed their operations. Indeed, I am
going to suggest to IPSA that it might move its work from central
London to DEFRA’s Alnwick office. I will come back to
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:06:13"></hs_TimeCode>. The staff

remain at Alnwick for 20 months while the company considers how it will
be handled in the future. That raises the question how likely it is
that the work will be offshored, perhaps to India or who knows where.
There are different views on the matter. The unions are fairly
convinced that the work will be offshored and Steria seems to have a
commitment to offshoring as a major part of its operation. Of course,
there are other sites involved, not just
Alnwick<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:07:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Cabinet Office’s position is that non-customer-facing jobs will
be offshored. I am not sure what that means when we are talking about
civil servants and their 
<?notus-xml column=1343?>personal expense claims. I think that they are customers of the service,

situation is very worrying for staff. Let us consider their position
under TUPE and the transfer arrangements. The unions have negotiated an
agreement that is referred to as TUPE-plus. There seems to be some
acceptance that, as these things go, it is not a bad agreement, but I
would be interested to hear my hon. Friend the Minister explain what
will be available to staff. During or after the 20-month period, will
some of them be offered other civil service posts? It has been
suggested that they will, but the trouble is that many of the posts may
be down in Tyneside or even much further away, perhaps over in
Carlisle, where the Rural Payments Agency is
situated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:09:11"></hs_TimeCode>. What
did the Department’s equality impact assessment have to say
about the situation and about people with caring responsibilities who
cannot easily move? They do very good work in the Alnwick office, but
they would not be able to continue to provide a good service to the
Government if they were told that they had to move a long distance
away.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:09:50"></hs_TimeCode> That
raises a question about what the Department will do, if outsourcing
goes ahead, to seek other work for its staff. It seems to me that if
there is a period in which the new company reviews what it does, that
period should be used to look for other work that could be done at the
Alnwick office, as Peter Walker did 30 years
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131120114000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0004.htm#131120114000063">After<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:10:27"></hs_TimeCode>

impact in a small rural community such as Alnwick, where there are not
many such professional jobs and where the quality of locally available

than their offline counterparts. The Government are investing
£530 million in rural broadband up to 2015, which,
through match funding, will result in up to £1.2 billion of
public funds. The pace of progress is accelerating, with 42 of the 44
local projects contracted, including all of those in the south-west.
Across the UK, 10,000 rural properties are being connected each week.
As was announced in the spending review, a further £250 million
will be available from 2015 to extend superfast broadband to 95% of UK
premises by
2017.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131120114000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0004.htm#131120114000076">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:17:51"></hs_TimeCode>

my right hon. Friend pointed out, the Government signed an agreement on
1 November 2013 with Steria Ltd to create a joint venture partnership
with Government. The new company, Shared Services Connected Ltd, has
been formed initially from a consolidation of some existing shared
service centres: the Department for Work and Pensions, DEFRA and the
Environment Agency, with in-scope services from UK Shared Business
Services Ltd expected to become part of SSCL by 2015. All DEFRA staff
previously engaged in the delivery of shared services transferred to
the new organisation from 1 November 2013. Services to existing

Alnwick and

creation of SSCL is a key part of the civil service reform plan, which
will harness industry best practice to deliver Government back-office
functions more efficiently. Transforming back-office operations across
Government could help to deliver between £400 million and
£600 million in savings for the taxpayer, freeing up scarce
resources to be better spent on front-line services. Economies of scale
will enable Steria to drive down costs and improve service levels by
sharing expertise across customers, adopting common processes and
systems and investing in new tools. To be a competitive and viable
business, SSCL needs to be in line with other companies of this kind,
which see some non-customer-facing transactional roles being sourced
offshore. As longer term transformation plans are agreed, SSCL will
consult with staff and representatives. Assistance will be provided to
any affected staff, including reinstatement and redeployment

time, the objective is to establish SSCL as the pre-eminent provider of
shared services to UK central Government and the wider public sector.
By migrating clients to a low-cost shared service model, it is
estimated that total benefits delivered by SSCL will be in excess of
£l billion. It is expected that in the course of the next couple
of years there will be some site consolidation from the nine existing
delivery sites, and we expect some staff reductions. Steria has made a
number of commitments on behalf of SSCL, including: no compulsory
redundancies in the first six months, an intent to minimise the need
for compulsory redundancies through work force planning, and a series
of redundancy avoidance measures during the transformation period.
Steria has also agreed that any final decisions on location will not be
made for six months. That will be a business-based decision. My right
hon. Friend will be well aware that this is a key 
<?notus-xml column=1347?>point. There will be a chance to demonstrate office efficiency, given
the low cost of locating in the base, the ownership of the premises and
so on, so there is a good case to be made to Steria for the Alnwick
office. However, the decision will ultimately be based on what it aims
to deliver to Government and the taxpayer.</hs_Para>

members of staff might look to the future and decide whether to look
for other opportunities, while others will stay on. The agreement is as
described, which is to say that the accommodation will continue to be
occupied. The company’s plans for carrying out the activity

redeployment can be explored. I have a great deal of sympathy generally
for his view about Government jobs in rural areas. The tax office in my
constituency went during the last Government drive to narrow the HMRC
estate, which was a matter of great sadness. As a Government, we need
to ensure that we explore all the options for keeping jobs in rural
areas. He was generous 
<?notus-xml column=1348?>enough to point out that I am relatively new to my responsibilities, but

ensure that lessons are learned and that the objectives of the original
project to make efficiencies are met, but there might also be
opportunities to ensure that the company takes into consideration some
of the points he has raised this evening. Again, I can feed his

him for the diligent way in which he has pursued this matter. Having
been in this role for about a month, I have heard from him on several

the Minister knows, in the centre of Ipswich there is a new development

Michelle Claridge, an entrepreneur, says, “I would like to set
up a pharmacy in this area, to service the new community.” But
it is not that simple. People cannot just get a retail unit for which
they have planning permission and start a pharmacy; it does not work
like that. The system is arranged by the pharmaceutical services

Claridge applied, it was run by the primary care trust—which
manages it in consultation with the health and wellbeing board for the
area and determines whether there is a need for a pharmacy in an area.

Pharmacists could offer such services easily and relieve pressure on
general practitioners and hospitals. The scale of what they could do is
significant. Why can they not offer basic diabetic treatment or flu
jabs? One could—I am sure not you, Dr McCrea—go to the

Claridge has experienced this situation. She said, “I want to
set up GP provision in this new community, linked to my

that the area for innovation in what is not really a market at all is
limited. That seems to me a great sadness and a missed opportunity, and
I am sure the Minister will agree. So how do we loosen things up? I
will address that in a second, because we first need to examine how

are essentially three categories of drugs. First, there are the
so-called “special drugs”—not the special drugs
that you might be aware of in Northern Ireland or in the rest of the

drugs are outside the normal regulatory regime. They are called
unregulated but, of course, this being the NHS, they are
regulated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112073000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112073000021">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T09:40:35"></hs_TimeCode>,
there are the regulated drugs—the vast majority. They are drugs
that are within patent and a few other sectors. Finally, there are the
category M drugs, which have come off patent. The NHS tries
to derive benefits from their coming off patent by ensuring that there
is not excessive profiteering in the sector. I hope I have explained

M drugs are incredibly complicated. In the parallel trading of
pharmaceuticals across the European Union—just to take one
issue—it was often beneficial to import drugs from Greece or
southern Europe to the UK because of the price differences between the
pound and the euro. The reverse is now true, which means that there is
sometimes a shortage of supply in the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

is addressed by a quota system imposed by the pharmaceutical companies,
which inevitably causes difficulties for pharmacists because sometimes
five people, rather than three, want a particular drug one week. At
that point, the pharmacist rings up the wholesaler and says, “I
need two more prescriptions.” The wholesaler will then say,
“Actually, I don’t have them.” The pharmacist will
then have to phone the supplier to ask for two prescriptions, and if
the pharmacist cannot get the prescriptions from the supplier, they
have to go into the secondary market to buy from another pharmacist who
is keeping the prescriptions in stock. The other pharmacist, completely
understandably, takes a margin on selling the drug to the pharmacist
who requires the
prescription<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T09:44:08"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T09:44:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112073000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112073000027"><Member ContinuationText="Oliver Colvile" PimsId="5610" UID="13112073000128" xid="1110" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112073000128"><B>Oliver

problem is that pharmacists are completely at the mercy of the
demographic that they happen to serve. The averaging of pricing
operated by the PSNC means that if pharmacists happen to be selling a
particular pharmaceutical in their area because of a high incidence of
diabetes and are making a loss, and if they are not selling many drugs
on which they might otherwise make a profit that allowed them to break
even or make a small margin, they are immediately

for Copeland (Mr Reed), to take note of what happens when people try to
regulate a market to the degree that his party—not him, I am
sure; he is one of the more sensible members of his party—wishes
to on energy prices. Such regulation results in inflated prices across
the spectrum, as has happened in many instances in the drugs market in
the United Kingdom. Good customer service is not incentivised, and good
pharmacists are crying out to be rewarded for quality. Furthermore,
innovation and supply are

third area I will address before I give others an opportunity to
contribute is the essential problem at the heart of the debate. Of
course it is understandable that we have ended up with a regulated
system, because there is only one customer for most drugs. Indeed, if I
understand things correctly, 80% of prescription drugs are bought by
the NHS on behalf of people who are entitled to free prescriptions.
Because of the way in which we have set up our health service in this
country, it is impossible to extract the kind of value from the big
pharmaceutical companies that other countries are able to extract, as
there is only one purchaser. I do not know why in this country we have
not got to a position of questioning the business motives and ethics of
big pharmaceutical companies, as the United States has for many
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T09:48:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112073000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112073000035">I
should qualify all that by saying that, of course, within the
pharmaceutical sector there are the most fantastic companies that are
innovating, contributing upwards of £12 billion a year to the UK
economy and employing thousands of brilliant people across the country.
We should be proud of those companies, but it is surprising that we
have such an unquestioning attitude to those enormous interests, which
have a relationship with the NHS and general practitioners that could
be generously described as corporatist. That is unhealthy in driving
innovation, in encouraging responsibility and, most importantly, in
ensuring transparency. That is precisely why we get scandals such as
the one raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T09:49:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

will be committed against the interests of the taxpayer.</hs_Para>

hope, opened up the debate a little so that we can discuss some of the
issues. I do not have any prescriptions for how we might deal with
them, other than the general principle, which I hope the Opposition
will agree with, that liberalisation is generally a good thing. If we
deregulate this market—not the quality of the people dispensing
pharmaceuticals, but the commercial side of the market—to allow
pharmacists to offer more services more innovatively and more cheaply,
and if we encourage competition in NHS purchasing and price-setting, we
will do something on behalf of taxpayers and patients. I have put
forward a group of questions to open up the debate, and I am grateful
for the contributions that will follow

The hon. Gentleman mentioned the all-party group, and we had a session
on pharmacies easing the burden of emergency care. We had several
witnesses, one of whom—Paula Wilkinson—was the chief
pharmacist at Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group. She showed us a
publication that the CCG was sending round mid-Essex called “Why
wait to see your doctor or nurse? See your pharmacist first!” It
is part of the health care on the high street initiative that the CCG
is running, and she focused the majority of her comments on that
initiative, which she said nudged—that is very much
Government-speak—people towards using the pharmacy first.
Like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T09:56:47"></hs_TimeCode> another

serving patients with minor ailments.</hs_Para>

said—this is quite interesting, and I would be interested in the
Minister’s comments—that for people on low incomes,
prescriptions often provided a way of gaining free access to medicines
that are otherwise available over the counter without a prescription.
She said that meant that patients on low incomes were perversely
incentivised to attend their GP or an A and E service to get
prescriptions. She believed consideration should be given to providing
some free medicines without prescription to those on low incomes.
Clearly, if a patient has been on a medicine for a long time, that
would not be that challenging, and a professional such as a pharmacist
could extend the period without having to go through any rigmarole and
clogging up the rest of the system.</hs_Para>

hospital. We need to look at certain issues in primary care services

NHS expenditure goes on people with long-term conditions. This winter,
quite a lot of them are likely to end up going to A and E and clogging
up the system because they have, for whatever reason—they may be
forgetful as a result of other problems, such as dementia—not
adhered to their drugs regime at home. Managing such people in the

mentioned the question of medicines adherence. Under the
present general pharmacy contract, it is pharmacists’
duty—and they are paid for this—to take in unused
medicines. It is extraordinary that every year medicines costing
hundreds of millions of pounds are prescribed and then are unused, for
whatever reason. It is a difficult situation. The 2010 report by the
York health economics consortium and the school of pharmacy at the
university of London suggested that up to £500 million could be
generated in England in just five therapeutic areas—asthma,
diabetes, raised blood pressure, vascular disease and the care of
people with schizophrenia—if medicines were used optimally.
Those are all long-term conditions on which taxpayers’ money is
spent. The report rightly said that sub-optimal use of medicines and
waste undermine the £12 billion investment in medicines by the
NHS.</hs_Para>

patient’s medicines—prescribed and
non-prescribed—to promote adherence and to support the optimal
use of medicines; 2.8 million MURs were provided by community
pharmacies in England in 2012-13. Since 2011, pharmacies have offered a
new medicine service to provide additional support to patients who are
starting to take certain medicines for long-term conditions. An
evaluation of the effectiveness of the NMS is due soon, and more than
640,000 people starting to take new medicines have benefited. That is
adherence —making sure that people do as their
prescription sets out.</hs_Para>

York and London review, which is entitled “Evaluation of the

question in great depth, and clearly the problem will never be
eliminated altogether. Nevertheless it is clear that in this country
people sit and write out prescriptions and people take them away and
effectively put them on the shelf. The patient might use the medicine
for a couple of days. Perhaps they do not like the side-effects, and
indeed that is unavoidable on occasion. However, some medicines are
stored in bathroom cabinets, and when they are emptied the medicines
are taken back to the pharmacist or thrown away, which costs the nation
hundreds of millions of pounds. We must question whether some of those
medicines, given that they are not used, should be prescribed in the
first place. However, that is a wider issue for health professionals,

has been much debate in Parliament about changes in the Health and
Social Care Act 2012. The Minister was on the Committee that considered
the measure. Two things were writ large in that Act. First, we have now
put into statute the need to reduce health inequalities—but they
are not reducing. Everyone is living longer, but in terms of social
class things are still going downwards. Pharmacists could work on
reducing health inequalities in areas where there is known deprivation.
That should be a major aim. Secondly, the Minister will remember the
emphasis on population health. In view of the statistics that I have
read out, I think pharmacy has a major role to play in improving
population health.</hs_Para>

health problems were very bad 150 years ago, and they involved the
environment—bad housing, bad sanitation and bad water. The
public health issues that this century will suffer from will be to do
with individual lifestyles. I read out some statistics about smoking
cessation and pharmacies, and I believe that community pharmacists are
the gatekeepers to the national health service. Far more people visit
them than any other part of the NHS and they have a major role to play.
The sooner we alter the current mode of contact and move away from the
situation where pharmacists get the bulk of their money just churning
out prescriptions to one where they cover wider issues within
communities and look after the health of the population, the better we

return to the matter in hand, having run my own business, I can well
understand the pressures on businesses—the need to make profit

behind paying for what you get and that a good service needs to be paid
for. At the same time, however, from what I have read in the media and
the considerable background information to the debate today, the
scandal of double-invoicing and cashback to the detriment of the NHS
cannot ever be
accepted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112073000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112073000075">I

profits on drugs that cost ‘pennies’”;
“‘There’s a lot of flexibility over
prices’”; “Pharmacies and suppliers accused of
price rigging”, and last, but not least, “The NHS, the

provision of new cancer drugs, Alzheimer’s drugs or any number
of other new drugs that are not accessible on the NHS. How do I tell my
young constituent suffering from cancer that there is no funding for a
drug that has been proven in other countries to help when she is
reading about double-invoicing? Is the cost of her life so little for
the House that we can allow the practice to continue? I have asked

that people have and do not use; they sit until they go out of date and
are then dumped. In Northern Ireland, the Minister, the GP surgeries
and so on have taken steps to ensure that the prescription of drugs is
better controlled. Sometimes, people might run out of drugs, rather
than having extra in the cupboard, but such steps help and take away
wastage in the system. The right hon. Gentleman made that clear in his

done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:22:15"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
ways and means of good practice, to which I have referred on many
occasions. I say what we do in Northern Ireland with humility, but we

pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies need to make a profit, but that

Lane End in my constituency, a pharmacy opened alongside a dispensing

interests of somehow distributing profit fairly. The debate has brought

of the issues with a market system is that business men are
profit-maximising, which is both a problem and a benefit. The problem
is that business men do not like competition much, because that is what
drives down prices and therefore profit. That is the crux of the
matter. The purpose of the Government is not to entrench in law and
regulation the tendency of business men to seek rent—excess
income through capturing the state—but that is just what is
happening when competition is inhibited by restrictions placed on a
dispensing practice simply because a neighbour has opened a

All those behaviours cost the NHS money, but individuals will not be

in an era that is set to be defined by austerity, and public finances
are still in a parlous state. In society at large, not just in
Parliament and across the political spectrum, but at the school gate,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Dr Daniel
Poulter):</Member></B> We have had a wide-ranging debate today on
issues such as the deregulation and regulation of pharmacies, the local
provision of pharmaceutical services and the extension of the role of
pharmacists and what they do in our communities. Importantly, we have
also discussed pricing and behaviour that, if not fraudulent, is
certainly very irregular on behalf of some pharmacists and drugs
companies. I hope that I will have time to deal with all those issues,
but I will write in more detail to any Member here today who feels that
more points need to be answered.</hs_Para>

further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:49:28"></hs_TimeCode>, may I
say that it is a pleasure, as always, to serve under your chairmanship,
Dr McCrea? We took part in many sittings together when the Health and
Social Care Act 2012 was considered in Committee, and it is always a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I congratulate
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:43:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer), my constituency neighbour, on
securing today’s debate. It is important to recognise that our
NHS is not only about doctors and nurses, but about midwives,
physiotherapists, occupational therapists, heath care assistants and
all the other people who contribute to the health of the nation every
day, including pharmacists, who play an increasingly important role in
delivering high-quality local health care and who are embracing the
enhanced role that they have been offered under the 2012 Act. It is
right that we put on record our thanks for the work that pharmacists do
every day.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112075000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000019"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:43:48"></hs_TimeCode>The
right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron), in an excellent,
considered speech, made some very good points. In particular, he said
that community pharmacists are the face of our NHS in many communities.
He is absolutely right in saying that because, particularly in more
deprived areas of the country, pharmacists are often the first point of
call for advice—whether on simple details about medications or
for important primary health care advice. Pharmacists perform that role
every day. We should be grateful to them for what they do, and I put on
record my thanks for that work.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112075000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000020">It is
important to put on record that pharmacies are in robust health.
Although we debate deregulation and difficulties, we know that there
are more NHS community pharmacies than ever before—more than
11,400 in England—and they are offering health care, treatment
and healthy lifestyle advice and support throughout the country. They
dispensed more than 900 million prescription items last year, which is
up 53% from 10 years ago, and about 2 million prescriptions are handed
out every day 
<?notus-xml column=350?>by pharmacists. Therefore, we have an industry, as part of our NHS and
in its commercial activities and other work, that is in robust health
and is performing a valuable service for our NHS.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112075000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000021">Of course,
we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:46:29"></hs_TimeCode> could get
into the issues that the right hon. Gentleman rightly raised on the
appropriateness of prescribing medication. The chief medical officer
talked in some detail in a report about the need for GPs to look
sometimes at the appropriateness of the antibiotics that they prescribe
and about how we need to look at antimicrobial resistance in this
country. The right hon. Gentleman made his points very well, but I hope
that he will forgive the fact that I shall not address them directly in
today’s remarks. However, he was right to make them and the
chief medical officer certainly agrees with him, as do
I.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:46:07"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

with other points that have been made, but initially, I would like to
address the important points made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:46:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:46:31"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich. We rightly value the innovation and
the opportunities that pharmacists have to innovate and support their
local communities in different ways. Because they are centred in the
community, only pharmacists are able to use such methods. I had the
pleasure of attending the annual pharmacy awards and looking at some of
those ways. I saw pharmacies, embedded in local communities, making a
real difference in providing health and lifestyle advice and improving
the quality of care available to local patients.</hs_Para>

the same time, although we want to encourage and support
innovation—the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme, or the
PPRS, was recently renegotiated and enhanced to give pharmacists the
opportunity to innovate exactly as I have described—we also need
to recognise that we have a publicly funded national health service,
which is a point that has been made across the Chamber today, and we
are very proud of it. It is free at the point of need, and it is
important to ensure that the money that is given to the health service,
whether to pharmacies or to other parts of the NHS, is properly spent,
and there is also a role in ensuring that services are provided in a
safe and effective way. I shall come on to some of those points
later.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport (Oliver
Colvile) has been a consistently strong advocate for the role of
pharmacists, and he made his points very well today.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:47:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Strangford (Jim Shannon) also made a useful and powerful
contribution, which was picked up by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:48:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Copeland (Mr Reed) a few moments ago, about the importance of
ensuring that there is no fraud in the system and that pharmacists
always behave appropriately. I am sure that the majority of the time
pharmacists behave appropriately and make a very valuable contribution.
When there may be fraudulent behaviour, it is right to pick up on that
and investigate it. I will come back to that in a moment, because we
all want to see high value for money from our NHS and to make sure that
the money is spent on patients and not wasted. I think that that is
something that we all agree with and believe in across the
House.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112075000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000025"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>I
turn to the important issue of pricing. The vast majority of drugs that
are prescribed are covered by either the PPRS or are generics, where
competition helps to keep the price down. We recently introduced a
price for common specialists, but a small number of 
<?notus-xml column=351?>prescriptions, as has been mentioned in the debate, fall outside the
pricing mechanisms that are in place. We are working with the
Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee to find a better
mechanism to encourage pharmacists to seek lower prices.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112075000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000026">Where there
may be cases of fraud, it is right that we investigate them, and they
are investigated. NHS Protect exists to safeguard—to
protect—against fraud in the NHS. That has been a consistent
policy; it was followed by the previous Government, and it has been
followed by the current Government. The reason why we need services
such as NHS Protect is to ensure that if there is fraudulent
practice—in this case, potentially in the behaviour of a small
number of pharmacists in dealing with small, unique areas of
pricing—it is investigated properly. I will ensure that either I
or Earl Howe, who is the Minister responsible, writes to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:50:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Copeland to inform him of where we have got to with the
investigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:50:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000027">The
other point, which was made
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:50:19"></hs_TimeCode>by the hon.
Member for Strangford and is very important, is that we want to ensure
that money goes on patients. There is increasing demand for drugs. It
is very good that the NHS is continually innovating and developing more
treatments, better surgical techniques and improved drugs and
mechanisms. Of course, when drugs are used in the NHS, they need to be
evidence-based, but I hope that he will agree that it is good that we
have set up the cancer drugs fund, which has helped to increase the
speed at which people with cancer receive drugs. More than 30,000
people have benefited from the cancer drugs fund and received cancer
drugs. We should all be pleased about that and proud of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:51:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000028"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="13112075000088" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000088">Jim
Shannon:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that positive response.
I outlined in my contribution a couple of examples of people who did
not access the cancer drugs fund, but in my mind clearly should have
qualified. Is he prepared to look at that issue to satisfy those people
who need drugs urgently because of the time they have left on this
earth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:51:32"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000029"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Poulter" PimsId="5522" UID="13112075000089" xid="1024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000089">Dr
Poulter:</Member></B> On how drugs are accessed, one of the
problems—this was why the cancer drugs fund was set
up—was that some people, as the hon. Gentleman rightly outlined,
had been receiving drugs in other countries for many years, but we in
this country were a little slower to respond to some of those
innovations. But of course we need to ensure that, whatever fund we set
up for providing medications, those medications are shown to be
effective and there is an evidence base for them. However we do things,
there will always be new treatments on the horizon that we would like
to get through to people more quickly, and we need to ensure that those
treatments are always evidence-based. I think that we can be pleased
that the cancer drugs fund has made a significant difference by
providing treatments in a more effective and much quicker manner, but
if the hon. Gentleman would like to discus the matter further, I would
be very happy to see him and talk it through in more
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:52:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000030">I
think that it would be useful for me, picking up on the points raised
early in the debate, to outline the processes involved in opening a
pharmacy. Anyone can open a pharmacy anywhere, subject to the premises
being registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council, 
<?notus-xml column=352?>when the owner’s service model includes the sale or supply of
pharmacy medicines or prescription-only medicines against prescriptions
from that pharmacy. However, there are extra criteria for providing NHS
pharmaceutical services. Anyone wanting to provide NHS pharmaceutical
services is required to apply to the NHS to be included on a
pharmaceutical
list<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:53:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000031">Before
September 2012, there were control of entry requirements. The NHS
(Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005 determined whether a
pharmaceutical contractor could provide NHS pharmaceutical services. In
England, no new contractor could be entered on to a PCT
pharmaceutical list unless it was “necessary or
expedient” to secure the adequate provision of pharmaceutical
services locally. That was the control of entry test. If a new service
provider was judged neither necessary nor expedient, the NHS, or the
PCT in question, had to refuse the application. There were rights of
appeal to the family health services appeal unit, which is run by the
NHS Litigation Authority. That was available if there was a
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:54:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000032">Part
of the reason for the strict criteria relates to the pricing mechanism
and how pharmacists are paid, which I will come to later. Obviously,
the local health economy is an issue, and pharmacists are not paid just
for the number of prescriptions that they provide; they are also given
a baseline fee. When we have a publicly funded health service and we
need to ensure that need and demand are aligned, it is important that
we look at this in the round. I sympathise very strongly with the
points about the need to de-bureaucratise the NHS where
possible—those were good points well made—but we also
have to recognise that this is not just about arbitrary mapping; it is
about aligning need and demand for a service within the pricing
framework in place. That is not just about the number of prescriptions
that are provided; it is a much more complex mechanism. I will come to
those points
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jamie Reed" PimsId="4838" UID="13112075000090" xid="824" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000090">Mr

he is being typically generous. On pharmacy numbers, does he think that

Poulter:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that under the
previous Government, the Office of Fair Trading did a review and
recommended total deregulation of the pharmacy industry. That was in
2003. The previous Government put in place a strong package of reforms
to recognise that we need some degree of what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:55:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ipswich would call market forces but I would probably
refer to more as patient choice. We need to support patient choice as
much as we can, but within the context in which we have a publicly
funded service that needs to be regulated. It is a health care service;
it is treating and looking after patients. We need not only to secure
good value for the taxpayer, as part of how we fund that service, but
to ensure that there is independent regulation and some regulation by
Government as well. That is about ensuring that we have the
highest-quality services
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:56:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000035">Given
that I am running short of time, I will write to my hon. Friend or I

<?notus-xml column=353?>That is a pharmaceutical needs assessment. I am happy to talk through

is worth highlighting the fact that pharmacists and pharmacies play an
increasingly important role in our NHS. Many pharmacies now provide
additional services. They are contracted to do so outside those pricing
frameworks. That is done locally by clinical commissioning groups.
Health and wellbeing boards or local authorities can also contract
pharmacists to provide services. As my hon. Friend will be aware,
responsibility for public health—40% of that budget—has
now passed to local authorities. Given that public health
responsibility, there is a strong role for local authorities in
commissioning local health care services if they feel that that would
be in the interests of the local
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T10:57:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000037">Under
the Health and Social Care Act 2012, other providers of health care
services, outside the traditional framework of GP and community
services and secondary care, were given more of an opportunity to put
themselves forward and offer to provide valuable services. This is a
real opportunity for pharmacists to bring forward to CCGs what they do
and to make the case that they can provide many services in a way that
will be focused on primary prevention and that will save the local
health economy money but also deliver better care. The track record of
pharmacies and pharmacists is very good in delivering community
care—whether looking after people with diabetes or providing
simple services for other patient groups. Under the 2012 Act, there is
now a much greater opportunity for pharmacists to come forward and put
in offers, within an integrated health service, and make the case about
how they can provide services. They may be able to do that in a much
better way, as they are often embedded in their communities, than some
of the traditional mechanisms in the
NHS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000038">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T11:00:03"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that my hon. Friend will be reassured by the fact that the
legislation that we have put in place as a Government has given
pharmacists a much greater opportunity to contribute to their local
health economy, not just in economic terms and in terms of the economic
benefits that that will bring for pharmacists, but by delivering the
very good care that we know they can

well and secures good value for the taxpayer and for local patients,
but there are issues about certain items that pharmacists can
prescribe, and we do need to look into them. There is a role for NHS
Protect in doing that. We value the innovation that pharmacists provide
locally in delivering
better—higher-quality—patient-centred care, and the 2012
Act has put us in a better place to support local pharmacists in

subject for debate and have asked me to clarify the debate’s
purpose. I should make clear that that group does not include the
Minister, who has positioned himself as a driving influence on internet
governance. He has attended the past three meetings of the Internet
Governance Forum—an organisation that I will come to later in my
remarks—where his contributions have been valued greatly, so
demonstrating that the UK is a leading contributor to the development
and evolution of the internet. Nevertheless, it is worth explaining why
I have chosen this subject for debate and why it is so important to us
all.</hs_Para>

is a tool that crosses all spheres of life. It is hard to believe that
it is only 30 years old, and even younger to the mass population. At
the outset, it was a network used by academics to connect research and
academic institutions; now it is central to all personal and commercial
activities in our lives. It allows better communication, permits
transactions and can help to generate wealth and support freedom. It
has been central to the overturning of Governments in the interests of
democracy around the world, but has, sadly, facilitated the spread of
terrorism at the same time. We must always be aware that it can be used
for malevolent
purposes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000043">The
governance of such an instrument is obviously relevant to us all and
any changes to that are a matter for us all to comment on. Child
protection online has dominated the political agenda of late in the
United Kingdom and is an obvious example of why internet governance is
important and relevant to individuals, families and organisations. It
is not a techie thing: its implications are far reaching. Trust and
identity, security and cyber-security are just a few issues that show
why Governments and individuals need to be equally interested in
internet governance.</hs_Para>

internet’s roots in academia mean that its governance structure
has simply evolved, and that evolution has generally taken place in the
absence of Government interference, probably because it took
Governments some time to understand the internet’s potential. If
Governments had been more involved, the internet would have taken much
longer to develop and would be less free, less innovative and less
revolutionary—in every sense of the word. The freedom of the
internet has led to its innovation. If Governments had been in control,
we would not be where we are today and the world would, without
question, be a different place.</hs_Para>

the internet has developed according to what has been labelled a
multi-stakeholder agenda: the private sector, civil society, academic
groups, technical communities and the voluntary sector have all played
their part, as well as Governments, with all stakeholders contributing
on an equal footing. That situation gave rise to the Internet
Governance Forum—an annual conference that stemmed from the
United Nations world summit on the information society in 2005. Its
purpose is to bring together a wide range of individuals and
organisations to discuss internet governance issues. It 
<?notus-xml column=355?>recognises the need for partnership, consensus building and innovation
to respond to improvements in technology, together with the new
opportunities and challenges that those changes and improvements
bring.</hs_Para>

Governance Forum, or IGF, offers a neutral space. Although it does not
result in a negotiated outcome, the organisations that it gathers
together develop thinking that is implemented by the international
multi-stakeholder community. The IGF provides an excellent framework
for understanding internet issues, where difficult balances often need
to be maintained. The UK has been at the forefront of parliamentary
engagement with the issue, and MPs from around the world have played an
active role in shaping discussions over the years. I would encourage
continued participation.</hs_Para>

Governance Forum and draw Members’ attention to the relevant

pay tribute to Nominet’s role in the organisation itself. It
plays a full part in developing thinking about internet governance and
ensures that the UK’s interests are heard at the centre of the
decision-making process. It is also worth noting that the United
Kingdom Internet Governance Forum, or UK-IGF—the organisation
that develops thinking on internet governance here in the
UK—would not happen without Nominet’s support, so Nominet
plays a much bigger part than simply managing the .uk domain
registry.</hs_Para>

also takes a neutral position, allowing and encouraging all attendees
to contribute freely and to develop independent thinking. I had the
privilege of chairing this year’s meeting of the UK-IGF, which,
among others issues, highlighted child protection, youth engagement and
identity and trust. That event was central to the contributions made by
UK representatives at the IGF. Attending the past two IGF meetings has
given me an opportunity better to understand international influences
and cultures and how they form part of the internet governance
process.</hs_Para>

year’s IGF was markedly different to the meeting a year earlier.
Among the range of subjects under discussion, which included trust and
identity, cyber-security, human rights and protection of children
online, the structure and governance of the internet itself was
dominant. That is why I wanted to secure today’s debate, to
ensure that the issues that were considered there are on the record
here in Parliament.</hs_Para>

“The structure and governance of the internet,” I am
referring to the calls by some Governments and some nations to have a
greater say in how the internet is governed—perhaps, according
to their agenda, I should say managed. Before I explain the risks that
entails, it is worth commenting on the governance structure of the
internet as it stands. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, or ICANN, co-ordinates the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority, or IANA. IANA is the department of ICANN responsible for
co-ordinating some of the key elements that keep the internet running
smoothly. It allocates and maintains unique codes and numbering systems
that are used in the technical standards that drive the internet and
enable it to work. Although the internet is renowned for being 
<?notus-xml column=356?>a worldwide network that is free from central co-ordination, there is a
technical need for some key parts of the internet to be globally
co-ordinated; that co-ordination role is undertaken by IANA. ICANN
performs the IANA functions under a US Government contract—a
fact that is particularly
relevant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000052">It
is that relationship with the US Government that some organisations and
nations are concerned about and are seeking to change. The fallout from
the Edward Snowden revelations was a genuine concern to some at the
IGF, but it is being used by others as an opportunity to gain stronger
control of the internet. Some Governments are calling for changes to
the way in which the internet is governed, potentially risking the
freedoms that it has brought about, and using information shared by
Edward Snowden as the reason—or should I say as the
excuse?—to do so.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112075000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000053">I believe
that the internet must remain open with oversight that derives from the
joint action of international organisations, industry and civil
society, but I am concerned that other nations are calling for control
that could limit the internet’s contents and, as a result, its
potential for innovation, ingenuity and investment. Next April, the
Brazilian Government are hosting a summit to consider the issue. It is
not yet clear what the exact purpose of that summit is, but it is clear
that some nations see it a key step to increasing their power and
influence, and that of Governments in general, over the
internet.</hs_Para>

Governments are successful, that will raise serious issues for us all.
The great freedoms that have come from the internet as we know it may
well be under threat. To give credit to the Minister and to the Foreign
Office, the UK Government have already played a leading role in
promoting internet freedoms. I refer to the positive response that I
received from the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
my right hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid Kent (Hugh

role in preparation for the conference in Brazil and in discussions in
the United Nations, where some Governments seek to establish

system, including the all-important IANA function. Without careful and
accountable management of those critical operations, we put at risk the
integrity of the internet and its ability to evolve and expand. ICANN
must develop internationally, and it can only do so if we assure the
accountability of the organisation. An important part of that is to
ensure active, multi-stakeholder engagement in shaping the future
development of the organisation. The IGF, which is central to that,
must also evolve. It is the only UN-mandated forum that brings together
the experts who shape and develop the internet with the policy makers,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr
Edward Vaizey):</Member></B> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship this morning, Dr McCrea. I thank my hon. Friend the Member
for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns) for calling this important debate.
He said that it was a vital issue, but apparently it is not one on
which our colleagues feel well briefed. As I gazed round the room and
realised that we were alone, until my hon. Friend the Member for
Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies)—the one colleague who is
interested in the subject—joined us, I thought that that spoke
volumes about parliamentary participation. As we constantly tell our
constituents, however, our physical absence does not necessarily
indicate that we are not interested in an issue.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan has brought this matter to the
attention of the House with his absolutely superb speech. I am sure
that what  I am about to say will come out the wrong way, but I
could not have given a better speech myself. He articulated all the key
issues that surround the slightly esoteric question of internet
governance, and he illustrated why it is a vital issue for politicians
in this country and across the globe who value a free and open internet
and who recognise the astonishing benefits that the internet has
brought.</hs_Para>

begin such speeches by discussing the remarkable benefits that the
internet has brought, and it is a cliché and a truism to say
that over the past 20 years, it has begun to completely transform the
way in which we do business and communicate. It has brought the globe
closer together. It will drive economic growth, not only in this
country—one of the most tech-savvy and internet-engaged nations
in the world; the British consumer adapts well to new technology and
e-commerce is a significant part of our retail landscape—but,
perhaps more importantly, in the developed world. We all know 
<?notus-xml column=358?>how Africa has been able to leapfrog the fixed infrastructure found in
developed countries on to a mobile infrastructure, which has enabled
rural businesses in Africa in particular to trade and fundamentally
remodel the way in which they do business. Such rapid innovation makes
a massive difference to the developing world. Our message about a free
and open internet, which is often misinterpreted as being a
self-interested message on behalf of the west, is actually a message to
the world about how the current model for internet governance secures
the innovation that is transforming lives across the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000063">As
a result of that model, the internet is open,  global and
borderless; its technical standards are  open and developed by
consensus; and it is open to  new devices, applications and
services. There is no  centralised or overarching global
framework of top- down intergovernmental control or oversight.
The key stakeholders that have made the internet such a success
continue to have a voice: businesses, civil society, the technical
community and the academic institutions where the internet was born.
Governments can work with those stakeholders to share knowledge,
experience,  skills and best practice. Governments alone would
not have the expertise that other stakeholders can provide.</hs_Para>

collaboration, consensus and partnership-building, ensures that the
internet continues to be dynamic, innovative and robust. He rightly

Vaizey:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is completely correct. The rule of
law applies to the internet, and that which is illegal in the physical
world is illegal in the online world. That is why a zero-tolerance
policy towards child abuse images does not pose a threat to internet
freedom. Those images are vile and illegal, and we must do everything
in our power to remove them from the internet and catch those who
exchange them. That is why we have worked with internet service
providers to give parents the tools they need to protect their children
online, and we will continue to apply the law on pornography online as
well as offline. There are other issues: consumer protection,
intellectual property rights, data protection, legal and regulatory
frameworks and business models have had to adapt. They are all factors
in our approach to internet policies.</hs_Para>

are challenges and opportunities, such as the need to promote greater
multilingualism on the internet, so that more people around the world

developing world in expanding its capacity and internet 
<?notus-xml column=359?>infrastructure. That is why I am delighted that the Department for
International Development, for example, supports the Alliance for an
Affordable Internet in that area. The key point, which our approach to
child protection highlights, is that no one stakeholder or Government
acting alone can tackle the issues. Everyone needs to work together and
collaborate, which emphasises why we are supportive of the

my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan pointed out, there have
been calls from some countries for a fundamental change in the
international internet governance model. Some have called for
Governments to have direct oversight of the internet and for a new
intergovernmental organisation to create treaty-based rules. That
sounds perfectly sensible at first blush—a superficially easy
solution to some of the difficult challenges that we face with the
internet and internet governance. Our strong view is that that top-down
model would not work and would put the internet at risk for three
reasons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000068">First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T11:21:03"></hs_TimeCode>,
such formal institutional decision-making models would not be able to
keep pace with the rapid technological change that is characteristic of
the internet and the rapidly evolving needs and desires of internet
users. Such a model would act as a brake on innovation and stifle the
dynamism that has allowed the internet to deliver many benefits and
opportunities for economic growth and social welfare. Secondly, the
internet is an adaptive technology. It is not a single entity but a
network of networks with no centralised control. It is questionable
from a technical point of view how top-down control of the internet by
Governments would work. Finally, as I said in my opening remarks, the
internet is a tool that affects nearly all aspects of life. Any new
intergovernmental organisation would at best duplicate the mandates of
existing international organisations and at worst lead to significant
confusion.</hs_Para>

World Trade Organisation, the World Intellectual Property Organisation,
Interpol and many other international organisations have over recent
years expanded their capacity to deal with internet-related issues in
their areas of expertise. That seems to be a sensible way forward. We
do not support the establishment of a new intergovernmental body, but
that does not mean to say that we should resist all change. The
international internet governance model needs to be kept fit for
purpose, and as the internet develops, we must ensure that the existing
processes we support can adapt to keep pace with future opportunities.
Work is already under way in that
respect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112075000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112075000070">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T11:22:39"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend mentioned the IGF. I attended the past three forums. I
missed the first one when I was a Minister, but I have been to every
one since. The most recent took place last month. This debate is an
opportunity for me to play tribute to a number of players. The previous
Labour Minister with responsibility for telecoms, Alun Michael, now a
police and crime commissioner, helped to establish the IGF after the
world summit on the information society. I pay tribute to him as a
former Minister who maintained his interest and expertise in the area.
He kept the issue alive in Parliament as well as supporting the
creation of the UK-IGF. I echo the praise that my hon. Friend lavished
on Nominet,  the charity responsible for UK domain names, ably
led by Lesley Cowley. It does a fantastic job in showing that the
multi-stakeholder model is effective and that a 
<?notus-xml column=360?>private not-for-profit organisation can play a key role and respond to

changes or adaptations are needed. We look forward to seeing 
the results of that work next year. My hon. Friend  also

I have said, perhaps repeatedly, we are sceptical about greater control
of the internet by Governments or by an intergovernmental organisation.
We are committed to engaging in discussions about how we can ensure
that the current model remains fit for purpose. The tests we should
apply to any proposed change to the internet governance model must
ultimately be practical. Does it allow us to maintain the internet as
an open, robust and technically secure service? Does it help us to find
sustainable and consensus-based solutions to the challenges that we
face? Does it allow the internet to continue to develop and innovate
and offer social and economic benefits to more people around the world?
The internet has been a huge success and continues to transform all
aspects of our lives. We must work to maintain and strengthen the
multi-stakeholder model of internet governance that has sustained that
success and ensure that it is fit for purpose in the

Phillipson</B> (Houghton and Sunderland South) (Lab):</Member> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hood. I am grateful for
this opportunity to lead this afternoon’s debate on the cost of
child care—a growing concern to many Members across the House.
Perhaps I should start by declaring an interest as the proud mother of
a little girl. Like many Members, I have come to realise how difficult
it can be for families to find the right kind of child care place. I am
in the fortunate position of not having to make the same kinds of
financial decision about what works for my family. I am very lucky, but
I am conscious that many people face difficult
situations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000004">Once
again, it is the Labour party that is highlighting the cost of living
crisis. We are all too familiar with the challenges that our
constituents find in accessing affordable child care and the increasing
burden that they face. The failure to keep down the cost of child care
has put immense pressure on household budgets and directly contributed
to the cost of living crisis facing so many families across our
communities. That failure applies equally to pre-school provision and
provision for school-age
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000005">By
2015, families with children will have lost up to £7
billion a year of support. Right now, families with pre-school children
face a triple blow of spiralling child care costs, a reduction in
nursery places and a cut in financial assistance. Some of those
families are losing up to £1,500 a year due to tax credits
changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000006">Parents
often say that child care can really become a logistical
nightmare once children reach school age. Despite that, the previous
Labour Government’s programme to support school-age children has
been abandoned by the Department for Education, leaving many parents
struggling to juggle work and family life. The Minister will no doubt
claim that the Government are making progress; unfortunately, however,
creative number crunching cannot hide the fact that the
Government’s plans are failing to support the majority of
families. It has been left to Labour to respond to the current crisis,
with our proposals to extend child care for working parents of three
and four-year-olds and to introduce a legal guarantee for primary
schools to make child care available from 8 am to 6 pm.</hs_Para>

Labour Government understood the importance of the issue. The 1998
national child care strategy recognised for the first time that child
care was not just a private family matter, but one where Government had
a role to play in ensuring the affordability, availability and

during those 13 years of Labour
Governments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000008"><Member ContinuationText="Dr Thérèse Coffey" PimsId="5608" UID="13112079000099" xid="1185" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000099"><B>Dr

for their children. I will make the very point put to her during
yesterday’s debate: we need to make sure that child minders are
of the right quality and can provide the best possible care for

Phillipson:</Member></B> A significant body of evidence shows that
pre-school years are critical to a child’s development. Despite
that, pre-school child care is becoming inaccessible to an increasing
number of families. The cost of nursery places has risen by more than
30% since the last election—five times faster than the rise in
wages 
<?notus-xml column=363?>over the equivalent period. It now costs, on average, £107 a week
for a 25-hour nursery place. Parents working part time on average wages
now have to work from Monday to Thursday before they have paid off

costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000018">To
make matters worse, all this has happened while there have been 35,000
fewer child care places than in 2010. The fact is that for many
parents, especially single parents, there is no longer a viable choice.
With prices rising faster than wages, thousands of parents are being

opportunity to
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000019"><Member ContinuationText="Kate Green" PimsId="5566" UID="13112079000106" xid="1207" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000106"><B>Kate

concern. We want to support the poorest families to access child care,

harder.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000021">The
reality is that it is predominantly women who have been hardest hit by
the rising cost of child care. Female unemployment is at its highest
for a generation. According to the Office for National Statistics, more
than 1 million women in the UK are out of work—an increase of
82,000 since May 2010. Affordable child care gives women the
independence to make choices that are right for them and for their
families. Every woman who is forced out of the workplace suffers a
significant personal blow, while the rest of society loses her talent,
knowledge and
expertise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000022">As
we heard in yesterday’s debate on this issue, the
Government’s own social mobility and child poverty commission is
clear that, for many low-income parents, cost, rather than quality, was
the main factor in choosing child care. A recent survey by Asda showed
that child care costs prevent 70% of stay-at-home mums from
working.</hs_Para>

that the Minister will agree that, in economic terms, it is absurd to
lose the valuable contribution of women in the workplace. Higher
unemployment rates increase the benefits bill and reduce tax revenues,
while higher rates of women’s employment support stronger
economic
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000024">If
the economic recovery is to harness everyone’s potential, the
Government should ensure that work pays for all families. That is why
Labour is proposing targeted measures to bring down child care costs.
Our plan has two major components. First, child care for three and
four-year-olds will be extended from 15 to 25 hours per week
for working parents. That support will be made available both to
single-parent working households and two-parent households where both
parents work. Those plans will be fully funded through the bank
levy.</hs_Para>

financial year, the banks paid a staggering £2.7 billion less in
overall tax than they did in 2010, 
<?notus-xml column=364?>while over the last two years the Government’s bank levy has
raised £1.6 billion less than they said it would. I hope the
Minister agrees that, at a time when resources are tight and families
are under pressure, that cannot  be
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000027">The
second component of Labour’s plan will be a focus on the primary
school guarantee. Some 62% of parents with children of school age say
that they want to be able to combine working and family life. For that
to happen, they need to be able to access care before the school day
begins, after it ends and during holiday periods. Nearly 30% of those
who need such care were unable to find it. That is
unacceptable.</hs_Para>

the Minister’s own Department backs that up. In September 2011,
the Department published research highlighting that extended services
provision can have an important positive impact on children, families,
communities and schools themselves. Under the previous Government, 99%
of schools provided access to breakfast clubs and after-school clubs,
but more than a third of local authorities have reported that that has
been scaled back in their area in the past three years. That is why
Labour will legislate to guarantee that parents can access child care
from 8 am to 6 pm if they choose.</hs_Para>

cost of child care is only one part of the solution. We must also
consider how we can improve its availability and accessibility.
Evidence shows that families from lower-income backgrounds, including
in parts of my constituency, are among the least likely to use formal
child care. We need to help our constituents understand the support
that is available and how they can access it, along with the benefits
that can come from having a child in nursery or child care provision.
Furthermore, many parents in my local area work shifts, so child care
services must become much more flexible to meet their needs and the
circumstances of their
employment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000030">The
location of child care services is another important consideration. For
many people in my constituency, transport is a major problem, owing to

a little more on the issue. The aspirations set out by the hon.

critical. As she said in the answer that she kindly provided me, the
reason why so many child minders fell out of the system in the 13 years
of Labour Governments was quality. She is absolutely right; we need to
ensure that high quality—in fact, world-class
quality—child care is widely available.</hs_Para>

to affordability, there is no doubt that the cost of child care has
risen significantly. Some of that will have been due to supply and
demand; there is no question about that, where demand exceeds supply.
It is important to expand the number of child minders to help with
that.</hs_Para>

things that the Government are doing right is allowing schools to shed
some of the regulatory burden on the ability to provide a wider range
of child care opportunities on site. Labour suggests that legislation
is required to have a primary school guarantee, but I do not believe
that. What is important is that a school should not have to register
separately with Ofsted if it offers provision for under-four-year-olds
or that it should not need such tight planning when it wishes to
expand. The same should apply when existing nurseries of good and
outstanding quality wish to expand.</hs_Para>

changing things so that Ofsted-registered and good or outstanding
nurseries will start to receive funding directly, cutting out the
recycling of money through the local council. That is another good
measure to accelerate the needed provision of high quality child
care.</hs_Para>

thing—the Minister may talk at more length about some of
these—would be to streamline qualifications for early years,
instead of having a choice of about 400 potential qualifications. In
that way, parents could readily and easily check the quality rather
than have to do their own research. Having an accreditation with fewer
qualifications is a streamlining simplification that will help not only
providers of child care but parents to make an appropriate assessment
of what the right thing is.</hs_Para>

of child care, I think the Government accept that having some of the
most expensive child care in Europe—we are second highest behind
Switzerland —is not sustainable. We need to address that. Coming
from a Conservative tradition, I would try to do that not just by
constantly upping the subsidy, but by providing wider choice, which
will bring down cost. However, I commend the tax-free child care
scheme, which will be available to working
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000048">I
am sure that Government Members would be delighted if we could persuade
the Chancellor to bring that scheme forward by a year, but I accept the
fiscal constraints under which the Government operate. In any case, I
am pleased that the scheme will be forthcoming in April 2015. That is a
real positive for working mothers and
fathers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000049">Other
useful measures that the Government are introducing include shared
parental leave. I understand that our coalition partners are keen to
extend that even further; that is a debate for another time. I am
pleased that we are pressing forward with that important development,
and I am sure that Opposition Members welcome it too.</hs_Para>

why I do not think we need legislation to implement the primary school
guarantee is that we can just get on with the scheme if that is what
primary schools wish to do. We may require a statutory duty to force
that to happen, and we have to consider that, but I see leading schools
providing it already.</hs_Para>

that I made yesterday is key. Governing bodies should work with head
teachers and parents to ensure that the school day is not artificially
reduced simply to have as short a lunch time as legally possible, but
to ensure that time spent at school is available for extra-curricular
activities and to be mindful of the fact that parents are
working.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000052">On
Sure Start, we can have the back-and-forth. I have not had time since

widely, I appreciate councils’ concerns. Our own councils are
going through this challenge; it is not unique to councils in the
north-east, Trafford or wherever else. It is happening across the
country. However,  we need to be mindful that reducing support
to local councils is being made up for, in some part, by other
opportunities for councils to raise money. That may not be popular; it
is certainly not popular with one of my constituents, who complained

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:54:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Houghton and Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson), I
declare an interest. I have a four-year-old and a two-year-old. One is
still going through the nursery system and one has recently done so. As
well as declaring my interest, I also confess that before I had
children I did not appreciate the importance of this issue to families
or the costs or choices that people were forced into when trying to
organise and pay for child
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:55:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000067">Before
talking about costs, I want say something about the benefits. A
good-quality nursery education can be hugely beneficial for young
children. It can contribute enormously to their social confidence; it
gives them their first friendships outside the immediate family; it
helps them to learn the basic building blocks—colours, shapes
and numbers—and it improves their speech. It is hugely
beneficial<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:55:52"></hs_TimeCode>. It
enables them to be more confident, outgoing children. That is
important, because we should all agree that we want children to get a
good start in life.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:56:09"></hs_TimeCode> know that it
is in the early years, and the early months, of a child’s life
that the first inequality often sets in. Good-quality early years care
can be important in improving life chances and extending
opportunity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:56:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000068">In
a recent speech, the chair of Ofsted said that some children begin
school 18 to 19 months behind in their development, compared with other
children. Any society that cares about equality of opportunity or life
chances should be concerned by that stark statistic. This is about
cost, but it is also about quality and
opportunity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:56:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000069">We
cannot have a situation where some are effectively able to pull up the
drawbridge on children who do not get good life chances, and allow
these patterns of inequality to remain
unaddressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:57:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I
do not seek to blame the 
<?notus-xml column=369?>present Government for that pattern. Inequality of opportunity is
deep-seated and has existed for a long time. However, as my hon. Friend
said, things are getting harder, with the closure of Sure Start centres
and rising
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:57:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000070">Let
me turn to the costs and the choice faced by working families. We now
have decent maternity provision in the UK. We used to be pretty much at
the bottom of the European league. We are not at the top of the league,
but we are in a respectable mid-table position. Mothers are entitled to
52 weeks leave, of which they will be paid for 39 weeks, although only
the first six weeks is to be paid at the high rate of 90% of their
salary. After that, mothers are dependent on contractual provision,
which varies among employers. Fathers are now entitled to paternity
leave for the first time, which is a welcome change introduced by the
Government of whom I was a member. Before that, there was no
recognition at all in the system of the role that dads might play
around the time of birth or of the degree of support that they could
offer to new
mums.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000071">The
costs of child care really kick in when maternity leave comes to an end
and mums want to go back to work. In London, a full-time nursery place
can easily cost £1,300 to £1,400 a month. Let us pause
and think about that. That is £15,000 a year, cash up front.
There is a little bit of tax relief for this, but it is essentially
cash up front.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:58:53"></hs_TimeCode> people have
two children in nursery, which is not uncommon, the cost may fall a
little as the child turns two and three and the 15 free hours kick in,
but a family could easily be looking at a cash figure of £25,000
a year for two children in nursery. That means that someone with two
children would have to earn some £40,000, well above the
national full-time average salary, just to pay for child
care.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13112079000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000093">Outside<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:59:25"></hs_TimeCode>
London, the costs are lower, but still expensive. In my Wolverhampton
constituency, a full-time nursery place costs about £600 to
£700 a month or around £8,000 a
year.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T14:59:37"></hs_TimeCode> It has to
be remembered that that is £8,000 a year in a constituency where
full-time average salaries are just over £20,000 a year. Even
though child care is cheaper outside the capital, it is still a huge
proportion of a full-time salary. No wonder that mums, particularly
mums with two or more young children, are quickly forced into a choice
between working and looking after the children. It is sometimes dads,
but mostly it is mums who are taking longer parental leave and making
that
choice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:00:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_ParaIndent><hs_Para UID="13112079000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000072">Some
parents may want, and are able to afford, to stay at home, which is
their choice, but most families need two salaries to survive. Facing
such costs, mothers end up either working for very little—often
because they fear that years out of the labour market will make it
difficult for them to go back and that they will lose all sorts of
opportunities—or being forced to give up their job simply
because they cannot afford the child care. That is a huge waste of
talent and experience. If capable people who are willing to work cannot
do so because the costs of child care prove an insurmountable barrier,
we have to care and do something about it because the country is losing
out by forcing women into that
choice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000073">This
has gone on for far too long. I expect the Minister will stand up at
the end of our debate and extol the importance of the 15-hour offer for
three and 
<?notus-xml column=370?>four-year-olds and tell us how it has been extended to some
two-year-olds. The offer was introduced by the previous Labour
Government, and it makes a really big difference by giving important
help to parents. Even I, as a member of that Government, do not pretend
that the offer is the whole answer. The offer is often made in five
chunks of three hours, which does not allow someone in a part-time job
to rely solely on that child care; they still have to top up with other
paid-for hours. What we need is child care built around the working
day, which would be most valuable for working parents. The 15-hour
offer is valuable and important, but I do not pretend that it is the
full
answer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000074">I
am often struck by the comparison between how we fund early years and
how we fund higher education. The time spent by children in nursery and
by students doing a degree is pretty similar—typically three
years in both cases. The costs are now similar. A full-time nursery
place in Wolverhampton costs £8,000, and studying at university
costs a similar amount. The difference is that the further south
someone goes, even if they study at one of the best universities in the
country, the cost of a nursery place becomes higher than the cost of a
student place. For higher education students, there is a system of
subsidised loans, with repayment terms contingent on earnings and
forgiveness of the debt after a number of years if they do not earn
enough. No such help exists for working parents, who are paying
similar, and in some cases higher, costs. Working parents are expected
to meet all those costs up front. They get almost no help other than a
little bit of tax relief at the margins, which has a hugely damaging
effect on the labour market and our
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000075">There
is an urgent need for more affordable places and for the same amount of
national policy attention and energy to go into child care as has gone
into higher education over the years. The truth is that child care has
not received such attention and energy. When the costs of higher
education go up, we often see students marching on the street. I
confess that, when I was a student, I marched on the street for various
causes. If the parents of one, two and three-year-olds were not so busy
looking after their children and having to cope with the choices that
we are talking about today, they would be marching on the street
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112079000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0001.htm#13112079000076">Parents
need our help. They need the same amount of policy attention as has
gone into the costs at another point in young people’s lives.
That is the priority that we should give to child care. Children need a
good start in life, and parents need help. It is time that we made that
a much higher
priority.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_20_PT_1/EB2E53D9528AB3B79CDA5E16FD13EFEB5A68A6C5" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="20 November 2013">Wednesday

to face young parents with such false accounting, and I am confident
that the Minister agrees. It is not good enough to say, “Yes,
we’ll borrow more to fund it,” because that borrowing

Members have drawn on a number of aspects in explaining why this is
such an important debate, and we touched on a number of issues
yesterday. Child care is important for the children, because of the
pre-school support, confidence and education they get, which give them
the right start in life. I have visited child care facilities across a
range of areas in my constituency, and it is evident how vital that
pre-school support is in ensuring children reaching school age do not
start out disadvantaged compared with children from perhaps more
economically fortunate backgrounds. All children should have that
pre-school input, and the child care offer and the child care debate
are crucial to ensuring that we see that equality across the
board.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112084000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000005"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:16:00"></hs_TimeCode>Child
care is also crucial for women. I am therefore pleased we have such a
great showing of male MPs in the debate, as we did yesterday. That is
vital because this is increasingly an issue for fathers as well as
mothers, and rightly so. The Labour Government introduced a lot of
changes to ensure that we reach the goal of equality between men and
women and on child care responsibilities. Ultimately, we know that we
are not there yet, and child care is still very much an issue for
mothers and women generally.</hs_Para>

a result of child care responsibilities, women are unable to stay in
work, and they fall out of the workplace. Many choose not to work, and
that should be supported, but we are talking about child care, so it is
right to focus on those women who would like to stay in the workplace
but are unable to do so. I mentioned the figures from a survey that
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:17:08"></hs_TimeCode>Asda undertook,
and I find them startling. It should prompt any Government to action to
know that seven out of 10 mums say they cannot go back to work because

Many more women than

unemployment as a consequence. We have not seen a matching increase in

the issue is close to my hon. Friend’s heart, and he is
extremely passionate about having the case heard. On the other side of
the coin, a lot of women who would like to work have fallen out of the
workplace because child care costs are prohibitive. However, women have
also suffered pregnancy discrimination, sex discrimination or maternity
discrimination. One deeply concerning issue is the additional barriers
the Government have put in the way of women who want to seek redress
for such unfairness. I am surprised because members of the
Government—particularly female ones—should be deeply
concerned at additional barriers such as charges for going to a
tribunal being put up for women seeking redress for such
discrimination. I hope that the Government will listen and take that
seriously, because it is nothing short of a

Phillipson:</Member></B> Is my hon. Friend concerned, as I am, about
the fact that many families, in addition to dealing with the cost of
child care, are responsible for the care of older relatives? That
affects women in particular. They must try to combine looking after
elderly parents or other relatives, when there is pressure on social
care, with trying to make ends meet for their children. That is a great
pressure at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:20:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112084000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Catherine McKinnell" PimsId="5703" UID="13112084000169" xid="1212" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000169">Catherine
McKinnell:</Member></B> Women have suffered a triple whammy. Many have
suffered unemployment because of public service cuts. They are also
dealing with the reduction in the availability of child care, and
increasing costs because of increased demand. As well as that, they are
picking up the pieces where public services can no longer provide
support and must step back because of reductions in funding. It is
often women who step into the breach. They must juggle their ability to
provide family support of both kinds. Many women do that willingly,
happily and lovingly, but as a society we must question whether that is
the future we want, or whether we are taking a step back on equality by
pushing more and more women who want to stay in work and progress
economically back home and into caring roles. Women are still not equal
to men in economic
terms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:21:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112084000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000013">The

the Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell), is keen to stress the
fact that the cost of child care is not a soft issue, but a key issue
for the economy. It affects whether we get economic productivity or
waste the resources of women who would choose to work, but are
prevented from doing so or do not bring home enough money at the end of
the month. I know many women working all the hours they can, whose
earnings are taken up in child care costs to such an extent that they
ask every week, or sometimes every day, “Is this actually worth
it?” The cost of juggling caring responsibilities with work is a
challenge in itself, even without the challenge of bringing home very
little pay. Often there is a short-term crisis for a family for the
sake of a long-term economic benefit for the individual, the family and
the children. It is a key area and the Government should take it

appreciate the Minister’s point, but the Government promise a
roll-out of additional places for two-year-olds and I know for a fact
that many schools do not have the capacity to provide pre-schooling
places for three-year-olds at the moment, let alone for the
two-year-olds to whom the Government aspire to give places. It would
therefore seem logical for Sure Start to be among the places where
child care places are provided. That is why I question the Government
not only about the broader picture for Sure Start—including its
important early intervention work and the fact that it is available and
accessible for new mums and communities—but about the loss of
child care places when Sure Start centres

there seems to be no clarity on what “reasonable reach”
means. What journey by public transport might be deemed reasonable?
What are the reasonable changes a family would be expected to make? If
they were travelling with a pram or buggy, which presumably they would
be, given that young children are involved, is that reasonable? How
frequent must a bus service be to be deemed reasonable? How much should
it cost a young family to travel by public transport to a

some clarity on those issues, which would help to inform the debate

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden) has
already alluded. It is the thing that has affected me the most over the
past month. Ofsted has stated that five-year-olds from the least
affluent backgrounds are 19 months behind five-year-olds from the most
affluent backgrounds in development terms. That is a shocking
statistic, and it alone should be a call to arms for all of us to roll
up our sleeves and to put child care centre stage. The costs of child

address the issue. It is absolutely

have visited many nursery settings in my Scunthorpe constituency over
the past month, and I was struck by the vast variety and diversity of
those settings. As the Minister mentioned, many of them are nurseries
attached to schools, which provide a very important part of that
landscape. I visited Messingham farm nursery, which is a new business
in my constituency that meets the needs of a particular community and
does a fantastic job. As the name suggests, it is about not only child
care, but also using animal care to provide a particular experience for
young people. I also visited the Ark family centre, which is run in
partnership with the Baptist Church and delivers very good nursery
care. Finally, last week, I took advantage of what was laughingly
called a “mini-recess” to go to the Ashby Sure Start
children’s centre, which is a fantastic facility that was
created as a result of the previous Government’s Sure Start
initiative. It is transforming the lives of the children in an area of
my constituency where such a service is most
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:34:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112084000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000033">I
am always impressed by the quality, professionalism and commitment of
the people working with children in such settings and by the way in
which they divide up their time based on specific skill sets to address
the needs of children at different stages of development. At the Ashby
children’s centre last week, I was shown the files in which each
child’s progress is carefully measured. Interestingly, I was
told that schools are now more interested in receiving that information
and building on it. The transition to the next stage of education
should therefore be more secure, which was perhaps not the case a few
years ago. We can see how the investment in nursery education is making
a real
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:35:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

refer to the recent concerns of the Children’s Society about
tax-free child care replacing the employer-supported child care
vouchers. The Minister will hopefully take this opportunity to address
the society’s concerns, because it is clearly focused on
children’s well-being. Parents on universal credit will not be
eligible to receive tax-free child care. Instead, they will receive a
component of universal credit up to 85% of child care costs. Working
parents on the lowest incomes will receive help with up to 70% of
costs. It seems odd to me and to the Children’s Society that
working parents on the lowest incomes will get the lowest level of
support. If its concern is accurate, I hope the Minister will address
that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:36:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112084000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000035">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:36:51"></hs_TimeCode>
Children’s Society is also concerned that the complexity of
having two systems of child care support for working parents and issues
around the threshold may cause the same sort of difficulties that many
of us experienced in relation to the Child Support
Agency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:37:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:37:32"></hs_TimeCode> the
Government provide help with only 70% of child care costs to those on
the lowest incomes, can they still guarantee that every hour of work
will pay for those on universal credit if there is an increase in the
tax threshold? There may be an unforeseen consequence that we would all
want to avoid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:37:44"></hs_TimeCode>.
Children’s charities, including the Children’s Society,
have asked for 85% support for those on universal credit, and I hope

will end with some points of concern. The cost of nursery places has
risen by 30% since the last general election, which is five times
faster than pay. At the same time, the same families are seeing their
budgets squeezed by the rise in energy prices and transport costs and
by general inflation. The average bill for a part-time nursery place of
25 hours a week has gone up to £107, and parents working
part-time on average wages would have to work from Monday to Thursday
before they paid off their weekly child care costs.</hs_Para>

fewer Sure Start centres, with three being lost on average every week.
The Minister and I might disagree about the numbers, but I think we
agree that Sure Start centres have been closed and have had their
functions changed, which is clearly evidenced by what people across the
country tell us. There are 35,000 fewer child care places than at the

the record, the Labour party is proud of what we achieved on early

left government. There is no silver bullet or panacea to resolve such
difficult and complex issues. The point, however, is the direction of
travel, which under the Labour Government was positive and in the right
direction, but under this Government has turned back. Ensuring that we
have good, affordable and flexible child care is not only critical to
families and to closing some of those inequality gaps, but to the
economy as a whole, as we have heard from Members today. That is why we

Powell:</Member></B> I do not want to get into a stats war with the
Minister, but the point is that families up and down this country know
that it is getting harder and harder to find childminders and quality
early-years provision. As the Minister knows, there is also massively
increased demand: the birth rate has been rising by more than 125,000

therefore facing significantly increased demand as

hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine
McKinnell) rightly asked the Minister about the figures. The Department
for Education’s own press release from June 2010 stated that
there were 3,621 Sure Start centres; recently, the Directgov website
showed that there were only 3,053. That is where our figures come
from—they are the Minister’s own
figures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:45:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The
point being made today, however, is that the issue is not only about
the numbers, but about the services being offered, because many Sure

do not want to confuse matters, because there are two separate issues:
Sure Start centres and their provision for early-years intervention
work; and Sure Start and child care provision. The Policy Exchange
paper showed that, in the poorest areas, child care provision is of the
poorest quality—that is why the Sure Start provision of child
care is of particular importance. It has focused on some of the most
deprived areas, where child care quality is at its worst. That is where
it is most needed. We still need Sure Start centres that are able to
provide child
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:46:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112084000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000052">On
the model more broadly, the early intervention grant, which provides
the funding for children centres, will be halved between 2010 and 2015,
going from £3 billion a year to £1.5 billion a
year. That is what is having such an impact on the services that Sure
Start centres are able to provide to new mums. Those centres play a

asked a further question about the Sure Start model yesterday, which I
hope the Minister can answer today. It was about another critical

child care and the more they earn, the more they will benefit. It will
do absolutely nothing about cost. In fact, there is evidence to suggest
that the scheme—putting so much into the system on the demand

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education (Elizabeth
Truss):</Member></B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Houghton and
Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson) on securing today’s
debate. I associate myself very much with the comments made by all
parents here today; I am the proud mother of two daughters. We need
more parents representing people in the House. I am a great supporter
of the changes that we have made to parliamentary hours, but we could
do more to make the House of Commons a parent-friendly place. It is
important to have representatives who are also mothers or
fathers.</hs_Para>

that I cannot agree, however, with the hon. Lady’s analysis of
the Government’s policies or indeed of the previous
Government’s record. As my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich
North (Chloe Smith) pointed out, that Government left the biggest
budget deficit of any major economy, and as a result we were borrowing
£1 for every £4 that we spent. In those circumstances,
the support that the Government have given to parents and families is
excellent. We have increased total spending on child care and
early-years education: it was almost £5 billion but will be over
£6 billion. We have increased the number of hours of
free early-years education for three and four-year-olds from 12.5 hours
to 15 hours a week, which is worth £400 per child for parents.
We have extended support to two-year-olds, and tax-free child care,
available from 2015, will be worth up to £1,200 per child. That
provision is flexible between the ages of nought and five so parents
can spend the allowance in the way that they see fit. We are providing
support to families in tough times.</hs_Para>

comment briefly on the claims made about child care places. There is a
genuine issue here, and we need to be clear about the figures. There
are two different registers upon which child care places are based
under 
<?notus-xml column=382?>Ofsted. The most accurate figures can be found in the Department for
Education early-years providers survey from 2011—that is the
most recent of those surveys, which are biennial. I am concerned that
the Opposition’s figures do not include the 800,000 places in
school nurseries. In places such as London, about 50% of all places are
based in schools. As Baroness Morgan, an Opposition peer, has pointed
out, school provision gives a strong basis for future progression and
avoids some of the issues with transition that Opposition Members have
raised. I would like to point out that our survey shows that over
200,000 places are available across the country. It is wrong to say
that there is a shortage of places. Of course, I agree that we need to
do more work on supply and
quality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112084000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Catherine McKinnell" PimsId="5703" UID="13112084000184" xid="1212" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000184">Catherine

that costs have risen by 30% since the Government took office. The
study that was mentioned also suggested that costs had risen by 50%
under the previous Labour Government. Child care costs have been rising
year on year, but other recent studies suggest that those costs are now
stabilising and have been flat in real terms for the past two years.
Across the political spectrum, we need to analyse why we put the same
amount of money into our child care system as countries such as France
and Germany but parents in those countries pay a lot less—they
pay about half the costs that parents here pay. It is not just about
the money that the Government are putting in; it is about the
efficiency of provision, competition in the child care market and how
that market works. I have spent a lot of time thinking about that as a
Minister, and some of my plans are aimed at addressing those specific
issues.</hs_Para>

that after-school clubs have declined. In fact, our most recent study

extended schools policy that Labour had before the election was that
schools could simply put a link to a child care provider on their
website, or something like that, and that would count as providing an
extended school place; the school had ticked the box, but there was not
really any all-day provision. We are working on

making it easier for schools to collaborate with outside providers, so

that, for example, the Harris academy chain has agreed that all its new
primary schools will have a school day of 8 am to 6 pm. We need to make
provision in a sustainable way that enables schools to mix and match
with their school day, so that children have extra learning and extra
opportunities for creativity, sports and after-school activities. We

approach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112084000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000070">A

in that area. That is why we have developed the early-years educator
qualification and are offering bursaries this year for early-years
educators—that is, young people with good qualifications who
wish to enter the professions of child care and early-years education.
We have also matched the entry requirements for early-years teachers to
those for teachers. This year we have seen an increase of 25% in

starting in January, the Oasis academy in Hadley is offering 40 places
for two-year-olds with a Teach First early-years teacher. Exciting
things are happening in schools to get highly qualified people working
with our youngest children. Of course, that is being done in an
age-appropriate way; when I visited the class of two-year-olds based
there already, they were having their feet painted then running around,

will be able to do that. The hon. Lady will be interested to hear that

conversion therapy is a simplistic one between allowing people freely
to choose conversion therapy and infringing people’s personal

real and present danger in Britain, and that instead of being a problem
just among religious fundamentalists, it is an issue for the national
health service and the professional sector. This is not a simplistic
debate about freedom to choose. If lesbian, gay, bisexual and

therapy used to be a much greater and more systemic problem in Britain
than it is today. In the 1950s and ’60s, LGBT patients were
routinely forwarded by teachers, GPs and, as in the case of Alan
Turing, criminal courts to NHS so-called specialists in sexual
orientation treatment. During that period, all branches of psychology
from the cognitive to the behavioural and the psychodynamic had their

watershed moment came when homosexuality was removed from the American
“Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders”
in 1973. However, simply changing the rules does not change an entire
system overnight. Conversion therapy persisted and psychotherapy
remains an unregulated profession in Britain. Anyone in the country can
set up as a psychotherapist without being part of a professional body,
and there are professionals practising in the NHS and therapy sectors
who received their training well before homosexuality ceased to be
classed a mental illness. Even the new intake of therapists is a cause
for concern.</hs_Para>

the problem of conversion therapy in Britain requires a range of
measures. In the therapeutic profession, affirmative therapy, which
begins from the premise that no efforts should be made to change
sexuality and that homosexuality is perfectly normal, should be

feel uneasy about their sexuality. To promote this therapy, we must

initiatives has the Department of Health supported from the Equality

hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Sandra Osborne) on

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:14:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

debate comes during an important week for the LGBT community. On
Monday, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the abolition of the
wretched section 28, and today is the annual transgender day of
remembrance, when we remember the thousands of transgender people
across the world who have paid the ultimate price, simply for seeking
to be themselves. Those men and women have lost their lives at the
hands of hate-filled zealots, because they had the courage to be who
they wanted to be.</hs_Para>

conversion therapy on people who are homosexual might not be on the
same level as physical attacks on a member of the LGBT community, but
it is certainly part of the wider problem of discrimination against
them. That said, the psychological harm that medical professionals have
recognised as a side effect of such attempts to change or tone down
sexuality could well lead to the same end result.</hs_Para>

absolutely clear: allowing the continuation of so-called therapists
offering gay cures is, first, saying that being gay is problem that
needs to be cured, and secondly, that it can be cured. Being gay is not
an affliction. The only higher power that I defer to on the matter is
the World Health Organisation, which has categorically confirmed that
fact. Being gay cannot be cured any more than any other aspect of
someone’s personality can be changed without doing that person
serious damage.</hs_Para>

from the Government is similarly clear. The action taken last year by
the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, and in 2010
by the UK Council for Psychotherapy, is welcome. However, they cannot
solve the problems themselves if the people they strike off their
registers can still legally continue to call themselves
therapists.</hs_Para>

system to ensure that counsellors and therapists are properly
accountable. A statutory register has been put forward in the past as a
solution to the problem, and in the absence of any better ideas, I
still think that that is the way to go.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:16:44"></hs_TimeCode>, I would
be grateful for any other solution that the Minister can put forward
that would have the same effect.</hs_Para>

such a system is set up, no doctor practising in this
country—and certainly no doctor paid by our NHS—should be
sending any of their patients to conversion therapy. Even if that
patient begs to be referred, doctors swear an oath to do no harm, not
to do whatever their patient asks them to do. We know that conversion
therapy is harmful and doctors should know that too. 
<?notus-xml column=390?>We also know that the majority of people who request conversion therapy

I find the practice utterly abhorrent and it has no place in a modern
society. That is my personal view, and many of the questions that have
been asked are questions that I have asked officials about the powers
that might be available. If hon. Members would welcome it, I would be
very happy to meet with all of them or a group of them to discuss the

Government have a proud record of supporting the rights of lesbian, gay
and bisexual people. Most recently, we witnessed and welcomed the
enactment of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Our support for
the legislation demonstrates absolutely our belief that extending the

loving and committed relationships and families in modern Britain come
in all shapes and sizes and should be
celebrated.</hs_Para>

Lamb:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention, and I
note her point. Being lesbian, gay or bisexual is not an
illness—it is sad that we need to state that, but it needs to be
stated. It is not an illness to be treated or cured. Way back in 1973,
the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its
diagnostic glossary of mental disorders. Thankfully, the international
classification of diseases produced by the World Health Organisation
eventually followed suit in 1992; there was quite a long delay before
that happened. Therefore, we are concerned about the issue of so-called
gay-to-straight conversion
therapy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112084000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000122">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:19:52"></hs_TimeCode>
Department of Health has received 15 or so letters in the past few
months about the issue. All but one of those letters have been
supportive of gay people and against the notion of gay-to-straight
conversion therapy. That surely reflects the fact that most people in
society today are far more relaxed and understanding about
people’s sexuality than they ever were in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:20:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112084000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112084000123">We

That paper makes clear our continuing view that, although statutory
regulation is sometimes necessary, it is not always the most

organisations must provide evidence to the PSA that they are well run

but the scheme does not endorse any particular therapy as effective and
it makes it clear that accreditation does not imply that it has done
so. However, organisations seeking to be accredited can set their own

with their sexuality, family arguments over their sexuality, or
hostility from other people. Supporting people through aspects of their
lives that are difficult or challenging is a large part of what

Baldwin</B> (West Worcestershire) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hood. I start by declaring that I
have an interest in the south Worcestershire development plan, because
I am fortunate enough to be a home owner in the beautiful Malvern Hills
district. On 24 October, in this Chamber, I discussed the matter with
the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my
hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick Boles), who has
responsibility for planning. There were some unanswered questions on
that occasion, and since then we have had an initial opinion from the
inspector, hence my request for today’s debate.</hs_Para>

in a much better place than it was under the top-down regional spatial
strategies of the previous Government. I fully support the need to
build new homes to meet the pent-up demand for property in south
Worcestershire, which has resulted in an average house sale price of
£224,500 in the past quarter—well above the national
average for affordability. I also appreciate the importance of house
building for jobs and growth in the construction industry, which is
only now recovering from the economic shocks inflicted on the country
by the previous Government.</hs_Para>

Worcestershire, our three local councils—Worcester city council,
Malvern Hills district council and Wychavon district council, which my
hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for planning visited
recently—have been working in partnership for seven years to
develop an ambitious and sound local plan for housing growth. After the
2010 election, and in light of the planned revocation of the west
midlands regional spatial strategy in the coalition agreement, they
immediately and presciently commissioned expert projections of local
population growth. In so doing, they perhaps got a head start on other
councils, and their evidence base is fresh and up to date.</hs_Para>

local councils democratically agreed the plan last December. Although
it caused much controversy at the time, one of the factors that
encouraged councillors to vote in favour of the plan was that it would
allow them to secure a plan-led system, which would provide certainty
on the amount and location of development until 2030. The plan was
submitted for examination in public on 28 May, and on 28 October the
inspector issued his interim thoughts about stage 1 of the
inspection.</hs_Para>

speculative development, which my hon. Friend the Member for Redditch

delivered as quickly as possible? It is an ambitious plan for growth,
but delay is destroying faith in local democracy because councils
appear to find speculative development, in places where it is not

exactly what tomorrow’s closing stock prices would be.
Particularly when there is opportunity for a revision during the plan
period, can we agree that in a time of constrained resources it is
inequitable to place such a high evidential and process bar on
councils, and that to do so is a disproportionate use of
resources?</hs_Para>

highlights the difficulties of economic forecasting, particularly
beyond 2021. He makes a range of helpful technical points about past
under-supply, affordable housing provision, windfall provision,
non-delivery allowances, phasing and buffers. He discusses bringing
empty housing back into use and whether C2 extra care provision should
count towards a council’s housing supply. On that point, the
provision of extra care to include C2 accommodation is a key priority
in our area, and we are keen to attract such development. If the
housing allocation in the plan were x thousand, and y% of the units
were for C2 extra care, will the Minister confirm that that would meet
housing need and would not be considered as double counting?</hs_Para>

this week, I learned that the three south Worcestershire councils have
published a timetable for the additional technical work requested,
which will take until the end of January 2014. The inspector has
decided “in the interests of natural justice”, as he puts
it, that further hearing sessions will be required and that the
earliest that they could start would be the week commencing March 10
2014. Only once the inspector has reached his conclusions on stage 1
will he be able to give details of the time scales for stage 2. It
sounds as though the process might easily run until the end of 2014.
Frankly, world war two took less time than getting through the
bureaucracy and red tape that surrounds the local plan.</hs_Para>

matters worse, all that bureaucracy and red tape is strangling housing
growth in the area. Because the plan has not been agreed, developers
are submitting speculative planning applications in areas that are not

come, first served basis, despite the potential of other, more
favourable sites to meet local housing need. That leads not to the
house building that we want to see, but to a long series of legal
disputes between developers and the council. When such appeals occur,
it appears to be for each planning inspector to decide how much weight
should be given to the emerging plan and how much to the old—we
thought defunct—regional spatial
strategy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112086000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112086000019">For

prohibited in open countryside. If a neighbourhood plan permits such
single homes inside settlement boundaries, will my farmer have any hope
that he can build his bungalow? Will individuals be able to get
planning permission to build a single home on land that they own

conclude, I have come to the view that the planning process still
remains extraordinarily baroque and subject to the whim of distant
bureaucrats with no stake in the locality. Planning lawyers surely rub
their hands in glee at all the legal fees involved. One local parish,
Powick, raised £10,000 for its own lawyer. How is that a good
use of family budgets? How does it help the economy? In balancing the
interests of tomorrow’s population with the interests of
today’s home owners and home builders, we are strangling growth
in south Worcestershire, preventing house building and stalling
construction in my constituency and elsewhere. I look forward to
hearing from the Minister about his and the Secretary of State’s
plans to unblock the Byzantine

the Member for West Worcestershire put her case. I have heard the
planning system described in many ways, but the use of the words
“baroque” and “Byzantine” in the same

I hope she will understand the dual constraint I am under: I am not the

planning policy places local plans at the heart of the planning system.
Those plans set out a vision and framework for the future development
of an area. The Government urge councils to get on with their local
plans: 51% have now adopted a local plan and 76% have reached at least
publication stage. As my hon. Friend acknowledged, that represents good
progress over the past three years. When the Government came to office,
only 17% of councils had an adopted plan that complied with the 2004
legislation, which is an extraordinary state of affairs. When I became
a Minister in the Department, I was surprised to find that in 2010, 83%
of local authorities had not adopted an up-to-date local plan, despite
the fact that six years had passed since the legislation. In the
general context of what she says, that fact might support the idea that
the planning system is both baroque and Byzantine to some of those

on the details of the plan in south 
<?notus-xml column=399?>Worcestershire or housing needs there in particular, because the plan is
currently before the Planning Inspectorate. The Government have removed
top-down targets for housing delivery. My hon. Friend mentioned the
west midlands regional spatial strategy. When I was an MP in the
previous Parliament—you may remember this, Mr
Hood—Westminster Hall was often full of west midlands MPs, in
the case of my hon. Friend, and west country MPs, in my case,
complaining about regional spatial strategies and how they had been
imposed by fiat from central Government. They were often resisted by
MPs of all political complexions. The fact that the coalition

significant problem that we must counter: we simply have not been

year for which figures are available, 2012-13, the number of first-time

should be given to emerging plans. Assessment of objectively assessed
need is not an exact science; the regional spatial strategy proved
that. It depends on a number of assumptions about future conditions, so
the examination of any local plan must test those assumptions.
Agreement on housing need involves difficult decisions, but such
decisions bring a security that the plan will steer development to
where people agree it should go. If need is underestimated, housing
shortages will be perpetuated for decades.</hs_Para>

thrust of what my hon. Friend was saying concerned the time taken to
put the south Worcestershire plan in place. Clearly, we all want plans
to be put in place as quickly as possible. However, the length of time
taken at an examination depends on many factors, including the
complexity of the issues and the level of objection. It is quicker in
the long run for the inspector to give the council an opportunity to
revisit evidence. The alternative is withdrawal from examination, which
will leave councils without a plan for a longer period.</hs_Para>

Friend asked some questions about what weight should be given to
emerging plans. I cannot comment on the individual cases and areas she
mentioned, but I can say that Government policy sets out the fact that
plans become more robust as they evolve through the plan-making
process. Decision makers, whether they are councils or inspectors, can
consider whether they should give weight to emerging policies in local
plans. That weight will increase as the plan
evolves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112086000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112086000045">We
need to strike the right balance. We cannot have a situation where
development decisions are put on hold whenever a plan is in
preparation. It would not be sensible to have some form of moratorium
on development during that period. It would not be advisable to give
draft plans the same weight as an adopted plan. Applying such weight to
a draft plan would allow councils to postpone examination, perhaps
indefinitely, leaving uncertainty for all concerned. Our draft planning
guidance sets out what we think is an appropriate way forward. It
establishes the exceptional circumstances under
which 
<?notus-xml column=401?>applications should be considered, but we need to consider carefully the
comments made on the draft guidance before reaching a final
view.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112086000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/halltext/131120h0002.htm#13112086000046">My
hon. Friend mentioned neighbourhood planning, and I am glad that she
said that she loves neighbourhood planning. Before I became a Minister

neighbourhood planning, a major reform introduced by the coalition
Government in the Localism Act 2011. There is a growing momentum behind

between the Department of Health and the General Practitioners’
Committee (GPC) of the BMA. From 1 April 2013, the role of
the Department in negotiating the contract transferred to NHS England,

continue to access appropriate GP services, as they move to more
equitable funding arrangements over the next seven
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13112087000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/petntext/131120p0001.htm#13112087000027">The

The National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) was introduced in April
2002, although some forces adopted NCRS practices before the standard
was formally introduced. Figures before and after that date are not
directly comparable. The introduction of NCRS led to a rise in
recording in 2002-03 and, particularly for violent crime, in the
following years as forces continued to improve compliance with the new
standard.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>2</Sup> Includes the

National Fraud Investigation Bureau (NFIB) assesses reports it receives
from Action Fraud and other organisations and makes a decision on
whether to disseminate crime packages to law enforcement agencies. It
is not an investigative body itself. In the King's Science Academy
case, the report was passed from Action Fraud to the NFIB for
assessment in the usual way. However, an administrative error led to
the report being categorised as an information report, rather than a
crime report, before it was sent to the NFIB for assessment. This error
lead to a delay in the report being disseminated to West Yorkshire
police who are currently undertaking an investigation.</hs_Para>
