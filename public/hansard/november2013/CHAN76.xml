set up a helpline on the benefit cap and an online calculator so that
they could work out some of the figures themselves. It then telephoned
some of the most vulnerable, and visited them as well. It set up
funding for intensive employment support and worked with local

abuse that has gone on for far too long, with people buying annuities
where they will get their money back only if they live until they are
90 or beyond. The Financial Conduct Authority, which was created only
about six months ago, has already reported on annuities and will bring
forward further proposals. We are working with our colleagues at the
Treasury who lead on these matters to make sure that this issue, which
has gone long unaddressed by successive Governments, is finally
tackled.</hs_Para>

number claiming rose by 10 times. More importantly, let me inform the
House of an international comparison. In the UK at the moment, some
60,000 or so are food bank users. In Germany, which has a much higher
level of welfare payment, 6 million people use food banks—one in
12, which is many more, and it is the same in Canada. The hon. Lady

Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague). We also
called for an end to early and forced marriage, and for greater freedom
of religion and belief. We committed to taking urgent and decisive
action against the illegal wildlife trade ahead of the conference in
London next year. And Britain successfully resisted an attempt to usher
Zimbabwe back into the Commonwealth without first addressing the deep

trade and for developing our links with the fastest growing parts of

after the summit in Sri Lanka, I continued to bang the drum for British
trade and investment. I went to New Delhi and Calcutta in India before
heading to Sri Lanka—the third time I have visited India as
Prime Minister. And I went from the summit to Abu Dhabi and Dubai,
where Airbus agreed new orders from Emirates and Etihad airlines that

Miliband</B> (Doncaster North) (Lab):</Member> I thank the Prime
Minister for his statement. Let me start by saying that all our
thoughts are with the people of the Philippines as they struggle to
deal with the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan. Thirteen million people
have been affected by the typhoon, over 4 million of them children;
nearly 3 million have lost their homes and, as the Prime Minister said,
thousands are believed to have lost their lives, including a number of
British citizens. The pictures we have seen are of terrible
devastation. As so often happens when disaster strikes anywhere in the
world, the British people have reacted by reaching deep into their
pockets: so far, £35 million has been donated by the British
public through the Disasters Emergency Committee. I also want to thank
our forces on HMS Daring and HMS Illustrious for the work they are
doing to help with disaster relief, and to commend the leadership of
the Prime Minister and the International Development Secretary in
providing £50 million in aid. We need to see the same from other
countries, as the UN appeal has only a quarter of the funds it needs.
Therefore, may I ask the Prime Minister what actions the Government are
taking to encourage other countries to commit and free up resources as
quickly as possible to the Philippines, so that this UN aid target is
met? Serious damage sustained to airports, seaports and roads continues
to present major logistical challenges for the emergency response, so
may I ask the Prime Minister what steps are being taken to ensure that
humanitarian relief is reaching those in very remote and isolated areas
who have been worst affected by the typhoon?</hs_Para>

Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting —CHOGM—we
welcome the communiqué’s conclusions on global threats

of course, on development. At its best, the Commonwealth summit gathers
together 53 countries seeking to promote common values, including
democracy, accountability, the rule of 
<?notus-xml column=962?>law and human rights. I believe that this House is united in our
abhorrence of terrorism and in recognising that what happened in Sri
Lanka, particularly towards the end of the conflict in 2009, when tens
of thousands of innocent civilians were murdered, totally fails the
test of those values.</hs_Para>

that reason that, at the 2009 Commonwealth summit, the last Labour
Government blocked the plan for Sri Lanka to host the summit in 2011.

are the words of the Foreign Secretary. Delaying the hosting of the
summit until 2013 was to allow time for the Sri Lankan Government to
show progress on human rights. This has not been the case; indeed,
things have got worse, not better. I say to the Prime Minister that
when he attended the summit in 2011, he could have acted precisely as
the Labour Government of 2009 had done and brought together a coalition

Prime Minister tell us: what were those consequences for the Sri Lankan
Government? Secondly, at the summit on Friday, the Prime Minister
called for the Sri Lankan Government, as he said, to initiate an
independent inquiry by March into allegations of war crimes. But by
Sunday, President Rajapaksa had already appeared to reject this. The UN
human rights commissioner called two years ago for an
internationally-led inquiry, and we have supported that call. Is not

after this summit the Sri Lankan President will be chair of the
Commonwealth for the next two years—that includes attending the
Commonwealth games. Did the Prime Minister have any discussions at the
summit with other countries about whether President Rajapaksa was an
appropriate person to play that role? Finally, the Prime Minister of
Canada and the Prime Minister of India decided not to attend this
summit. In explaining his decision, Prime Minister Harper

the good intentions of the Prime Minister, were not Prime Ministers
Harper and Singh right to believe that the attendance of Heads of

am also grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his response on Sri
Lanka and the Commonwealth, but it is worth recalling that, had we
listened to his advice, we would not be having this statement now in
the House and discussing this issue. Given that Labour agreed to this
conference taking place in Sri Lanka, criticising my attendance breaks
new records for opportunism and double-speak. Let me respond very
directly. In 2009, some time after the end of war, the last Government
agreed that the conference should take place in 2013 in Sri Lanka. If
he knows anything about foreign affairs—I doubt it, because he
barely gets out of Islington—he would know that this is a
consensus organisation: once something has been agreed, it is very
difficult to unblock it. So it was in 2009 that the pass was sold. I
have to say to him that, more than that, this shows very poor judgment.
This is a multilateral organisation of which we are a leading member
and our Queen is the head. How do we advance free trade if we are not
there? How do we stand up for issues such as tax, transparency,

Sri Lanka, the right hon. Gentleman specifically asked whether we
pressed for our agenda. Yes, we did, very directly, on the importance

an independent inquiry. Of course, some other leaders decided to stay
away, and everyone must take their own decision, but frankly,
no country on earth has a more direct relationship with the
Commonwealth than this one, and that is why it was right to go. If he
is concerned about the rights of Tamils, as I am, and reconciliation,
the right thing to do is to go and shine a spotlight on their plight.
You cannot do that sitting at home. I remember when his brother
said that we needed Foreign Secretaries and Prime Ministers who could
stop the traffic in Beijing. He will not even get out of Primrose Hill.

call for an inquiry into the terrible events in Sri Lanka would carry a
great deal more weight if he had not obstructed the report on the Iraq
war. The Chilcot inquiry demanded papers to reach a conclusion on why,
10 years ago, the House made a decision to join Bush’s war in
Iraq, with the loss of 179 British lives.</hs_Para>

important point. The Commonwealth brings quite different and disparate
countries together—some of the largest on earth, such as India,
but also some of the smallest and most fragile island states in the
world. It is a forum in which we can discuss issues, share
values and perspectives, but also, yes, talk about business and
trade, which is why there is a business angle to the events in which we
took part. We should use all those forums to push for our agenda of
free trade and trade facilitation, and there is an important meeting
coming up in Bali very soon.</hs_Para>

Jaffna, he saw the devastation and grief inflicted on the Tamil people
by President Rajapaksa. Is he aware that we continue to deport Tamil
people from this country to Sri Lanka, where they are tortured? Will he

of the best and latest information about whether someone genuinely
faces a risk of torture and persecution if they return. Of course, I
shone a light on some of the human rights abuses that are taking place,
but it is also right to point out that in Sri Lanka today warfare,
civil war, terrorism and violence of that kind are not taking place, so
we should be clear and welcome that. I thank the right hon. Gentleman

Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International
Development but the extension resourced through the armed forces, which
is most welcome. In relation to CHOGM, the

that is not adequate to meet the concerns and anxieties about alleged

point. I accept that the Sri Lankan Government have set up some

that I thought it unwise to go to Sri Lanka, but having heard the Prime
Minister’s statement and what he now plans to do I am changing
my mind—not a bad thing, possibly. As someone who has raised the
Tamil question many times in the past 20 years or so, may I urge him

stand and having given the issue the attention it deserves, we must now
make sure that we follow through, but we should do so on a basis of
huge optimism about the potential future of the country. If proper
efforts at reconciliation are made, there is no reason why that

who was very uncomfortable about the meeting happening in Sri Lanka in
the first place and very troubled by our participation endorsing
President Rajapaksa, may I, too, commend the Prime Minister for being
extremely robust and effective on the war crimes issue, and encourage
him down that road? Was he able to ask any questions about disappeared
people and about assassinations, and is there a chance that the

rights better than it has been

kind remarks and for what he said about my attendance at the summit. I
did raise the issue of the disappeared, and at the refugee centre in
the displaced persons village I met some people who told me about
relatives who had disappeared. The Minister of State, Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr
Swire), held a meeting with families of the disappeared, so the issue
was raised at every level in our engagement with the Sri Lankan
authorities. We must continue to raise these issues in the months and
years ahead. There is much to commend in the Commonwealth, but it is an
imperfect organisation. At its best it does stand up for values that we
all share and believe in, and the more it does so the better an
organisation it will be.</hs_Para>

that the tough and brave decision was that of those family members of
the disappeared who were willing to approach him? They are now at
serious risk for their lives, the lives of their families and the

bravery that was shown was by the displaced people who were prepared to
meet me and to speak out about their concerns. Bravery was shown by all
those who have lost relatives and who do not know where they are. Also,
it was incredible to meet journalists who have stood up for freedom of
the press and risked assassination, torture and persecution. In the
offices of the <I>Uthayan</I> newspaper are pictures around the walls
of journalists who died reporting facts and truth in Sri Lanka. We
should do everything we can, including through the high commission, to
make sure that nobody who spoke out or met me suffers in any way at
all. It is now very public who I met and where I went, and our
engagement with the Sri Lankan Government could not be clearer about
the importance not only of their safety, but of making sure that they

huge dangers for our planet. There is a strong case for saying that
there are connections between unusual weather events and the climate

I was able to raise the fact of the international climate fund, to
which Britain has made a significant contribution, and how it should be
helping these countries. The Commonwealth is a good place to make the

Friend says. At its best, the Commonwealth comes together and signs up
to important declarations, such as the Perth declaration on human

for in every case. We can point to the good places, such as Fiji,
excluded from the Commonwealth, given a path back to the Commonwealth
if the right things happen, but we can all point to examples where

the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister’s announcement

additional tools to invest in Wales to rejuvenate the Welsh economy,
which has languished behind the rest of the United Kingdom for far too
long. This package will make the Assembly and the Welsh Government more
accountable to the people they serve and place important taxation
levers in the hands of the Welsh Government, which, if used wisely, can
help to make Wales a more prosperous place. This is a
once-in-a-generation opportunity for Wales. I hope that the Welsh
Government will rise to the challenge and look beyond the M4 to invest
wisely and strategically across the whole of Wales. I will place a copy

for advance sight of his statement on this historic occasion. It is
almost a year since the Silk Commission produced its report and 16
years since the last time a Conservative Secretary of State for Wales
made a statement in this House—better late than never. Labour

to thank Paul Silk and his team for their work in producing the report.
That report and the Government’s response to it are of enormous
significance to the people of Wales—a part of the UK that has
been harder hit by this Tory Government than anywhere else. Welsh wages
have fallen faster and further than anywhere 
<?notus-xml column=985?>else in the UK, the Welsh budget has been cut by £1.7
billion by the current Tory Government, and we have seen energy and
other bills rise higher and faster than elsewhere. That is the reality

those cuts, the Welsh Government have sought borrowing powers and
agreed with the Silk recommendations that Wales should be able to
exercise those powers, as Scotland and Northern Ireland presently do.
We welcome the confirmation that Wales will in future have the capacity

of State clarify some of the many details that are left outstanding
after today’s
announcement?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311188000366" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#1311188000366">First,
will he clarify exactly when he expects that package of borrowing to be
in place for the initial tranche of investment in the M4 and other
roads? More importantly, will he tell us about the process by which
that level of borrowing will be agreed? The Government previously
indicated that the devolution of the minor taxes such as stamp duty and
landfill tax, which are being devolved today, would be sufficient to
trigger significant borrowing powers for the Welsh Government.
Today’s statement, however, seems to suggest that that borrowing
would now be contingent on income tax-varying powers being taken up in
Wales. Will the Secretary of State confirm whether that is the case and
say how much borrowing will be released once the minor taxes are
devolved? Will he further confirm whether a mechanism, a set of methods
and a formula similar to that used in Scotland under the Scotland Act
2012, which affords about £230 million of borrowing to Scotland,
would be the method employed in
Wales?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311188000367" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#1311188000367">We
welcome the devolution of the minor taxes—stamp duty and
landfill tax—as this gives the Welsh Government the capacity to
make some changes to the Welsh economy and to invest in order to grow
and create jobs. Prior to the introduction of these new Welsh
taxes, we would need to be very clear about whether the Welsh people
would be better or worse off. That is our primary concern, so will the
Secretary of State explain exactly how the process and methods will be
agreed and set for offsetting the block grant by the amount devolved to
Wales under the minor taxes?</hs_Para>

significant aspect of today’s announcement relates to income tax
and the proposal that the Government will legislate for a referendum in
which the Welsh people may be asked if they want a proportion of income
tax to be devolved to Wales. Our position on income tax is that we
support the proposal as laid out by Silk on the basis of a
“triple lock”, whereby we will judge whether the people
of Wales will be worse off, we will see through the referendum whether
the people of Wales want to take that responsibility and we will see
whether fair funding is agreed for Wales. That remains our
position today.</hs_Para>

significant that, in making today’s announcement, the Government
have rejected Silk’s proposal to devolve the income tax bands
independently of one another. Can the Secretary of State confirm why he
has rejected that recommendation? The Government’s written
statement suggests the reason is that the UK Government have discovered
an interest in the progressivity of the UK tax system and are
concerned that devolving those bands independently of one another might
reduce that progressivity. That is ironic from a Government who 
<?notus-xml column=986?>have cut taxes for the wealthiest people in Wales. Will the
right hon. Gentleman further confirm that the leader of the Welsh
Conservatives in Cardiff Bay has said that he would use the tax powers
only for the wealthiest by cutting only the 40% band, thus continuing
the anti-progressive policies being pursued in
Westminster?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311188000370" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#1311188000370">I
noted from the media today that the Secretary of State, in contrast,
would cut all the bands by 1%. He will know that that would result in a

which related to when the borrowing powers would be made available. I
am pleased to be able to tell him that, as was announced in my written
ministerial statement, the Welsh Government have already been given
assurances that they can negotiate with the Treasury for borrowing
powers in respect of the M4 and the north Wales expressway to take

devolution of income tax. I urge the Welsh Assembly Government to

the Wrexham industrial park in north Wales and the economic basis, or
the Environment Agency and the river catchment areas, there is an

explain to the House that new clause 1 expands on an amendment I tabled
in Committee— in the Public Bill Committee upstairs,
rather than in Committee of the whole House. The point of the new
clause is to afford the House an opportunity to consider whether some
of the work undertaken on the past in Northern Ireland could be
consolidated and could have its value advertised and added to by
creating the capacity for the Secretary of State to commission a report
or reports by a person or persons on various groups or
classes of cases, on events in a particular locality or period, or on
the activities of a particularly paramilitary group within a particular
period of time.</hs_Para>

that have already been produced—whether by the Historical
Enquiries Team, established 
<?notus-xml column=995?>inquiries or independent panels, or even by reviews

because at the minute we have a fairly inadequate arrangement whereby
if the HET reports on a case the report is given to the family
concerned and treated as though it is the property of the family. It is
published only if the family chooses to publish it and only in the
manner the family chooses.</hs_Para>

have been issues with some of the HET’s work, not least when it
has investigated what have been called “Army deaths”,
that situation has meant that although the HET has done some good work
over a number of years, which has been valuable to the families, many
families have not felt that they could discharge the burden of
publishing the work. Of course, other families have been able to
publish that work or to turn to the assistance of others to have it
published. In recent times, a powerful compilation examining different
HET reports has been produced by the Pat Finucane Centre, resulting in
a book called “Lethal Allies.” It draws on the HET
reports on a number of cases, on Ministry of Defence files and on other
papers in the national archive to set out more of the circumstances
behind a certain group of murders—the up to 120 murders
conducted by the Glenanne gang. That powerful book has been able to
draw on HET reports simply because those families gave the reports to
the Pat Finucane Centre and entrusted it with that work. That points
towards a wider gap in the provisions on the past, not least those that
the Secretary of State would preside over in the public interest and in
the name of the wider political process.</hs_Para>

Durkan:</Member></B> In no way could I claim to be speaking for a
majority of all the families whose cases have been investigated by the
HET, but I have met many of the families, and I appreciate the very
different experiences that they report to me. Some families are unhappy
about how the HET investigated their case, and what it was able, or not
able, to find; other people were particularly satisfied, and have taken
consolation and a sense of closure from what the HET has been able to
do for them. The point is that many families feel that there may be an
unequal process in relation to the past, and they are coming at that
from different points of view and experiences. The new clause tries to
ensure that our approach to the past, not least in terms of the HET, is
more holistic.</hs_Para>

Historical Enquiries Team has been seriously compromised by a report by
Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary that found that the
HET’s conduct of investigations of what are called “Army
deaths” was so unequal and off-standard as to be illegal. That
has put a serious question mark over the future of the
HET’s discharging of its investigative role. Many of us believe
that there is a need to replace the HET with a new body that is clearly
compliant with article 2 of the European convention on human rights,
and that if such a new body 
<?notus-xml column=996?>were created, the role relating to historical investigations that
attaches to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland could devolve to
that new body; we see the possibility of that article 2 compliant body
taking over both the HET’s role in investigating the past, and
the police ombudsman’s role in investigating complaints about
past police conduct. Whether or not that new body is created, there
needs to be an ability to draw on the good work already done by the HET
in a lot of cases—work that currently is not celebrated, or

speaking to the new clause. I have said that many of us believe that
the HET has been seriously injured, and that the viability of it
serving its purpose in future, and its reliability, have been
fundamentally wounded. I know that many people on the Northern Ireland
Policing Board have that view as well. As to whether the Chief
Constable has come to that view, we will have to see. The new clause
does not legislate for a new body; it simply allows us to ensure that
if a new body were created, that would not negate good work already

individual cases and events, but on evident lessons or patterns in
findings relating to different cases and events. Anne Cadwallader, on

and compelling points relating to the Glenanne gang and its work: the
connections between many different killings; the repeated use of
various weapons; the likely involvement of some people; and issues of
collusion and complicity in all that. That approach should be available

the House to vote to pre-empt—what may or may not come of the

past, as it was the main chamber of accountability for many years in
relation to Northern Ireland’s troubled past. It is not enough
for us to say that we do not want to address the

helped by what the HET has been able to do in their case. I believe,

an omnibus report in relation to all the events of Northern
Ireland’s burdened past. It is not one received version that
looks at all the tragedies and atrocities in Northern Ireland’s
troubled history. The new clause would create the ability or capacity
for the Secretary of State to commission reports on different classes,
groups or possible groups of crimes. Just as many people have found the
book, “Lethal Allies”, a compelling drawing together of a
number of different reports, plus other evidence relating to the work
of a network of loyalist activity over a period of six years, so there
could well be room to say that we need a report that draws together HET
and any other findings on the work of the IRA in a given area or over a
given period, or of the Irish National Liberation Army, or of loyalist
paramilitaries in other areas, so that people who were victims know
that their experiences were not isolated cases in which they were
victimised and bereaved but were part of a network or pattern at a
particular time. That narrative should be brought out and should be
available to people.</hs_Para>

of the HET to date: its work counts solely as the private property of
families, unless the families themselves choose to publish it. There is
no formality in this House, for instance, whereby the Government may
make an apology to a family on the back of an HET report.
The Government up till now have treated that apology as a private
matter, not a matter for the parliamentary record. An apology was duly
given by the Ministry of Defence after a family had shared with it an
HET report, but we had to go to the bother of an Adjournment debate,
which I called, to get that apology voiced on the record. That shows
that there is a problem in how HET reports are
treated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111827000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111827000029">This
is not just a point that we in the SDLP have come up with. Others have
addressed it as well. There are victims groups who say that this is one
of the deficiencies in relation to the HET. There is a question mark
not only over the quality of the HET’s work, but over what the
rest of us are doing with the HET’s work and whether the rest of
us are interested in it. In the Haass talks the parties are meant to be
addressing what is to be done about the past and what is being done,

been privileged to have a HET report shared with one by a family, one
has only to read it to see that it may be pointing less towards any
possible prosecution, than bringing out significant information about
the background events and circumstances. The first time that many
families found out that their loved ones were murdered by the same
weapons was when they read the HET reports that dealt with murders by
the Glenanne gang. No one ever told them that before. They were never
told that as a result of RUC investigations or any other revelations,
or comments or observations made by Ministers about the nature or
network of crimes or murders. None of that information was ever shared
with those families until they received it from the HET, and until the
Pat Finucane Centre literally brought them together as victims of the
same
weapons.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_18_PT_1/467A2D8471125367363D2774E8E6129C09E08D87" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="18 November 2013">Monday

of the issues at the moment with the HET—too much of this debate
is focusing purely on the HET—is that it is limited in that it
cannot make its reports public. Many of us assumed that that was a
statutory restriction on the HET, but it turns out that it is not. The
clause allows germane facts that can point to the wider pattern and
help to fill in the wider narrative in relation to forces, whether
paramilitary or anybody else, who carried out murders and series of
crimes. Where that wider narrative is brought out it would not be at
the expense of publishing any information that is in the HET report
that has previously been regarded as private, for whatever reason of
sensitivity. But the wider narrative lesson should be able to be drawn
out by a wider
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111825000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111825000039">Again,
I make the point that there has been a significant response to the book
“Lethal Allies”, including in Armagh and Tyrone. The
Glenanne gang carried out its nefarious sectarian murder campaign
against innocent Catholics. Remember that only one of the 120 whom it
killed had any link whatever with the provisional republican movement.
The people whom it killed were members of my party, the SDLP, people
who were in the Gaelic Athletic Association, people who had bought
property who were setting up in business. That is why they were
targeted. Those who were specifically targeted and shot in their
workplace or in their homes, as opposed to those who were more randomly
killed by bombs, were all people of the ilk that I have
described.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111825000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111825000040">It

Kingsmill massacre is not the only evidence that discounts the cosy
claim that has been made in the past for the IRA, and is still made to
date, even on behalf of Sinn Fein, that there was nothing sectarian
about the IRA campaign and that only loyalist paramilitaries carried
out campaigns with an eye to a sectarian agenda. That

draws on the findings of other bodies, not to set up a new
investigative mechanism or some new roving or roaming inquiry into
everything and anything. It would take the value and significance of
what has already been found by other competent inquiries and
investigations, so it would take what is already there in reports and
marshal it together to draw value, and not just for the victims, but

the de Silva report, in which people basically examine what is on the

in the UK, because, as we heard earlier in relation to the southern
Irish dimension, there could be significant records in the south. There

Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. However, both have put it on record
that they have not universally found that co-operation on the part of
every single person they have sought to interview.</hs_Para>

note that the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officers Association
recently issued its own qualifications in relation to its future
co-operation with the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, regarding
the latter’s report on a murder that happened in my constituency
in the late 1980s. I question the terms in which the retired police
officers have voiced their position. Indeed, the statement the
association has issued adds to the questions about that event and the
background to that murder. Two innocent civilians were allowed to die
when, after 10 o’clock mass, they went to inquire after a
neighbour they had not seen for some time, so there were questions
about whether he was at his flat. When they did so, purely out of their
good nature, they became the victims of a booby-trap bomb that was in
the block of flats, having been planted by the IRA, who are absolutely
the culprits in this—let nobody else say anything different. It
is clear from the police ombudsman’s report that the
police—the security forces—were aware that the bomb was
there. They made sure they did not go near it, but it was left and
civilians died. I regret that the retired police officers have chosen
this particular report on which to voice a strangely couched position
in relation to the police
ombudsman.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111825000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111825000052"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Dodds" PimsId="2983" UID="13111825000189" xid="171" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111825000189">Mr

that the retired police officers would say that one side of the story
is told but theirs is not always told in the same depth or to the same
extent in the circumstances of the time. Does he agree that
retired police officers who served in the RUC are in a uniquely
invidious position, because unlike others they do not have all the
legal back-up and wherewithal to support them, and many of them are
getting on in age, yet an onerous task has been put on them with all
these inquiries and so on? These issues need to be

it be the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains,
the HET or any successor body, the police ombudsman, or any other
inquiries or panels—and whatever their work is—this House

Government papers that have emerged from the archives, thanks to the
work of the Pat Finucane Centre and others. The annual report, with the
statement from the Secretary of State, could be a parliamentary point
of record for any apologies that have been issued by anybody in
Government, and not only the British Government. Any apology by any
public body or any Government in respect of findings or reports would
be recorded, rather than being left as though it is just a matter of
private correspondence between a victim’s family and a
Government Department, which is the Government’s current
position. The Government say that if they issue an apology on the back
of something in an HET report or anything else, they do not see it as
being up to them to record it or to acknowledge it in Parliament in any

receive them under the pretence that the IRA campaign was somehow a
clean campaign compared with the loyalist death squads, or under the
pretence that the IRA only targeted people in uniform in the heat of
battle or direct confrontation. The IRA killed many people by murdering
them down lonely lanes, by shooting them in the back, by shooting them
as they came out of their workplace and by shooting them as they came
from their place of worship. It would then say that there was nothing
sectarian in its campaign. Apparently, the loyalist campaign and
collusion by members of the security forces was sectarian, but the IRA
campaign was meant to be clean and sectarian-free. We know, and not
just from IRA victims, that that is simply not so, and we need to have
that spelled out in wider narrative accounts. New clause 3 aims to

preventing that. In the absence of anything wider, people are getting
away with their own gable wall histories. They are getting away with
their own pretences about the nefarious character of violence during
the troubles being attached to one side and not the other. Equally,
we still sometimes get the nonsense from some
spokes- persons within sections of Unionism that the loyalist 
<?notus-xml column=1005?>campaign existed only as a response to republican violence, and that it
needs to be understood in that context. As far as I am concerned, all
the violence was wrong. None of it could be justified, and none of it
could be justified by the violence or excesses of anybody else. What
the IRA did, did not justify what the loyalists did. What the
loyalists or security forces did, did not justify what the IRA did
either.</hs_Para>

localities, as under new clause 1—or through future annual
reports to this House. Such reports would provide an assurance that the
past is being dealt with by due standards and is receiving a due
response from those in Government and in other public bodies who should

piece of proposed legislation: the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill. It
attempted to set up an entirely secret tribunal whereby people could go

and immunity from anything in the past. Not only would the issuing of
certificates have been secret; the then Government proposed a clause
through which an added seal of secrecy could have been imposed by the
Secretary of State. The only person who could have gone to prison in
connection with any crime committed in the past would have been a
relative or a reporter who reported or alleged that somebody had
benefited from a certificate relating to their particular
victimisation. Potentially, only the victims, or people who were

There are a lot of ideas out there, many conflicting, in relation to
the past. There are many good ideas coming from many different sources,
which is one reason the Haass process is important—he will be
taking all of them on board. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will put
forward this idea as part of that process. It would be somewhat at odds
with the Haass process if we were to pass new clause 1 and new clause
3, because it would seem that the House was legislating in advance of
any agreement or full-scale negotiations. It is another contribution
and the proper way forward might be to feed it into the Haass process

other point, which has just been mentioned by the hon. Member for

“other new mechanisms” under subsection (3)(f) of new
clause 1 might include what comes out of Haass, a de Silva-type
review of archives or investigations in other jurisdictions. However,
if those are added to reports from the other bodies mentioned in
paragraphs (a) to (e), we would have a list of official investigations
that will inevitably and invariably result—this is one problem
of current investigations into the past—in a 
<?notus-xml column=1007?>preponderance of evidence coming out, issues arising or events being
investigated that involve members of the security forces. That is
because members of the security forces and the authorities keep
records, which are the means through which such matters can be
investigated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111825000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111825000075">In
that list of reports, I fail to see any real analysis or narrative that
would include any great in-depth investigation of any paramilitary
murders, whether loyalist or republican. That is just the reality of
all reports that we have seen up to now. It is one reason we hear
reasonable people on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland
say time and again, and I have a lot of sympathy with the view:
“All this concentration on the past is one-sided and is designed
to rewrite history, because all we see is a massive concentration on
the 10% of deaths”—every death is regrettable, so I make
no issue about the sorrow of the relatives of those
killed—“in which members of the security forces were
involved.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111825000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111825000076">That
fact has to be remembered. I want to put on the record the fact that
3,530 deaths are attributable to the troubles, euphemistically called,
that Northern Ireland went through. Even to state that figure brings
home to us the terrible tragedy and devastation inflicted on Northern
Ireland over the years: more than 3,500 deaths, with many hundreds of
deaths in some years. Some 297 of those deaths involved the
Army and low hundreds involved members of the police, but more than
1,700 were the responsibility of the Provisional IRA. We do
not, however, see a proportional concentration by the press and the
media or by investigations and anything else into that category of
deaths. There were also 500, 600 or 700 deaths at the hands of loyalist
paramilitaries, which is equally abhorrent and wrong. The vast majority
of deaths in Northern Ireland were the responsibility of illegal
paramilitary organisations. Where is the balance in the hon.
Gentleman’s proposal, and where will the concentration be that
can lead to closure for people who have suffered from the deaths that
occurred at the hands of the Provisional IRA and

wrong and that those who perpetrated it were wrong to do so and were

police inquiry was carried out by the RUC in which the families were
not really involved. They were never really asked for their opinions or
asked about what happened on that night. They were always searching for
the truth. There was a police ombudsman’s report into the police

they have been selective. Where was the Government’s apology to
the people of Teebane? People might say, “Well, the Government
didn’t let it happen”, but yes they did. Successive
Governments of this United Kingdom allowed the Provisional IRA to carry
out its atrocities. They could have stopped it on many occasions, but
what did they do? They wined and dined its members and took them into
the places of power, instead of bringing them to justice. If we are to
have apologies, therefore, I do not want selective apologies; I want
apologies to the families of La Mon, Teebane, Castlederg. I represented
that constituency when those people were killed, and I would take
Members to visit a little graveyard outside the town of
Castlederg— 30 mph speed limit—because
proportionally more members of the security forces lie there than in
any other part of this United Kingdom. But who really cares? They were
just members of the RUC and UDR along the border. They were just
ordinary families.</hs_Para>

it comes to the story of the tragedy of the 30 years of trouble in
Northern Ireland, I am certainly not willing to allow the
provos or the Shinners to rewrite the history. I would say this to the
hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan): remember, there is no excuse for
any paramilitary act or for taking the life of another person. Let us
remember that the Provisional IRA started a campaign of murder against
an innocent, law-abiding people. The only sin we were guilty of was
that we wanted to be British. We wanted 
<?notus-xml column=1013?>to remain a part of this United Kingdom, and the only good
thing—on which I will finish—is this. Thank God we won,
because we are still British and the Union flag is still
flying—I trust it will be brought back for every other building,

brilliant parliamentarians and very fine gentlemen indeed—would
often ask me to join them for supper. It was a spontaneous act of
kindness, which was the mark of the man. At Eddie McGrady’s
requiem mass in Downpatrick on Thursday, there really was standing room

in Westminster or Stormont, to remain silent in the face of such an

many communities are struggling with the corrosive cycle of poor
educational attainment, worklessness and inter-generational
deprivation. That is on top of a cost of living crisis in
which prices are rising and wages are falling.</hs_Para>

was bringing my remarks to a conclusion, but I will address the
specific point that the hon. Lady mentions. We will deal with the issue
in our response to Ambassador Haass, which the hon. Lady asked me to
put in the public domain; we shall do so in the next few days. My view
is that, on the whole and in many cases, the work of the Historical
Enquiries Team has been effective and has delivered some level of
justice to victims. I think we should applaud that and draw attention
to it at every opportunity. However, some serious and legitimate
concerns have been raised about elements of the HET’s work,
which must be seriously considered. There are also questions about the
criteria applied to the investigations, the independence of the HET,
its capacity to do its job, and the HET’s ability to carry out
its functions given the limited resources available to the
PSNI.</hs_Para>

therefore provides an important opportunity not only to review and
recognise the successes of the HET, but to reflect in the context of
any new framework that is developed on some of the weaknesses and to
try 
<?notus-xml column=1017?>to put them right. We need a balanced and a measured
approach to the HET. In speaking to victims, it has brought truth to a
number of them—there is no question about that—but we
know that independent evaluation has raised some serious and legitimate
concerns. In the role that Ambassador Haass is fulfilling in the
all-party talks, it is very important to get the balance right. Options
would include a reformed HET or a replacement body to build on the
successes of the HET, but there must be some structure to deliver truth
and justice for the victims of violence in Northern Ireland. We
need a balanced and sensible view of the HET’s
successes, reform of the HET and of any future replacement
body.</hs_Para>

Wilson:</Member></B> Despite the hurt they have experienced, many
people in Northern Ireland wish to put that hurt behind them. Often
without invitation from the people concerned, the HET reopened the
sores and the wounds. Indeed, rather than help the situation, it has
made it worse for those people. We need to give careful consideration
to simply saying that we need another body to replicate what the HET
did, without any reference to the wishes of the
victims.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111825000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111825000144"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Ivan Lewis" PimsId="1485" UID="13111825000234" xid="357" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111825000234">Mr
Lewis:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The first
and overriding principle in any discussion about truth and justice has
to be putting the victims centre stage. We know that victims have very
different needs and very different wants. Some victims make it clear
that they simply want truth. Others want justice, and others simply
want to get on with their lives. Any process must therefore
appropriately reflect the fact that we must start from the perspective
of the needs and wants of victims. It is incredibly difficult to get
that right, because there are such competing and different views of
what people want, but the overriding principle has to be the needs of
victims—not lumped together in a collective way, because the
needs of every individual victim, treated sensitively wherever
possible, must take centre stage.</hs_Para>

to victims, I still believe that there remain so many outstanding cases
for which we have neither truth nor justice, but if we were to close
down the process at this stage, we would not be doing right by the
families and relatives of the victims of violence in Northern Ireland.
The question is how to reconcile all those competing pressures and
extremely difficult challenges and come up with a system that enjoys
maximum support in all communities in Northern Ireland. I certainly
think there is a strong case for the importance of truth recovery,
which has been mentioned in the past, and there is still a lot of work
to be done around it. That, however, cannot be an alternative to
justice for many people. It is vital to get the balance
right.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13111825000161" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111825000161">7

Robathan:</Member></B> Let me first repeat an apology that I
am sure you have already received, Madam Deputy
Speaker, from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State, who is currently on ministerial duty in the United
States of America. Let me also echo the condolences
and sympathy that have been expressed for the family of Eddie McGrady.
I knew him a little, and took part in debates with him. I would say of
him, overall, that he was a particularly decent man. I may have
disagreed with him on various issues, but he certainly stood up for his
constituents, and stood up for what he believed in in Ireland. He was
both decent and courteous. I wish that we could say that about every
Member of Parliament, but I am not sure that people will.</hs_Para>

say that I deplore the petrol bomb attack on the constituency offices
of the hon. Member for Belfast East (Naomi Long), who represents the
Alliance party. As others have said, such acts have no place in the
democratic process. This was a very worrying incident, and I hope very
much that we shall not see more such incidents.</hs_Para>

take a great deal of interest in Northern Ireland affairs, but this is
the first time that I have spoken in a Northern Ireland debate for
eight years. I have been otherwise detained elsewhere—and I
think that that is more or less the right description. I believe that I
made my last speech about Northern Ireland during a debate on what the
hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) described in his opening speech as
one of the worst pieces of legislation ever brought before the House,
namely the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill. I dug out my speech the
other day, and I stand by every word of it. The Bill was indeed a
disgraceful piece of legislation, and—as a result of pressure
from all sides—it was rightly dropped by the last
Administration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111832000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111832000006">I
understand that the issues raised by new clauses 1 and 3 were
considered in Committee, and that the hon. Member for Foyle initiated
those discussions as well. I appreciate that his party would like more
to be done to address legacy issues, and I sympathise with that
to a large extent. Like him and, I think, all Members of
Parliament, we want to see a way forward that commands the support of
all parts of the community and all parties in Northern Ireland, but it
was not evident from the interventions on his speech that there was
support for this particular way forward.</hs_Para>

responsibility for dealing with legacy issues is now devolved, and it
is right for us to allow the local parties—which are, of course,
represented here—to work towards an agreement on dealing with
the past. I welcome the initiative that is being taken by the main
local political parties in Northern Ireland to address the issue of
dealing with the past through the all-party group chaired by Richard
Haass. We have heard a certain amount about that today, and I agree
with the hon. Member for Bury South (Mr Lewis) that we must not
pre-empt, or in any way undermine, what is being 
<?notus-xml column=1019?>done by Richard Haass. The Government support the efforts that are being
made, and hope that progress can be made. As a House and as a nation,
we should await the outcome of the talks, and Dr Haass’s

has been said about the Historical Enquiries Team. We should be clear
about the fact that its work and the work of the police ombudsman are
not the responsibilities of UK Ministers. Those bodies are accountable
to the devolved institutions, and a carefully negotiated framework

mechanisms for reporting on the work of the bodies that are the
responsibility of the devolved Administration; creating a further
mechanism is likely to incur unnecessary expense, and would also
duplicate the work of other
bodies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111832000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0002.htm#13111832000009">Let
me say in relation to new clause 3 that the Secretary of State already
reports to Parliament by way of parliamentary questions and the

this opportunity of acknowledging the warm tributes that have been paid
to Eddie McGrady, with whom I served in the House and whose election
campaign I managed in 1987, when he unseated Enoch Powell. He served
all his constituents, and indeed the wider community in Northern
Ireland, well, and he was clearly held in high honour. He was also a
man of much greater humour than his public persona may often have
allowed him to express, but he was absolutely dedicated to the sanctity
of life and the solidarity of community on a totally inclusive basis.
The parity of esteem of which he always spoke was something that he
himself clearly enjoyed across the political divide.</hs_Para>

relating to the petition is qualified in the agreement, but
unfortunately that was not reflected in the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
In the initial Bill, there was no reflection whatsoever of the true
provisions of paragraphs 11 to 13. When some of us pointed that out,
the Northern Ireland Office “scrambled in” a measure
stating that the Assembly’s Standing Orders should make
provision for the procedures outlined in those paragraphs, but
unfortunately the Standing Orders never did make that provision. They
ended up providing for a petition of concern which could be signed by

clause seeks to remind people that the Good Friday agreement said that
those issuing a petition of concern would have the opportunity to prove
they have a legitimate concern on grounds either of equality or human
rights and that those grounds would be tested by a special committee
that would be established in the Assembly to report on the matter. We
worked that out very painstakingly during the negotiations because
people were concerned that a petition of concern might simply become a
drive-by veto, as it were, on any issue going forward or even being
tabled, which could lead to gridlock with tit-for-tat vetoes and
petitions of concern. The then leader of the Alliance party, now Lord
Alderdice, spoke very strongly in the negotiations about his concern
that we should not have just an open-ended free-for-all system of
vetoes.</hs_Para>

having petitions of concern is rightly in the agreement, not least
because having protections around decision-making mechanisms was a key
part of the rules in the negotiations that led to the agreement, and,
therefore, if it was essential in the rules that led to the agreement,
it would be essential in the agreement itself. The particular model of
protections had to be carefully balanced and calibrated,
however.</hs_Para>

we came up with was that there could be a petition of concern, but it
would not of itself be a veto. Unfortunately, the system as it is now
practised does turn the petition of concern into a veto. That has meant
that many matters in Northern Ireland end up not progressing, and some
are not even tabled at the Executive or in the Assembly because the
veto is now also used as a predictive veto, to prevent issues being
tabled and to hold things up in discussion within the bowels of
government
somewhere.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111832000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111832000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Dodds" PimsId="2983" UID="13111832000091" xid="171" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111832000091">Mr

is an interpretation. As we had the agreement of his party, which was
the main nationalist party at the time, and the agreement of the Ulster
Unionist party, which was the main Unionist party at that time, and the
wholehearted agreement of the then Government led by Tony Blair and the
wholehearted support of the then Opposition in this House, how did this
major issue that the hon. Gentleman is so exercised about not get

legislation that became the Northern Ireland Act 1998,
someone—not least the hon. Gentleman himself—could have
prompted a Member of the House to say, “An amendment might be in

stress that when we pointed out that this was not provided for in the

stipulation that the Assembly Standing Orders would provide for that
procedure. That turned out not to be robust enough. The right hon.
Gentleman might say, “Well, did we not address that in Assembly
Standing Orders?” He will find that the record of the Assembly
shows, in the very first Standing Orders report, that I did address the
fact that it was not there. The then Presiding Officer, Lord Alderdice,
acknowledged my attention to detail, in so far as he could without
being drawn into the debate; that obviously went very much back to his

cynical interpretation of why those concerned neglected to deal with
this at that stage is that the UUP and the SDLP were then the largest
parties, and they were hoping that they might be able to use the veto?
Perhaps the reason for the concern now about the petition of concern is
that the SDLP is not in a position to use it—as was originally
intended, which is the reason why the legislation did not reflect what
he is now saying that he wants.</hs_Para>

Durkan:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman might have some basis for
saying that if there was any truth in it, which, of course, there is
not, not least because we deliberately set the petition of concern
threshold at 30 because at that time we thought there was no chance of
a party reaching the 30s. That was one of the reasons why the 30
threshold was there; there were concerns about how freely this could be
used and that it might block things up.</hs_Para>

the petition of concern to be significant was emphasised not just by
the threshold but by the special committee procedure to show whether
there was a prima facie case on either equality or human rights
grounds. The petition of concern was not to be used just for the
convenience of a party that wanted to stop 
<?notus-xml column=1023?>something. The fact is, however, that petitions of concern have been
used to veto Bills that addressed the question of dual mandates between
local government and the Assembly, which is a completely undue use. A
petition of concern was also used to veto any question of a binding or
significant vote in relation to censure of a Minister; it was
never meant to be used in that sort of way.</hs_Para>

petition of concern being used, or being threatened to be used, by
different parties prevents issues from being tabled. The whole point of
the petition of concern was not to stop things being tabled, but to
ensure that when they were tabled they were duly frisked and tested in
respect of sensitive considerations such as human rights and equality.
New clause 2 simply tries to get the Assembly out of the rut it is
currently in, where vetoes are used far too often in a way that not

seeks to ensure consistency with what was intended and envisaged in the
Good Friday agreement and in the provisions that became section 75 of
the Northern Ireland Act, which provides for equality duties and duties
of public bodies in respect of good relations. On a number of occasions
in recent years there has been a move to say that the good relations
duty could sometimes trump the equality duty, so that a public body
might not come through with a measure on equality grounds based
on objective need because somebody else might feel it would upset good
relations. We have seen that arise in relation to the Irish language,
and there have been suggestions of its arising in relation to the
provision and siting of social housing as well. The amendment seeks to

duty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111832000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111832000035"><B><Member ContinuationText="Naomi Long" PimsId="1550" UID="13111832000097" xid="1012" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111832000097">Naomi

the balance between the two, but in fact give one supremacy over the
other? The reality is that in a divided society where there are
competing rights and tensions in respect of those rights it is
essential to strike a balance. Instead of simply giving equality the
upper hand on all occasions, we must ensure that equality and good
relations are balanced in decision-making
processes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111832000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111832000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Durkan" PimsId="3056" UID="13111832000098" xid="916" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111832000098">Mark
Durkan:</Member></B> That is why the amendment seeks to translate into
Northern Ireland legislation something that the House legislated on for
Great Britain in the Equality Act 2010, by specifying the relationship
between good relations and equality based on objective need. We cannot
use the question of good relations to justify a decision that fails to
exercise an equality duty based on objective
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111832000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111832000037">When
we discussed this matter upstairs in the Bill Committee, I pointed out
that my proposal would not have the converse effect that a public body
could not introduce a measure with an eye to good relations unless it
also met the requirement of equality based on objective need. The new
clause would not, for example, prevent the sort of thing that happened
in my constituency in relation to the Fountain estate. There was
widespread support for creating a new school there, even though it
would not have fulfilled any of the criteria on the Department of
Education’s lists relating to qualifying for capital spending on
a new school. Similar issues 
<?notus-xml column=1024?>arose there over school transport. Because of the particular
circumstances of the estate and the community, however, and because of
the ambition to uphold the ethos of a shared city, it was agreed that
it should happen for reasons of good relations and community support,
even though the proposals did not fulfil any of the Department’s
investment criteria relating to need.</hs_Para>

clause would not prevent such a project from going ahead in the future.
It would, however, prevent someone from using concerns about good
relations or agitating to advertise tensions in relations as a way of
preventing a measure from going forward on the basis of equality based
on objective need, whether in relation to language or to any other
public programme or investment, such as in social housing.</hs_Para>

an excessive use of petitions of concern. I would need to look at all
the evidence and, as I have said, 40% of the petitions are put down by
nationalists. I do not subscribe to any gridlock being entirely down to
these petitions, but the new clause would add to the problems if it
were passed. Let us consider the example of welfare reform, which is
currently held up in the Assembly. The Minister’s predecessor,
the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), who has now moved
on, was in Northern Ireland the other day warning about the
consequences of welfare reform delays for the block grant. That has
nothing to do with petitions of concern; that is a political hold-up
because Sinn Fein will not grasp and deal with the issue, and it is
going to cost the entire Northern Ireland electorate, ratepayers and
taxpayers a lot of money if it does not. So I do not think that
petitions of concern are primarily the issue here.</hs_Para>

be at the root of the proposal by the hon. Member for Foyle is that
some kind of abuse is happening. He spoke about when petitions of

instance, the cross-community voting? He has not in any way sought to
amend that—indeed, no party has. If proposals were to be made

“Unionist”. Why was that done? It was done to ensure that
then deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, the hon.

had actually resigned. The proposal was introduced whereby the Assembly
had to accept the resignation for it to become valid. There was a total

conclusion, new clause 2 is a misconceived proposal, but I commend
amendment 3. It is a technical amendment saying that if we are giving
the power to the Northern Ireland Assembly to reduce the number of
Members of the Legislative Assembly—as we are proposing to do in
this Bill, because that is right and proper, and that should be a
matter for the Assembly—the Assembly should also have the power
to consider the number of people required for a petition of concern to
be valid. For it to remain at 30 would be completely wrong, as that
number was regarded as proportionate for 108 MLAs. If the
Assembly were reduced to 90 MLAs or fewer, as would be my
preference, it would clearly be right, proper and sensible to reduce
the number required to sign a petition of concern. Amendment 3 is a
technical and sensible amendment, and I hope the Government will take
it on board.</hs_Para>

Robathan:</Member></B> We are considering two issues of vital
importance to the political settlement in Northern Ireland that are
embodied in the Belfast agreement of 1998, a copy of which we have seen
on the other side of the Chamber. Petitions of concern are intended to
ensure that on sensitive issues, the views of both sides of the
community in Northern Ireland must be taken into account. That is
fundamental to the power-sharing arrangements that now exist in
Stormont. The requirement that 30 MLAs sign a petition was part of the
Belfast agreement and it has not been amended since that time. I
believe that petitions of concern have been used 61 times
since 1998, but there have been many more cases when the possibility of
such a petition being used has led to policies being rejected or
amended before reaching that stage.</hs_Para>

that has resulted in deadlock and important decisions being delayed. A
failure to take into account the views of both communities would be far
more damaging and could affect the stability of the settlement as a
whole. As has been made clear, not all parties are content with how
petitions are used at present, and I have some sympathy with
the points made by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) and
the right hon. Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds).</hs_Para>

concern in Northern Ireland about the way in which the petitions are
used, greater scrutiny of the impact of such decisions would seem
appropriate, but there is already provision in the Northern Ireland Act
1998 for scrutiny of the kind the hon. Member for Foyle has proposed.
The question is whether it would be appropriate for the UK Government
to dictate to the Northern Ireland Assembly that such scrutiny must
take place. I do not believe it appropriate for us so to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111832000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111832000072">Turning
to the amendment moved by the right hon. Gentleman, it is a valid
question whether the number of Members needed to trigger a petition of
concern should remain the same if the Assembly is reduced substantially
in size. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead
(Mike Penning) made clear in Committee, amending the threshold of
support required for a petition of concern would require
cross-community 
<?notus-xml column=1029?>support before the Government could back it. Cross-community support is
particularly important for this measure, which is a fundamental
building block of the 1998 agreement and is specifically intended to
protect minority interests. We have heard today of the different views
that exist on the use of petitions of concern, and let me be clear to
the House that no consensus currently exists on the matter. If such
consensus emerged—for example, from the review process under way
in the Northern Ireland Assembly—the Government would certainly
be ready to consider giving effect to the conclusions when a
legislative vehicle was assembled. However, I fear we are
not yet at that point.</hs_Para>

that in case anybody thinks that I have been economical with the truth

administrators in Northern Ireland were expected to make changes to
registration and application processes at a time when they were busy
with electoral preparations. It would also help to avoid public
confusion about voter entitlements. It remains the Government’s

rules in Northern Ireland to allow us to move into line with the rest

Ireland. Like in every other part of the UK, and, I suspect, in almost

interesting; we took evidence from all the political parties—not

I think that I am right in saying that there was unanimous agreement
that we should move towards greater transparency on donations. There
were some question marks about how quickly that should happen, and
about the security situation, but it was generally accepted that people
who stand for office in Northern Ireland, and those who sign nomination
papers, put up posters or go canvassing, take the same risks as people
who make donations to political parties in Northern Ireland; why would
they be any different? For me, that was the convincing
argument.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111834000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111834000042">As

towards greater transparency regarding donations in Northern Ireland.

Committee of the whole House, we voted for the proposal. The Government
have had consultations, and the measure has been brought forward
because it has widespread support in Northern Ireland, and so fulfils
one of the criteria for changes to which the Minister has alluded
previously. It is because there is cross-party consensus that the
amendment has been put forward, 
<?notus-xml column=1035?>and we welcome that move. We have absolutely
no difficulty with moving towards greater transparency from
1 January —mindful, of course, that as the Minister says, there
is no change to the fundamental point that the decision will be made
only when the security situation allows. If it is made, however, it can
be retrospective and apply back to 1
January.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111834000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111834000044">We

massive loophole that allows parties from outside the United Kingdom to

political party that operates and seeks votes in part of the United

the Government have not, so far, seen fit to close that loophole, which
should not be available to any party. When the decision was made to
bring in regulations and legislation on the funding of, and donations
and loans to, political parties, it was rightly decided that, in
principle and fact, parties should be able to receive donations only
from registered electors in the United Kingdom. That is a solid, sound
principle, but an exception has been made in relation to Northern
Ireland. Nationalist parties—primarily Sinn Fein—can
raise all this money outside the jurisdiction. That money is used to
influence the political and electoral process. It is a scandal, and it
is wrong, morally, politically and constitutionally. Something needs to
be done about it; a party has openly admitted, through records filed in
the United States, that it is using foreign money. One can imagine the
howls of outrage that there would be from other parties if a Unionist
party, or the Conservative, Labour or Social Democratic and Labour
parties, used foreign money that had been donated secretly to fund
their electoral campaigns, with no

that there would be from sanctimonious people in Sinn Fein about that,
yet we are talking about a party that is receiving individual sums of
up to $20,000. Documents filed with the US Department of
Justice indicate that a New York-based company called MarJam Supply
Company contributed $5,000. A Government employment equality agency in
the United States found that staff at that company were subjected to
racial abuse. Another company that gives money to Sinn Fein hit the
headlines after its former boss was sentenced to three years in jail
for embezzling pension 
<?notus-xml column=1036?>money. The former chairman of another company that donated $1,000 to
Sinn Fein pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bribery charges. How do we
know all that? It is because the US authorities require that
information to be registered in the United States—it is
no thanks to legislation passed in this
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111834000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111834000051">I
say to the Government that this is intolerable. It is a scandalous
abuse of the electoral system in Northern Ireland. No wonder the IRA
and Sinn Fein do not have to rob banks any more, when they can get that
sort of money flowing into their coffers from abroad, with no
accountability whatever. I urge the Government to listen, to take this
argument on board, and to create a level playing field for all the
other parties.</hs_Para>

an appeal made on behalf of the Democratic Unionist party. We will
fight our campaigns and get our votes; I am confident that we will do
well. The hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) said in an earlier debate
that he never foresaw any party in Northern Ireland getting more than
30 seats and being able to trigger a petition of concern. He did not
envisage it; I am sure that if he had envisaged it, the trigger figure
would have been higher. We have 38 Members. Things can happen in
Northern Ireland, and we will fight our battle. When it comes to
donations and loans, all that I am calling for is a level playing field
for everybody. The Government need to act on that. Frankly, it would be
a disgrace if, in this Parliament, a Government led by a
Conservative Prime Minister—and a Government comprised of right
hon. and hon. Gentleman who have sought to reform the parliamentary
system to create greater fairness and transparency—continued to
allow this outrageous situation to

Tellers if the amendment went to a Division. I also want to acknowledge
the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills), who put his name to the
amendment and took an active part in the discussion, as a conscientious

that the Government have found that there was consensus on the issue,
but it was a new, revised consensus, induced by the fact that we had
Divisions on the subject in Committee of the whole House. Clearly, very
different messages were being given before that, including in evidence
to the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. It is one of the
occasions on which debate in the House brought about change, not just
in Government thinking but in how parties responded and saw those
issues by understanding how they were regarded by others. The public
are vexed about the lack of transparency and the readiness of too many
parties constantly to use security considerations to deny scrutiny,

allow an active and positive interest by members of the wider Irish
diaspora and by democrats throughout the island of Ireland, but that
should never allow for any dubious corporate donations or anything
else. It is quite clear that the ambit of measures in relation to
donations to Northern Ireland has been cynically abused, and it does
not match funding that would be allowed elsewhere. Again, for the sake
of consistency, without transgressing any legitimate interest of the

many hon. Members have noted, this is not a Bill that makes radical

because I would describe it as a Bill for more normal times. In the
past, Northern Ireland Bills have made fundamental changes to
government in Northern Ireland, or have been introduced in response to
political crises. This Bill supports the development of the devolved

institutional departures, but on delivery—chiefly delivery by
the institutions in Northern Ireland, but with our support—on
reducing community division and on economic renewal. That is the

that approach. It clears the decks of a number of relatively small, but

son of Malachy McGrady, it occurred to me that possibly there was
somebody in Downpatrick who was not a McGrady, but I did not find them.
I was privileged to sit with Arlene Foster, who represented the DUP

legacy issue—the issue of dealing with the past. It overhangs
everything we do. All our deliberations must be seen in that context.
Just to listen to some of the names and some of the atrocities that the

democrats must stand up against attacks. Members of my party and of the

the fact that the election for the Northern Ireland Assembly has been
brought into line with those for Scotland and Wales. We now have an
equal situation for the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly

right to do that. There are the new arrangements for the Minister of

Monday afternoon in Down hospital. I worked for and with Eddie for many

man of considerable integrity, hard work, dedication and commitment to
all his constituents without fear or favour. He represented the true
hallmarks of what a Member of Parliament should be, at a time in
Northern Ireland when it was difficult to engage in that particular
role because of ongoing violence, ongoing deaths, ongoing threats and
the ongoing murder of many of his constituents, some of whom I have
already referred to in this debate. He condemned all of those
unequivocally, because he always believed that the principle of
democracy must 
<?notus-xml column=1043?>reign. He, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle and many other
party members, participated faithfully in the negotiations on the Good
Friday agreement, because we firmly believed that that was the pathway
and the direction of travel to the resolution of our conflict, bringing
about a final political settlement on the island of Ireland, espousing
the relationships between Unionists and nationalists in the north,

Bill, with its 29 clauses, is being debated at a time, as the Minister

simply reflects a movement in the democratic process in Northern
Ireland. We in the SDLP—my hon. Friends the Members for Foyle,
for Belfast South (Dr McDonnell) and me—would like to have
enhanced the Bill with the inclusion of clauses to deal with the past,
which is currently the subject of the Haass talks, bringing back the
whole issue of petitions of concern to what they were meant to be under
the Good Friday agreement of 1998, and the whole area of statutory
duties with regard to good relations. We welcome the greater level of

in a much fuller

Committee, I tabled amendments on the length of the Assembly mandate,
which has been referred to tonight by the hon. Member for North Down
(Lady Hermon). We believe that the extension of the Assembly term from
four to five years is undemocratic, because Members of the Northern
Ireland Assembly, who fought the election in May 2011, those Members
who were elected, and those people who voted for all candidates in that
election, did so for a four-year term, not a five-year term. I
understand the Government’s wish for synchronisation, so that
matters concur with what is happening in the Scottish Parliament and
the Welsh Assembly, but we in the SDLP are clear that that is a
disruption to the democratic process and to the principle of democracy.
On Second Reading, I referred to the mystery tour, and why that
decision had been taken. When the Secretary of State, the Northern
Ireland Affairs Committee and other organs of political activity in
Northern Ireland were supporting a four-year term, why was it

someone with integrity, and he served his whole community without fear

my personal condolences to her at what must be a very difficult time.
He was very highly thought of right across the community in Northern

to commend in the Bill. However, in line with the convention that we
should save the best until last, I will focus first on some of the
matters about which I am still discontent. As I stated earlier, I am
disappointed that donations were not addressed more fully at this stage
in the Bill’s progress, with regard to both moving towards full
transparency and addressing the issue the right hon. Member for Belfast
North (Mr Dodds) raised on overseas donors and the lack of
transparency. I think that the time has come for us to build on the
progress we have made in Northern Ireland and show confidence in that
progress, and I believe that in order to do that we must be courageous
in the decisions we make as politicians. Part of that has to be about
taking on responsibility for transparency and accountability and the
normal standards of public life that apply everywhere else. It would be
a huge step forward if progress could be made on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111837000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111837000024">I
am also disappointed that we have been unable to address as fully as I
had wished the issue of dual mandates between the Assembly and Seanad
Eireann and between the Assembly and the House of Lords. I have had
some success this evening, so I will chance my arm and ask for some
more. One of the reasons for not addressing the issue in relation to
Seanad Eireann in Committee of the whole House was that there was soon
to be a referendum on abolishing it. The referendum failed to abolish
the Seanad, so it is an ongoing concern that people can still be
Members of the Assembly and the Seanad. I ask the Government, in the
light of that development, to consider revisiting the matter when the
Bill moves to another place.</hs_Para>

welcome progress made in the Bill on four matters. First, I welcome the
progress in addressing the anomaly of the appointment of the Justice
Minister, which currently advantages my party but would advantage any
party that found itself in receipt of that post. It is unfair and, we
believe, unbalances the situation. That is something we have raised and
worked with other parties to find a solution to, so we are pleased to
see it resolved in the Bill.</hs_Para>

welcome the legislative footing for the end to dual mandates. It is a
matter on which a number of parties made commitments before the last
Westminster elections, but only now are we slowly beginning to see some
progress. I believe that the Bill’s passage through the House
has concentrated minds on the issue. I believe 
<?notus-xml column=1046?>that putting that on a legislative footing will ensure that
those commitments will be met by all the parties that made them, which
I welcome.</hs_Para>

welcome the regularising of the Assembly’s terms to avoid future
clashes with Westminster elections. I regret that that could not be
done before the last Assembly elections so that the public would have
known that they were electing an Assembly for a five-year term.
However, I think that on balance it is better that we regularise it
now, rather than having the kinds of ad hoc changes to Assembly dates
that we had previously, when people were never quite sure when Assembly
elections would take place. It almost appeared as though our elections
in Northern Ireland were not as valuable or important as elections to
other places. It is important that that has been regularised. It will
allow people to focus properly on Westminster issues for Westminster
elections and Assembly issues for Assembly
elections.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111837000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111837000028">I
also welcome the move to remove permanent anonymity for donors from
January. I want to put on the record my thanks to the hon. Member for
Amber Valley (Nigel Mills) for his support for the amendments we tabled
in Committee. He ensured that mine was not a lone voice on the matter
and that at least there would have been two of us to act as Tellers,
even if there was no one to count. I was pleased that he was willing to
do that and thank him for it.</hs_Para>

about those matters not just because they are ones on which I have
campaigned, but because I believe they mark an improvement in the
democratic process for the people of Northern Ireland and the people I
represent in east Belfast. Huge progress has been made in Northern
Ireland—Members have reflected on that this evening—but
we still have a long way to go in achieving the normality we wish to
see. Indeed, the events of recent days and weeks suggest that there are
still those, both loyalist and republican, who would seek to deflect us
from doing that. It is our duty as elected representatives to make
politics work, to aspire to the highest standards in public life and to
restore the relationship between us as elected representatives and
those we represent, to engender their trust and confidence and to
demonstrate that politics is the only way forward and that it is a
practical and effective way to make our views known and heard. I
believe that the Bill will move politics forward in Northern Ireland
and improve the working of the system there. I am pleased to be able to

large and significant one that has properly received a great deal of
scrutiny in this House and in the other place. Fundamentally,
it is vital for securing the United Kingdom’s energy future and
ensuring that the crucial investment in energy infrastructure that we
need over the next decade comes forward. That investment will be
incentivised by the provisions in the Bill to reform the electricity
market—the most significant reform since electricity
privatisation. The Bill contains a number of other important
provisions, including putting people on the cheapest tariff, tougher
consumer redress, tackling fuel poverty, and strengthening nuclear
regulation.</hs_Para>

available for consideration of the Energy Bill, and for his making it
clear that they still intend that it should receive Royal Assent by the
end of the calendar year. He was not in post at the time, as he will

I press the Minister on whether he intends that the amendments made in
another place, where the Bill will have its Third Reading tomorrow,

significant issues were raised during the debates on the important
amendments made in the Lords, most notably on the amendment from the
Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Teverson, which I understand involved a
licensed rebellion against the Government by Liberal Democrats. Not for
the first time, the Energy Secretary was non-committal when asked about
this recently. Will the Minister therefore update the House on
the Government’s attitude to the Lords amendment? If he cannot
tell us that, perhaps he could give us his own opinion on the
matter.</hs_Para>

may be aware that last week, the devolved Parliament in Edinburgh
undertook to provide an emergency statement on electricity market
reform in relation to Government Lords amendment 66. The Westminster
Scottish National party spokesman, the hon. Member for Angus (Mr Weir),
is not in his place this evening, but the Edinburgh SNP energy
spokesman suggested that it was a constitutional outrage
that there had been no prior discussion with the devolved
Government. There is currently a predilection towards creating
grievance and diversion in Edinburgh that I hope we will be rid of in
less than a year’s time. Nevertheless, will the Minister explain
whether there has been any discussion with devolved Administrations
about the closure of the renewables obligation? He is well aware, as I
am, that about a third of the financial support for renewable energy in
the UK goes to Scotland, which has less than 10% of the consumer base.
It is spread across the board in Britain, which works in all our
interests—we share the risks and rewards. The Scottish National
party asserts that that will continue post separation if those of us in
Scotland vote that way, for reasons I still fail to understand, next
September. Will the Minister be clear on discussions with devolved
Administrations? Powers relating to the promotion of renewable energy
currently exist in the Scottish Parliament.</hs_Para>

important Bill which, as the Minister said, we supported on Third
Reading. We expressed reservations on some areas of energy policy that
have not been addressed, but it is an important, much-delayed and
much-needed Bill. We do not intend to oppose the motion and hope the
Government do everything they can to ensure that its passage is
complete before the end of the calendar year, as the Minister

the urgent work of renewing our energy infrastructure and capacity in a
low carbon, sustainable way for the future.</hs_Para>

Friend think are the implications for the

by those recent decisions? Where will that leave us if we are
justifying imposing significant increases in the price of electricity
for consumers on the basis that we are setting an example and leading
the world in our opposition to global warming and in our determination
to reduce carbon emissions? That leadership does not seem to have

grateful if my right hon. Friend gave some indication of how the
Government will respond to what has happened in Japan. Japan is where
the Kyoto agreement was negotiated. The consequence of the Japanese
redefinition of its targets will probably be more carbon dioxide
emissions, and we will not be able do anything about that. If we turned
off all the lights, closed down all our heating systems and did not use
any energy at all, we would still not be able to counter the
consequences of the recent Japanese decision. Does that not show that,
far from being able to lead the world, the political climate in the

that?</hs_Para>

policy, but the Polish Government have made it clear that they intend
to keep on burning coal. As the hon. Member for Christchurch said, the
targets in the Bill, for which an extension is now sought, seem to be
at odds not only with what has been said by other European nations,
including Poland and Germany, but with what is happening in other parts
of the world. I hope the Minister will take the opportunity afforded by
the extension to consider the direction of energy policy—the
commitments the Government are now making to look at the cost of
energy, and the Opposition’s attempts to pillory the Government
over that issue—so that we do not go down such a route. There is
a certain irony in the Opposition, who have been complaining the most
about energy prices, supporting such an energy policy in debates in the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111837000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111837000049"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="1050" UID="13111837000187" xid="293" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111837000187">Mr

(Tom Greatrex) that I am grateful to him for supporting the Bill,
particularly on the grounds that, as I think he said, the investment it

the amendments made in another place are likely to be considered. I
cannot confirm the exact date. That is a matter for the usual channels,

the hon. Gentleman asked about the amendment passed in the other place
on the application of the emissions performance standards to coal-fired

do not recognise that term. Indeed, I am not sure what that is, as I
have not heard of it in this place or, indeed, in the other place, so
he needs to look into that in a little more detail. We will set out our
position on all the amendments made in the other place when we come to

the hon. Gentleman asked about the Scottish Minister’s remarks

giving me the opportunity to make it clear that that point had been
discussed at length with the Scottish Government before that
Minister’s remarks in the Scottish Parliament this week. My

Secretary of State for Justice, he had the kindness and respect for
Parliament to phone me from Downing street one day at 6 am to state
that Wellingborough prison was going to be put out for market testing

Wellingborough prison and to put in an excellent public sector bid. I
would particularly praise the prison officers for going against union
advice and co-operating with the project. Wellingborough was so
improved that it was the third-cheapest prison in the country and the
Ministry of Justice decided not to privatise it. So all was well; the
prison operated efficiently and with the support of the local
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111837000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111837000077">But
then, without warning, on 17 July 2012, the last sitting day of
Parliament before the summer recess, the then Secretary of State for
Justice announced the proposed closure of Wellingborough prison. I was
given no warning of the decision and found out about it only during a
live BBC radio interview. In my opinion, that was a totally
unacceptable divergence from parliamentary protocol and utterly
disrespectful to me as a local Member of Parliament, but more
importantly it was disrespectful to my

24. In turning down my request, Mr Speaker made it clear that it would
not be possible to grant it as the House was going into recess the next
day. The then Secretary of State kindly wrote me a handwritten letter
apologising for what had happened and saying that it should never have
occurred. That was followed by a debate in Westminster Hall

extremely sensitive about making any changes to the Wellingborough

Minister told me privately that he was writing to me to say the site of

£17,894—the second cheapest out of all male
category C prisons. Not only that, but the prison has
significant room for expansion, a local population that supports it and
a council that wants to encourage its development. It has a superb
location as an overspill prison from London, yet is an easy location
for the rest of the country. Wellingborough prison absolutely fits the
Government’s policy. Terrific: another success story for the

central London by train and has superb road links from the M1. However,

prison also has the huge advantage of being a very cheap area in which
to build and develop. If that were not enough, the Wellingborough

there is another difficulty for the Ministry of Justice in trying to
sell the site. If the sale of land were to go ahead, there would be
serious questions as to whether the Government would remain financially
responsible for the prison-owned sewerage system on the site, which is
used by the local housing estate. We could end up having to fork out
more money for a site of which we are not even making use. I cannot see
how that is cost-effective on any level. Much more than that, most of
the prison is very modern and has, in fact, won prizes for its design.
In the five-year period from 2004-05, an incredible £22.4
million was spent on the prison—all to be thrown away if the

we have a golden opportunity to knock down the 1960s old prison blocks,
to extend the existing modern blocks and facilities and to build new

prison operational procedures, mix both state and private employees on
the same site, allow prison officers to do the essential running of the
prison, while allowing private contractors to carry out other
functions. We would then have the cheapest prison in the country per

£50 million has been bandied around; I always think that when
something is around the sum of £50 million, it cannot really be
based on anything. That was for revamping the existing prison, but I am
arguing for something different. I say we should knock down the old
bit, which is the minority of the prison, and build new blocks to make
a much bigger, cheaper prison, with a capacity of more like 1,000

Friend’s answers. Earlier today, in the statement from the

Justice is about to build a new prison in Wales for 1,000 prisoners at

Bone:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend again. I would argue even
further that for that investment, we could actually get 1,000 prisoners
accommodated. Let me correct my hon. Friend on one issue, because I
believe that the proposed prison in Wrexham is going to be for 2,000
prisoners. I shall comment on that later in my

for a moment, let us look at the London problem. The Ministry of
Justice’s own figures say that it needs 18,000 prison places and
has a capacity for 11,000. The prisons Minister will say that he is
going to build a 2,500-place prison at Feltham. Well, even if that is
possible, there will still be a shortage of 4,500 prison places. The
prisons Minister may say that he is going to extend other London
prisons, but—hand on heart—he knows that thousands of
prisoners from London will have to be imprisoned outside of London.
That is why the Wellingborough solution is such a sensible option. I
hope that some of the extremely expensive Victorian London prisons will
be closed, because that would make Wellingborough even more
important.</hs_Para>

may have been sold the idea of super-duper prisons with places for
2,500 prisoners. That may be the whizz-bang new policy at the moment,
but I believe that the strategy involves a great deal of risk. I think
that there will be considerable management diseconomies of scale which
would make such huge establishments exceptionally difficult to run. I
also think it extremely unlikely that they would be opened on time.
Indeed, I think that there would be much opposition to them, and that
they might never be built.</hs_Para>

in a nutshell, is that Wellingborough prison is the right size for
future development because of its location, because expanding it would
be cheap, and because its running costs are very low. The Minister may
say that his other plans render it surplus to requirements, but can he
be sure of that? I do not think that he can, and I suggest that the
prison site should remain on the Ministry of Justice estate for at
least another 12 months. If by then the Minister is sure that all his
plans are working and there is no need for the site to be retained,
then let him go ahead and sell it; but if, as I believe, there are
likely to be significant problems, let us look again at the possibility
of opening and expanding Wellingborough.</hs_Para>

efforts of all who worked at Wellingborough. As I said then, any
decision to close a prison is not made lightly, and is never easy. The
decision to close this prison was not a reflection on either the work
or the performance of the staff. As my hon. Friend pointed out, I said

decision to close the prison followed an evaluation of every

that parts of the site were in a poor state of repair. Its physical
fabric, like that of other facilities that were built in the 1960s, had
deteriorated over the years. It was not simply the accommodation that
needed to be brought up to standard; many other improvements were
required. It was increasingly unsafe, with poor services and
infrastructure, poor electrics, and inadequate water pressure which
failed to meet the required standards for the fighting of fires. It was
in need of a substantial further investment of about £50

Wright:</Member></B> As I have already said, the cost of 
£50 million—or £49.7 million if we want to be
precise—is the cost of bringing part of Wellingborough prison up
to standard, so that is not a directly comparable figure in this
regard. My hon. Friend may also know, as he may have heard this figure
mentioned in the House earlier today, that we estimate that the cost of
a new prison in Wrexham—which, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Wellingborough pointed out, will provide some 2,100 places, not
1,000—will be about £250 million. My maths is not good
enough for me to do that sum, although perhaps the maths of my hon.
Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone) is, but there is a clear
problem with Wellingborough, which is that substantial capital
investment would be required to bring it up to standard. This also has
to be seen against the backdrop of what was a strategic consideration
as to where those prison places would best be provided, and I will come
on to that
subject.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111837000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111837000116"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hollobone" PimsId="4744" UID="13111837000207" xid="858" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/debtext/131118-0003.htm#13111837000207">Mr

Friend the Member for Wellingborough said, we are replacing
accommodation that is old, inefficient or has limited long-term
strategic value. Reshaping the rest of the prison estate will enable us
to release offenders closer to home, which we know improves their
resettlement and helps prevent reoffending. Linked intrinsically to
this, a nationwide through-the-prison-gate resettlement service will be
put in place, meaning that most offenders are given continuous support
by one provider from custody into the community. We will support this
by ensuring that most offenders are held in a prison designated 
<?notus-xml column=1059?>to their area for at least three months before
release. To achieve that we must have the best fit between custodial
capacity and demand.</hs_Para>

construction of the new prison in Wrexham, subject to planning
approval, will offer 2,100 places when it is fully operational from
late 2017. In addition, we are looking into replacing the existing
Feltham young offenders site with a large new adult prison and a
discrete new youth facility. It is our aim that we will have more adult
male prison capacity in May 2015 than there was at the start of this
Parliament. As a result of this new capacity coming on stream, we were

the Government’s intention to ensure that the prison system
retains sufficient capacity and resilience to manage all those who are

Government have a duty to their citizens to ensure that we make the

system is necessarily complex and it must be able to meet a variety of
needs. That includes being able to receive new prisoners direct from
courts throughout England and Wales, providing health care and
education, tackling deep-rooted, dangerous and harmful behaviour and

the changing needs of the prison population is essential. By doing
that, we remain able to carry out the punishments set by the courts, to
maintain strong security to protect the public and to provide
opportunities for different types of offenders in order to reduce the
likelihood of their committing further crimes. Accordingly, individual
prisons are robustly assessed to determine whether their closure is
operationally viable before a recommendation is made. Such a
recommendation was made in relation to Wellingborough, and the decision
to close it was subsequently taken. That was because Wellingborough
prison is located in a region with too many places and it did not
perform a function that could not be replicated at other
prisons. Furthermore, there were enough other prisons located nearby to
allow us to avoid compulsory redundancies by redeploying
staff.</hs_Para>

to the issue of Wellingborough as an alternative London prison. My hon.
Friend the Member for Wellingborough has said that large numbers of
London prisoners find themselves in Wellingborough. Indeed, they also
find themselves in Onley and in other prisons. That is due to the
significant deficit of prison places in the London area for London
prisoners. As he knows, I firmly believe that the best solution to the
shortage of places in London is to build a new prison in London. That

Friend is correct, however, to say that we need alternatives to the
Feltham site, and we have other potential locations that fall within
the designated site search area. Unfortunately for Wellingborough, that
designated area does not stretch into Northamptonshire. It is my
expectation that we will find a suitable location for a new London
prison on one of these sites.</hs_Para>

Friend’s advocacy and passion, with which you are well familiar,
Mr Speaker, command respect. He has asked me to look again specifically
at the alternative sites that may be considered for a new London
prison. He knows of my scepticism that Wellingborough could be the
right candidate for that role, and I make absolutely no promises about
the outcome of that further consideration, nor do I undertake to
postpone the disposal of the site for as long as 12 months. However, in
view of the fact that our conversation on this matter took place only

Friend knows, however, we cannot hold on to the site indefinitely. The
level of security, utilities and maintenance has been reduced to one
appropriate for a site that has been closed, but it does not come
cheaply, none the less. We estimate that about £237,000 
<?notus-xml column=1061?>will be spent in this financial year on holding
costs alone. It is therefore in the taxpayer’s best interest to
avoid unnecessary holding costs and to seek to dispose of the site

State was right to say that when there are new facts, the situation
will be looked at again—I very much appreciate it. I have one
thing I wish to take up with the Minister. He rightly talks of a number
of prison closures, but they have been undertaken under the new

Wellingborough’s closure was done under the old Secretary of

Wright:</Member></B> I would say two things on that to my hon. Friend.
First, he must always remember to complete his quotes. When the

said, equally generously, that I was prepared to follow through on
difficult decisions where I believe them to be in the national

point relates to the closure of Wellingborough prison and the
comparison with other prisons. My hon. Friend knows my view, and I do
not think we are ever likely to agree on this. Having looked again at
that decision, I believe it was the right decision to close
Wellingborough prison in the circumstances. We are now considering a
different question: what to do with the site and what prospects it may
have for future use. I repeat that he knows where my scepticism lies,
but he asked me to consider the matter again, specifically whether
Wellingborough might form a suitable site for another London prison. I
said to him this morning, and I am happy to repeat it, that he may have
some task persuading me that it is better to build a London prison in
Northamptonshire than in London.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=1062?>question on the policy for London prisoners. As the
Minister knows, I have a vested interest, because my area contains two
prisons that take prisoners from London. When I have visited these
prisons, I have found that they have mainly been full of former gang
members who have been taken out of London. Removing them from the north
of London, where they come from, is seen as a benefit, because that
makes it more difficult for them to maintain contact with the gang
networks from which we have just extracted them. How far have we gone
with this policy so far? What are the thoughts for the future? Surely
we are going against our own vested interest here, which is to remove
these people whence they came.</hs_Para>

that the two prisons in his constituency are probably no more than a
stone’s throw from the edge of mine, and I know them well. He is
right that there are a number of London prisoners who are in prisons
outside London for good and sensible population management reasons. I
can reassure him that it is highly likely that whatever provision we

transferring of London prisoners to sites outside London. That will be
necessary because of the figures that my hon. Friend the Member for
Wellingborough has given the House tonight. That does not mean that we
should not consider the needs of the majority of London-based
prisoners, which will be to remain in the London area, and the needs of
their families who will wish to visit them, as much as the needs of
those offenders themselves. It still seems to me that we will want to
consider the building of additional prison capacity in or around the

with this new question that he now poses for himself, and stress the
excellent connectivity of Wellingborough, both north to south—it
is less than 50 minutes on the train to London—and east to west,
with the excellent road network. Moreover, much to local
people’s consternation, a campaign sponsored by the Department
for Communities and Local Government a couple of years ago saw
Northamptonshire marketed in London as “North
Londonshire”, attracting people from London to Northamptonshire.
In his efforts to answer this new question, I urge the Minister to
ignore this regional boundary, which very few people recognise.

location for a London prison to put it in Northamptonshire than to put
it in London. None the less, as I have said, I will consider that case,
and I will look carefully at what my hon. Friend the Member for

indefinitely to 
<?notus-xml column=1063?>hold on to a prison site that we may not need and do so at a significant
cost to the taxpayer. It follows that, as a first step to what may be
the disposal of that site, officials in the Ministry of Justice have a
meeting scheduled already with the local planning authority to begin
discussions on the future of the site. That process is obviously at an
early stage and no decisions on its future use have been made. It must
surely be in the interests of my hon. Friend’s constituents and
the taxpayer at large that we, in close consultation with the local

monitor compliance with the time limits by the authorities concerned.
This will provide all of the authorities involved in the permitting

women, peace and security (“UNSCR 1325”). The national
action plan is intended to strengthen our ability to reduce the impact

the last three years (2010-13), the UK Government have made progress on

have a key role to play in decision-making,  in the aftermath
of violent conflict. It is essential that peace negotiations provide
for the active participation, perspectives and needs of both men and
women.  Promoting and supporting women’s active and
meaningful  participation in all peace processes, as well as
their representation in formal and informal decision-making at all
levels, is vital to international peace and security. In this context,
we welcome the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2122 on 18
October, which reaffirms the integral role women play in peace
processes. Incorporating gender perspectives into our
conflict-prevention efforts has been an increasingly important focus of
our efforts. The UK recognises that long-term conflict prevention
requires investment in all perspectives.  Women’s
participation can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the
causes of and alternative solutions 
<?notus-xml column=39?>to violent conflict. In Afghanistan, the UK’s support to the
Tawanmandi programme, aimed at building the capacity of Afghan civil
society, has as a main element support for women’s contribution
to communities, including the empowerment of women through local peace
councils in 16 projects across the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1311182000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/wmstext/131118m0001.htm#1311182000024">Securing

entrepreneurs or employees. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
the UK is providing £60 million between 2010 and 2014 for the

The new NAP will also focus more on monitoring and evaluation; this

Boles:</Member></B> Monitoring of compliance with conditions attached
to planning permissions is a matter for the local planning authority.
Local planning authorities adopt various strategies to do this,
including, for example, asking developers to notify them of the start
of works, so that pre-commencement conditions can be checked. If a
developer fails to comply with a condition, the local planning
authority may serve a breach of condition notice requiring compliance.
If a breach of condition notice is not complied with, the person
responsible for the breach can be prosecuted in the magistrates court
where the penalty is a fine of up to £2,500 on
conviction.</hs_Para>

Department uses the centrally negotiated framework agreements operated
by the Government Procurement Service to purchase common goods and
services where typically Whitehall and other public bodies volumes have
been leveraged to deliver value for money for taxpayers. However our
goods and services (except for energy) are not ordered in bulk with
other Departments but they are purchased as and when we require
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311194000466" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0001.htm#1311194000466">On
energy, we now purchase this through Government Procurement Service
frameworks which are typically for five year periods, and following
extensive market competition and EU wide tender processes. The bulk of
central Government energy is aggregated under Government Procurement
Service frameworks, which enables the Government Procurement Service
Energy Team to actively engage directly with the energy markets to
achieve best value and price for the
taxpayer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311194000467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0001.htm#1311194000467">Also

Swinson:</Member></B> Government and regulators have been working
together to tackle the problems in the payday lending market and to
clamp down on unscrupulous and irresponsible lenders. We have made
clear our aim to ensure that consumers should not be able to take out
multiple loans the same day without their credit files being properly
checked and, more broadly, that payday lenders are making proper and
effective use of existing credit check mechanisms. Credit data sharing
is key to lenders carrying out proper affordability assessments, and
more progress on recording and using payday lending data in real time
is vital to addressing problems around multiple loans.</hs_Para>

are already required by law to assess the borrower's creditworthiness
before providing credit. We welcome, in the short-term, the Office of
Fair Trading's strong action on non-compliant payday lenders as a top
enforcement priority. From April 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority,
the new credit regulator has proposed tough new rules on payday
lending. These will include: binding requirements on lenders to conduct
proper affordability assessments; a limit on the number of times a loan
can be rolled over; and a requirement to include risk warnings and
information about free debt advice in all payday adverts, as well as
before rolling over a
loan.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1311194000068" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0001.htm#1311194000068">Cybercrime</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="1311194000673" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0001.htm#1311194000673"><B><Member PimsId="5617" UID="1311194002838" xid="1211" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0001.htm#1311194002838">Chi

universal credit pathfinder and a number of steps have been built into
the business process to deliver this. All new universal credit claims
are subject to identity verification at face to face interviews at the

their circumstances. There is then a further scrutiny of claims using a
rule-based data matching service that directs the requirement for any
additional documentary evidence or specialist attention where

use of security 'models' which are iteratively refined, and which
describe the current threats at any given stage, the definition of a
security architecture which acts as a design baseline for the security
services, the specification of security acceptance criteria for use in
automated testing and the fact that 
<?notus-xml column=691?>security specialists are embedded into the development process. These
approaches combine to ensure that controls are integrated into the
design and delivery of the IT system and are proportionate to the
threat at each stage of roll
out.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1311194002060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0002.htm#1311194002060"><B><Member PimsId="1268" UID="1311194002938" xid="330" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0002.htm#1311194002938">Mr

killing, injuring or capturing a wild bird was amended in 2013 to bring
it into line with the Republic's Protection and Management of Game and

allow NATO ships to visit Spanish ports directly from Gibraltar and not
to allow NATO ships to visit Spanish ports if they are going directly
to Gibraltar. Subsequently this reservation, which has been in place
since 1989, continues to be used by the Spanish Government to prevent
such movements. Similarly, any request by military aircraft from NATO

year, Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA) contract between the

the intervening period, there were extensive negotiations between the
Ministry of Defence and QinetiQ, including during the time before and
after the partial sale of the company to the Carlyle Group in February
2003. There have been continuous discussions between both parties since
then regarding the operation of the LTPA

ensuring that the service complaints process is as fair, effective and
efficient as it can be. Since the introduction of the new service
complaints system in 2008, the MOD has sought to learn from best
practice and improve the manner in which complaints are managed. As
part of this focus on continual improvement, in January 2013 a new
system for service complaints commissioner (SCC) oversight of the
complaints process took effect, requiring the services to inform the
SCC of cases likely to take longer than 24 weeks to resolve.</hs_Para>

developed together with a group of outstanding schools and initial

assessment, selection and recruitment process to identify those
non-graduate service leavers with the potential to become outstanding
teachers. This process also recognises the professional skills service
leavers already have and provides training to make best use of and
further develop them in schools. Good progress is currently being made

Thurso:</Member></B> Control of Westminster Hall is vested jointly in
the Lord Great Chamberlain, representing Her Majesty the Queen, and in
the two Speakers on behalf of the two Houses. These three keyholders
have joint authority for deciding on proposals for displays or
exhibitions in Westminster Hall. Before making their 
<?notus-xml column=713?>decision, the keyholders normally seek the advice of
the Exhibitions Advisory Group, a group of officials from both Houses
of Parliament (bringing together public engagement and heritage
expertise). The keyholders may consult other committees as they think
appropriate in any

total of 155 badgers were subjected to post mortem examination during
the pilot culls as part of the assessment of the humaneness of
controlled shooting. Any outward signs of illness or poor condition
were noted as part of the procedure. TB testing in culled badgers is
not being undertaken as a routine procedure in these pilots as high
levels of TB were confirmed in badgers in the regions in which the cull
areas are located during the randomised badger cull trial

on a few occasions, testing has been carried out at the specific
request of landowners when there has been concern that a culled badger
appeared to have been in a poor state of health. As post-mortems and
testing have not been completed, the numbers of badgers found to be
carrying TB is not known at present. Moreover, conducting conclusive

significantly reduce pressure on bills from 2015 by between £120
million to £750 million a year. The Government has urged water
companies to consider the impact on the customer when making decisions
about future bills, and particularly to consider if they need to apply
the full price increases allowed for in the 2009 price review next

Laws:</Member></B> The education maintenance allowance (EMA) was
replaced in 2011/12 by the 16-19 Bursary Fund. The decision to remove
the EMA was made because it was a poorly targeted scheme. Research
commissioned 
<?notus-xml column=733?>by the previous Government showed that although 45% of 16 to
18-year-olds in education received EMA, only one in 10 in fact relied

2 hours will operate an international service along the link with High
Speed 1. The link has capacity for 3 trains per hour in each direction.
There is flexibility to use the remaining 2.5 hourly paths for domestic
or further international services. How to best use these available
paths has not yet been fully analysed. However preliminary modelling of
domestic and international demand leads us to believe this potential
level of service, using a single track link, will be more than adequate

value of good asset management in delivering effective and efficient
highway services to meet local needs. However, in England the
development of highways asset management plans and strategies are a

not hold data on how many authorities have implemented asset management

<QuestionText>To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer
when the definition of food as '"Food" should be interpreted as meaning
food for human consumption. Where a mammal or bird is primarily reared
for use as food, but certain portions of the carcass (particularly
where they may be considered as in the nature of a by-product) are used
for other purposes (eg the use of certain offal in the production of
pet food), this should not be taken as disqualifying the animals from
the definition of livestock. However, animals (eg rabbits) raised
expressly for use in pet food should be considered as outside the
definition' was added to paragraph 5.3.2 Section 8, Part D:

resolution 2106. It has a clear focus on tackling impunity and
accountability and contains a set of wider political and practical
commitments. In particular it agrees that there should be no peace
agreements that give amnesty to people who have ordered or carried out
rape. The UK will now work with endorsing countries, the UN and civil

Simmonds:</Member></B> The British Government recognises the political
force of describing rape as a prohibited weapon or tactic of war. Rape
as a method of war is clearly prohibited under International
Humanitarian Law (IHL). In April 2013, the G8 made a historic
Declaration on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict that describes
rape and sexual violence as grave breaches of the Geneva convention, as
well as war crimes. This commitment was also included in the
Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict which was
launched at the UN General Assembly in September and endorsed by 135
countries. The payment of reparations is a matter for the national
Governments concerned. However, both our G8 and UNGA Declarations
encourage countries to provide greater support and assistance to
survivors of sexual violence. Since April 2011 the UK has committed
£1.5million to the International Criminal Court's Trust Fund for
Victims which aims to directly address and respond to victims'
physical, psychological, or material needs. There is a need to improve
the documentation and recording of rape and sexual violence in war and
the UK is leading on the development of a new international protocol on
the documentation and investigation of sexual violence in conflict.
Under article 
<?notus-xml column=777?>36 of additional protocol I to the Geneva conventions, states parties
have an obligation to determine whether the employment of a new means
or method of warfare would be unlawful. The UK is of the firm view that
any use of rape as means or method of warfare would be
unlawful.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1311199000105" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0005.htm#1311199000105">Ascension

policy of critical engagement with Belarus, including the EU's
sanctions regime. In advance of the 
<?notus-xml column=779?>rollover of sanctions at the end of October, EU member states conducted
a thorough analysis of the situation in Belarus and the sanctions
listings. Our analysis concluded that there had been no appreciable
improvement in respect for human rights and democracy in Belarus, and
that it was therefore appropriate to extend the sanctions for a further
year. Minor amendments were made to the list of those targeted to
ensure the measures remained robust and dynamic. As I noted to my hon.
Friend on 30 October 2012, <I>Official Report</I>, column 174W, it is
difficult to gauge the effectiveness of sanctions against an opaque
regime like Belarus. We judge that they have had some effect; the
travel ban and asset freezes are difficult for the individuals
targeted, damage Belarus' image, and have had a constraining effect by
encouraging others in similar roles and positions to respect human
rights and the rule of law. It is also our view that by regularly
reviewing sanctions measures, including the delisting of those who have
ceased certain activities, we are more likely to encourage listed
individuals to consider changing their
behaviour.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1311199000108" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0005.htm#1311199000108">British

contributed to the death, but it will not be the underlying cause.

deaths where one of these conditions was the underlying cause of death,

(HMCTS), which have been agreed between the Lord Chancellor, the Lord
Chief Justice and the Senior President of Tribunals, are set out in the
Framework Document which underpins it. They support the overall aim of
HMCTS which is to run an efficient and effective courts and tribunals
system, which enables the rule of law to be upheld and provides access
to justice for all. Working with other Government Departments and
agencies to improve the quality of decision making in order to reduce
the number of cases coming before the courts 
<?notus-xml column=800?>and tribunals contributes to the overall aim by ensuring that those
cases that come before a court or tribunal are those which actually
require judicial intervention. The HMCTS business plan for 2013-14

which support the organisation's objectives. It can be found

plan, and in many cases, it will be determined that an accredited
offending behaviour programme is necessary for them to address their

has completed relevant targets on his or her sentence plan, but also
the offender's behaviour while in custody, as well as risk assessments
and the release management plan. The Board will direct the release of
such prisoners only if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary

victims' lives. That is why the Government recently strengthened the
framework of criminal offences available to deal with stalking and
harassment by amendments to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997,

that stalking is a criminal offence and will not be tolerated, making

an evidence based decision to focus investment in offending behaviour
programmes on groups of offenders who are most likely to reoffend,

targeting these groups through the delivery of structured interventions

programmes to target violent, sexual and general offending. Stalkers
are a comparatively small group within the offending population and
individuals convicted of stalking share a broad range of offending
behaviours with other types of offender. Although we have not
identified a need to develop a specific intervention for this group,
their motivations, needs and the specific nature of their offending
behaviour will in many cases make them suitable for participation in

education at the heart of youth custody. In this way young offenders in

self-discipline they need to re-engage with education, training or
employment on release and stop offending. We intend shortly to publish

remit of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales (YJB) should be
extended to young people aged up to 24 years of age as part of Stage 1
of this year's Triennial Review of the YJB. This concluded that the YJB
should remain focused on preventing offending and reoffending of
children and young people under 18 within the justice system,
monitoring that system and commissioning a distinct secure estate for
young people. The Stage 1 report can be found at:</hs_Para>

improving support for young people who are transferring between the

promote better practice respectively for community and for custodial

Lamb:</Member></B> The number of people waiting more than 28 days for
Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services has
increased since quarter 3, 2008-09. We believe this reflects the
increase in the number of IAPT services, demand for them and the
overall number of people accessing services. The IAPT programme has
monitored waiting times since roll-out of its first wave sites in 2008.
Measurement of waiting times is complicated by various factors,
including local processes, information technology system capabilities
and patient
choice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111910002046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0008.htm#13111910002046">IAPT
has refined the measurement of waiting times as processes and systems
for collecting data have become embedded in services. This is reflected
in IAPT guidance over recent years in an attempt to improve accuracy
and consistent measurement across services. For this reason the figures
from 2008 cannot be viewed as a complete time series as definitions
have changed over this period. The present data collection process
ensures that more detailed information than previously is collected and
published on waiting
times.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13111910000066" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131118/text/131118w0008.htm#13111910000066">Mental

steps. NHS England expect that if the full range of proposals made in
the review, including those relating to community pharmacy, are
implemented, then this will relieve pressure on the system as a
whole—as well as its individual parts, such as accident and
emergency departments. A copy of the report has been placed in the
