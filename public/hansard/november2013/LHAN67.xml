failure to have any essential repairs carried out on their properties.
These people had almost given up hope and it is good to know that

they have achieved much. The requirement for managers to belong to a

continuing to pursue a complaint through the tribunal system as the

this matter. Does the Minister agree that it is essential that people
in leasehold properties understand their rights and obligations and the
redress which is available to them as a result of this and other
policies? Does she also agree that it is essential that people moving
into the private rented sector—which is increasing, and must
increase to help with housing problems—have the same

those points. It is incumbent on government to make sure, through
opportunities such as this, that both those living in leasehold
properties and those in the private rented sector are aware of their
new rights. It is incredibly important that we extend the private
rented sector because one way of driving up standards is to increase
choice for those living in the rented sector. I am pleased to announce
today that we have agreed yet another new Build to Rent project, this
time in Manchester, which will deliver 196 rented units by refurbishing

against this when we first pushed it through but we are delighted that
a sinner has repented. Given that the Government are now saying they
want to give support to those who have been disadvantaged by the
activities of letting agents, will they rethink their opposition to

it will provide, as I said, a new course of redress for leaseholders

sector—I am focusing now on the rental sector as opposed to
leasehold properties—two redress schemes are already operating,
and we certainly expect those two schemes to come forward for statutory
approval. The new redress scheme was part of a wider package of
measures that we announced a couple of weeks ago and that will provide
greater support for those living in rented accommodation. We will
certainly ensure, as part of that, that there is more support for local
authorities, so that they can be even more effective in their
responsibility to ensure that the accommodation provided in their area
is of a high
standard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T11:21:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000020"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall" PimsId="1817" UID="13110766000589" xid="1765" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000589">Baroness
McIntosh of Hudnall (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, since the noble
Baroness has raised the issue of the private rented sector, I am sure
she will be aware that for most people who are obliged to use that
sector—which, of course, includes a number of Members of your
Lordships’ House—the big issue is the enormous increase
in rents over the past few years and the concomitant rise in payments
to letting agents. Does she agree that it might be beneficial for the
Government to investigate this market to see whether it really is
operating in the consumer interest? At the moment, it is very much
rampaging in the interests of those who let rather than of those who
rent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T11:22:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" PimsId="5900" UID="13110766000590" xid="2111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000590">Baroness
Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> As I said in response to another
question, the most important action we can take to ensure that rents
are kept at a sensible rate is to ensure that an increasing supply of
rented accommodation is accessible to people. We are very much behind
that. One way in which we are doing that is with a £1 billion
fund called Build to Rent, which is about creating new residences that
are purpose built as rented accommodation. These new schemes—new
blocks or estates—are designed to meet that fundamental purpose
in the way they are constructed. Overall, however, although I
understand the noble Baroness’s point, I think that average rent
rises are running below inflation at the moment, certainly outside
London.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/F16A4FAA4E17958925C30FA76B16F0B761D69A94" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

circles, quite justifiably, as Ofquack. It means, in effect, that
craniosacral therapists, reflexologists and homeopaths can now claim to
be covered by the same professional standards as doctors and nurses. In
the past, the Department of Health has sometimes suggested that it will
not take sides between evidence-based medicine, which is based on

accreditation does not imply that it has. The principle remains that it
is for individuals, in consultation with health practitioners, to
decide which therapy is right for them. The scheme is not a form of
regulation, nor is the PSA a regulator. It sets standards for
organisations holding voluntary registers for health and social care

recognition of the importance of parity of esteem for
physical and mental disturbances. However, of course the treatment of
physical and mental disturbances often requires different amounts of
time. A short appointment for a physical treatment may not be the right
thing for the psychological treatments to which the noble Lord
referred. That makes it difficult for people in work both to get the
treatment that they need and stay in work. Does the Minister’s
department recognise, as the health department does, that parity of
esteem may mean extra time and facilities for those with mental
disturbances as against those with physical

welcome the Crown Prosecution Service action plan, published last year
with a view to bringing successful prosecutions. The CPS guidance on
FGM prosecutions provides a useful framework for prosecutors to
understand how to build stronger cases with the police to bring to
court. It explains how they need to be aware of the fact that where
there is a victim of FGM, the local authority or social services may
well have material or information to support

in the Home Office when one of my sisters, who was training as a
midwife, explained the full horror and scale of FGM. I was completely
horrified. I failed in my time in the Home Office to ensure that people
were being correctly prosecuted. Since then, we have not done any
better. I am glad to hear what is being said, but does the

that we need to make a step change in the landscape here. We have
continued to prioritise FGM, both at home and overseas. The
intercollegiate report, however, published this week, adds a very
welcome dimension to the work we are doing. It was written by health
professionals and FGM experts for health professionals, and the

the House when that Act went through, and I commend the noble Baroness
for the work she did on that issue. She mentioned France. One of the
features of the French system is the physical examination of all girls
under the age of five. We will not be following that path. We do not
think it would be right to do so. We think it raises ethical and human
rights concerns. However, all children are routinely seen by healthcare
staff in the universal healthy child programme that covers England, and
prevention and safeguarding absolutely underpin that programme. It is

with communities through civil society organisations in at least 15 of
the most affected countries. Developments in FGM abroad tend to change
attitudes towards communities here, which is why the Government are
confident that the work of DfID will result in culture change and,
hopefully, abandonment in both Africa and the UK. I would be happy to

the House and its authorities for the opportunity to promote the
debate—and, indeed, to all noble Lords who are here today. It is
also a very pleasant duty to extend a warm welcome to the noble
Baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, and the noble Lord, Lord Whitby, both of
whom will be gracing the debate with their maiden speeches. On behalf
of us all, I wish them nothing but fulfilment during their time in
this place. I also declare my interest as a board
member of Conservative Friends of the Chinese, but I do not 
<?notus-xml column=329?>wish to turn this into a partisan debate. It has been too long since we
had the chance to debate these hugely important issues.</hs_para>

is the world’s most populous country, with one-fifth of all
humanity’s children, the second biggest economy on the planet
and the largest standing army. We keep talking about Chinas as an
emerging nation, but China is not emerging: she has already arrived, an
ever-strengthening wind in our world. My own interest in China dates
from my doctoral studies at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in
the 1970s when China was in the throes of the Maoist madness that
killed, murdered and even starved to death tens of millions of
Chinese<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T11:47:42"></hs_TimeCode>. China
today is unrecognisable as that delta of misery which flooded into the
Yellow Sea. The first thing I do, therefore, is offer my unstinting
congratulations to the people and the Government of China for the
enormous strides that they have taken since

relations with China are long-standing, although they have not always
been good. Our imperial past has left many scars; the Chinese still
remember. However, both our worlds have moved on since those
inauspicious days. Our economic ties have expanded enormously. In the
past three years, British exports to China have doubled, although they
are still less than those of France, way behind Germany and only a
squeak more than Italy. Our trade deficit with China is far larger than
those of our European neighbours. On the other hand, our financial
services industry is a world leader. The plans to turn London into a
major hub for renminbi dealing are truly exciting. What draws so much
attention is the flow of Chinese investment into Britain. It includes
investment into Heathrow and Manchester airports, our new nuclear power
plants, the Lloyds building, the Royal Albert Dock, Thames Water, good
old Weetabix, our next-generation telephone and broadband systems, and
even London’s traditional black cabs. It is an arrangement of
mutual advantage: they send us cuddly pandas and, in return, we send
them

strengthen our economic links with China, as we should, we need to give
attention to many areas. I will highlight three. The first is that of
visas. In the past three years, the Government have been making it
easier for Chinese businessmen and tourists to come to Britain. All the
required paperwork is now available in Mandarin, making the process of
getting a visa much less onerous. George Osborne, in his remarkable
trip to Beijing last month, promised even further improvements. We
must, however, put those promises into action. Seven times as many
Chinese visitors go to France as to Britain. There is more to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T11:50:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000070">My
second point relates to our air links. We are going to have to work a
lot harder to make sure we are competitive with the rest of Europe. We
wring our hands about whether it should be Boris Island,
Heathrow’s third runway, Stansted or Birmingham—yet,
while we argue rather than implement, the Chinese just get on with it
and increasingly fly to mainland Europe. We have been awful at our
planning of airports policy. We need to get much better, and very
quickly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T11:50:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

few words about education—that vital bridge not just between
businesses but between cultures. We are by far the most popular
destination in Europe for Chinese students and the third most popular
in the world after the United States and Australia, yet we do far too
little in return. At state-school level, only a tiny fraction of pupils
are offered any education in Mandarin. The situation is improving, but
far too slowly. At university level, we have only around 400
graduates a year who get any training in Chinese. The situation at
postgraduate level is even more challenging. The British Association
for Chinese Studies reports that, in the past four years, Britain has
produced only 13 doctoral students covering all Asian
studies—all Asian studies, not just Chinese studies. Noble Lords
might be interested to know that the comparable figure for Celtic
studies is 19. As delighted as I am that we rejoice in our Celtic
roots, I think we need to dig rather deeper than
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T11:51:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000072">There
are those who are fearful of our growing contacts. They are worried
about the extent of Chinese hacking and industrial espionage, the theft
of intellectual property, the inadequacies of Chinese commercial law,

China stretch far wider than trade and commerce. The continued progress
of China is key to the stability of the rest of the world, and she
faces huge domestic challenges. China has the most rapidly ageing
population in the world. Her workforce is about to start shrinking
rapidly. The failures of the one-child policy are coming home to roost.
It is said of China that she will be old before she is rich. Like so
much of Asia, China is desperately short of energy and raw materials.
However, her biggest challenge is perhaps the shortage of water. Much
of it is polluted, unsuitable not simply for human use but even for
agriculture and industry. I will give one statistic. The water table in
Beijing has dropped 300 metres—a full 1,000 feet—since
the 1970s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T11:53:33"></hs_TimeCode>. All

China sneezes, the rest of the world catches cold. We talk glibly about
China being monolithic—one country politically, economically and
geographically—but that can be hugely misleading. China is
confronted by immense internal challenges, and many observers believe
that the most significant story of the next 20 years will not be the
story of her inexorable rise but of her growing domestic problems.
There will be rifts between the generations, the regions, the
religions, the haves and have-nots, the literally wets and dries,
between opposing ideas and conflicting needs.</hs_para>

interior is still one of the most backward parts of the planet. Some
400 million Chinese are desperately impoverished and have gained
nothing from the great economic awakening. It is said that a rising

There are also ongoing and deep-seated concerns about human
rights—of which I suspect we will hear more in this

new leadership in Beijing. From the speeches of Xi Jinping and Li
Keqiang, it is clear that they understand the magnitude of the
challenge they face. We should wish them well, for China at discord
could be no friend of the West, let alone a partner in our future
prosperity. This is where I want to leave my personal mark on this
debate. Although in many eyes the rise of China is a threat to the
West, I argue that the greatest threat comes not from China’s
expansion but from the possibility of her implosion. That would cast a
shadow over the world so intense that it would propel us into an ice
age that would make our recent economic troubles seem like an outing on
an iceberg. To borrow a phrase from Henry Kissinger’s recent

we criticise Chinese inflexibility towards Tibet, for instance, we
should at least understand their genuine fear that unrest in Tibet will
be followed by upheaval in Xixiang and other border regions, and then
perhaps throughout the entire country. To some, it is an extraordinary
concept that China could be a vulnerable member of the international
community. It is a particularly odd idea when we see China becoming
more assertive. She has border disputes with Japan, India, Vietnam and
the Philippines. Her army is mighty and she is flexing her
muscles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T11:57:01"></hs_TimeCode>.
American academics talk of a new cold war as the United States pivots
away from Europe and towards Asia, and as China increasingly joins

sown.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000078">Yet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T11:57:27"></hs_TimeCode>,
inevitably, and happily, there is another side to all this. China has
shown little appetite for external aggression. Many of these border
issues are left over from the centuries of humiliation, and many of the
disputes are about rocks and oil and, in the long tradition of Asian
politics, about face. Very often the Chinese have found an
accommodation. For instance, many feared that Hong Kong would be
destroyed after it was handed back, but Beijing has been true to its
word and handled our former colony rather like a precious Ming vase. We
should not blind ourselves or be complacent; we must realise that the
growth of China will inevitably create the need for change. Through
that, it will create also the potential for conflict. She is already
developing a more assertive foreign policy; she will insist on being
involved in a dialogue over the future not just of border regions such
as North Korea and Pakistan but of places further afield, such as
Syria—as we have seen—the wider Middle East and Africa.

is inevitably followed by political revolution. All across Europe,
crowns tumbled and thrones were toppled while, in Britain, we kept our

want to focus my remarks on the strength of the relationship between
universities in Britain and China. In doing so, I declare an interest
as a member of the Council of University College London which has,
itself, extensive links with China. This House has, on many occasions,
debated the importance of universities’ international links to
the UK economy. We know that international students in higher education
contribute about £10 billion a year to the UK economy, and that
universities have been frustrated by the apparent failure of the

threats they face in this
sphere.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000086">I
exempt the Minister from this, because he, as much as anyone in the
Government, has sought to point out these opportunities and support
universities in their international activities. He has taken a more
nuanced approach to visa policy, which recognises the value of
international students and higher education trade links. In view of his
forthcoming retirement from the Front Bench, I should like to take this

strength and depth of UK university engagement with China is already
considerable. We have heard from other noble Lords about some of the
partnerships and joint ventures between UK universities and their
Chinese counterparts. My university, UCL, has built close collaborative
links with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and has, for example,
developed the concept of a joint science and innovation platform. It
has become evident that academic-industrial partnerships in China can
enhance relevance, trust and impact of collaboration, thus
increasing trade volume and
sustainability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000088">The
demand for higher education in China is staggering and the pace of
expansion is difficult to comprehend. But the focus of university
partnerships is on research links and innovation as well as teaching.
For example, the Innovation UK China partnership brings together five
UK and 20 Chinese universities to promote joint innovation, knowledge
transfer and commercialisation of intellectual property. I hope that
the Minister will urge UK universities to work in concert to attract
the very best talent from China for training, exchange and
collaborative work. Currently, the UK attracts fewer of the very best
students from China than does the US. The UK receives 70% of the number
of Chinese students compared with the US, but produces only 20% of high
quality, joint publications. Will the Minister look into joint
scholarships for top talent with the China Scholarship Council to
attract the best young people from both our

UK is in a leading position and we should do all we can to preserve it.
The opportunities are considerable, but this is not just about money.
We have an opportunity to play a role in shaping the future leaders of
China. Universities are acutely aware of the ethical challenge of
partnership and investment in a country where corruption and the abuse
of human rights remain stubborn features. Does the Minister believe
that the UK Government should give advice and support to UK
universities as they look to build on their engagement in China? How
can we help them avoid the pitfalls of investment and partnerships
which could compromise their own ethical
standards?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000090">I
turn to the well worn subject of international students. The Government
often point to the recent rapid growth in numbers of students from
China as evidence that there is no problem with the competitive
position of UK universities internationally. They should not be so
complacent. This rapid growth masks a 3% decrease in non-EU
students from other countries. The strong representation of Chinese
students on UK university campuses is welcome, adding enormously to the
experience of UK students but, privately, some 
<?notus-xml column=334?>universities worry about the extent of our reliance on one country,
particularly given recent evidence of how volatile the international
student market can be. You have only to look at our second largest
source of international students—India—to see what the
problem is. The number of students from India fell by 32% in 2011-12.
That has particularly hit engineering, technology and computer science
departments and has played a large role in the decrease in postgraduate
taught enrolments. India has strong, active media which pick up the
negative political rhetoric and increasing visa hurdles in the UK to an
amazing extent. This is, for now, less true of China, but the growth of
social media is changing
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000091">Meanwhile,
competition is intensifying, particularly from Australia, which is back
from the brink following its own experiment in tightening visa rules.
If we want to preserve our position, we need the Government to stop
being complacent about the UK’s international competitiveness
and change visa policy to reflect the value that a diverse and growing
international student body brings to the UK. Therefore, will the
Minister say whether he will continue to argue for a favourable visa
policy? This House will shortly debate the Immigration Bill, which
contains yet more provisions likely to deter international students. I
hope that the Minister will commit to finding ways to minimise the
impact of that Bill on universities. In anticipation of the Prime
Minister’s forthcoming visit to China, will he undertake to work
with universities to increase opportunities for UK students to study in
China, for example, by supporting a postgraduate scholarship programme
on behalf of the UK? Finally, will he ask the Home Secretary to look
again at the detailed university enrolment figures and reconsider the
inclusion of students in the net migration

Clement-Jones (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I first declare my interests
as deputy chair of the All-Party China Group, a partner of DLA Piper
and chair of its China desk, a former member of Huawei’s
international advisory council and a council member of UCL. It is with
great pleasure that I follow the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, as I
agree almost entirely with her comments, derived from her expert
knowledge of the higher education
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:08:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000093">I
warmly congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, on initiating this
debate. He set out the issues extremely well. I look forward to hearing
our two maiden speakers later in the debate. I also look forward to the
winding-up speech of my noble friend Lord Green who has been such a
great champion of trade with China during his time as Trade Minister.
We will be sad to see him
go.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000094">This
debate is extremely timely. We have the opening of the EU-China trade
negotiations on 21 November; on Friday we have the very significant
opening of the third plenum in China; it comes in the aftermath of a
whole series of official visits last month, including the so-called
“yin and yang” Boris and Osborne visits and we have the
visit of the Prime Minister later on this year or at the beginning of
the next. It is noticeable that, despite the hitherto frosty relations
with the new Chinese leadership in the 18 months running up to those
ministerial visits, major inward Chinese investment 
<?notus-xml column=335?>has been at record levels over the past year. We are now the top
European destination for Chinese inward investment and the noble Lord,
Lord Dobbs, mentioned a number of those very significant inward
investment levels. In that period, record levels of trade have also
been set between China and the UK: in April this year, Britain’s
monthly exports to China hit the £1 billion level for the first
time. As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, we also have an
agreement on renminbi trading in London, which will be of considerable
significance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000095">I
have made 30 or so visits to mainland China over the years. Having
accompanied my noble friend Lord Sassoon, the new chairman of the CBBC,
in his recent handover visit in September and taken part, last month,
in a visit to Shanghai by the China All-Party Group, I am absolutely
convinced that the prospects for trade and investment both ways between
China and the UK are now better than they have ever been. This partly
derives from the Chinese Government’s 12th five-year plan which
involves a comprehensive strategy towards a more consumer-led economy:
a more environmental and energy-conscious economy where the
services—insurance, pensions, health and education—and
the private sector become much more important, especially with
China’s rising middle
class.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000096">This
is, of course, not to say that China does not have major challenges to
overcome, which all impact on the overriding Chinese public policy: the
need for stability. The noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, set all these out
extremely well. However, both the plan and the challenges give us
substantial opportunities here in the UK. The all-party group visit
last month gave me considerable reason to believe that we can take
advantage of some of the welcome new initiatives such as the Shanghai
pilot free trade zone and the Qianhai special economic zone,
particularly in the provision of professional, financial and consulting
services.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110766000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000097">We
also have a great deal to contribute in our creative industries. As we
know, Britain has a great reputation—particularly following last
year’s Olympics—in architecture, design, fashion, film,
animation, games, television, advertising, publishing and music. We
have a great opportunity for creative and artistic partnership between
China and the UK, typified by the success of Thomas
Heatherwick’s UK pavilion at the Shanghai Expo in 2010. In the
automotive field, brands such as Jaguar and Bentley are experiencing
record success. In fact, JLR’s sales in China are now higher
than they are in the UK. China is leapfrogging the West in many areas
of environmental sustainability. Its need for green growth provides an
important market for UK goods and services.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110766000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000098">In all this, as the
all-party group heard from a whole variety of successful and well
established British companies in Shanghai, we need to stay ahead of the
game if we wish to compete effectively in China. China is increasingly
moving from licensing western intellectual property, know-how and
technology to developing its own, so British companies need to keep
innovating to stay successful. We also need to focus on those areas
where we can demonstrate efficiencies and better use of resources.
However, for our trade and investment to keep forging ahead, we need
SMEs to 
<?notus-xml column=336?>have greater self-confidence in entering the Chinese market. We really
do need to get this message home to UK SMEs and help them with expert
advisory services through UKTI, chambers of commerce and trade bodies
and, especially, through local authorities. There is no doubt, for
instance, that setting up close twinning relationships between Chinese
and UK towns and cities can be of great benefit to business, if done in
the right way. I am currently reading an interesting study,
recently published by Carl-Johan Carlstedt and Christopher Georgiou on
twinning opportunities, which will work if we get the structures of our
local government right. However, there is often an imbalance between
the Chinese and UK twinning partners. Consider the different population
sizes of Shanghai and Liverpool. Whether we have local enterprise
partnerships or some of the new initiatives that are being taken, we
need to make sure that our structures are suitably matched when we are
twinning with Chinese
cities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:15:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

value in itself of building bridges, we need to build bridges in areas
such as education and tourism. We need visitors to this country to
experience what Britain is like, which will help them to create those
links that are often of great benefit for business. I am thinking in
particular of the alumni programmes that some of our universities are
putting in place with Chinese students, whether as undergraduates or
postgraduates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:15:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to the question of visas, mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady
Warwick. We need to get our visa regime right. We need to give out the
right signals to Chinese students by excluding them from the migration
figures. I have no doubt that during the course of this debate we will
hear further on that subject.</hs_para>

that the main focus of our concerns should be not just on the
straightforward bilateral relationship between the UK and China, and
not just at governmental level—although that context is
extremely important. However, the plain fact is that China now operates
all around the world in a polycentric manner, and our interface with
Chinese activity and development needs also to be polycentric, not just
at government level but at all the soft-power levels, between people,
professions and organisations—and particularly in education,
which is why the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, was so
valid. Educational links are extremely
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:17:07"></hs_TimeCode> at
every level, including right down to primary level, at which

China is now the main trading partner of many of the most influential
economies in both the developed and so-called developing world. As the
noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, reminded us, those adjectives are rather out of
date. China has become the most sought-after source of capital.
Countries, including ours, do not just wait for China to come calling
but actively seek out and court Chinese investment. 
<?notus-xml column=337?>China now funds foreign Governments, underwrites or donates schools and
hospitals, and pays for and constructs massive infrastructure projects
throughout several continents. That often makes China, for the
recipient country, a considerably more attractive and easier investor
to deal with than the World Bank.</hs_para>

has a major impact on both west and east Africa. On the European scene,
the Chinese are active in Warsaw and other capitals in working out how
to develop shale gas, among other resources. They are very active in
Latin America and Australia—with which they now have a huge
trading partnership—and throughout the Indian sub-continent,
particularly in Pakistan and Myanmar. The Chinese are building a
colossal base at Gwadar in Pakistan and huge ports at Chittagong in
Bangladesh and Hambantota in Sri Lanka. I say almost in
passing that they are sending to the next Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting in Colombo next week 100 delegates in order to
involve themselves in business in that region. It sometimes seems as if
the Indian Ocean, rather than the Atlantic Ocean, is becoming the main
area of a new pattern and centre of world trade. Indeed, it is forming
itself into a sort of maritime version of the old Silk
Road—although that, too, is very
active<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:19:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

China now purchases global resources in such huge volumes that it has
become the commodity price setter and key influence on markets. It is
feeling its way to establishing the renminbi as a rival currency to the
dollar, experimenting in Hong Kong and now coming into London, which is
extremely welcome and good for us—as long as there is no
discrimination with other foreign banks in the City of London. China
has a stockpile of $3.5 trillion in foreign currency reserves. These
are enormous
figures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:19:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000106">On
the energy and climate side, China’s appetite for energy
resources and its own path towards a new energy pattern will frankly be
decisive on all of us, regardless of our own policies. It is the
world’s biggest coal importer, the world’s biggest oil
importer and the world’s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. It
is building rows and rows of new coal-fired stations—not
necessarily CCS-enabled, but very much more efficient than the old
ones—and a large number of new nuclear stations. It has massive
wind farm investments, although I put “investments” in
inverted commas because there is not much evidence that they are paying
their way or even being used; however, they are on a very large scale.
It is buying up oil, gas and coal concessions around the world. It
claims, so the Energy Minister there told me, to have more shale gas
than the United States; but I am told that the geology is difficult and
there is the problem, to which my noble friend Lord Dobbs rightly drew
attention, that it may lack adequate water resources. On the nuclear
side, of course, China will now be involved in our own nuclear fleet
replacement programme, beginning with Hinkley Point, although I shall
feel a bit more reassured when I see the money actually
arrive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:21:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000107">On
the social and political side, Chinese aid and investment around the
world help development, but in some cases they bolster despotic regimes
and aid states bent on violence and anti-democratic programmes. We need
to show the Chinese, in our dialogue with 
<?notus-xml column=338?>them, that those moves are against their own interests. They affect the

and foreign policy side, China wants to be a world power of a kind, but
if it is to be one, it will have to accept responsibilities at a
greater level than hitherto on the global stage. After all, it imports
50% of its oil from Iran and Saudi Arabia, but one has to ask just
where China is on Middle East issues, on Iran’s nuclear issue
and on Syria and chemical weapons. Quite often, the Chinese seem
outright detached or just

territorial expansion plans. As we know, it regards Tibet and Taiwan as
unquestionably part of China. It does, however, allow Hong Kong amazing
freedom, including its own currency and representation in international
bodies including parts of the Commonwealth, which is all very good for
us in the UK. China is now aggressive towards Japan, which is
regrettable; their two countries are vastly interwoven in trade terms
and together add up to about 18% of the world’s GNP, so it is

Valentine (CB):</Member></B> Our economic relationship with China is
often presented in terms of imports and exports. However, as chief
executive of London First—a business membership organisation
that helped to create the UK China Visa Alliance—I know that
this fails to capture the extent of the connection. Many UK
organisations do business with China in less obvious ways. Arup is
advising on construction projects, Prospects is helping Chinese
entrepreneurs to set up English language schools, universities such as
UCL, as we heard earlier, are opening Far Eastern campuses so that
Chinese students can benefit from our world-class education and, of
course, as the Minister well knows, Hong Kong is a thriving financial
centre with strong links to the UK through our historic association.
London is the lead location for Chinese investment, while in Manchester
the £800 million cash injection into “Airport
City” by a Beijing investor will make it one of the
country’s biggest construction projects since the Olympic
Park.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110766000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000112">But
there remain barriers to our economic relationship, and I follow the
noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, by zeroing in on the issues of tourist visas
and air links. Before I do so, I add my plea to those of previous
speakers for the Government to remove students from the net migration
target. The UK is unlikely to become a member of Schengen any time
soon. The unwelcome consequence of remaining outside is that would-be 
<?notus-xml column=339?>visitors to Europe can visit 26 countries on one visa but have to apply
for an additional visa to include the UK on their trip. On top of that,
we require them to supply fingerprints, which can mean a round trip of
up to 600 miles to one of our application centres. It is small wonder
that five times as many Chinese hit the shops on the
Champs-Élysées as empty their wallets in the West End.
The problem is not that we turn down too many applications, but that
not enough potential visitors apply in the first place. The growing
Chinese middle class makes up the world’s most valuable and
expanding tourist market. Chinese visitors spend more than 60% of their
travel budget on shopping, and last year they overtook American
shoppers as the world’s biggest purchasers of luxury goods,
accounting for 25% of the world market.</hs_para>

the Government are moving in the right direction. Recently they
announced a pilot scheme under which some visitors will have to fill in
only one form for the two visas. Next year, we expect the Schengen
countries to start demanding fingerprints as well, which levels the
playing field in one respect, although it is probable that this will
make it even less likely that the Chinese will want to go through the
hassle twice. I encourage the Government to go further by extending the
shared application process to all travellers, and ultimately to
collocate visa centres with those of other Schengen countries so that
the entire process can be as seamless as possible for our potential
high-spending visitors. While on the subject of border enforcement, I
also urge the Government to look at reducing immigration queue times at
airports. After a long flight, a target queue time of three-quarters of
an hour is hardly a welcome.</hs_para>

to my next subject. Armed with a visa we need, physically, to get the
Chinese to Britain. I do not need to reiterate that the UK is falling
behind European competitors in its air connectivity to emerging and
high-growth economies. Despite being one of the busiest hub airports in
the world, Heathrow is an especially weak link to China. In fact, China
is one of the destinations that globally are most frequently accessed
from a hub outside the UK. On the other hand, by 2015, China will have
spent four years building 82 new airports. We in the UK will be
awaiting recommendations that may or may not enable us to build just
one new runway in 10 years’ time. How confident is the Minister
that when those 82 airports have been built, all those potential
flights to the UK will have somewhere to land?</hs_para>

Kirkham (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, most of us as consumers or indeed
as retailers—a job which I have been doing for over 45
years—have benefited massively from the awesome Chinese economic
miracle. The world economy is underpinned by low-cost, high-quality,
great-value goods made in China, from kids’ toys to 
<?notus-xml column=340?>sex toys, from machine tools to motor cars, including 90% of the
world’s personal computers, 50% of the world’s ships and
70% of the cell phones. We in the West comfort ourselves with the
thought that it is all due to the Far East’s
“low-cost” economy, but I venture to suggest that this is
not entirely true. I say that not from knowledge derived from reading
books, academic research, trawling the internet or taking a brief for
this debate but rather from direct, on-the-ground personal experience
of transacting business with Chinese companies since 2000. From that I
can tell you without caveat or reservation that China is a massively
innovative society with a truly phenomenal work ethic, an absolutely
determined “can do and will do” attitude and culture and
a real commitment to
self-improvement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:29:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000117">China’s
ascendancy in the global economy is no fluke. When upwardly mobile
Chinese acquire surplus renminbi, their first thought is not to study
brochures for foreign holidays or flash cars—although China is
the biggest and fastest-growing new car market in the world, with
almost 20 million vehicles sold last year—no, their priority is
to invest in their children's education. That is a bit of good news for
us here in the UK because we host around 120,000 or 130,000 fee-paying
Chinese students in our colleges. If we did not play so hard to get or
make it so hard to get here, there might be even more Chinese
participating in that part of our knowledge

China to which I was introduced a short time ago at the turn of the
millennium has entirely vanished. It did so in just 10
years—although we are talking 10 Chinese years, which
seems equivalent to about 100 years of development anywhere
else on the planet. New China is on track to be the world’s
largest economy very soon. The country has evolved at an incredible
pace, segueing seamlessly into “brand China”. In 2008,
“brand China” gave us the world's biggest and best
Olympic Games, arguably until 2012, with its iconic and undeniably
brilliant Bird’s Nest stadium and a phenomenal,
never-to-be-forgotten opening ceremony. This was a “set the

Shanghai with its 24 million inhabitants. It has been developed into
the Paris of the East: fashionable, stylish, exotic and exciting with
its fine stores, restaurants, hotels, houses and apartments. That
tremendous civilised backdrop is conducive to networking and
transacting business, which is the lifeblood of China. It seems odd and
sad that it takes a visit to a nominally communist country to see
old-fashioned enterprise in action, enterprise that, through its
unstinting investment in infrastructure, has provided tens of thousands
of kilometres of highways and expressways and its own high-speed rail
network, to support, facilitate and power China's stellar growth. The
Beijing to Guangzhou high-speed rail line is the world's longest

investors, consumers and tourists, welcoming them with open arms. We
must make the UK a ravishingly attractive destination, dismantling
without delay every conceivable, perceived or real barrier and hurdle

the strongest possible trade links. We must act like a friend. Indeed,

<?notus-xml column=342?>from the two maiden speeches, to which we look forward. The importance

begin with the recent comment by Aaqil Ahmed of the BBC on British
religious illiteracy. I make a plea for attentiveness to the religious
and philosophical, not least Confucian, history of China, without which
we shall not be able to understand China today or tomorrow, in all its
bewildering and bedazzling complexity. As a metaphor for this
bedazzlement, we might consider the current exhibition of Chinese
painting at the V&amp;A, which the Foreign Office Minister opened a few
days ago, or cast our minds back to the exhibition at the Royal Academy
which coincided with the Chinese state visit of 2005, and displayed
wonderful artefacts of the Manchu emperors. Just as those paintings and
artefacts are of bedazzling complexity and subtlety, so is
China’s relationship with western religion and philosophy, and
with Christianity in
particular<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:38:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000127">When
Marco Polo visited Kubla Khan in the 13th century, he found
to his surprise, in and around Nanjing, ancient Christian communities
originating from Syriac-speaking eastern Christianity, probably from
the seventh, or maybe the fifth or sixth century, along the Silk Road,
following the economic tracks of the world. At a later date, there is
an extraordinary monument to a Christian bishop from the so-called
Nestorian Church of China from that early period. The combination of
Christianity and China is not something
new.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000128">In, the
17th century, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci settled in China for many years,
and accommodated his little community to Mandarin culture. By his time
those earlier traces of Christian communities had almost disappeared.
He experimented boldly with a Confucian interpretation of the Catholic
faith. In the end, he was not supported by Rome. If noble Lords want a
fascinating account of a dialogue between western philosophy and
culture and Mandarin culture in that period, Cambridge historian Mary
Laven’s book on Ricci’s mission to China is a very good
way in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:39:46"></hs_TimeCode>. The
stories of various 19th-century Protestant missions to China are much

point is that any understanding of the interrelationship between this
country and China needs to take into account religious and
philosophical dimensions that go back many centuries. Today, the Church
of England, largely through the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of
Canterbury, is building, as best it can, good relations with the China
Christian Council. Elder Fu Xianwei attended the most reverend
Primate’s inauguration earlier this year and, in a long personal
conversation afterwards, invited him to China. I have no doubt that, at
some stage, the most reverend Primate will accept that invitation and
implement
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:40:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000130">The
exponential growth of Christianity in China, especially in the growing
eastern cities, is not well known here. There are huge numbers of
practising Christians in China, amounting to many tens of millions,
although I agree that the exact figure is very hard to 
<?notus-xml column=343?>determine. They operate largely—to use western language—in
non-denominational church structures: roughly speaking, independent
congregations in loose federations. The Chinese Government have a close
interest in how religion helps in building a harmonious society, now
that communism is not the only player in China’s major global
role. Here, I particularly single out the work of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences in Beijing.</hs_para>

noted at the most recent National Chinese Christian Congress, in
September, are also making a major priority of international relations.
Here is an opportunity for British churches to respond to this as we
all give China the attention it certainly deserves. Co-operation is
also developing over theological education, especially at the national
theological college in Nanjing and with the Amity Foundation, in its
work with the poor in rural regions. Amity Printing Presses, in
conjunction with the International Bible Society, has produced 20
million copies of the Bible in Mandarin in recent
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:42:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000132">When
Matteo Ricci went to China four centuries ago, he took, as a present

Ricci discovered in return the riches of a deep and wonderful culture.
This whole debate is about the exchange of religious, philosophical,
economic and cultural gifts, et cetera. My plea is that, amid such a
rich exchange of gifts, we do not forget to show proper attentiveness
to the religious, philosophical and cultural traditions of China and
our own country, and their part in what will happen as we

China. This is a momentous occasion for me, so I would like to begin by
saying thank you. First, I thank my noble friend Lord Dobbs for
securing this timely debate and for his fascinating contribution. I
have been given the warmest of welcomes by all Members and by the

relatively little engagement with China, as it was yet to become the

would like to give some brief reflections on what I have learnt about
China as an executive at Tesco and former vice-chairman of the
China-Britain Business Council. This unique body, now led by my noble
friend Lord Sassoon, and so well supported by the Minister, celebrates
its 60th year in 2014. The visit of the Prime Minister in 2010, which I
was lucky enough to join, and the recent follow-up by the Chancellor
have greatly helped to push things along in a favourable
direction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000137">My
first point is that UK and Chinese interests can be complementary and
that trade is a natural area of collaboration. Even in the 19th
century, companies such as HSBC and Jardines built up trading
conglomerates and, indeed, cultural links that are still important
today. We know from the 2011-2015 five-year plan that China is
gradually trying to move its economy from investment to consumption.
Its economy has been very unbalanced and, given our recent reliance on
the service sector, it is a great opportunity to build lasting export
links for British
manufacturers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000138">The
area I know is consumer goods, which is a good example. Chinese
consumers are hungry for brands such as our own British success story,
Burberry. There is a huge opportunity for some of our great
shopkeepers, with Boots, Mothercare, B&amp;Q, Paul Smith and Tesco all
flying the flag there. I was also involved in seminars with MOFCOM, the
Commerce Ministry, on the transfer of climate change-related
innovation. China of course has a history of flooding and famine;
pollution is evident in the orange skies above Beijing and other
eastern cities. So there is a huge opportunity for exporting UK
expertise on green building, pollution control and carbon-friendly
refrigeration. Conversely, there is a wonderful opportunity for the
Chinese to invest in the UK and I was gratified to see the
announcements last month about Manchester Airport and Hinkley
Point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000139">I have
done business in many countries and I believe that Britain is the
country that is now most open for business. For the overseas investor,
it is easier to set up and get through the necessary red tape here than
in pretty well any other country in the world. Traditionally, there
have been visa impediments to Chinese investors and I am so glad to see
that the Government are now tackling those. However, we should expect
China to reciprocate and the Chinese to be equally welcoming. So far,
this has not always been the case with proposed UK investments in
China.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000140">My
second theme is: “Think local”. Working in Asia is very
different from working in Europe and especially from working in
America. Having a local Chinese partner makes a positive difference and
I would recommend it. Thinking local is also important in another
respect, because northern and southern China are very different, not
least climatically. The goods you sell and the services you offer have
to take account of these continental-style differences. China 
<?notus-xml column=345?>cannot be looked at through the prism of a homogenous nation. By
thinking local, UK firms can build networks with local operations
catering to specific local
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000141">My
final thought is about ambition. As the Chancellor said during his
recent visit, there is an ambition in China and a surprising sense of
optimism—similar, in a way, to Victorian Britain or 1890s New
York. The ambition of the Beijing Olympics inspired us to do even
better last summer. Britain excelled in Olympic sport and also, of
course, in creativity, with the sheer entertainment value of those four
extraordinary

and the critical importance of China. The China-Britain Business
Council, the noble Lord, Lord Powell, Sir David Brewer and my noble
friend Lord Sassoon have all played a part, but my noble friend Lord
Green’s experience as chairman of the largest company in the
FTSE—HSBC—and his experience in that part of the world
meant that he knew directly that China was not merely a foreign country
but a place with massive potential. From my perspective, he was very
much a John the Baptist in articulating most forcefully how critical it
was that we had a completely new relationship with China. He will be
much missed in his role when, in due course, he finds freedom and
liberation, but we hope that he will continue to guide our thinking in
many

The English language is the language of business globally. That gives
us the most extraordinary opportunity. I will recite all the economic
benefits of international partnerships and of overseas students. Over
and above the economic advantage for Britain of
this wonderful export industry, I believe strongly that universities,
particularly in the UK, are the places where intellect, integrity,
culture and values are set. At that age, people need a moral compass to
set them out on the world. The world today is not monochromal; it is a
global world with cultures mixing. I declare my interest as an
executive director of Odgers Berndston, where I people-traffic
corporate global leaders and, very often, leaders of higher education
institutions. The one thing in business that people need today is
individuals who are culturally sensitive. It is no good being a Brit, a
Welshman or a Scot; you have to be a global citizen.</hs_para>

view the world as one community. It is really hard to develop that
later on if you have never been educated with people of
different cultures and backgrounds. The privilege of UK universities
now is that they have become so multicultural and that people at that
age make their contacts and connections. When I was young, you
frequently did not go to even a mixed-sex university or college.
Perhaps it was very much composed of people of a similar social

Haskel (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord Dobbs, for initiating this debate because it brings back
many happy memories. When China announced the open-door policy in 1978,
I was an early businessman to go there. I sold the Chinese the
equipment and technology to make some of my firm’s textile
products and carry out some of our processes so that they could supply
markets that were closed to us in the UK. So began my business
association with China, which lasted many years.</hs_para>

loved going to China. The Chinese proudly took us to the technological
wonders, so graphically described by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkham. They
also patiently explained calligraphy, Beijing opera and Chinese art. In
the philosophical exchange called for by the right reverend Prelate,
they came here. The night before they went home, we always gave them a
farewell dinner at the Reform Club. There was a lot of interest in this
luxurious form of people’s commune. All this helped create the
personal relationships so important in getting things done in China.
This is because you never really know who is in charge, at any level.
The Communist Party maintains its monopoly on power by control of the
economy and access to it.</hs_para>

when the London Mayor and Chancellor announced their successful
business deals in China last month. The Chinese press reported that
business had been done because the Prime Minister had admitted that he
had mishandled or misunderstood Tibet. Here, some commentators ranging
from the <I>Observer</I> to the <I>FT</I> interpreted the business
resulting from this visit as kowtowing to the Chinese; I am sure that
the Minister saw these reports in the papers himself. Maybe that is
true, but to me it looked rather like desperate salesmen doing reckless
deals to achieve their quotas. Indeed, the signs are there: the
Chancellor announced measures to make it easier for Chinese banks to
operate in London by opening branches that are regulated from Shanghai
rather than subsidiaries regulated in London. This is exactly what
helped to precipitate the crisis in 2008 and, as the noble Lord, Lord
Dobbs, mentioned, we said, “Never again”. Of course, if
Chinese financial rules are reformed, it would be good for the City to
have a bank clearing Chinese currency in London—but at the cost
of bending our new banking
regulations?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000153">It

a concept not well understood or adhered to in China. And do the
British public have faith in this concept? I doubt it, after their

itself has criticised the system of regulation in place to oversee
Huawei’s operation here and its equipment that is now part of
our digital network. I am all for an open economy and Britain being
open for business, but there is a line between openness and
recklessness. We must be very careful not to surrender our ability to
operate and compete in important sectors of industry. Sectors where we
have strengths, such as space, must not be sacrificed on the altar of
inward investment. This is why we have to be sure that we are operating
the right business model. If we have contractors for crucial sectors of
our infrastructure that make it easy for us and make promises, as the
noble Lord, Lord Howell, explained, there is little redress when things
go wrong, and revoking such contracts is very expensive to us. There is
always the temptation to hide these errors because politicians do not
want to be embarrassed.</hs_para>

globalisation, our relations with China in business are complicated.
The modern supply chain is so involved that it is almost impossible to
track. You do not know if firms are trading with themselves or at
arm’s length. The harmonisation of standards is virtually
impossible, and this means the careful mutual recognition of
regulation. This applies as much to intellectual property rights and
data protection as to trade in goods and
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000156">All
this makes dispute resolution highly complicated. Remember, too, that
foreign companies in China are sometimes singled out for investigation
or state-led smear campaigns simply because they are foreign. This is
why we must have a reciprocal relationship with China, not a dependent
one, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, in her
excellent maiden speech, and bilateral co-operation rather than
reckless dependency—one of engagement, as the noble Lord, Lord
Dobbs, put it. These are all pressures on our business relations with
China. We have to think them through properly before doing more deals
that we may come to
regret.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/D653C67FAD81F9AC47A9DA344DFD8BE8039D9D92" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

other place, the Prime Minister assured us that the UK will
stand firm on human rights. It would be good to hear the
Minister confirm that there was no apology from the Prime
Minister for the Dalai Lama’s visit to London and his
meeting with him. Human rights and political reforms
are, in the end, the only way to
sustain and grow the prosperity of China. So old and deeply
talented 
<?notus-xml column=352?>a civilisation has the ability to resolve these
contradictions, and it is our hope—and our
interest—that it does so.</hs_parafo>

personal note. In the north-eastern city of Shenyang my late
mother-in-law, a brilliant German businesswoman, Erica Lederer, began
to manufacture decorative goods for the German market very shortly
after the cultural revolution. She admired the people, their skills,
their competitiveness and their friendship. At the centre of Shenyang
stands perhaps the biggest statue of Mao Tse-Tung in the whole of
China. Under his granite feet the talent and aspirations of ordinary

Whitby (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is truly an honour to speak for
the first time in this noble House. I begin by thanking your Lordships
warmly for your generous welcome and the staff of the House who,
despite my regular pestering, have been remarkably kind and
understanding. I would also like to thank all those people who have
helped me on my life’s journey to this point, not least my
sponsors and noble friends Lord Baker and Lord Edmiston, my family and
friends, who have guided and loyally supported me throughout, the
people of Harborne, who elected me, and my political friends and
colleagues from both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Parties, who
entrusted me for eight years with the leadership of the largest
metropolitan authority in the United Kingdom.</hs_para>

those years a considerable amount of my time and energy was focused on
developing and nurturing a sophisticated political relationship with
Beijing and several of China’s powerful cities. We structured a
campaign of engagement and business development between Birmingham and
China, a programme which used civic links to build bridges into China
and reinforce them with formal twinning between several major
cities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:21:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The
results have been impressively tangible. The Greater
Birmingham City Region exports £2.7 million-worth of
goods to mainland China, far more than the south-east region. We make
up almost a quarter of all UK trade with China and are the
only region in Britain that has a trading surplus with China
itself. That success is due in no small part to Jaguar Land Rover
exports, which increased 74% last year on the previous year and are
already ahead by a further 24% this year. As a proportion of
Jaguar’s total sales, China is now Jaguar Land Rover’s
largest global
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000177">Despite
the collapse of MG Rover in 2005, manufacturing is still taking place
in Longbridge. Most importantly, however, the new Chinese owner of the
brand, SIAC, has invested heavily in research, development and car
design, creating 400 engineering jobs. The MG magic, quintessentially
British, still has its heart in Birmingham, and the new MG3 was
recently launched from Longbridge in September. The combination of
British design and Chinese production is a powerful example of the
bilateral benefits of Chinese investment. The former premier of China,

Britain and China.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:23:33"></hs_TimeCode> welcome the
Government’s bold decision to reform the UK’s visa
application system. During my administration in Birmingham we increased
tourism from 29 million visitors in 2005 to 33 million in 2011,
generating more than £5 billion of economic improvement while
supporting 60,000 jobs. We are already a major destination for Chinese
business visitors and tourists and expect to double the number of
Chinese visitors over the next decade. The city region already attracts
7,375 Chinese university students, according to the latest statistics.
However, the challenge is that 83 million Chinese tourists left China
last year, the biggest tourism market in the world, spending
£63 billion between them. The United Kingdom saw just
a fraction of those visitors, with only 180,000 coming to the UK. I
believe that with sensible and sensitive visa arrangements we can
dramatically improve our student visitor
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000180">The
Greater Birmingham City Region is currently undergoing transformational
transport infrastructure projects such as New Street station, new metro

is essential to the growth of our regional economy and point-to-point
airline routes which connect you to the growth nodules of the world,

congratulating my noble friend Lord Whitby on his excellent maiden

vigorous leader of Birmingham City Council, the city of Joe
Chamberlain, which my noble friend served devotedly, not least as head
of a notable coalition administration, to which he made reference. He
gave us a fine taste of his vigour and determination in his speech and
will

is an important debate, for which we are indebted to my noble
friend—and long-standing personal friend—Lord Dobbs. It
provides an opportunity, among other things, to draw attention to the
extremely significant contribution made by British schools and
sixth-form colleges to the ever-expanding and closer relations between
our country and China. My noble friend Lord Kirkham made brief and
vigorous reference to that. The importance of education in bringing our
two countries closer together has not been neglected, but it tends to
be discussed almost entirely in relation to higher education. Our
universities and other higher education institutions are at the centre
of this dynamic academic relationship, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Warwick, and my noble friend Lady Bottomley reminded
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:28:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000184">Nearly
79,000 students from mainland China were enrolled in our higher
education institutions in 2011-12, nearly double the number in 2007-08.
However, it is important to note that this growth in numbers has been
assisted in no small measure by British schools, and in this
achievement our country’s independent schools loom large. I
declare an interest as president of the Independent Schools
Association, which represents the heads of some 300 smaller, less well
known independent schools and which forms part of the Independent
Schools Council, of which I was general secretary for some years,
working for some 1,200 schools altogether. I also speak as
president of the Council for Independent
Education—CIFE—which is a professional association of 18

people come to British schools from a wide range of countries. Some
come to our maintained schools: to the state boarding schools and
others that have an international outlook. But the vast majority of
overseas pupils come to British independent boarding schools and
sixth-form colleges, influenced no doubt by OECD surveys, which rank
our independent schools among the best in the world. Most of these
schools are members of the Independent Schools Council. Currently,
26,000 non-British pupils whose parents live overseas are being
educated in
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000186">The
growth in the mainland Chinese market has been one of the most striking
features of the recruitment of foreign pupils to British schools in
recent years. Traditionally, Hong Kong was the principal provider of
overseas pupils, but today, the number of new pupils from mainland
China is catching up with the number from Hong Kong, and will soon
overtake it. Their combined numbers account for nearly 40% of all
overseas pupils in ISC schools—slightly more than the total for
the whole of the European mainland. The mainland Chinese number
increased in the past year by 5.4% to a total of almost 4,000. This is
in addition to a total of more than 5,700 from Hong
Kong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000187">Chinese

pastoral care; a secure environment; opportunities for entry to UK
universities; and, not least, by the warmth of the welcome extended to

as a result of the comments made in this

other Members of the House in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, for

UK exports more each year to Ireland than it does to China. China has a
population of 1.5 billion. That is quite a statement and it
demonstrates the challenge that we face. We have barely 1% of
China’s imports, and Germany has 5%. We have got quite a long
way to go. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, in his
period at the department has done a lot, not only to encourage, but to
push things forward. I know this from personal experience; I went 
<?notus-xml column=356?>to see him about air traffic services. I am on the board of NATS. He
personally made some changes which have helped the development of that
organisation and it is now in 32 countries throughout the world.
Unfortunately, it is not in China. I ask the noble Lord, in the short
time he will still be at the department, if he would make sure that we
have a role there, on trade missions. Certainly, aviation is expanding
at an enormous rate in China. For an island, our connections with the
companies and countries that we export to are crucial. The noble

support what noble Lords have said, in particular what my noble friend
Lady Warwick of Undercliffe said about visas. There seems to be a bit
of a disconnect here; you talk to the civil servants and they say
“There isn’t a problem”. But we know that there
is, and somehow that disconnect has to be addressed. Bo Xilai sent his
son to Harrow. There are education connections which we could build on;
we have very few expats living in China, yet half a million Chinese

Ningbo. It is run by Nottingham, and when the university was built less
than a decade ago, it was built on farmland. Next year is its 10th
anniversary. The city has grown in population from 5 million to just
under 10 million in that short time. The university has 6,000 students,
10% of whom are international students, while the rest are Chinese.
They are being taught to a degree which is Nottingham University UK
accredited, and they are taught in English. The capital assets of the
university are held in partnership with the Chinese city fathers. The
chairman is a local Chinese woman, and the governing council has
Chinese members on it too. But the academics are not

day for such a debate. For today, the first ship will enter
Britain’s new port, London Gateway. This remarkable deep-water
facility will be able to handle 3.5 million containers a year and is
just 20 miles down the Thames from London. Earlier this year, the Prime
Minister described it as “an emblem of ambition”. So it
should be, but I was struck that all the coverage of this new port
referred to the imports that will be landing at London Gateway, many of
them from China. However, the plan must not be that these ships will
leave London empty. London Gateway should indeed be an emblem of the
ambition Britain has to build its exports. There is no more inviting

China.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000201">As we
have already heard, our performance has improved markedly. Last year
was the third in a row in which our sales to China increased faster
than those of Germany, France or Italy, but from a relatively low base.
We are still too far behind. Yet, as my noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe
said, there is an appetite in China for British-made goods. Jaguar Land
Rover, for instance, sold a record 73,347 vehicles in China last year,
an increase of 74% over the previous year. Burberry has been selling
its style in China for 20 years and last year Church’s

I was one of those fortunate to attend a wonderful event in the gardens
of Buckingham Palace. This was no ordinary garden party but an
opportunity for royal warrant holders to display their wares. From
sausages to silverware and 
<?notus-xml column=358?>cosmetics to clothing, the best of British was on show. As potential
buyers from abroad looked at what was on offer, the Queen and Prince
Philip toured the exhibition, doing their best to boost the sales
effort. Ten years ago, the idea of a trade fair at Buckingham Palace,
with Her Majesty taking on the role of head of sales, would have been
unthinkable. Now, however, Britain is really serious about bolstering
its export effort. We had a prime example last month, to which many

Wilson of Tillyorn (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, China is enormously
important. There are always new things happening there, and it is
endlessly interesting. I feel very supportive of the view that China is
now so much of a world power that we must be involved with
China, try to get China involved in all the major issues in the world,
encourage China to take part in international organisations, and
encourage those organisations sometimes to adjust themselves to take
account of China’s
joining<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:50:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000213">The
visit recently by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Mayor of
London to Peking seems to have put our own bilateral relationship back
on some good rails, and that is very encouraging because, without that
top-level relationship in good order, it becomes much harder to deal
with things at different levels. It is interesting to note that, as the
noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, in his splendid and far-ranging speech opening
the debate, said, over the past three years, despite some difficulties
in our own bilateral political relationship, our exports to China have
gone steadily up, and Chinese investment here has gone up
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:51:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000214">As
the major things have by and large been dealt with, I should like to
concentrate on some practical building blocks in the relationship with
China. The first is the importance of learning the language, to which
the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, has just referred. My attention
was drawn the other day to an extract from a foreign-language journal
in Shanghai. It lamented the fact that foreign businessmen in Shanghai
failed to realise that speaking Chinese was essential to promoting
trade. The date was January 1924. The point is still worth making, but
the good news about our trading relationship with China is the
significant number of young people, including from the United Kingdom,
who go to China, who deeply immerse themselves, and who speak very good
Chinese. I find that very

encouraging the fact that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office seems to
be reverting to a more traditional approach of believing that regional
expertise really does matter and that language matters. I understand
that, with the strong support of the Foreign Secretary, there has been
a great promotion of learning foreign languages, including Chinese. It
would be very interesting if the Minister had those figures because it
would inform
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000216">The
noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, referred to the single step that starts any
long journey. The single step is at a lower level. University work on
China, as he pointed out, particularly at PhD level, is not nearly good
enough. The number of students at university level is not good enough.
We also need to start at school level. There the picture is mildly
encouraging. I should declare an interest. I am president of the
Scotland-China Education Network, which tries to promote the teaching
of Chinese in Scottish schools under the inspired leadership of Dr.
Judith McClure, former head teacher of one of the major girls’
schools in Scotland. There are about 10,000 young people in Scotland
learning Chinese at state schools, and there will be more in the
private
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:53:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000217">There
are, however, practical problems. This gets back to the visa problem,
to which so many noble Lords have referred in different forms. There is
the problem of getting people from China to teach Chinese in our
schools throughout the UK. Recently, to take an example in Scotland,
the Confucius Institute in Strathclyde University in Glasgow wanted to
renew the contracts of some of their Chinese teachers who had been
there a year. The UK Border Agency has apparently changed its rule so
you can have a year, and it cannot be renewed. Some of those teachers
were told they could not come back. Late last night I was told that the
immediate problem has been resolved, but the underlying problem
remains: how do we get people from China to teach
Chinese<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:54:29"></hs_TimeCode>? There
is a similar problem at another Confucius Institute, the one at
Aberdeen University, where I have an expired interest, having stepped
down as chancellor at the end of last year. I hope the Minister will
take account of these problems, although they are not his departmental
responsibility, and try to bring together the UK Border Agency with
those who are involved. Perhaps it would be a good sort of birthday
thing to do before, sadly, he steps down from his present
post<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:55:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000218">The
noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, referred to the significance of law in China.
There was a very good programme here run by the Great Britain China
Centre, of which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, is president,
to train Chinese judges. About 80 have been trained in the past decade
or more. Funding, which came from the Ministry of Justice, has run out.
It is a very good, practical thing we could do. Those people go back to
China, their influence spreads, and it is extremely valuable. Perhaps
the ODA could take that

there is the matter of Hong Kong, to which the noble Lord, Lord
Goodlad, also referred. Our political position there has hugely changed
since 1997 but Hong Kong has institutions, a legal set-up and a
government structure which make it very user-friendly 
<?notus-xml column=361?>for people from the United Kingdom. It is a very good jumping-off ground
for trade and all involvement with China. I am sure that the Minister,
with his own personal background, will feel strongly about that and
therefore I can appeal to him to encourage his colleagues to continue
to see the importance of Hong Kong in our relationship with

entering your Lordships' House a few years ago to take a keen interest
in the nature of the relationship between the UK and China, of British
business and interests in China, and in the state and condition of the
Chinese in Britain. To this end, I also declare an interest as the
chairman of the APPG for East Asian Business, as co-chair of the

each of these roles I hear much about the challenges and criticism from
both sides in the UK-China relationship, from both the media and
through public debate, as well as behind closed doors. There can be no
doubt that there has been and will likely continue to be areas of major
disagreement and cultural and political differences in the relationship
between our two countries. I could spend much of this speech recounting
the historic disputes and perceived injustices on either side. These
might include British imperial imposition by gunboat on China of goods
such as opium and other wares which Gladstone described as morally
indefensible and which ultimately hurt us when our protected trade
succumbed to global competition. Similarly, companies in Britain at
times feel competition from China has been unfairly backed by a
favourable currency, state subsidies and an intellectual property
framework that historically has been hard to enforce, all under the
control of a Government who exert supreme authority over their citizens
and media.</hs_para>

could go on recounting such instances but I will not because these
issues are both complex and culturally and politically difficult to
resolve. Will we ever get agreement if we see the world just through
the Chinese leadership’s eyes? They are concerned to maintain
stability in a country that is known to descend into anarchy if not led
well and strongly; they are cautious about religion, as past cults have
led to extreme acts of violence and terrorism, such as the Boxer
Rebellion. The Chinese Government are keen to avoid other
countries’ determining their own internal affairs given colonial
experiences at the hands of almost every other major power. Or by
pushing our western liberal agenda onto China will we get it to agree
to open up faster, introduce democracy on our terms, give up its 
<?notus-xml column=362?>one-party communist system in favour of a fully western one with a
strong and free media and full introduction of the rule of law? Your
Lordships can see how these divergent approaches might not lead to
swift agreement in the short term. Instead, there is another, pragmatic
approach—a word that I choose because both the British and
Chinese in general are highly pragmatic people. That is to focus not on
what we disagree on at the outset, but on what we have in common. There
is a lot we have in common, more perhaps than we realise, and more than
is the case between China and many other of our competitor
nations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000225">First,
we share similar historical journeys. We as the first industrial nation
know what it is like to shift painfully from an agricultural society to
an industrial and then knowledge economy, with all the attendant
environmental, social, and political issues that this creates. We have
a lot of experience to humbly exchange with China on how to manage this
transition, and we can also learn a lot ourselves as China attempts to
do in 50 years what it took us hundreds of years to do, including
adapting our politics to meet the needs of a more urban, connected
society and innovating new solutions in healthcare, housing and
education in the 21st
century.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000226">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:00:23"></hs_TimeCode>,
we have a common economic interest. China is shifting from an
investment-led economy to one driven by consumption. We are the
services capital of the world and have a lot to gain by helping Chinese
consumers and service businesses in China flourish, harnessing our
knowledge, brands, and expertise. Having ourselves made the shift, we
can make a living exporting that know-how to help other emerging
countries make their shift as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000227">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:00:54"></hs_TimeCode>,
we both love learning. Our higher education and independent school
system is the envy of the world; many Chinese love to send their
children to study here, and the door is wide open for businesses from
Britain to share their vocational knowledge. Many UK businesses could
make a living from just doing that for the next few decades, let alone
trying to directly service clients in China, such as with Martin
Sorrell’s new advertising school in
Shanghai.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000228">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:01:07"></hs_TimeCode>
I witnessed at first hand the recent visit of the
Chancellor—where we with the help of the Manchester-China Forum
facilitated the announcement on Airport City—and the visit of
the Mayor of London, I saw much to praise in these developments,
because we focused on what we have in common, and not necessarily just
on what separates us. There is progress on tourist visas, on allowing
Chinese banks to more easily invest in Britain, and on enabling
investors to help fund our recovery. But there is still more that we
can do and ultimately, as a country, we have to choose how we want this
relationship to develop. Will we choose to let UK neo-protectionists
determine our foreign policy just as they did 200 years ago? Our
policies on abolishing the post-study work visa, a key draw for Chinese
students; on restricting the number of Chinese executives and family
members from coming to help Chinese CEOs set up headquarters in Britain
and create local British jobs; and on continuing to count students in
immigration statistics all seem to be of the same spirit as that which
Gladstone denounced,

will we let China romanticists determine our policy and expect to walk
into China naively assuming to be given a red carpet welcome like our
first ambassador to the Chinese imperial court, Lord Macartney? Some
organisations and SMEs I know still behave in this way, hardly
bothering to learn the language, or engage people who can speak it
literally and culturally, then wondering why so little was achieved. Or
will we perhaps choose another way, which is to provide UK-China
bridges, whether between individuals, cities or organisations, to let
people build trust and then decide and act for themselves? As much as
we have recently, laudably, reoriented ourselves at the centre towards
better China relations, we have also to acknowledge that many recent
breakthroughs in trade, from Weetabix to Royal Docks to Manchester
Airport City, university and other partnerships, often started through
the efforts of individual relationships: through the Anglo-Chinese
students and business people who became friends and set up their own
joint ventures, involving their parents and networks from the UK and
China; through stakes being purchased with the advice of lawyers,
friends, accountants and bankers; and through the Chinese diaspora in
Britain helping to build academic and commercial links. Perhaps our
role at the centre is to increasingly get out of the way, politicising
less, and making it easier for bridge builders and intermediaries to do
their
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:03:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000230">Finally,
in the recent Pew Research Centre global attitudes survey, we can see
that the population of Britain sees China less as an enemy than do
other nations, at 7% compared to the US at 18% and France at 10%, and
that the young here are generally more favourable towards China.
Perhaps we in politics and the media need to follow the public more
closely and let the people get on with it. Osborne and Boris can hardly
be blamed for making strong overtures to China; increasingly, they and
we by doing so are also playing to audiences at home. A strong UK-China
relationship is not just potentially good for the economy, but will
increasingly represent, for those keen to follow public opinion,
sensible politics as

so because China has been an institution in my life for a very long
time. I go back to 1949 when, together with my academic friend, the
noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, I sold Conservatism in the Labour valleys of
south Wales. The two of us, along with another, were the “brains
trust” in the Constitutional Club of Ebbw Vale. The first
question asked of us when we put our act over arose from the fact that,
on that very evening, a socialist called Ernest Bevin, then Foreign
Secretary, had recognised the People’s Republic of China. We
were asked whether we thought that this was at all a proper thing for
the British Government to do. Mercifully, we had both been subject to
academic instruction at Cambridge from Professor Eli Lauterpacht, 
<?notus-xml column=364?>the international lawyer, and we were very quickly able to define what
was necessary for China to be regarded as respectable, which was what
we told the socialist miners at the Constitutional Club. That has left
China planted firmly in my interests. Of course, it became

of the most striking things was to understand the huge leaps that the

only because of that magnetism. And that magnetism would not be durable
if they found their investments being dealt with unkindly. They needed

the picture that we were trying to get across, and it was that picture
which has laid the foundation for market economics, rather than
communist economics, that started in Hong Kong, but began spreading
through China as well. The extent to which that is now understood and
has been clarified by today’s debate is important. It has been
an accurate, encouraging and optimistic debate, and I think the

a liberal trading relationship with China. We recognise the importance
of our political relationship. Those arguments have been underwritten

Lord, Lord Dobbs, for securing this debate and for his wonderful
introductory speech in which he managed to give us a sense of focus. He
led us in what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford
called “an exchange of gifts”. I thought that was a very
apposite phrase. Who can complain about a debate in which there is
poetry—if you can say that limericks are poetry. The noble
Baroness, Lady Valentine, was kind enough to share her thoughts, an
aperçu, about some of the problems that the Government have
faced in relation to tourism and
trade.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000241">I also
pay tribute to the two excellent maiden speeches that have graced this
debate. Interestingly, they managed to reach the heart of the debate,
possibly in an unscripted way, but we benefitted from that. The noble
Baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, spoke about her experiences in China and
the lessons we could learn from the way in which trade is done there.
The noble Lord, Lord Whitby, spoke about work that is happening in
Birmingham—how investment changes things in a
locality—that is the reverse of the coin. These were both
influential and helpful to our understanding of this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000242" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0001.htm#13110766000242">I add
my congratulations to the Minister for a happy birthday. We have not
had enough of the noble Lord in this House and are sorry to lose him so
quickly. Ironically, as well as today’s debate, we are meeting
again next week in another debate, so we are going out in a rush
together. As many noble Lords have said, we are sorry that the Minister
will not be with us as we go forward into the New

seems to be common ground that, in addition to a wider understanding
and perspective on China, the key to the present relationship is in
improving our exports. That is desirable, possible and even necessary.
The UK currently exports $474.6 billion a year. We are roughly the 10th
largest exporter in the world. However, we are dwarfed by the amount
that China exports, which is more than $2 trillion, significantly more
than the United States which exports $1.5 trillion. UK exports to China
have grown in the past decade 
<?notus-xml column=366?>from $0.5 billion to nearly $3 billion. This is welcome, but it is from
a very low base. In the first two decades of China’s move
towards economic openness, the truth is that we have lagged very far
behind Germany and France in penetrating Chinese markets. According to
a recent article in the <I>Economist</I>, we export only about 50% of
the amount that France does and 30% of what Germany does. Our exports
to China are only just surpassing our exports to Italy. The graphs
crossed in 2011. As my noble friend Lady Dean said, we still export
more to
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000244">There
are no major political differences in our wish to improve our export
performance, including to China. As part of this debate, we need to
examine and address the reason for our continuing poor export
performance. Noble Lords are aware that the National Audit Office
published a report recently on how we support exporters overseas. It
makes for interesting reading. It says that exports need to grow by 10%
a year, every single year, to meet the Government’s target of
doubling our exports to £1 trillion by 2020. It goes on to say
that there seems to be no credible plan or measurement of progress to
reach that target. Obviously, UKTI has a key role but it supports too
few exporting British firms, according to the NAO. That is not good
enough. We have to help more firms to export. Government cannot bridge
this gap by itself; it is the firms that do it. We have to help those
that already do to export more.</hs_para>

underwriting that. As Daniel Kawczynski, a Conservative MP who has
written a report into UKTI performance, has said, over the past 18
months, just 18 small companies have used government export guarantee
products which are aimed specifically at them. If we do not deliver
more from that route, we are not going to be successful overall. To
address this weakness requires an overall system-wide approach within
the UK to guide us forward—a rethink of our industrial strategy
over the recent period. Whether we pursue this successfully will matter
far more in the long run to our economic relationship with China than
anything
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000246" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000246">Labour
has a credible agenda which the coalition seems to lack. This includes
financing innovation, building skills, developing our regions and
reforming our banks to ensure that they support the real economy. The
economic recovery seems finally to be getting going again after a long
and protracted period of stagnation, and that return to growth is
something to celebrate and nurture. However, with business investment
still on hold, bank lending to SMEs still contracting, youth
unemployment still very high and living standards still falling for
millions in this country, for most people, there is so far no recovery
at all. This is no time for
complacency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000247">In

from several noble Lords that they are optimistic that the UK economic
relationship with China will improve as China makes the inevitable
transition from being the workshop of the world to being a knowledge
and service economy. As this occurs, the argument goes, the Chinese
will demand more of our excellent services in areas such as finance,
the wider professions, health and higher education. As the noble Lord,
Lord Haskel, warned us, we must be careful. In recent years, British
universities have congratulated themselves on the large numbers of
Chinese who have chosen to study in the UK. They have been welcomed
here, and they have also become necessary to the survival of many of
our departments and courses. There are various reasons why these
students choose the UK, but an important one has been the lack of
appropriate courses at home. However, that is fast becoming an obsolete
reason, as Chinese higher education develops. The traditional elite
universities have taken stock of international examples, welcomed new
staff out of foreign postgraduate training, recruited foreign
lecturers, started to reform teaching and curricula and developed new
courses. Some 1,300 private universities have been established, usually
with flexible, practical and very work-oriented courses and
modules.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000249">So
China presents three challenges to the model we have of us being the
experts, giving them UK higher education. First, China will not for
long be a source of overseas students if its own universities overtake
ours. Secondly, Chinese higher education clearly intends to offer its
services in the world education market. Thirdly, in China there are, at
present, 16 million students in higher education, with plans for 20% of
secondary school leavers to be in higher education by 2010 and
50%—a familiar figure—by 2050. Even if a small proportion
of these have a first-rate education and can use English, they will be
competing with our graduates in virtually every field, unless, again,
we can provide something very special from within the United Kingdom.
Does the Minister agree that it is important to learn the lessons of
Chinese education, both positive and negative, and apply them to our
own
institutions?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000250" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000250">We
have heard that the Government are desperate to secure Chinese
investment in the UK. The tough regulatory approach to banking that was
introduced after 2008 has been relaxed to promote trading in the
Chinese currency in the City. Guaranteed electricity
prices—double the present level—have been offered to
secure Chinese investment in the EDF nuclear station at Hinkley. We are
not against these measures per se, but we would like to see a much more
serious debate about their justification and the implications that will
flow from them, so perhaps the Minister will comment on that when he
responds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000251" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000251">According
to a recent article in the <I>Economist</I> in June this year, perhaps
the single most disappointing aspect of the British economy in recent
years has been its export performance, about which I have been talking.
Against that background we have to remember that sterling is 25%
cheaper on a trade-weighted basis than it was in 2008, and yet the
trade deficit was still a stubborn £36 billion last
year—more than 2% of GDP. 
<?notus-xml column=368?>Of course, as many noble Lords have pointed out, this is partly the
result of a fundamental economic mismatch. Britain’s strength is
in services; China’s hunger currently is for raw materials and
machine tools. China seized 80% of the world’s metals supply
last year, boosting exports from Australia in the process. The odd
British firm, such as Rio Tinto, has cashed in, but countries such as
Germany, whose firms sell kit used in Chinese factories, have done so
very much
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000252">The
prospects for British cultural exports are much brighter. However, as
has been raised, there are real concerns about IP protection in China.
In 2011, Britain’s global exports of TV formats—exciting
programmes such as “Strictly Come Dancing” and
“MasterChef”—were worth £1.5 billion. I
hope that these figures will begin to attract more attention from UKTI,
particularly in relation to developing economies and
China.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000253" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000253">However,
the truth is that other countries appear to be taking better advantage
of the shifts in China’s economy. I shall end with some
questions for the Minister. As many noble Lords have mentioned, Britain
seems to have gone out of its way to establish a reputation as a
country hostile to business visitors, tourists and students. Visa
processing is still slower than for the rest of the EU. As a result,
London loses out to Paris as the place where wealthy Chinese like to go
to shop. Visa restrictions hold back exports in more subtle ways, too.
The <I>Economist</I> points out that Britain’s architectural
practices, for example, often want to hire staff from the countries
where they plan to bid for work, but this is almost
impossible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000254">In
2011, the Prime Minister said that he wanted to double trade with China
by 2015, but the gains that have been made are small. A much touted
2011 trade pact with China covered some 3% of the existing commerce
between the two countries. Germany and China, for example, recently
agreed on a deal which was 10 times bigger. Is the target set in 2011
still the one for which he is
aiming?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000255" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000255">My
noble friend Lord Haskel mentioned that the warm public welcome for the
Dalai Lama’s visit last year, which was largely arranged through
No. 10, has not helped relations between the two countries. Like the
noble Lord, Lord Watson, I would be grateful if the Minister would
comment on that, particularly in the light of the rather
underwhelming reception accorded to the Chancellor and the Mayor of
London when they visited China
recently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000256">Human
rights concerns still affect our relationship with China. It is not
just the regular house arrests but the lack of press freedom, the
oppression of minorities and the fact that religious dissidents
continue to be locked up. What representations have been made? What has
the noble Lord said to his Chinese counterparts when he has led
delegations to China? It would be interesting to reflect on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000257">A
continuous theme running through our discussions is that of language.
How do we deal with that? How do we get people to speak Chinese? The

covering emerging and developing economies including Azerbaijan,
Indonesia and Mexico, there is still no envoy for China. Is that the
case? Will the Minister also comment on a long-promised agriculture

Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills &amp;
Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend
Lord Dobbs for tabling today’s debate and for his
very informed and insightful comments. Indeed, I thank all noble Lords
for their very wide-ranging contributions. I pay especial tribute to my
noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe for her extremely insightful maiden
speech, which focused particularly on conditions in China, as did the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson. I also pay tribute to my noble friend Lord
Whitby for his insightful comments on what it is like at this end as
Chinese investment transforms British economic
conditions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000259">This
is an extremely important topic for us all and a very complex one. We
have covered a lot of ground in this debate and I will find it
something of a challenge to respond to all the questions and summarise
all the themes in the allotted time. I like to think that I have come
and gone to China over a long time but I am humbled by the fact that
the noble Lord, Lord Watson, first went there in 1977 and the noble
Lord, Lord Haskel, who first went there in 1978. I am a mere newcomer,
having first gone there in 1983. However, I think the thought resonates
with all of us that this is a society and an economy that is changing
rapidly and profoundly, and will continue to do so. The challenge posed
by this enormous, sophisticated and cultured country, and our
engagement with it, is of profound importance to British society and
the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000260">As
China continues to grow, so do our shared interests and
responsibilities. Our relationship is broader and deeper now than at
any time in our history. As I say, China is changing fast. I could go
on at length but one manifestation of that change is that Chinese
companies are increasingly going global and are on their way to
establishing global brands rather in the way that the Japanese did
after the war and South Korea more recently. China will be
next.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000261" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000261">China is
also becoming more sophisticated in its own research and development.
It now files the largest number of intellectual property patents of any
country in the world. Interestingly, there are more cases of IP theft
going through Chinese courts than in any other country in the
world—some 84,000 in 2012, only 2% of which involved
foreign companies. .In other words, China has got to the stage where IP
is an issue for Chinese businesses dealing with Chinese businesses,
which I think means that we can take some comfort that the authorities
mean what they say and intend to create a robust environment which
protects intellectual property and stamps out corruption and
fraud<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:26:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000262" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000262">China
is changing in other ways, too. The international role of China is
changing profoundly, as my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford so
articulately explained. This is a country that is taking its place on
the world stage. We often talk about an emerging power. It is not an
emerging power; it is re-emerging, or retaking its place on the world
stage. I like to remind my colleagues in business that in 1820 China
had the largest economy in the world and, 200 years on, it will be the
largest economy in the world
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:27:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=370?><hs_para UID="13110766000263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000263">China is also a country
with a deep cultural past. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Guildford reminded us, and others echoed, this is a country with a
long-standing philosophical and religious perspective. I have met some
of the characters mentioned by the right reverend Prelate and they are
very remarkable people. The authorities are very keen to see a
harmonious development of Chinese society and recognise the role that
faith groups can play, particularly in an urbanised
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:28:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000264">That
brings me to my next point. China is not merely changing fast but
urbanising fast. The figures are enormous. A number of speakers cited
figures in relation to aspects of China’s growth. China has the
most of almost everything these days, and the challenge posed to it by
urbanisation over the next 20 to 30 years will be the biggest for any
country, except possibly India. Something like 50% of its population
live in cities now, but this will increase to 60% in as little as
20 years’ time. The implications for urban
infrastructure, urban planning and the whole economy are profound. The
rapid transformation presents enormous challenges for the Chinese
authorities. Sometimes I think that the popular impression of China is
that the authorities sit in Beijing smiling quietly as more and more
Chinese companies invest and take over the world. That could not be
further from the truth. The authorities are very conscious of the
significant challenges of developing a very complex and large society,
and of the need to rebalance. They are well aware that at the moment
the Chinese economy is too dependent on investment and exports and
needs to rebalance
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000265">They
are also well aware of the issues in the rural areas: poverty, issues
of land ownership, the flow of immigration into the cities, which it is
increasingly difficult to control, and so on. Demand for products and
services like healthcare and education is expanding very rapidly and
will continue to do so for the next generation. On the plus side of
these challenges, a middle class is developing with the same sort of
appetite for branded goods that we all take for granted. It is,
therefore, no surprise that, as has been quoted, Jaguar Land Rover now
finds China to be its largest market. Some 80,000 vehicles were sold
there last year, and the number is growing rapidly. It is the second
largest exporter of cars to China after BMW. So there are lots of
challenges and plenty of opportunities,
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000266">Two
important themes have dominated this debate and I will touch on both of
them. The first is education and culture. My noble friend Lord Dobbs
spoke about Chinese language tuition in schools and universities. I
share his view of the importance of increasing the sensitivity of the
younger generation in this country to Chinese, which is about both
Chinese studies and Chinese languages. I am very pleased to report that
my grandson is, almost exactly at this moment, doing a presentation on
the warring kingdoms period of Chinese history. So he is being made to
learn something about that great
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000267">The
Government are committed to the learning of languages, including
Chinese, in schools and universities. We undoubtedly start from a low
base in the case of Chinese, but in 2013 the number of students
entering for a GCSE in Chinese increased by 20% compared to 
<?notus-xml column=371?>the previous year and there were more than 3,000 A-level entries. It is
a low base, but at least the direction of travel is right. In higher
education, language study is about choice. We have seen some shifts
towards languages that will better support employment outcomes in
growth economies, including Chinese. In 2011-12 the number of students
at UK higher education institutions taking Chinese studies was 1,870: a
small number, again, but the direction of travel is good. It is
important to note that there are many students not studying Chinese who
increasingly get a component of Chinese studies as part of more
multidisciplinary programmes. There are Chinese centres at Sheffield
and Nottingham, to name but
two.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000268">There
is plenty of work to do. My noble friend Lord Lexden and others,
including the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, also pointed out the
importance of education, not just at university but at school level. We
recognise the importance of schools introducing children to Chinese at
a young age and also the importance of being open to Chinese students
wanting to come here at secondary and tertiary level. Another aspect of
this is the importance of the engagement of British universities and
other colleges in China. The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, referred to the
work of Nottingham Ningbo. There are a number of other British colleges
and universities: Dulwich College in Shanghai is just one of them.
There are now some 230 research partnerships between British
educational institutions and Chinese ones. We cannot be complacent
about this. The noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, reminded us that the
Chinese are rapidly upping their game and the old-fashioned notion that
we have all the expertise and they have all the need is, frankly,
behind us. We should recognise these as joint experiences: partnerships
where we learn together about matters of importance to both our
economies and
societies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000269" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000269">There
is plenty of competition in the English-speaking world. As my noble
friend, Lady Warwick, said, the Australians have learnt the lessons of
some of their mistakes. We must make sure we have a supportive approach
to letting Chinese students, and others, into the British education
system. We need to minimise the impact of immigration rules on
universities. I have been asked in this House before whether I would
take up the question of excluding students from the immigration
numbers. In response to that suggestion, I have taken it up and am
happy to have another
go.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000270" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000270">Another
theme that came up repeatedly, not entirely unrelated to education, is
visas. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, and others, drew attention
to the ease with which you can get a Schengen visa. There is some
mythology around the numbers of these visas and where people actually
go. In his opening speech, my noble friend Lord Dodds said that seven
times as many Chinese visitors go to France as to Britain. This is
actually quite difficult to verify. One hard figure we do have is the
number of visas issued. In 2012, the French issued 277,000 visit visas
and we issued 210,000. So they issued one-third more than us rather
than seven times
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000271">Chinese
exit data on first destinations for Chinese travelling abroad show that
the UK was the top European destination in 2010 and second to Italy in
2011. My general point is not that we should be complacent but 
<?notus-xml column=372?>that the numbers are quite hard to pin down. It is plain that we need to
expect more and more Chinese visit visas over the coming years, both
for tourism and for business and educational purposes. Specifically, we
expect the number of visa applications to top 1 million by 2017. To
facilitate that, and the processing of this very large increase in the
number of applications, we introduced a number of
measures.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110766000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000272">Last month, in Beijing,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced measures to streamline and
simplify the visa process for Chinese nationals who want to visit the
UK for business, study or pleasure. This includes plans to open a
24-hour visa service and streamlining the UK and Schengen visa
application process. As the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, pointed
out, the Schengen process itself is moving—or so they
claim—to biometrics, which will level the playing-field. I hope
that we will increasingly be able to provide, in effect, a
one-stop-shop service for Schengen and UK visas. We will, of course,
always be left with the greater flexibility of Schengen. I suspect
there is no one in this House who would argue for us joining the
Schengen accord at the moment.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110766000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000273">We will do our best on
visas and I assure noble Lords that the Government recognise the
importance of ensuring that the process works as seamlessly as
possible. The forms are now in Mandarin, which was a good start. We now
have more offices around China: more than the Schengen area does.
Progress is being made in discussions with Schengen about how to
converge the two processes as much as possible. I noted comments from a
number of noble Lords on the importance of ensuring that the visa entry
rules for both students and business are as business-friendly and
education-friendly as we can make them. I am always happy—and so
is UK Trade and Investment, the office which I oversee—to
discuss any problems that specific institutions or firms have with
getting people in, within the context of the overall policy. We are
plainly not going to throw the whole policy up in the air but we need
to make sure that, in practice, it works for business as seamlessly as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000274" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000274">I
turn to inward investment, which is a very important topic for the
economy in general. It is a great and long-standing competitive
strength of this country that we are open for inward investment from
all countries in the world. It is very difficult to imagine a number of
our obvious competitors being as sanguine as we are about investment
in, for example, the water supply of the national capital. Some 9% of
Thames Water is owned by the Chinese sovereign wealth fund, as is
10% of Heathrow. We welcome these investments. We
also welcome the deal announced by EDF in respect of Hinkley Point C,
which is a good deal for this country. The entire nuclear industry,
irrespective of who is investing in it and who is building it, needs to
be properly regulated, for all the obvious reasons, but we are
committed to the importance of nuclear as part of the energy mix. We
have to invest substantially over the next 10 to 20 years in nuclear
rebuild and we should welcome the involvement of foreign direct
investment—including from China—so long as it is properly
regulated and overseen.</hs_para>

Haskel, mentioned Chinese banks in London. The fact that we offered to
allow 
<?notus-xml column=373?>them to operate through branches, as opposed to subsidiaries, does not
mean that we are not going to regulate them, although they are, of
course, regulated by the authorities in Beijing—not in Shanghai,
incidentally—which would be the case whether or not they were
subsidiaries or branches. They will also be regulated by the Prudential
Regulatory Authority, whether they are subsidiaries or branches,
according to the highest standards that the PRA thinks fit. I am very
happy to assure the noble Lord on that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:39:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

discussed and I am not sure that I have anything useful to add to the
exchange that has already taken place. I know the managers of that
company, both here and in Shenzhen. I believe that they are
committed to doing good business in this country and are certainly
investing and building up the skill base in the way that my noble
friend Lady Wheatcroft mentioned. All Members of the House
will be aware of the security arrangements that are in place and are
currently subject to review, following the report from the
Intelligence and Security Select

which are the other side of the coin. Every speaker has referred to the
fact that we have a long way to go on this. We start from a low base
and market share. I have always found completely unacceptable the
notion of being behind not merely Germany, which is possibly
understandable, but France and Italy. The good news is that we have now
overtaken Italy. The good news is also that we have grown faster than
all three of those countries for the past three years, but this is a
long journey and we have to keep at it.</hs_para>

importance of building relationships and making long-term commitments
is something that everyone has underscored. It is true everywhere but
it is certainly true in a country like China. Businesses need to spend
time and need help. When it comes to small businesses, which were
referred to by a number of noble Lords, it is important for the British
Government to ensure that the role of UK Trade and Investment, working
in partnership with the China-Britain Business Council, is as effective
as possible in supporting those who make that journey by de-risking the
decision for them and helping them to attend trade fairs. I am pleased
to report that we have increased the number of resources we have on the
ground in China, not merely in Beijing but around the country. We have
increased the amount of money available for attendance at trade fairs
and, by the way, we have increased the number of trade advisers in this
country.</hs_para>

respect of finance, we have substantially revamped UK Export Finance;
it is not now the case that as few companies have been able to access
UKEF as the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, referred to. Indeed, its
business is growing rapidly and I have asked it to triple its book over
the next two or three years. I am afraid that I shall not be in office
to see this happen but will be cheering from the sidelines. UKEF is now
on the way and the momentum is clearly there. It now has more than
£1 billion of support for small businesses, compared with almost
nothing three years ago. So the direction of travel is
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:42:33"></hs_TimeCode>. We need

Lord, Lord Wilson, I should like also to refer to the capabilities in
the Foreign Office. We have 60 new staff working across the network in
China, a third of them focused on less well known provinces and
second-tier cities. I was recently in Wuhan, a city that we the British
have neglected; the French are the dominant foreign presence there and
we need to put that right. What is true of Wuhan will, frankly, be true
of dozens of other cities. We have a long way to
go<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:43:14"></hs_TimeCode>. We have been
investing in language training in the Foreign Office. I have some
numbers somewhere that I cannot find, so I will write to the noble
Lord, Lord Wilson, with the details. We have substantially increased

explicitly to some of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson. I do not have the time to discuss Britain’s
industrial strategy, except to say for the record that we the coalition
believe that it is a coherent strategy that is bearing fruit, and we
need to stick at it. We need to invest in the skills that equip the
next generation to succeed in a competitive world. There is no turning
back from this globalisation. There is no turning back from the
challenge of ensuring that education and apprenticeship systems work
correctly, that we connect up research and development at university
level with businesses and that we invest in appropriate partnerships in
key sectors. The sectors involved for the British economy are very
wide—all the way from advanced manufacturing and aerospace,

with just 30 seconds on Hong Kong, as my time is up. Hong Kong remains
extremely important to the British relationship with China generally,
as well being important in its own right. I had the great honour of
living in Hong Kong when the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, was governor
there, and I have seen it change rapidly over the years. The closer
economic partnership agreement is in place between Hong Kong and the
mainland, which means that a company operating in Hong Kong can do
business in the mainland without further restrictions, and several
hundred British companies in Hong Kong have the opportunity of building
their business in the mainland through the Hong Kong gateway. It is a
very important asset in terms of the competitiveness of British
businesses in China, when compared with that of our European
counterparts and
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:45:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the importance of this debate. No country is strategically more
important to us than China. This is a long journey forwards in the
relationship. It is a complex country and there are massive
opportunities. Of course there are many political and economic
challenges on the way through. The dialogue needs to be open, honest
and continuous. Given that two or three of your Lordships quoted
Mao’s saying that the longest journey begins with a single step,
I should like to add another: this journey is a marathon, not a
sprint.</hs_para>

House who participated. My noble friend Lord Green’s summing up
has been most helpful; he has been for so long at the sharp end of
things and his time at the coalface has been hugely productive. He
deserves his retirement but we shall miss him. I must once again
congratulate my noble friends Lord Whitby and Lady Neville-Rolfe who
made their first speeches in this House. But my friendly neighbourhood
Whip has whispered in my ear—a loud Chinese whisper—that
we are out of time. I must apologise, therefore, for being unable to
refer to other individual contributions. I hope that noble Lords will
understand and forgive me for that. The debate has been a credit to
this House. Its messages were put quite superbly and came across loud
and clear. The Chinese sometimes say that Britain is a small island, a
long way away, which makes a lot of noise. It means at least that they
hear us, and that sounds like a pretty good place to start—and
also to stop. I beg to

Soley:</Member></B> My purpose in bringing this Question before the
House is to try to initiate some long-term thinking on the way in which
we supervise our security services, the impact of high technology, the
pace of change compared to our legislative process, and, importantly,
the freedom and security of the internet.</hs_para>

that there is no reason to doubt the importance of the security
services to the freedom of the people of this country and their safety.
I say that not least because of my memory of my involvement in Northern
Ireland in the 1980s. Equally we have to be clear about what we are
defending. We are defending freedom and a way of life, which, as we all
know in this place, means that we have to have a good system of
parliamentary accountability for the security services. I do not take
the view that accountability has been totally useless, or whatever some
people have alleged, but there is considerable room for change, and we
ought to start addressing that in some detail, which is why I want a
slightly longer debate than we are able to have in this one
hour.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110766000287" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000287">My
first point to the Minister, to which I hope he will give some
long-term thinking, is the pace of change in technology. It
is a crucial problem and has been so for some years. Technology,
particularly information technology, moves so fast that the ink is
hardly dry on the Acts of Parliament that we pass before they are out
of date. We really have to find a new way of dealing with this. There
are a number of possible options, but the one I have looked at with
some interest—and I know that this has been referred to in
discussions about the data communications problem—is a hybrid
between a Select Committee and a legislative Committee that looks at
the constantly changing 
<?notus-xml column=376?>technology and how to bring changes into effect in existing legislation.
We have a number of ways in which we do this in other areas in the
House. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which I
was on, is one way of doing it; we ought to consider that. This House
is very strong on science and technology, and we have here people with
a great knowledge of information technology. The suggestion that I make
to the Minister—although it is a matter for the House
authorities as much as for him, but support from the Government would
be helpful—is that he look at whether we could introduce a
committee process which would enable a detailed look at the way the
rapid change in science and technology affects our legislation, not
just on the security services, although clearly that is the most
important one in the current
context.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000288" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000288">The
other issue I ought to say in opening is that although I would disagree
entirely with Snowden’s release of all this information, which I
think was grossly irresponsible, in my humble judgment, if he were put
on trial before a jury in this country, he would probably be found not
guilty on the basis of a public interest defence. There is probably
enough in what he has done that revealed to us things that we did not
know about which would give him a good defence in that area. I do not
think the Government are necessarily thinking of it, but getting into a
battle either with newspapers, Snowden or anybody else on
this would likely be a losing battle. It would be far better
to address the issue than to deal with it that way. I only wish that
Russia and China could have a Snowden as well; actually, it might even
the field up a little bit.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110766000289" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000289">I turn now to the
internet. Next year, it will be 25 years since the invention
of the internet by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. I hope we will find ways of
celebrating that because it is, in my judgment, by far the most
important way in which the people not just of Britain, but of the world
have been able to communicate, and it has been a great engine for
freedom. However, what has happened recently has been a gift to some of
the more authoritarian countries and some of the more authoritarian
organisations which would like to close down the freedom of and access
to the internet. One of the things that is most troubling about what
has been happening with the security services is this business of
interception of the internet services. For example, the Google
fibre-optic cable being breached is a matter for concern. One has to
ask whether the Prime Minister, any other Minister or the intelligence
committee knew that that was about to happen. Was it ever considered by
them?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110766000290" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000290">This
brings us straight into the third and main point of this debate, which
is whether we can improve the way our security services are subject to
parliamentary oversight. Much of the comment made outside has been
based on an assumption—a wrong assumption—that because
the security services, through the Tempora system, have been hoovering
up lots of information, all of that information has been read or looked
at. It has not been; it is the case that in Britain, you need to have a
warrant if you are going to look at the content of these things. What
troubles me is that, although you might need a warrant in the UK, you
do not 
<?notus-xml column=377?>necessarily need it overseas. There is a particular problem here in that
the communications network between Britain, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and the United States—the so-called
“five eyes”—are interchanging information all the
time and are using our systems. Therefore, it must be said that, given
that the United States is now accepting that it intercepted the phone
of Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of a friendly and liberal power, now
with a very good constitution—not least because we wrote
it—the very least that should have happened is that the British
Government should have been aware of it. However, It was probably done
with some interaction with GCHQ, even if they did not know about it. In
other words, I suspect that the inter-linkage between the National
Security Agency of the United States, GCHQ here and the other
surveillance organisations in New Zealand, Australia and Canada is not
really supervised by any of the parliamentary structures in any of
these countries.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110766000291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000291">We have a very real
problem, which is far greater than we have had in the past, about how
we carry out effective oversight of security organisations operating on
all our parts. The Intelligence and Security Committee is doing very
good work, and I greatly welcome the way they have opened up their
processes in recent times. I am sure the Minister will want to record
that. I still say that it is not enough, and that we should have a
long, hard look at the way in which we oversee this international
co-operation, because it means we will be involved in some of the
things we might say we would not do, like tapping the Chancellor of
Germany’s telephone. I do not know whether that was done as the
result of the ability of the Tempora programme in GCHQ, but a Minister
should have known and should have been able to give a clear reply of,
“Yes, we did know that” or, “No, we did not know
that”. I suspect that the answer is that we did not; in fact, I
am almost sure of it, but it might have been done as a result of that
co-operation. That linkage is extremely important, and we cannot ignore
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000292">There are
other areas of this supervision that are critical to us. MI5 and MI6
have been quite good recently at opening up and speaking in public, but
I can not say the same about GCHQ. GCHQ needs to be much more open than
it has been, with all the difficulties that implies. When I suggested a
while ago that GCHQ ought to be much more receptive to visits from
parliamentarians, whether of this House or the House of Commons, the
answer was, “Well, we are nervous about some MPs or Members of
the Lords”. My response to that is, “Well, I am nervous
about some of the people who work for GCHQ”, more than one of
whom I have met and would have some anxiety about. We cannot address it
that way; you have to say that they must be accountable to Parliament
and we must be able to have those discussions. As MI5 and MI6 have
discovered, you can actually deal with the difficult questions and
challenges that you face in a parliamentary system. It is that which
makes us stand out above the others and makes us different from some of
the other countries that are delighted about what Snowden is
doing—but he is not, of course, looking at their own systems,
which they would desperately hide from all of us.</hs_para>

within my time, not least because I hope to give a little more time to
others and to extend this debate on other days, but I ask the Minister
to take away and look at this business of how we legislate for
high-technology change in a slow legislative

Blencathra (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Soley, on securing this debate. I deeply wish that it were not
necessary, but in my view, the legal basis under which the security
services operate—RIPA—is no longer fit for purpose. I say
that as the Peer who had the privilege to chair the Joint Select
Committee on the Draft Communications Bill last year, the so-called
“Snoopers’ Charter”. We considered the rapidly
changing technology, and no area is changing faster than this. I refer
the Minister to our conclusion in paragraph 289, where we recommend the
super-affirmative

colleagues in both Houses who have not been properly and publicly
thanked for the excellent job they did on that Joint Select Committee.
We made a pretty good job. We decimated the draft Bill and came up
instead with workable solutions which were unanimously agreed by the
whole committee, even though many of us had very different views on the
balance between security and
privacy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:58:57"></hs_TimeCode>.

of government—any government—to maintain the safety and
security of law-abiding citizens, so that they may go about their lives
and their business as far as possible in freedom from fear. This is not
only in the public interest; it is in the interest of law-abiding
members of the public. For this the law enforcement authorities must be
given the tools they need. Reasonable access to some communications
data is undoubtedly one of those tools. But the Government also have a
duty to respect the right of citizens to privacy, and their ability to
go about their lawful activities, including their communications,
without avoidable intrusions on their privacy”.</hs_quote>

were the conclusions we came to last year in the light of what we knew
then. Although Prism and Tempora were at the centre of what we were
being asked to look at, we were deliberately kept in the dark about
them. It is my personal view that the draft Bill was clearly an attempt
to legitimise what the security services were doing already. Of course,
they may be talking publicly about it, but they refuse to come to
Parliament to tell us about the Bill they were demanding that we pass.
This situation cannot be allowed to continue. We need a wide-ranging
debate about the balance that we described in our conclusions. We said
that they should have reasonable access to some communications, not
uncontrolled access to anything they liked or beyond what Parliament
intended. This is the key point: whether the security services were
technically operating under some part of RIPA is irrelevant. What is
wrong, as we have discovered over the past few months, is that they
were doing things way beyond the imagination of Parliament and which we
did not know about. I have no brief for the <I>Guardian</I> 
<?notus-xml column=379?>and its general, Polly Toynbee, bleating for someone else’s money
to be spent on its favourite causes, but in my opinion the newspaper
has done a service by revealing the reach and the extent of what was
being done in our
name.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000297">I
detest traitors who reveal secrets which endanger national security,
but there is a greater threat to our freedom when powerful agencies of
the state feel that Parliament must be kept in the dark about the
parameters under which they operate. I say “parameters”
because we do not need to know, nor should we know, the operational
techniques and methodology of the security services, but we should have
known that they had the Prism and Tempora capability and were using it
under rules agreed by Parliament.</hs_para>

the early 1980s, I sat in a trench in Germany and asked my commanding
officer, “What is my mission, Sir?”. “Your
mission, Maclean”, he said, “like the rest of us, is to
try to hold them back for 48 hours to give the politicians time to nuke
‘em”. In those days, breaching national
security could have resulted in the complete nuclear annihilation and
destruction of the western world, and that was what traitors
like Burgess, Philby and the other Maclean were
doing. It is preposterous for senior figures now to suggest that
Snowden is in the same league as those traitors. He is not, and that
should be obvious. There is also a need for a debate about what is
national security now. Clearly a dirty nuclear bomb in central London
which renders the capital unusable and uninhabitable for 50
years is a mega threat to national security. However— and I
choose my words very carefully so that I am not
misunderstood—much as a terrorist bomb that kills 100 people is
an abominable evil and we should try to stop it, is it a threat to
national security in the same way as nuclear annihilation in the 1980s?
Is it a threat that requires the communications of 56 million
law-abiding people to be collected in case there is an evil
terrorist among them? I do not know, but I do know that this
Parliament—your Lordships’ House
and the other place—must debate it and
collectively strike the balance between reasonable
access on the one hand and privacy on the other.
We must have replacement legislation for RIPA along the lines
recommended by my committee, with proper checks and balances on the
security services. We need that debate, it must be wide-ranging, and we
need it
soon.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/C9DEC3D32462FBDBB44BE263A6BE63C241B5F0B7" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

Northern Ireland. I have to say right at the beginning that I know at
first hand the good that the security services do and about the lives
they have saved. Those are not the hundreds that the noble Lord just
referred to, but in one case it was thousands. Overall, it has been
many, many thousands of lives in this country. I know also that much of

obvious. It is right and fitting in a democracy that all the agencies
of the state are accountable to and overseen in an appropriate fashion
by the elected representatives of the public. The intelligence agencies
are a special case since inevitably much of the work they have to do
must be carried out in secret. That does not mean that they are
unaccountable. Indeed, over the decades we have constructed an
elaborate degree and system of oversight. Their work is carried out in
accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that
their activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate—I
will come back to this. At the heart of the framework are two Acts of
Parliament, not only the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act 2000, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, but also
the Intelligence Services Act 1994.</hs_para>

rigorous system of oversight of the activities of intelligence services

Commissioner and the Intelligence Services Commissioner, and scrutiny

this system of oversight have been added to by the interviewing of all
three heads of the intelligence services in public and on television.
That is an extension that is happening even as we speak. The
fundamentals of the system of oversight and accountability have not
changed, and indeed we have been assured of this by the Foreign

is the present controversy all about? If the fundamentals and the
objectives of the intelligence services have not changed, what is it
that has changed? It is the world that has changed, and it has done so
exponentially. That is not least in terms of electronic communications,
as referred to by my noble friend Lord Soley. Cyberspace is now an
environment that permeates everything we do. It is an environment that
offers great opportunities for information, communication, personal
empowerment and advances for good, but it is also an environment that
offers equally great opportunities for the bad: for, among others,
international crime, terrorism, paedophiles and hate crimes. These, and
others intent on malevolent action, no longer communicate directly
using a simple telephone line from A to B. Put simply, they now
communicate across the world by voice over ISP, the internet, by
e-mail, by text or by concealment on web pages. That is what has
changed, and crucially, all of these traverse the globe. They are
transnational, not even international. All those whose activities are
of malevolent intent use these electronic means.</hs_para>

can tell noble Lords that when I was Home Secretary I looked at a
number of plots, on some occasions between 40 and 60. Not one was
confined to this country alone. All of them involved communication
between people in at least two countries, while a major one involved
people in 20 countries. That is the nature of the world in which we now
live. The job of the intelligence agencies has thus been made
infinitely harder in maintaining surveillance. I can tell the House
that Sir Iain Lobban has only just told today’s hearing that we
have to, “anticipate, discover, analyse, investigate and
respond, and we have to do that globally”. That is him speaking
for GCHQ. How can I tell noble Lords that? It is because I have an iPad
which communicates 
<?notus-xml column=381?>to me in real time via the BBC what is being said in another place and
communicates that simultaneously around the world. That is the world we
are now living in and which our intelligence agencies have to cope
with. They are faced with an infinitely greater task than ever. They
are still looking for needles in a haystack, but the haystack is now

have been assured by the Minister that the nature of the surveillance

therefore in order to discover who is communicating with
whom, the security services have to operate under

from a Home Secretary; that has not changed. So it is incumbent upon us
to recognise that while information should not be kept unnecessarily
out of the public domain, a balance must be struck. In order to
safeguard sensitive methods and sources and to ensure that the secret

Strasburger (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Soley, for initiating this important debate. Let me start with two
tributes. First, I pay tribute to our security services which do an
excellent job of keeping us safe. My second tribute goes
jointly to the American whistleblower
Edward Snowden and to the <I>Guardian</I>, which has published his
astonishing revelations. Both have been brave and highly
responsible—all but one of the <I>Guardian</I> articles was
approved in advance by the Government—and were it not for them,
we and the rest of the world would still be in the dark about what the
NSA and GCHQ are up
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000307" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000307">This
scandal, for that is what it is, is not the fault of GCHQ, which
naturally will grab all the tools it can until it is stopped. The blame
falls on those in this country and in America who should have been
watching over the spies. In the UK, I am talking about the Cabinet in
this Government and the previous Government, the National Security
Council and the Intelligence and Security Committee. These bodies are
supposed to oversee the security services. It is their job to ensure
that the British people are not only safe but that their privacy is
protected and that intrusions into our private lives are proportionate
and justified. In the case of GCHQ’s Project Tempora, they have
all failed miserably.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110766000308" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000308">The only way such
highly intrusive powers can be granted in a democracy is with the
informed consent of the people, via Parliament. Parliament was
certainly not informed about Tempora, nor has it given its 
<?notus-xml column=382?>consent. We parliamentarians knew nothing about the way GCHQ was helping
itself to the private data of every citizen until the <I>Guardian</I>
exposed it. The Cabinet, the NSC and the ISC have all been asleep at
the wheel while GCHQ ran out of
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000309">The
ISC, which has the most intimate access to the security services and
should have known what was going on, lacks resources and the skills
needed to understand the technologies being used. It has clearly failed
to ask the awkward questions it should have been asking. The ISC must
be unfit for purpose, even in its recently modified guise, and there
are questions about its independence. Parliament should not have had to
rely on a whistleblower to reveal Tempora’s massive abuse of
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000310" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000310">Furthermore,
the Home Office has deliberately ensured that Parliament is kept in the
dark. Last year, I sat on the Select Committee on the draft
Communications Data Bill, under the very able chairmanship of my noble
friend Lord Blencathra, and listened to Home Office officials
repeatedly justify the Bill by adamantly asserting that there was a 25%
shortfall in the communications they could collect and that this gap
was hampering the fight against terrorism. At no time did they
disclose, not even in the two private sessions, that for years GCHQ has
been collecting far more data than that Bill would have given it and
that there is no shortfall. That deliberate deception of Parliament is
an affront to democracy, and those officials should be seriously
considering their
positions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000311">So
what needs to happen now? First, there needs to be a vigorous public
debate about what we are prepared to allow our security services to do
and the boundaries of their reach into our private lives. I hope that
the outcome would be permission for intrusive and up-to-date powers of
interception for the police and security services where there are
convincing grounds for suspicion of serious crime. Equally there needs
to be a strong prohibition of mass untargeted surveillance of ordinary,
innocent citizens. There will be a need for new legislation to replace
RIPA, which was full of deliberate loopholes when it was written and is
now hopelessly out of date. There needs to be very strong and sceptical
oversight which reports directly to Parliament and has the necessary
resources and skills and real teeth. Most of all, we need a sea change
in the Government’s approach to the trade-off between liberty
and
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000312" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000312">The
Snowden cat is out of the bag. He has 58,000 secret documents, and so
far the <I>Guardian</I> has published excerpts from just 17 of them.
There must be much more to come. It will no longer do for the
Government to sit Canute-like on the beach while a tsunami of further
revelations engulfs their old policy of sticking their fingers in their
ears and muttering that they do not discuss security matters. They must
stop trying to shoot the messenger by attacking the <I>Guardian</I>.
They must also stop pretending that Britain has the best oversight of
its security services in the world when that oversight has
spectacularly failed to spot and prevent intrusive surveillance of
every citizen without Parliament’s knowledge and
consent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000313" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000313">Our

Foulkes of Cumnock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate
my noble friend Lord Soley on obtaining this debate. Like him and my
noble friend Lord Reid of Cardowan, I admire the work of the
intelligence and security services. They have averted substantial
terrorist threats and, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, I think
that is of national interest. I also understand and agree with what my
noble friends Lord Reid and Lord Soley said about the challenges of new
technology. However, I will follow what the noble Lord, Lord
Strasburger, has just. Some recent reports have shown the inadequacy of
the scrutiny of those services by the Intelligence and Security
Committee as currently comprised. That is what I want to concentrate on
in my few remarks
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000315">I am
not surprised, frankly, at what has happened. For four years, I served
as the only representative of this House on the nine-person committee
and experienced some of the difficulties of scrutinising the
intelligence and security services. I had some radical ideas and some
changes to propose and managed, along with others, to persuade the
Government to increase the number of committee members from this House
to two. I was surprised, although maybe I should not have been, that I
was summarily removed from the committee by the coalition. What was
even more disturbing was that no Labour Peer was appointed by the Prime
Minister in my place—no Labour Peer served on that committee. I
have great admiration for the many qualities of the two Peers
appointed. However, I doubt if my old friend, the noble Marquess, Lord
Lothian, and the noble Lord, Lord Butler, a former head of the Civil
Service, have at the top of the list of their qualities a reputation
for radical and challenging questioning. In fact, two more stalwart
pillars of the establishment would be very hard to
find.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000316">The ISC
is, as I understand it, being reconstituted and is to become a joint
parliamentary committee rather than a committee appointed by the Prime
Minister. However, I must say, with respect to the Minister, that the
secrecy surrounding the way in which this committee is to be
constituted would do MI6 proud. It is not the open procedure that
Parliament ought to have. Can the Minister, in replying, clarify
exactly what the composition of the committee will be, how it will be
appointed and how it will operate? My view is that, like any other
Joint Committee, the House of Lords should have roughly half of the
members, especially as we are going to be bearing half of the cost. I
suggest that the size of the committee might be increased to
11 members, with five from the Lords and six from the
Commons. The latter would include the chair, who should be a member of
the opposition party, like the chair of the Public Accounts Committee,
to give the committee greater credibility. I have great respect for the
current chair, Sir Malcolm Rifkind—I have known him for 50
years, since he was young man—but, to be honest, it does not
instil confidence among the public and in Parliament that the committee
will undertake 
<?notus-xml column=384?>radical and effective scrutiny when you have someone in the chair who
has so recently been Foreign Secretary and had those kind of
responsibilities himself.</hs_para>

the committee is seen as effective and impartial, the members of the
committee need to be chosen by as democratic a procedure as we can
possibly devise. We are not the most democratic House, but at least we
can try to work on some kind of democratic procedure so that the
members are accountable to both Houses. I am asking the Minister to
cover this in his reply, but suggest that if we had five Peers, two
might be chosen by the Labour group, two by the government parties and
one by the Cross-Benchers. They would have an opportunity to report
back to the groups on what is happening and what their experience has
been. Of course, it is up to the Commons to decide how its members are
chosen, but I hope there would be some degree of
accountability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000318" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000318">Further
changes are of course needed in the operation of the committee. For
example, when I was on the committee, we had no staff to carry out
investigations. We were not allowed to appoint staff to go into the
departments and carry out investigations on our behalf. Previously, the
committee had an investigations officer, but that was stopped by the
Government because, no doubt, he was investigating too much. The
committee needs some capacity in that
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000319">The
changes in membership should be made first. For the committee to have
some credibility, it needs to have some accountability. I hope that the
Minister will give noble Lords a clear indication in his reply that
there are going to be changes in the constitution, composition and
operation of the Intelligence and Security Committee. If we do not get
those kinds of assurances, some in the media and among the public will
continue to take that view that somehow, in some ways, the Government
have got something to
hide.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13110766000554" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000554">3.23

Judd (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I join other noble Lords in thanking
my noble friend Lord Soley most warmly for having had the courage to
initiate this debate. If anything has been established in the very
important deliberations so far in this debate, it is that there is a
need for a proper, full debate, and a much wider public debate, about
the issues at stake. If nothing else, my noble friend is to be
congratulated on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000321" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000321">I should
say at the outset that I have, of course, been a Defence Minister and a
Foreign Office Minister. I was a Defence Minister in the days when we
had service Ministers, and I was very proud to be Minister for the
Navy. As such, I was regularly briefed by the head of intelligence in
the Navy, who was a very enjoyable admiral, so it was a good
conversation. I shall always savour the day on which he came to see me
with his briefings and said, “Minister, I think I ought to let
you know that the head of the Russian Navy is describing you as Cold
War Warrior Judd”. I am not sure that that would be immediately
recognised by all my colleagues and the rest, but I will always savour
that
occasion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000322" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000322">I
grew up in a non-conformist Christian family, and one of the realities
of growing up in that kind of culture was that from a very young age I
was encouraged 
<?notus-xml column=385?>to realise that, whatever I might do with my life, God knew everything.
My theological thinking has rather moved forwards since those days, but
I do not think that at any point in my evolution have I seen GCHQ or
the NSA as God. That is the point. God was there as a moral balance in
life. He was your conscience. There is immense power in the hands of
these authorities now, but no one—including, I believe, most of
those working in them—would begin to believe that they are the
moral authority of the world; they are there to preserve
security.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000323" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000323">I
have been convinced for a long time that if you make a hard analysis of
the threats that face us as a nation, the combination of terrorism, the
fact that small numbers of people can do terrible things and the
increasing accessibility of the material for mass destruction is a
nightmare. One only has to think of the whole business of germ warfare,
crude nuclear weapons and the rest to imagine what could happen. If I
have one comment for the noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, after his very
powerful speech, it is that I am not quite sure how he comes to his
conclusion in the equation he put before us, because I do not think
that it is just a matter of more localised, small incidents or nuclear
war. I think that there is a whole gradation in between and that the
real dangers lie in that area. That is why intelligence is
indispensable. For a long time, I have felt that our security lies very
much in the realm of intelligence and in ensuring that it is properly
staffed and properly
resourced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000324" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000324">Therefore,
going back to my point about God, if I may, it is all the more
important that everyone can be certain that in the leadership of the
intelligence agencies there are people committed, second to none, to
the principles of liberal democracy and freedom that they are
defending. It is important that that commitment and understanding
permeates the whole organisation and that the internalised culture is
that what it is doing is defending freedom, democracy and a decent
society. That is a terribly easy thing to say but a terribly difficult
thing to achieve.</hs_para>

to look very hard at the criteria for selection in the intelligence
services, the training and the leadership at all levels.
Otherwise, the excitement, the intoxication and the challenges of the
task could become dominant; there is also the danger of
counterproductivity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000326" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000326">I
emphasise that, like others who have spoken, I believe this country
owes a tremendous tribute to the courage and dedication of the
overwhelming majority of people working in the security services and
what they do on our behalf. I believe, therefore, that it is our duty
not only to scrutinise, which we are doing today, but to stand firmly
by those who have this concept of responsibility and of what they
really are there to do. We must deal very severely with those who abuse
that task or who indulge in things that I believe could ultimately be
described as treason. Extremists work best when there is a culture of
sympathy. We must never allow things to happen which accentuate that
culture and which introduce more doubt among thinking people, thus
opening up the opportunity for extremists to recruit and to strengthen
their cause, and I am afraid that we are in danger of that
happening.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/2FB8E37981F6CC8C8D0B179A56B5B7731B715F41" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

intelligence helps protect national security, tackle terrorists and
stop criminals. But this does not mean the activities of the
intelligence services go unchecked. Successive Governments have rightly
introduced measures to ensure that the use of intrusive powers needed
to obtain intelligence are governed by a strict legal and policy
framework compatible with the Human Rights Act. This ensures that
intelligence activities are authorised,
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:39:28"></hs_TimeCode> and

rigorous internal controls. Their recruitment and training procedures
are designed to ensure that those operating within them can be trusted
to do so lawfully and ethically. A culture of compliance with the
letter and spirit of the law pervades everything they do. Noble Lords
have rightly paid tribute to the work of those in the intelligence
agencies. In their most recent reports, both the Intelligence Services

the use of intrusive powers by the intelligence agencies. Senior

effective. That is why, as noble Lords mentioned—indeed, the
noble Lord, Lord

the Intelligence and Security Committee examines the policy,
administration, past operations and expenditure of the intelligence
agencies. Noble Lords will remember that earlier this year the Justice

committee’s powers. As a result of that Act the intelligence
agencies are more accountable to Parliament and no longer have the
ability to withhold information from the ISC. The new ISC has a broader
remit, extra powers to consider past operational activity, and twice
the resources. Those reforms were not conjured from thin air but
followed public consultation on the best

the new appointments process, although the PM nominates the members

appoint the ISC. The reforms in the Justice and Security Act mean that
the ISC will itself select its chair. Should the committee wish to
nominate a member of the Opposition as the chair, it will be free to do

another review next year into intelligence legislation,
which may assist with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Soley. The Interception Commissioner is investigating reports related
to interception following the Snowden leaks. A judicial review of the
police’s decision to stop David Miranda in August is currently

be aware of the Supreme Court’s decision this year in the case
of Smith v Ministry of Defence, in which, by a majority of four to
three, the court concluded that the claim should go to trial so that a
judge could decide on the evidence whether the claims were covered by
the doctrine of combat immunity, or could give rise to a claim based on
the Human Rights Act. There are a number of reasons why I will not go
into the detail of the facts of the case. First, it is not concluded.
Secondly, it used to be a convention, not sufficiently honoured, that
Parliament did not criticise judges. Thirdly, whatever the law should
be, those who brought these claims have suffered bereavement or serious
injuries and can only have our profound sympathy. Finally, even those
like me who are alarmed by the implications of this judgment could not
but admire the detailed and thorough analysis of the issues contained

principle which arise from that case are important and should be
debated. Are judges to blame for the current situation? It is
undoubtedly the case that the approach of the courts to difficult
questions of immunity from claims has changed. For example, in Hughes v
National Union of Mineworkers in 1991, the Court of Appeal decided that
police officers who were quelling serious public disorder should not be
liable for negligence on public policy grounds. The decision stemmed in
part from the case of Hill v the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire<I>
</I>in 1988, in which the House of Lords Appellate Committee decided
that the police were immune from claims in negligence for failing to
catch the Yorkshire Ripper, albeit that they may well have made
mistakes which, if avoided, could have saved the life of the last
victim or victims of Peter

law in relation to combat immunity is judge-made. It was explained most
recently in the cases of Mulcahy in 1996 and in Multiple Claimants v
Ministry of Defence<I> </I>in 2003. It is not a neat and tidy area of
the law. Its scope seems likely to be very closely confined in the
future. It must be acknowledged that rather few of our judges have
served in the military, whereas in the post-war period almost all would
have done so. But this does not explain entirely the opening up of the
law. Sir Alan Moses, in his thoughtful preface to <I>The Fog of

of the difficulties in the Smith case and its predecessors was the

the doctrine of combat immunity is insufficiently precise for
judges’ tastes, the effect of the Supreme Court finding is that
a court will then have to examine in detail whether there was fault
and, if so, whether that fault fell one side or another of the rather
uncertain line which defines combat immunity or, as the Supreme Court

with vast numbers of documents and the luxury of time in which to

away from the field of military activities. No fog, my Lords, in Court

restricted to an undistinguished period in the combined cadet force at
school, will be seeking to second-guess military commanders facing
life-or-death decisions based inevitably on less-than-perfect
intelligence and almost certainly on less-than-ideal equipment at any
one time. I am afraid that it is simply not enough to suggest that the
courts can, in each individual case, sort out what is a purely policy
matter, and therefore not capable of review by the courts, from a
matter that crosses the boundary into combat immunity. The very process
of deciding those issues will involve challenging military decisions on
procurement, tactics and deployment, whether on a macro or micro scale.

authority to bring that claim to court. When that claim is
brought before the court, the judge has to deal with it. There are two
sides to every argument and the issues cannot be ducked, however
difficult or uncomfortable they may
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:13:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000388" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000388">The
claims with which we were dealing arose out of casualties sustained in
two distinct phases of the United Kingdom’s engagement in Iraq.
The first was a friendly fire incident involving two Challenger tanks
during combat operations on the fourth day of the offensive. The second
involved the use of Snatch Land Rovers on two occasions during a period
when our forces were exercising the powers of government for the
provisional Administration in Iraq—assisting the civil power, in
other words. These claims were brought under two distinct branches of
our law. The claims in the two Snatch Land Rover cases are brought
under the Human Rights Act for breach of a convention right. The
Challenger friendly fire claims dealing with combat do not raise a
human rights issue at all. They are brought under the common law only.
The second of the two Snatch Land Rover cases has an additional case
under the common law,
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000389" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000389">As for
the human rights claims, we held that a decision of the Strasbourg
court left us with no alternative but to hold that the protection of
the right to life under Article 2 of the convention applies
to members of the Armed Forces when they are serving anywhere outside
the territory of the United Kingdom, as well as inside its territory.
Of course, as has been pointed out, that raises the question of how
that article was to be applied, in the situations that were described
to us in these cases. The majority held that the court did not have
sufficient facts to decide the issue for itself, so the Snatch Land
Rover cases would have to go to trial. However, we gave as much
guidance as it was open to us to give in paragraph 76 of the judgment.
I said that the court must avoid imposing unrealistic or
disproportionate obligations on the state in connection with the
planning for, and conduct of, military operations in situations of
armed conflict. It would be easy to find that the claims are beyond the
reach of Article 2 when those thought to be responsible were actively
engaged in contact with the enemy. In the Snatch Land Rover cases, it
was not open to us to declare that the state had absolute immunity in
these matters. The law with which we are dealing—human rights
law, convention law—does not work that way, but we expected the
trial judge to pay very close attention to the guidance which we were
giving.</hs_para>

claims, we first had to examine the doctrine of combat immunity, which
has been referred to, because the MOD argued that all the common law
claims should be struck out on this ground. As noble Lords have heard,
the majority rejected that argument. But it is very important to note
that the claims in the Challenger friendly fire incident—when it
was plain that our forces were, indeed, engaged in combat—were
not directed at those who were conducting the operations on the ground.
Those who formulated the claims were very careful to direct their
claims in a different direction. The complaints were of failures in
training and the provision of equipment, which occurred long before the
tanks crossed the start line. So the issue which has caused concern was
not directly raised at all in the Challenger tank claims. The majority
view was that combat immunity did not apply to things done or admitted
to be done at that preliminary stage. However, it is crucially
important to note—and I cannot stress this point too
strongly—that we did not say that the doctrine of combat
immunity no longer exists: it remains part of our law. The noble Lord,
Lord Faulks, gave us a description of people engaged with the enemy on
the beaches, in the air and in other situations. That is not what our
judgment was dealing with, and there is nothing here which deprives
commanders, and those serving under them in that situation, of that
protection while they are engaged in
combat.</hs_para>

we were left with arose in the Snatch Land Rover cases and it was a
different one. It was whether the immunity applies to what was going on
in Iraq after the combat phase was over, when our troops were, as I
have said, assisting the civil power, no doubt in situations of
considerable danger. Here too, the majority held that the court did not
have the information to decide for itself whether the claims should
succeed. We did not rule out the possibility of applying the immunity,
but the issue had to go to trial because we needed to know
more—as will the judge—about the precise situation with
which our forces were dealing at the time. In paragraph 99 of the
judgement, I repeated the guidance given in paragraph 76 that, when
considering the issue of what is just and reasonable, great care must
be taken not to subject those responsible for decisions at any level
who are engaged in operations of the kind that were being conducted in
Iraq after the end of hostilities to duties that are unrealistic or
excessively burdensome.</hs_para>

the Minister has made clear on several occasions, the case is now in
the hands of the trial judge. I suggest that it would be premature to
draw any further conclusions until his decision is known. However, I
hope very much that it will be appreciated that those serving in our
Armed Forces, to whom we owe so much, are not as vulnerable to legal
challenge as some people have been suggesting. As the author of the
judgment, and as a former national service officer, I am greatly
encouraged by the perception that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of
Gresford, has taken from it and the way in which he has appreciated the
guidance we were trying to
give.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/1EB75F3F1C4E83EDC3CCED0EF95CD55C3C69A1BB" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

service, service discipline, enforcement and review were the
responsibility of the chain of command. Since then, service legal
arrangements have changed to accord more closely with human rights

services have adapted, but what concerns me more is that the Armed

incompatible.</hs_para>

death, is a criminal offence under Armed Forces law. But today or in

The Lord Chancellor’s reassurances have been frittered away,
most spectacularly by the way that the Supreme Court findings last June
were publicised. The court’s view—albeit a minority
one—that such cases were not suitable for resolution by a court
seemed to be a ray of hope that could help inch the problem back to
greater realism. The noble Lord, Lord Faulks, quoted the wording of the
minority view, and it is worth repeating. It stated
that,</hs_parafo><hs_quotefo UID="13110766000516" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000516">“the

that realism be translated into new legislation? There is a proper
reluctance in some quarters not to try to make changes because of the
variety of cases that are sub judice and because today’s service
men and women might be encouraged to believe that their rights were

a need to be proactive, not to await events only to find that the

and Croft, to which reference has already been made, has made it quite
clear that they do not consider that the military should be in any way
above the law. It does present us, however, with enormous problems. I

blood first. I do not think there is any excuse for an armed serviceman
to murder a helpless prisoner. I do not think that the brutal treatment
of detainees who are completely helpless victims in the hands of those
who are supposed to be looking after them can be defended in any way. I
remain to be convinced that any serious intelligence got through
torturing detainees has actually saved British lives. On top
of that, we leave the moral high ground when we descend into this sort
of behaviour, and, inevitably, it gets out. What is almost beyond doubt
is that when this stuff does get out, the effect it has
justifies the actions of terrorists to carry out even more
atrocious acts which put British lives at risk. So, in the
category of cold blood, I do not think that anything other than the
ruthless application of the law should be applied.</hs_para>

though, is very much more difficult. The problem is that the law deals
in facts, it does not deal in context. Let us face it, the military are
the only people who are in the business of actually having to kill
people. That puts them in a unique position in our society. If a
soldier shoots a civilian, and that civilian is subsequently found to
be unarmed and going about his lawful business, it sounds as though he
has committed an unforgivable act, but if the context is one of
ambushes, sniper fire and suicide bombings, the whole context changes
that act. We have to accept that the pressures our military have been
under in Helmand province, for instance, where they are dealing with a
population some of whom are more than happy to kill them while others
are not, completely changes the context in which acts like that are
carried out.</hs_para>

the paper about the US Marine Corps in Helmand a few years ago. Some US
marines were watching a rather distinguished looking Afghan man
standing some way away in a field. They had him in their binoculars and
they were wondering what on earth he was doing. This went on for some
time, but eventually, they gave up, saying, “We won’t
bother”. One marine turned around to walk away, whereupon the
man picked up a rifle and shot him in the back. If you are dealing with
that sort of environment, it is extremely difficult to bring the
courtroom into the actions that soldiers take in such circumstances. If
you are on live round training in the military, where you walk down a
theoretical alley and targets pop out all around, I have to tell noble
Lords that it is very difficult not to shoot the nun straight through

I turned completely head over heels and landed on my back at the bottom
of what was really quite a deep crater. If I had not done so, I might
have broken my neck and died. Later on in our training we were training
with live rounds. I inspected the Bren gun of the guardsman who had
been firing and it was clear. I walked forward. He put the magazine
back on to the gun and pulled the trigger. Those who know about Bren
guns will know that that means that the thing goes off. The butt of the

My noble friend Lord Faulks compared training in the Army to the
Factories Acts and so on, but I do not believe that life is like that.
You have to train in reasonably extreme circumstances in the military,
and you run risks when you do that. Regrettably, people die quite
regularly when training with the British military. If they all sue

Guthrie of Craigiebank (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I start with a
blunt and basic point. For those who have not experienced active
military service, it is difficult to 
<?notus-xml column=403?>understand the pressures and friction of the battlefield. Decisions have
to be taken by men who are under stress, often under fire, on the basis
of incomplete information. Those decisions have to be taken quickly.

for centuries, men who fought were aware of some rules of chivalry,

careers as to their responsibilities. There are limits. Let us not be
squeamish: in combat, men are trying to defend their country by killing
its enemies. It follows that civilian norms cannot apply. Things which

might all sound like common sense. I hope it does. In previous
generations, that is how it would have been regarded. In the early
stages of the Falklands War, when we started to suffer casualties, the
then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was upset. It took her husband
to comfort her, saying that that was the sort of thing that happened in
war. He knew because he had been there and seen it. Denis Thatcher was
right. Yet in recent years, common sense has often been brushed aside.
Health and safety and the European Convention on Human Rights have both
been imported into contexts where neither is really applicable. In
effect, members of the judiciary has been brought into the front line

who discovered, on reading the important and commanding academic
article by Professor Anthony Forster in <I>International Affairs</I>,
Vol. 88, on the process of juridification of armed conflict, that I had
played a somewhat unwitting role in this process, as historical adviser
to the Bloody Sunday

Forster lists a number of key moments in the period since I became an
adult, over the last generation, in which one can see this process of
the juridification of armed conflict. Some have already been referred
to in our discussions, such as the Supreme Court ruling in Smith this
summer, and the Baha Mousa case. However, he also mentions the Bloody
Sunday inquiry, and what it tells us about changing attitudes, a number
of times. He makes a very serious point: it is an obvious example not
just of the way that the judiciary has become engaged in the process of
the use of force by our soldiers but of how the concept of national
interest has changed, in the sense that it was inconceivable for
British Governments to formally challenge, in that way, the past use of
our soldiers in conflict at a later date. The decision of the Blair
Government in 1998 to reopen the issues dealt with by the Widgery
inquiry in the early 1970s is an example of the way in which the
traditional concept of national interest has changed, for good or
ill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000421" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000421">Professor
Forster’s point in his article is that, emotionally and in a
number of ways, our society’s view of these questions is in the
process of flux and change; I think this is indisputable. I remember
being 
<?notus-xml column=405?>a student in Cambridge in 1972, when Bloody Sunday occurred, and there
is no question that that day, when 14 innocent civilians were killed,
is one of the least happy days in the history of the British Army. I
remember watching the demonstration of students in Cambridge. I can see
in my mind’s eye the people in that demonstration, one of whom,
for example, came to hold one of the highest offices of state. There is
no question that, in this respect, our attitude as a society and the
attitude of leaders, public opinion and so on has
evolved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:45:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000422" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000422">In
some respects, the Widgery tribunal is often discussed a little
unfairly. Lord Widgery actually said that a majority of those who died
on the day were innocent—that has been forgotten—and the
Army’s response to discovering his view was one of being
disturbed. However, it is hard to avoid the sense that the structure of
feeling surrounding the tribunal was very different from the structure
of feeling that we have today. It has already been referred to by noble
Lords that, in the post-war period, judges themselves had often served
in the military, as had Lord Widgery. A key issue in the Bloody Sunday
tribunal was the role of the general in Northern Ireland, General Ford,
who had been a very brave soldier at the D-day landings. It is almost
inconceivable that these recollections and emotional associations were
not in Lord Widgery’s mind when he considered the issues posed
by Bloody Sunday; it is humanly
inconceivable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:46:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000423" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000423">We
have now moved into a very different world. Lord Justice Moses refers
to this in the introduction to the Policy Exchange pamphlet that has
been referred to a number of times during this debate. He talks about
remembering, as a boy, cases coming up before a judge where a burglar
comes into the court, puts on his regimental tie and medals and the
judge regretfully looks at him and returns half the merited sentence
for the crime. This world has gone completely; it is not to return. I
know that and Professor Forster knows it. We know that the Widgery
tribunal inquiry was inappropriate and inadequate. He states clearly
that he has no regrets about being an historical adviser to the new
tribunal. It is not a question of trying to create a context in which
the Armed Forces operated outside civilised standards. Politically we
have to be aware of the fact that, in the wars of choice that have been
referred to in recent times, as the fundamental ideological
justification of these wars has been the defence of human rights, it is
all the more important that our Armed Forces are perceived to behave
properly in context, as far as possible, with obligations to human
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:48:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000424" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000424">However,
we have reached a fundamentally unstable point. I listened with great
interest today to the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope. I
do not want to be misunderstood. There is an argument about whether the
four were right in the Supreme Court, whether the three were right in
the Supreme Court, and whether there were exaggerated fears out of the
ruling that came from the majority on the Supreme Court. I understand
that argument and I am extremely grateful to the noble and learned Lord
for the way in which he explained the position with great clarity
today. However, the real problem is that we are 
<?notus-xml column=406?>on a slippery slope once we move to a rights-based jurisdiction, away
from the unproblematic concepts of national interest and the
relationship between the state, the judiciary and the Armed Forces that
existed a generation ago when I was a young man. We are now in a new
place. Indeed, Professor Forster says at the end of his piece that once
you move away from those concepts to rights-based arguments, because of
the difficulty of reconciling and aligning competing rights, the
context is always
unstable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000425" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000425">That
is why, despite the hints that come from on high, there will be no end
to litigation on this subject; the floodgates are absolutely open,
despite the hints that people perhaps misunderstand the full
implications of the ruling of the majority in the Supreme Court. That
is why, like the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, I was attracted to
the argument on the question of Parliament looking again at combat
immunity. Perhaps the noble and gallant Lord is right to believe that
this is not the right step at this moment, although there are other
steps that Parliament might consider taking. However, what is certain
is that there is no stability in the place that we have currently
reached, and we owe our Armed Forces that
stability.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/F27907821EC1F307A3284EECE84CF32ADD20CB52" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

very important: the impact of the uncertainty that has been created on

Now, however, we are looking to increase the numbers to something like

however erudite and legal, is causing problems already. I say this as
president for the past 10 years of the Reserve Forces Association, and
the questions that I get—few at the moment, but they will gather
speed and pace—about the liability of reservists who are serving
abroad alarms me, and gives me concerns about our ability to reach our
target of recruitment over the coming years. It is rather poignant that
today the MoD has sent out a call for 1,500 extra reservists for
service abroad, principally in Afghanistan.</hs_para>

Ireland was different again. Traditionally, in what were called

Constabulary being exhausted. I have always regretted this, because of
the problem it posed for our soldiers. They were expected to be firm,

see it, I passed the Bill to the Director General of the Army Legal

Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, I
originally put my name down to speak in this debate because I
understood that my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead
would be unable to be here. It had been my overriding concern to make
plain that Smith is a good deal more nuanced and measured a judgment,
that the senior judiciary 
<?notus-xml column=409?>and the majority judgment in Smith had not lost their marbles, and that
the reaction has been something of an overreaction in terms of the
damage that it does to our fighting capabilities. The Defence Secretary
was quoted as
saying,</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13110766000500" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000500">“We
can’t have troop commanders living in fear of how lawyers back
in London might interpret their battlefield
decisions”,</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13110766000442" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000442">and
somewhat similar concerns were expressed by noble and gallant Members
of this House during Questions. Those concerns are substantially
misplaced. When my noble and learned friend Lord Hope told me that he
could take part in the debate after all, I wondered whether to scrub
from the list. However, I decided not to, partly because not having
been on the case I am perhaps almost better able to emphasise the
comparatively limited effect of the majority judgment. I also want to
make plain that I am prepared to acknowledge and recognise the problems
that the majority judgment creates for the future, perhaps not merely
for the Armed Forces but for the justice system as
well.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13110766000443" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000443">As to
the limited effect of the judgment, three things must be recognised.
First, members of the Armed Forces, notwithstanding that they are on
active service abroad, come within the UK’s jurisdiction for the
purposes of the European Convention on Human Rights. That was the
unanimous decision of all seven members of the Supreme Court in Smith,
and that conclusion was plainly now dictated by the Grand Chamber
decision in Strasbourg—a decision, I add, that was contrary to
what we had previously decided in the Appellate Committee here in the
House, to which I was party.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110766000444" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000444">Secondly,
however—this is very important—it by no means follows
that the fact that a claimant was on active service abroad when killed
or injured is irrelevant to a claim under the
convention; far from it. As the majority’s judgment
makes plain, the convention will not be applied as imposing
on states obligations which are unrealistic and disproportionate.
Policy decisions made at a high level of command and things done on the
battlefield will necessarily fall outside the protection of the right
to life under Article 2 of the convention and a wide measure
of appreciation is given to member states as to what are the
requirements of armed
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000445" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000445">Thirdly,
all the various claims that were considered—claims under the
human rights convention and separate claims brought in common law
negligence, without reference to the convention—which were
grouped together in Smith in the Supreme Court, were being dealt with
at a preliminary stage of the litigation, namely as strike-out
applications. The question for the court was therefore: should these
claims be allowed to proceed, however unpromising they might appear, to
see whether once all the facts were established they should succeed,
or—this was the minority conclusion—should they receive
their immediate quietus on the basis, frankly, that enough was already
known to decide that they could never properly succeed? The majority,
of course, took the former view, but made it plain that it was far from
clear that all, or indeed any, of these claims would in the end
actually succeed. So much for the limited effect of the
judgment.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=410?><hs_para UID="13110766000446" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000446">I will now turn briefly
to the problems which, as I have already said, I nevertheless recognise
that the majority judgment poses for the future. This appears clearly
from the judgments of the minority, in particular those of the noble
and learned Lords, Lord Mance and Lord Carswell, with whom the noble
Lord, Lord Wilson agreed. The problem is this: to say that first,
high-level policy decisions, and secondly, battlefield decisions, fall
outside convention protection, leaves a wholly undefined area of middle
ground between those two extremes; an area within which the
majority suggests that, depending on all the detailed facts of the
case, liability might arise. That, as the minority judgment suggests,
makes extensive litigation almost inevitable in a number of cases, and
is likely to lead to the “judicialisation of war”. These
passages have already been emphasised by various of your
Lordships. It might, therefore, have been preferable to have ruled with
the minority that on the known facts, without the need for any more, no
positive obligation to protect life could arise under Article 2 of the
convention, and Strasbourg would not contend otherwise and, similarly,
that it would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose on the
Ministry of Defence any common law duty of care in respect of any of
these deaths or injuries and rather they should be regarded as falling
within the scope of this somewhat ill defined defence of combat
immunity. That is the burden of the argument of the noble Lord, Lord
Faulks. I have to say, one can readily see its
attractions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000447" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000447">As
to the way ahead, it must now surely be necessary to await the final
outcome of these particular actions, hopefully sooner rather than
later. One would have thought they should be expedited. Parliament
cannot legislate retrospectively in respect of these claims. Depending
then on how matters appear, legislation may be thought desirable. I
suggest that this would most sensibly and conveniently be done by the
Secretary of State making an order—the
noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has already referred to
this path—pursuant to Section 2 of the 1987 Act which
would revive the effect of Section 10 of the 1947 Act.
Essentially this would exclude tort liability for the injury or death
of any member of the armed services in connection warlike operations or
activities
abroad.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000448" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000448">I will
make a brief final point. Legislating to allay
the fears of those who may be criticised—soldiers or
the Ministry—in one of these cases is also by definition
legislating to end the compensation hopes of a number of brave injured
soldiers. It may be the right thing to do, but we should not lose sight
of that
consideration.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13110766000567" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000567">5.08

Rosser (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this is an important issue, and I,
too, express my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, for providing
the opportunity to discuss the matter in some detail and shortly to
hear the Government’s position from the Minister. Virtually
all—if not all—of your Lordships who have spoken have
been able to call on their direct and practical knowledge of the law or
on their direct and practical knowledge of the realities of conflict
and the realities of the way in which our Armed Forces operate and 
<?notus-xml column=411?>work on our behalf. Unfortunately I am not in that position. Like the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, I am extremely appreciative of the Library
note.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000450" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000450">Although,
as has been said, there have been previous decisions by courts that
have given rise to the concerns that have been expressed today, it has
been the Supreme Court judgment last June, apparently changing a
Supreme Court judgment from 2010, which has raised the profile further
of the issue of our Armed Forces and their vulnerability to legal
challenge. Shortly before the Supreme Court judgment, in May this year
the High Court apparently ordered hundreds of inquest-style public
hearings to investigate alleged unlawful killings and mistreatment of
civilians by British forces in Iraq. Recent legal challenges to the
Armed Forces have fallen into two main categories: those relating to
the Armed Forces’ treatment of civilians and those which relate
to the Armed Forces’ treatment of their own personnel.</hs_para>

lawyer, I would like to talk about the Supreme Court judgment and what,
as I perhaps mistakenly understand, it said. The proceedings concerned
three sets of claims arising from the deaths of three of our servicemen
and serious injuries to two others in Iraq. The first set, brought in
negligence, arose from a friendly fire incident involving British tanks
and alleged failures by the Ministry of Defence properly to equip the
tanks involved and give the soldiers adequate recognition training. The
second set arose from the detonation of improvised explosive devices
level with the Land Rovers in which the soldiers were travelling and
claimed that the Ministry of Defence breached the European Convention
on Human Rights by failing to take preventive measures to protect life
in the light of the real and immediate risk to life of soldiers who
were required to patrol in the Land Rovers. The third set, like the
first, was also brought in negligence, by—I believe—the
son of one of the soldiers killed in the Land Rover incident, and
claimed various alleged failures on the part of the Ministry of
Defence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000452" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000452">The
Ministry of Defence argued at the Court of Appeal that the Land Rover
claims should be struck out because at the time of their deaths the two
soldiers were not within the jurisdiction of the UK for the purposes of
the European convention and because, on the facts put forward, the MoD
did not owe a duty to the soldiers at the time of their deaths under
Article 2 of the convention, the right to life. The Ministry of Defence
also argued on the Challenger tank claims and the third set, the
negligence claim, that they should be struck out on the principle of
combat immunity and because it would not be fair, just or reasonable to
impose a duty of care on the Ministry of Defence in the circumstances
of those
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110766000453" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0002.htm#13110766000453">The
Court of Appeal decided that the Land Rover claims should be struck out
and that the Challenger claims and the negligence claim should proceed
to trial. The Supreme Court decided unanimously, as has been said, that
in relation to the Land Rover claims the two soldiers were within the
UK’s jurisdiction for the purposes of the European convention at
the time of their deaths. By a majority, the Supreme Court held that
the Land Rover claims should not be struck out on the ground that the
claims were not within the scope of Article 2 of the European
Convention on 
<?notus-xml column=412?>Human Rights and, also by a majority, that the Challenger claims and the
negligence claim should not be struck out on the ground of combat
immunity or on the ground that it would not be fair, just or reasonable
to extend the MoD’s duty of care to those cases. The effect of
the Supreme Court’s decision was that all three sets of claims
could proceed to trial.</hs_para>

relation to whether it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose a

have, however, noted what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of

Government are clearly concerned about the lack of clarity. Subject to
what the Minister has to say, the Government appear to be waiting, not

laying down clear principles and guidelines that can be applied and

by those who feel they might be subject to legal proceedings. Nobody
wants to see a situation in which our Armed Forces are less able than

new or changed legal considerations and the perceived or real prospect

need to be taken by government, the other key issue is whether our
Armed Forces, involved in or preparing for operations, are being
inhibited in what they do on our behalf in the national interest as a
result of uncertainties about exposure to potentially successful legal
challenges and claims. I hope the Minister will be able to give
assurances that that is not the case because, if it is, we are in a

the rule of law and to take account of how the law changes. There is

there has been no decision by the courts that would suggest that they

Ellis, and Allbutt and others versus the Ministry of Defence, which

extremely tragic incidents in Iraq arising out of lethal attacks on
soldiers patrolling in Snatch Land Rovers and out of a so-called
“friendly fire” accident involving Challenger 2 tanks.
The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, set that out very clearly. It gives us no
satisfaction at all to have to defend cases brought by the families of
the brave men who died or were injured in these events, but the

allege that individuals were abused on arrest and unlawfully detained,
which amounted to a violation of their Article 3 and Article 5 European
convention rights. These are the right not to be subjected to torture
or inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to liberty. They seek
damages, sometimes for very substantial amounts, as well as
declarations that their human rights have been breached, and in some
cases they argue that a full investigation is required into their
alleged ill-treatment. In a smaller number of cases, unlawful killings

alleged.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110789000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000013">A

the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg court handed down judgments in the
two important cases of Al-Skeini and Al-Jedda. These judgments resulted
in a substantial extension of the extraterritorial application of the
convention to Iraq. In addition, the Al-Jedda judgment had what I can
only regard as the deeply unfortunate consequence that compensation has

There is no question that his killing was a tragedy and a shameful

Lords will, I think, be pleased to learn that there remains the
possibility that those responsible for the death of Baha Mousa will be
brought to justice. As suggested by the previous Defence Secretary, a
new investigation of the case is under way, conducted by the Iraq
Historic Allegations Team, which was set up as a mark of the
Government’s serious commitment to get to the bottom of the
allegations of abuse and unlawful killings in Iraq. Despite repeated
legal challenges, the competence and integrity of the Iraq Historic
Allegations Team has been vindicated by the High Court and it is
getting on with its important work, carried out under difficult
conditions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000016">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:30:28"></hs_TimeCode>
investigations are important because we need to ensure, as I have said,
that the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom will be held to the highest
standards of conduct. They are also important because, by establishing
how abuses were allowed to happen, remedial action can be taken. The
Baha Mousa public inquiry, chaired by Lord Justice Gage, provided a
cogent analysis of the conditions which led to the killing and made
72 recommendations to prevent any recurrence, all but one of
which were accepted by the Government. We intend to make an
announcement shortly on progress on implementation of the Baha Mousa
inquiry recommendations. The department will also shortly be publishing
the first annual report on systemic issues identified from the
investigations of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team.</hs_para>

mentioned earlier the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in
the case of Al-Skeini and Al Jedda, which had important implications
for the application of the human rights convention to our operations in
Iraq. It is important to be clear that in our view the situation in
Afghanistan is different. This is in part because the UK operates in
Afghanistan through ISAF, a multinational force under the ultimate
authority and control of the United Nations Security Council.
Consequently, we contend that the UK’s acts 
<?notus-xml column=417?>and omissions are, for convention purposes, attributable to ISAF and
hence to the United Nations, not to the United Kingdom. But even where
the convention does not apply, there are legal challenges that need to
be grappled with. The English courts are all too aware of the serious
and difficult outcomes that can arise. Through a combination of recent
legal challenges seeking to put a stop to UK detention and transfer
operations in Afghanistan, the Defence Secretary came close to being
put in a position where he could neither lawfully detain captured
persons nor transfer them into Afghan custody. The problem was
eventually solved, thanks in part to co-operation between the British
and Afghan Governments, but this illustrates the way in which judicial
action in the domestic courts can potentially have the most serious
effects on operations which the Government consider vital for national
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:32:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000018">Given
the centrality of the European Convention on Human Rights to many of
these issues, some have suggested that derogation from the convention
for military operations should be considered. Article 15 of the
convention allows for parties to derogate from the convention’s
obligations, but only from certain articles and then only in time of
war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation. There
are different views as to the circumstances which would satisfy this
condition. The legal and political questions which derogation would
raise would be difficult ones, and we would need to be very clear that
the benefits outweighed the disadvantages before proceeding with that
option. The coalition agreement is also clear that no such changes
would be contemplated at

should like to say a word about the costs of litigation arising out of
military operations. The Ministry of Defence is required to spend
millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money each year to defend
claims. These are resources which have been voted by Parliament for
defence purposes and which would be much better employed in support of
the front line. I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work
of the Secretary of State for Justice in seeking to ensure that public
resources are allocated as far as possible only to the most meritorious
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000020">My
noble friend Lord Thomas referred to a paper produced by Army personnel
on the problem of risk aversion, which was subsequently leaked to the

noble friend Lord Freeman was absolutely right to remind us that these
matters are potentially of vital concern to reservists as well as to
the Regular Forces. His call for an early resolution of these
uncertainties is very pertinent. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham,
mentioned Northern Ireland. I was also there in August 1969 and well
remember the yellow cards that we were all given and the extreme care
that we had to take. There are some misconceptions about derogations
from the European Convention on Human Rights by some of our key allies.

ours.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000021">In

suitable it is that this ground-breaking debate should have been
introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, whose most
distinguished Speakership of the Commons—the first of her
gender—is exactly the right harbinger for the memorable
celebrations that stretch in front of us. I am looking forward to
hearing about their nature and detail, but I do not think any questions
of mine will elicit more information than the noble Chairman of

advance notice from the work programme of the further committees of
both Houses that are designing this constitutional jamboree.</hs_para>

my City connections, I am aware of one coincidence worth recording. In
the great American celebration of 1776, the American Bar Association in

<?notus-xml column=421?>1976 moved lock, stock and barrel to London for its annual gathering.
The Drapers’ Company, of which I am a liveryman, invited to its
election dinner in July that notable American academic Professor
Goodhart, father of my noble friend Lord Goodhart and at that time
Master of University College Oxford, who was already co-opted onto a
working party of welcome. In his guest-of-honour speech to the drapers,
Professor Goodhart, after revealing that he came from a country with
drapes but no drapers, and was thus overwhelmed suddenly to meet 200
drapers in a single hall, said that a more naive member of the
welcoming party could not tell what all the fuss was about, whereupon
another colleague whispered to the professor: “Silly old buffer;
he doesn’t realise that it’s because of Adam
Smith’s publication of <I>The Wealth of

an American to be involved was also a bright omen for Sir Robert

one sadness for some of us, perhaps for many and even for all, is that
we should have been robbed by death in 2011 of the late Lord Bingham of
Cornhill, whose book in 2010, <I>The Rule of Law</I>, was an offering
to Magna Carta’s greatness and was described by reviewers as so
much more than a book for lawyers. I am profoundly impressed by what
the Library has served us up with in comprehensive briefing, and I
personally commend the slim volume to which these events have
introduced me in a splendid series published by Oxford University Press
entitled <I>Magna Carta: A Very Short Introduction</I> by Professor
Nicholas Vincent, professor of medieval history at the University of
East Anglia. He has brought home to me how far back the seeds that led
to Runnymede were sown and how much rolling of the wicket occurred in
the decades that preceded the historic sealing—sealing, not
signing—using seals that only the British Library still retains
attached to the original charter. So far I have not been able to secure
a copy of the late Lord Bingham’s speech in the Guildhall when
Tip O’Neill, the Speaker of the House who died so recently, came
over. However, I have a copy of the speech Lord Bingham gave at
St Albans Cathedral in 2011, the year of his death, the
forerunner to Professor Bogdanor’s similar address at the same
festival this year.</hs_para>

embraced the G8 summit in Enniskillen this year would have been a
suitable vehicle for spreading 
<?notus-xml column=422?>the word about such events, as did Ian Rankin’s novel about a
similar summit held at Gleneagles. This time I shall draw on my own
childhood and those of my sons. I grew up with the World War One board
games of L’Attaque and Dover Patrol. In due course I found even
better the World War Two version entitled Tri-Tactics. They were
outstanding in that they were demanding but gentle games which
introduced the young to the subtleties of warfare. Later I spent hours
on the floor with my sons playing Kingmaker, the similar version for
the Wars of the Roses which demanded a grasp of the interstices of
strategy. Diplomacy was another version on a wider scale.</hs_para>

Parekh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by thanking the noble
Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, for securing this debate and for introducing
it with such eloquence and wisdom. When looking at the 800th
anniversary celebrations of Magna Carta, it is important to bear in
mind four or five features of the charter which are in danger of being
ignored.</hs_para>

democratic document. Democracy is the rule of the people. What Magna
Carta does is provide the rule of law. The two are quite different.
Happily, Magna Carta introduced the rule of law and, in so doing, it
prepared the ground for the liberalism that would eventually prepare
the ground for democracy. It has allowed us to consolidate our liberal
democracy in the way we have.</hs_para>

is the product of the threat of civil war. Some 26 Barons had
threatened to take up arms unless King John agreed, but even when he
did agree in order to avoid civil war, the Pope voided the document and
war broke out. It was reissued after King John’s death. In other
words, it tells us something very English while at the same time
something very universal about history. It did not come unasked and it
did not come without the threat of violence, rather it came about as
the result of an enormous amount of pressure building up on the king of
the
day.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/85756C519A4EC743BABE3193A2E1C1A86DA43C45" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

talk in terms of general legal principles, which again is a very
English way of approaching the problem. It deals with specific
grievances, to which specific responses are made in the context of the
just thing to do. These are then generalised and translated into
large-scale universal legal and moral principles.</hs_para>

forget that in clause 20 it reiterates the medieval Christian principle
that human needs must be given priority over everything else, which is
why it says, for example, that if a man commits an offence, the King
should fine him, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his
livelihood. A merchant may not be deprived of his merchandise and a
villein or a worker may not be deprived of the instruments of his
husbandry. His livelihood is his natural right which may never be
trampled
upon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000049">The
other thing it does very explicitly is in clause 16. It
talks about how people who owe money to the Jews should be treated, and
goes on to say that non-Jews should be treated in exactly the same way.
This establishes an important principle which counters any form of
anti-Semitism. At that time, that was an extraordinary contribution,
and we should not ignore it and simply talk about
democracy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000050">Finally,
it ensures the freedom of the Church. The King assures the barons that
not only will the Church be left free to practise its own leadership
but that there will be no interference in its
elections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000051">If
these are some of the important distinguishing features of this
historic document, the question is how to celebrate its
800<Sup>th</Sup> anniversary. Why are we celebrating it in the first
instance? The reason is twofold. First, it is to reaffirm and deepen
our own commitment to the rule of law, which, as we know from the
experience of the past forty years, is constantly in danger of being
eroded. It is intended to remind us of the great tradition to which we
belong and of how we can continue to affirm the heritage that we
cherish.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000052">The
second objective is to spread awareness of the rule of law in the rest
of the world, and, if I may be a little devious, to affirm our soft
power. It reminds the world that we have achieved something very
significant in our history of which the world should take note. If
these are our two objectives—to reaffirm and deepen our own
commitment to the rule of law and to affirm the commitment to the rest
of the world and in so doing to increase our soft power—the rest
of what I am going to say
follows.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000053">Take
the first objective. How do we deepen and reaffirm our own commitment?
Exhibitions are all right. People will come and people will go. We need
to catch young people and get them to realise what our history has been
about, what the rule of law is about and what constraints it imposes
upon executive power. Therefore we should be organising lectures and
seminars in schools and in major cities up and down the country,
encouraging local events and holding a national essay competition, as
has happened in some other countries in relation to other events.
Continuing with the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd,
made, I favour an annual lecture in Westminster Hall where the two
Houses can meet to take stock of where we are in the field of the rule
of law. It may not be entirely inappropriate. It will allow the two
Houses to meet regularly as well as provide an occasion to take a moral
and political audit of where we stand at any given
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000054">As far
as the rest of the world is concerned, I have two suggestions. I hope
they are not presumptuous but worth considering. First, the British
Council should be asked to take an active role in sponsoring and 
<?notus-xml column=424?>establishing annual lectures in key countries, designed to explore
further the idea of the rule of law. If I may be even more
ambitious—I do not think we are that short
of money—I should have thought that the 800<Sup>th</Sup>
anniversary of Magna Carta was an occasion in our history where we
might institute a prize comparable to the Nobel Prize, given by the
British people through the agency of the British Government, to the
person who, during the particular year, has contributed the most to
establishing the rule of law. Some such imaginative idea equivalent to
the Nobel Prize would be a worthy tribute to this great
event.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13110789000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000172">6

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I find myself in a position that
reminds me of the first intervention that I think I made in this
Parliament. At Question Time, the noble Lord, Lord Hill, was asked
about why some historian—I cannot remember which one—was
being removed from the national curriculum. I stood up, from a little
further back than I am now, and suggested to the noble Lord that we
should not worry about the nuances of a particular historian but about
the facts, because intellectual fashions change. I compared
intellectual fashions to
hemlines.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000056">I am
probably of an unfashionable hemline and an unfashionable tradition in
history, for which the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, of course has to take
some responsibility, as he was running the University of Aberdeen when
I was there as a student. I come from a school of historians, which I
do not think is popular now, which did not regard Magna Carta as being
that big a deal. It was something that failed; it was the control of
those outside resisting the creation of a modern, centralised state
where you control power and did not deal with your overmighty subjects.
It was a symbol of King John’s failure, and was then imposed on
Henry III, who is nobody’s idea of a romantic hero. He did not
assert full control of his kingdom until the age of 29, which is very
old by medieval standards, and ended up, in the last part of his
career, with the kingdom effectively run by his son, who had to win a
battle and a civil war for him after the rebellion of Simon de
Montfort. Magna Carta was issued a couple of times during that
reign.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000057">Magna
Carta is reissued and referred back to every time the overmighty
subjects beat up a king. “You have failed, we are going to
impose something on you”, they say. When I discovered that I was
very unfashionable, in terms of intellectual background, I did a bit of
reading. Magna Carta itself refers back to a conveyance of rights from
the reign of Henry I. The barons then imposed it on King John, who was
known as Softsword—today that would be a sexual reference but
then it referred to the fact that he was not very good at fighting, or
at least was not perceived to be. The fact that the statues round here,
dusty as they may be, are wearing armour and thumbing broadswords
conveys quite a lot of what I read about that process. I always felt
that a successful baron was like a medieval Hell’s Angels
leader, in that he came in and asserted his rights by force, through
his skill at
arms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000058">Magna
Carta has gone on to be something else and the idea has emerged,
whether justifiably or not, that the rule of law comes from it and
seems to be embodied 
<?notus-xml column=425?>in it. If I go past a copy or a facsimile of it here with Americans,
they stop and go, “Wow”. I was always much more impressed
by the draft Declaration of Rights when we had it on display here, with
its crossings-out and ink-stains, which set out the tripartite idea of
sovereignty: Lords, Commons and Crown together. It may just be an
educational accident, but I am told that I am intellectually cynical.
The idea of Parliament did not get going until a fair bit after Magna
Carta. It was something that was generally called when the
Executive—the English royal family—wanted money out of
their subjects, usually to fight a war. That was something
different.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000059">Magna
Carta may have set up an idea, but a study into the way that an idea
grows and captures attention and the way you refer back to a golden age
might be a more important thing than its point in history. It might be
more important to look at the fact that it can suggest something else
to somebody. The events themselves will be argued over, but the fact
that you are still arguing over them is probably a greater contribution
to an idea than any historical events will be. I hope that we can
reflect that and do not make it out to be some great, almost religious,
experience on the part of those imposing it. It was not. It was
somebody saying, “We will deal with our problems now”.
When they did not get their own way, they called in a French army to
get rid of the king. That does not sound like the start of democracy to
me.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/1D2C3412713129E122DBB81D91BFEB9E686BDA67" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

concepts from Magna Carta as a means of putting pressure on the king.
That is an example of the appropriation of Magna Carta in the struggle
for change in our country. There is of course a vastly important
tradition of legal commentary that dates from the 17th century which

the divine right of

Cormack (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is very good to be the first
on this side of the House to be able to congratulate my noble friend
Lord Bourne on an excellent maiden speech. The first maiden speech I
had to comment on was that of Mr Dennis Skinner way back in 1970. I
said I hoped he would be heard often in the future, I was certainly
correct in suggesting he might be, and I hope we will hear more of my
noble friend. He was right to make reference to Wales and Scotland. We
must not forget that among those to whom Magna Carta is addressed in
the preamble is Alan de Galloway, constable of
Scotland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000090">I
must declare my interest. Not only am I a member of the committee to
which the noble Lord, Lord Bew, referred, but I also have the honour to
be the chairman of the History of Parliament Trust and of the Historic
Lincoln Trust. In all of those capacities I am seeking to work to
ensure that 2015 is a memorable year. We have some marvellous events
planned in Lincoln, and I believe that my noble friend—I
deliberately call her that—Lady Boothroyd will not be too
disappointed by what happens here in Westminster. I agree about the
dusting of the statues, I hope something can be done there. The barons
and the two bishops who look down on us day by day have not received
any housekeeping attention for an extremely long time. As one looks up
and thinks of them—the four Williams, the earls of Pembroke,
Salisbury, Warren and Arundel, the great barons—one does realise
that we owe them a very real debt for what they did to bring the King
to account. I do not subscribe to the somewhat jaundiced view of Magna
Carta which was advanced in a slightly curmudgeonly way by the noble
Lord, Lord Addington. Well, de gustibus non est
disputandum.</hs_para>

Cormack:</Member></B> Quoting Latin is entirely permissible in this
Chamber. What I would like to say to the noble Baroness, Lady
Boothroyd, in particular, is that I have been able to have discussions
with the Deans of Lincoln and Salisbury and with the chief executive
and chairman of the British Library, the noble Baroness, Lady
Blackstone, and I am not unhopeful that the sort of event to which she
referred will take place. Obviously further negotiations have to be
conducted, but I believe that it would be wholly appropriate to see the
four documents here. Whether Westminster Hall would be the right place
because of the climatic conditions is a 
<?notus-xml column=432?>different matter, but it would be good to see them here. Westminster
Hall should certainly have great events. In 1965, Her Majesty the Queen
came to commemorate the 750<Sup>th</Sup> anniversary of Magna Carta and
the 700<Sup>th</Sup> anniversary of the de Montfort
Parliament. I very much hope that something similar will be able to
happen in 2015. I can also say to noble Lords that I have had some
conversations with the Halle Orchestra, and I hope there will be some
wonderful performance in Westminster Hall that
year.</hs_para>

resoundingly memorable year in every possible way, and of course it
wants to reach out to young people. I hope that we will do symbolic
things. On 15 June, the anniversary itself, when we all hope that there
will be a great event at Runnymede, it would be appropriate for there
to be a public holiday and for Parliament to adjourn, after a brief
sitting, to Runnymede and be there with Her Majesty the Queen. That
would be entirely right and proper. I hope we might persuade those
other countries for which Magna Carta is so important to have a public
holiday on that day as well so that we are united in our recognition of
the importance of the rule of law.</hs_para>

have that right around Westminster Hall so that young people in
particular can recognise the continuity of Magna Carta, and its
fundamental importance to our very way of life. I hope that the noble
Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, will feel that those of us who serve on the
Committee from the two Houses of Parliament are entirely at one with
her in her sentiments of wanting this to be a really memorable year in
the history of our Parliament and country. We are certainly determined
in Lincoln, where we have one of the four original copies, to make it
one of the most memorable years in our history, with
exhibitions, a Three Choirs Festival and many
other things—all of these, I say to the noble Baroness, Lady
Lane-Fox, reaching out particularly to the young. For the youth of the

Dykes (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow my
former Commons colleague the noble Lord, Lord Cormack. We worked
together on a number of schemes, some including human rights, both
overseas and in the UK. We, as MPs, came to know of his knowledge of
and affection for the history of Parliaments from ancient times and of
his experience of reading and writing about those things. We are very
grateful. This is an important occasion. I thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Boothroyd; I was impressed that she was well under her time limit
in her opening, which was commendable.</hs_para>

noble Baroness’s anxieties and concerns about some things.
Although they will be immensely important, the World War 1
commemoration period, over several years, will have far more government
money attached to it than anything to do with the Magna Carta
celebrations. That is a pity. In a historical context, Magna Carta is
deeply inspiring.</hs_para>

for the excellent maiden speech from the main coalition party Benches
of my noble friend Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth. His knowledge of this
matter is profound, and I am sure that he will be heavily involved in a
number of these activities. I am also grateful for the excellent
historical analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, and my noble friend
Lord Addington. They gave the original background to it. We should not
get carried away with the starry-eyed Mills and Boon version of Magna
Carta which is not really true. The gradual development over hundreds
of years of democracy as we now know it, as well as the importance of
the rule of law, was opportunistic, episodic and accidental. The
Glorious Revolution of 1688 was one stage in that process, as were the
United States’s declaration of independence and constitution.
What a pity we did not pay more attention to the French
Revolution’s<I> Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
Citizen</I> because we were afraid of it; it is a substantial document
but little known in this country because of the intellectual and
psychological gap between the political cultures of the continent and
ourselves, with our Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-American
traditions.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110789000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000099">I
am also grateful—this is a time for mentioning gratitude, I
think—to Sir Robert Worcester, that talented and noble son of
Kansas as was, but now an English American, for leading the Magna Carta

he sent me a helpful briefing memorandum about this debate. It reminded
me that, speaking at the UN General Assembly in 1948, as she submitted
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt argued
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13110789000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000166">“we

of events have been considered and planned with the hope, according to
this memorandum, that in 2015 more than 100 countries will be
commemorating the importance of what began on an open plain
800 years earlier to this generation and many generations to
come. The danger is that it will not be noticed enough by the media
unless there is real force and psychological strength behind that
effort. That does need a lot of attention and organisation. It is
amazing how quickly time goes when one is coming up to a deadline of
that kind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000101">I
note, too, that after the Second World War Germany and Japan were
apprised, quite rightly, of the virtues of the Magna Carta, in its
modernised form, the text, what it meant and the rule of law. What a
model democracy Germany has become after the nightmare 
<?notus-xml column=434?>it went through with the Third Reich. It is a very impressive
achievement, and we are proud to be friends with the great German
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000102">I
believe, too, that even though one of our weaknesses—and it is a
controversial point, so I apologise in advance for making it—is
in not having a written constitution, there is a feeling of pride in
many people that we are unusual and unique in not having one, although
all the other Commonwealth countries which came from the Anglo-Saxon
tradition directly with independence much earlier than the colonies do
have commendable written constitutions. At least, though, we have
access to the European treaties, which are an international kind of
constitutional backcloth to the rule of law and human rights, and the
European Convention on Human Rights. All those things started 800 years
ago as gradualistic concepts in a very different context with very few
people involved. The barons in those days were very exclusive indeed,
unlike the huge, overlarge House of Lords Chamber we have now with far
too many barons. Despite that reality all of us would like to be
considered to be here validly, both the noble Barons and the noble
Baronesses. The more noble Baronesses we have, the
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000103">There
is a lot to be done. I think that if all those threads come together
and the Government put a reasonable budget figure on the expenditure as
well as other organisations and the private fundraising that will go
on, this can be a great occasion for all of us to be proud with lessons
for the future and particularly for the younger
generation.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/4B3D5D0FC614215F4955C99E421AF1BB0E9A1D97" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

Bilimoria (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, Sir Bob Worcester, the chairman
of the Magna Carta 800th anniversary commemoration committee, in a
recent speech, summed it up really well—foundation of human
rights, father of all constitutions, basis of our civil liberties,
rights of free men and now women and of legal tradition, the bedrock of
our systems of democracy. Then he says, “Who are its
guardians?” He says it is our system of rule of law,
jurisprudence, of
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T18:38:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I say

the first Zoroastrian Parsee to sit in this House, I would like to talk
about Cyrus the Great, one of the greatest emperors of the ancient
world, best known for two things. The first is the Cyrus cylinder,
perhaps the first recognisable modern legal instrument. In the UK we
consider the role of the Magna Carta. Without fail when I take people
round this House, I show them the facsimile copy in the Contents Lobby.
We think it is great: sealed in 1215 on the field of Runnymede; the
first bill of rights; power of the barons over the king; the
establishment of the House of Lords and the House of Commons; a
Parliament free of the direct control of the

the Magna Carta is juvenile compared to Cyrus’s
cylinder—a declaration found in the ruins of ancient Babylon
that set out the great deeds and genealogy of Emperor Cyrus. Created
around 530 BC, the cylinder notes Cyrus’s great humility and
tolerance, which formed vital aspects of the tradition of the
Zoroastrian faith. This is true because of the role that 
<?notus-xml column=435?>Cyrus played, not just in the protection but in the active promotion of
many religions and faiths that flourished in the Persian empire during
his time. It cites his building projects and the territories that he

is well known for his magnanimity. A specific example is the refuge

Great Charter”, and he could not remember the date, 15 June

I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, for
initiating this debate with such enthusiasm and passion, and I agree
with all that she said. As we know, Magna Carta has 
<?notus-xml column=436?>played a critical role in developing our form of democratic government,
subject to the rule of law. It is important because of the influence it
has had, not only in this country but around the globe, and
particularly in the Commonwealth, in establishing the constitutional
principles governing any society committed to the rule of law, which as
we know is fundamental to any democracy.</hs_para>

near to Runnymede, where Magna Carta was sealed. This initiative,
“Magna Carta in Egham”, is led by Egham Museum and I am
associated 
<?notus-xml column=437?>with it. The impetus for this project sprang from concern that the
planned celebrations would be a passing spectacle which would leave
local residents passive bystanders without any involvement or lasting
legacy. To ensure that this does not happen, volunteers—I
emphasise that they are volunteers—from Egham Museum are working
to produce online resources to support debates and are organising a
series of Magna Carta constitutional conventions, bringing students
from across the UK to Runnymede to debate and draft a modern-day
charter. They are also planning an exhibition at Egham Museum with
satellite displays at various locations around the area. A lot more
activities will also take place using new media. I was delighted to
hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox, said in that regard.

important thing is that the focus is on local engagement and
participation. It is these types of activities which need support and
outreach from this House and Parliament. While symbolic events and
celebrations are extremely important, this Parliament needs to reach
out. I therefore urge this House to work in partnership with such
imaginative and community-based projects and use the occasion of Magna
Carta’s anniversary to encourage participation, help unleash
local civic spirit, and make the best use of new technology to ensure
that that happens. We are not a closed House; we must link up with what

Stevenson of Balmacara (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I join all noble
Lords in thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, for providing the
opportunity for today’s excellent debate, which has been most
interesting and to the high standard usually found in this House. I
thank all speakers for their contribution. In particular, I praise the
maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Bourne, which was excellent and
of very high quality. There have been three maiden speeches today, of
rising quality, which has set the bar very high for those who have to
follow. I noted, as other noble Lords will have done, his early bid to
be appointed to the Refreshment Committee. This raises the stakes a bit
for those who are yet to come. These days, if you want to put in a bid
for where you want to be in a few years, you have to do it in your
maiden speech—that sounds a bit
daft.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000120">The
noble Lord and other speakers mentioned a theme which came out of these
discussions—whether or not we should have a written
constitution. We do, of course, have a written constitution. The
problem is that it is dispersed into so many different documents. What
we are really talking about is codifying our existing constitutional
documents into a single place. That would have been a fantastic
solution to the question of how to celebrate Magna Carta in 2015. It
may take us until 2115 but we should not give up the aim to do it. The
noble Lord is correct, and I absolutely agree with him on that
point.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110789000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000121">I also
thank the Library for its very high-quality briefing which brought us
right into the debate. It was interesting to read Magna Carta again. It
is difficult to know what it is these days, because it is hard to
imagine what it would have been like when it first 
<?notus-xml column=438?>came out. It came across to me, in a curious way, as a bit like a
manifesto—that is the nearest analogy I can think of. When you
became sovereign you had to engage with those you ruled in order to
gain their acceptance of your ability to rule, a bit like a modern-day
manifesto.</hs_para>

spoken very well about what it means to have a Magna Carta. I endorse a
lot of what has been said: it is a fantastic document. It is also very
modern. It is fascinating to read in one of its chapters about what to
do with payday lenders. The FCA should take note: this has been around
for a long time and I am not quite sure why it has taken so long. The
sections relating to the City rail against those who might lobby
unfairly for advantage: those who are discussing the lobbying Bill
might reread that section
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000123">We have a
number of proposals to come from the noble Lord who will respond to
this debate and I do not want to delay the House unduly before that.
However, I want to run over a couple of things that struck me during
the debate. The noble Baronesses, Lady Prashar and Lady Lane-Fox, were
right to pick up on the need to engage with the younger generation in a
modern way. This has to be done through social media; there is no point
in trying to look at old ways of doing this. We have to get real, get
into social media and involve them. I hope that that will be picked up
and taken
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000124">The
noble Lords, Lord Cormack and Lord Bew, were a bit unkind to us in
raising our anticipation of what is to come. I hope they will be
satisfied with what they hear. I like the idea of decamping to
Runnymede but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, said, we would need
to do something about the accommodation or there will be an awful lot
of tents required. The noble Lord, Lord Bew, reminded us that there are
other anniversaries: we must also think about them and find a place for
them to be recorded. If we do that then, going back to one of the
themes of Magna Carta, which is its UKness, we might also have space
for the Declaration of Arbroath which, in Scottish terms, is as
important as Magna Carta.</hs_para>

debate that your Lordships’ House does very well. It does it
very well because it is trying to capture the importance of a
particular historical event, to place it, and make an assessment of its
contribution to the development of our political system over a number
of centuries. Importantly, it does this in a way that illuminates and
reinforces the values that underpin our current parliamentary liberal
democracy. That is the whole basis for why we should celebrate Magna
Carta. It did not deliver democracy by any means, but it was the start
of a process that developed concepts that, in time, became absolutely
essential in underpinning the nature of liberal parliamentary
democracy.</hs_para>

seem a long way away, it is important that we make plans. I will say
later that there are disadvantages and advantages in having this debate
at this stage, which were alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Bew. We
want to involve Members in the planning process, and a number of
Members made contributions this evening that clearly deserve to be
taken further, and I encourage the officials of the House to have
contact with them about the extent to which their suggestions can be
taken up and further
developed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110789000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-0003.htm#13110789000129">The
Magna Carta is undoubtedly one of the most important documents in the
development of—I use the words carefully—our largely
unwritten constitution. There is a historic and political science
debate to be had about that, but we are not having it now. Although
Magna Carta was forced upon King John as the result of a political
crisis and drawn together in haste, it was underpinned by key
principles that have shaped our legal and constitutional system. In
particular—these have been alluded to and explained throughout
the debate—are the principles that the Executive in particular
must be subject to the rule of law and that there must be no taxation
without consent. There were the beginnings of the key concept of
holding the Executive to account. All these principles, as I say, were
developed further and underpinned parliamentary democracy. As many
Members of your Lordships’ House pointed out, Magna Carta has
also played a significant role in the development of constitutions in
many other countries around the world. The statues of the Magna Carta
Barons, who keep an eye on us here in the Chamber, reflect the
connections between Parliament and Magna Carta, and it is absolutely
right that we, as this House—I repeat, this House—should
celebrate its anniversary.</hs_para>

left, I would like to set out some of the plans that both Houses have
started to make. First, those plans need to be considered in the wider
context of other anniversaries that the House will be marking in 2015.
Secondly, it might be helpful for me to say a little more about how our
plans fit in with other events being planned nationally. There has been
reference to the other anniversaries that will be celebrated in 2015,
because it will be a momentous year for Parliament for many reasons.
Obviously, some lesser minds will no doubt be focused on the outcome of
the general election in that year but there will be a number of special
events happening during the year that look back at the important
anniversaries that we are here to celebrate. This debate has already
drawn attention to the fact that in 2015 we will mark 800 years since
the 
<?notus-xml column=440?>sealing of Magna Carta. In addition, 2015 will also be 750 years since
the de Montfort Parliament. Together, these two anniversaries can be
seen as marking the beginning of a process towards our parliamentary
democracy, and the de Montfort Parliament in particular has a unique
resonance for us because it met in Westminster Hall. The year 2015 will
also mark 600 years since the battle of Agincourt and the
creation of the office of the Serjeant at Arms, 200 years since the
battle of Waterloo and, as has been mentioned, 50 years
since the death of Sir Winston Churchill. Parliament will therefore
have a lot to celebrate and commemorate in 2015, and officials and
Members—I repeat, and Members—have already begun to
develop some ideas for possible ways in which this House, along with
the House of Commons, may be able to mark these
occasions.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T18:49:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/D968334408ED615255C705E10C71059AF4EBAF6A" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

medieval origins and the development of other concepts and rights, and

not in a position to confirm details of the programme in any specific

argument to have a single great parliamentary occasion that, if
possible, brings together what are technically the
engrossments—the surviving copies of Magna Carta—and thus
in a sense bring them home to Parliament. That would provide an

problem is that when the present Parliament building was built, the

the statues so high up. Since then, of course,

wish to look at. The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, gave us an absolutely
outstanding and correct theoretical analysis by placing Magna Carta in
its wider perspective. The question that has been reflected by many
noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, in
his excellent maiden speech, is “Why celebrate Magna
Carta?”. The vital point to make is the linking of Magna Carta
with our enduring liberties. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, blamed me

Hussein-Ece (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, when Tunisian Mohamed Bouazizi
set himself on fire in December 2010, he became the catalyst for a wave
of protests that triggered revolutions against dictatorial regimes that
had ruled the Middle East for decades and generations. These protest
movements called for social justice for impoverished citizens who faced
rising unemployment, reduced living standards and a lack of political
freedom and free speech. Men and women all wanted dignity as well as
democracy. While each country had its own specific challenges and
difficulties, these common themes emerged as calls from the protestors
began to echo across the region. The demand for human rights came from
both men and women, with women playing an active and unprecedented role
in the protests and
revolutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:00:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000003">The
changes sweeping countries affected by the events of the Arab uprisings
presented opportunities to establish real progressive changes in the
attitudes towards and treatment of women across the Arab world.
However, in taking a long, hard look, and despite the existence of
international resolutions drafted to protect and empower women, the
challenges facing women remain overwhelming. In particular, the initial
small gains made by women on the front lines of their respective
revolutions are in real danger of regression as religious and
male-dominated conservatism occupies the power vacuum in some
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:01:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000004">The
Arab uprisings were, it is fair to say, among the most important and
powerful events of the past 100 years, some say since the
fall of the Ottoman Empire. The aftermath of the revolutions has
brought a backlash against the rights of citizens, particularly women,
when we contrast the current status of women’s rights in these
countries with the roles played by women of all ages, ideologies,
ethnicities and social backgrounds in the uprisings in countries such
as Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen. When dictators began to fall, there was
relief and a sense that women would be able to gain political
empowerment. The Arab spring signalled many new beginnings,
possibilities and, most of all, hope for a better
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:02:13"></hs_TimeCode>. On 25
January 2011, as we watched millions of Egyptians demonstrating in
Tahrir Square, demanding jobs, freedom, social justice and the removal
of the then President Mubarak, the voices of millions of women, Copts,
Muslims and Bedouin stood together in a truly historical
moment.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110765000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000005">Another triumph for
women during the Arab spring was their constant presence throughout the
social media sphere. Some commentators dubbed it the “social 
<?notus-xml column=124?>media revolution” and debate has continued
about the effects and role of social media in the Arab spring. It
marked a turning point of instant news and access to what was happening
on the ground. I read many tweets from women in real time who were
taking part in a revolution. Yet these women found themselves suddenly
targeted by the authorities and by factions. We saw the horror of
violence against women unfold in Tahrir Square. It was clear that those
carrying out gang rapes were organised, well paid and well protected.
They were in the hundreds. Did it stop the women? The following days
saw the insurgence of women protesters boldly
increasing—multiplied, loud and
fearless.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000006">The
Egyptian experience perhaps brought a sharp focus upon these attacks.
During the Tahrir Square protests, most shockingly, there were numerous
reports of police sexual attacks on female protestors—and,
infamously, the virginity tests. Egyptian military doctors subjected
some female demonstrators to invasive virginity tests, following police
arrests for demonstrating. A young Egyptian woman, Samira Ibrahim
fought to take her case to court, along with other female protestors.
While an order was put out demanding an end to the practice, the
military court cleared the doctor who had performed the test. These
appalling tactics were used to scare off the growing presence of women
during the Egyptian
protests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000007">Alongside
these reports came stories of the sexual assault of female journalists.
CBS reporter Lara Logan came to the attention of western media when she
reported her story of having been sexually assaulted by men while she
was reporting at the demonstrations. Following this, further stories
reported a young British journalist, Natasha Smith, and an
American-Egyptian commentator, Mona Eltahawy, were subjected to similar
attacks. So when dictators began to fall, there was relief that women
would be able to taste what political empowerment felt like. The Arab
spring signalled many new beginnings, possibilities and most of all,
hope for a better future. However the rise to power of
religiously-dominated patriarchal parties in Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco
and Libya meant new restrictions imposed on women. The post-revolution
regression of female equality has been most acute in Egypt, first and
disappointingly under the elected Government of the Muslim Brotherhood,
and presently under the transitional Government. Women were not
represented at all in the constitutional committee under the Muslim
Brotherhood, and though they now make up 5% of the membership under the
transitional Government, they remain largely isolated from
decision-making positions and structures.</hs_para>

Morocco, there were eight women in the previous Cabinet; today there is
only one. Earlier this year, the Moroccan Parliament adopted a
decree lowering the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16,
which is considered a major setback. A first draft of the electoral law
in Libya reserved 10% of seats in the constituent assembly for women,
but the quota was later abandoned. In Yemen, despite the
country’s commitment to international women’s rights
conventions, the transitional Government has failed to implement and
enforce even existing laws designed to protect women. In Syria,
the situation is most acute and declining. The conflict, ongoing since
early 2012, has left more than 
<?notus-xml column=125?>100,000 Syrians dead—including 6,000
children—and estimates for Syrian refugees living in Lebanon now
top 1 million. Refugees, in particular women, have faced
isolation, marginalisation and violence in refugee camps. Many of these
women refugees face sexual harassment in public places such as where
they obtain their assistance coupons. Those left fighting for
democratic choice within Syria face disproportionate punishment for
their actions, including detainment, torture and assault. Syrian women
leaders have emphasised the urgent need for Geneva II—which has
sadly been delayed yet again—and for Syrian women to be
part of that political
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:07:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110765000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000009">On 29 October, Syrian
activists and leaders gathered alongside 80 others in Jordan for the
Arab Regional Training on Women, Peace and Security, organised by
women’s rights organisation Karama in partnership with the UN
Women’s Fund for Gender Equality and the UN Development
Programme. It was held to build the capacity of civil society leaders
to implement international resolutions on women, peace and security,
and to lobby for national action plans advocating
women’s inclusion in the transition and the peacebuilding
process. When we reflect on what the Arab spring did, it would be
impossible to provide a full analysis of its effects on the lives of
women, primarily because in many instances the Arab spring—or
autumn as it has now been dubbed—continues in various forms, as
the many countries continue to adjust constantly to new
rules of law, governance and uncertainty. However, for the first time
in recent Middle Eastern history, women played a crucial role in
defining their country’s future. It gave women a platform for
their voices to be heard and their stories to be shared, but the news,
as I have briefly outlined, is not promising. Many women feel their
lives and their rights have deteriorated. Rebeca Grynspan, the UN
Under-Secretary-General and associate administrator of the UN
Development Programme,
stated:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13110765000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000156">“The
character of this century will be determined by our ability to walk
towards gender equality. All the studies not only suggest that if you
tackle gender equality, you empower women, but you also will be much
more effective in fighting poverty and
hunger”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13110765000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000010">The
measure of democratic success is weighed in the treatment of women,
their advancements in politics, media and social spaces and the ways in
which women’s issues are defined and responded to. I would
therefore ask for an assurance from the Minister that, when meeting
delegations or when Geneva II is finally convened, the United Kingdom
will take a strong lead in ensuring that there will be representation
from women and that women’s rights will be on the table
and part of that discussion. It surely cannot be right that
women’s voices continue to be suppressed by male-dominated talks
that affect the lives of 50% of the MENA—Middle East and north
Africa—countries. I am grateful for the helpful briefing from
Karama, whose founder is Hibaaq Osman. I look forward to hearing from
other noble Lords, in particular from my noble friend Lady Hodgson, who
will be making her maiden speech.</hs_para>

Tonge (Ind LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend
on securing this very important debate. The position of women in the
Middle East is a constant 
<?notus-xml column=126?>source of concern for many of us. At first, I
thought that the so-called Arab spring was good news for
women in those countries but, sadly, the effects are not proving
universally
beneficial<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:10:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

role in many countries’ demonstrations and protests. As we have
heard, they were not afraid to be out on the streets with their men,
and they displayed even greater courage than our own sisters in the
suffragette movement did at the beginning of the last century. In fact,
it is not very long since women in this country had few
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:10:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in Tunisia and spread quickly. The leaders of Egypt, Libya and Yemen
were overthrown. The protests in Syria have led to a tragic civil war
in that most beautiful country. Before the Arab uprisings, women
enjoyed some rights—Islam did not mean necessarily that women
were oppressed. Although not strictly an Arab country—and I have
to put in a plug here—Iran was and is quite remarkable in its
encouragement of women’s education and their freedom to use
contraception. Iran is often quoted in family planning circles for its
amazing 1.9 fertility rate. That is less than the replacement level and
it means that women are having fewer children.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110765000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000014">Family<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:12:19"></hs_TimeCode>
planning, despite the ayatollahs, is thriving in Islamic Iran. In some
countries where Islamists predominantly led the uprisings, there has
been a falling back for women’s rights and freedom, but not in
Iran. It was beginning to happen in Egypt under the Morsi presidency,
where women’s rights were being talked about. However, that was
a tragedy for Egypt because, together with other restrictions that we
have heard about, it gave a cause célèbre for a coup by
the army, which I have to say should have been condemned by our
Government. Whether we like them or not, the way for democratically
elected Governments in the Middle East—the Hamas-led Government
in Palestine was another example in 2006—to be removed is at the
ballot box, not at the point of a gun. I do not like the coalition
Government very much, as noble Lords may have noticed, but we have to
wait until they are dispatched, or not, at the next election. We lose
all credibility if we preach democracy and then refuse to recognise the
decision of the electorate in other
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000015">I
want to make a special plea for our Government to recognise what has
been going on in Bahrain since the Arab uprisings and to recognise the
treatment of women there in particular. Hundreds of women have been
sacked for participating in pro-democracy demonstrations, and even
those who got their jobs back have had to give up their trade union
membership and employment rights. They cannot vote or participate in
any way with the political process there. Women have been arrested in
their homes in the middle of the night; they have been tortured and
sexually abused; and some have gone on hunger
strike.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000016">A
teacher who led a protest march—I have the details—was
arrested, tortured, sentenced and refused permission to work again. A
young mother and activist—sick with cancer, as it
happened—was made to stand in a doorway while she was sexually
abused, all for wearing a political T-shirt. A heavily pregnant woman
was jailed with no charge because she objected to her husband’s
arrest at a checkpoint. At least 13 women have died in Bahrain, with no
one being held accountable.</hs_para>

there is some good news. Over the past 10 years, a quiet
revolution has been going on in the Middle East. Health services and
education have improved in most countries, although sadly not in Yemen.
Iraq had very fine health services but they are subject to great strain
at the moment. Gender equality has been achieved in education in most
Middle Eastern countries, although, as we have heard, opportunities
afterwards are still very limited. Maternal mortality has dropped
dramatically, although again, not in Yemen. In Yemen 110 women per
100,000 still lose their lives in childbirth, which is very high
indeed, but in other countries the rate has come down and the most
remarkable thing of all is that over the past 20 years women have been
following the example of their sisters in Iran and accessing family
planning to limit their
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000019">The
Arab spring, we are told, was led by the explosion in the number of
young people wanting a better, different life. The women want a better,
different life but a researcher in the USA, Professor Eberstadt, calls
it the “youth quake”, which I rather like. However, the
drop in family size all over Middle Eastern countries will balance that
out eventually and reap a huge benefit for women. Later marriage, which
is also occurring, and fewer babies mean better health for women, a
longer time in education, a better family income as mothers join the
workforce and, I hope, more time to forge their way into the
constipated—if noble Lords will excuse the medical
term—male politics all over the Middle East. In the future we
can expect a “women quake” and good luck to them. We will

noble friend Lady Hodgson to your Lordships’ House, particularly
after such a thoroughly knowledgeable and passionate speech. As a
former president of the Conservative Women’s Organisation, she
joins an illustrious group of women on the Conservative Benches who
have previously held that position: my noble friends Lady Byford, Lady
Seccombe and Lady Anelay, who are with us this afternoon. I know that
in that role she founded the Conservative Women’s Muslim Group,
whose events I have had the privilege of attending. She is also known
for her encouragement of many women in the preparatory stages of
standing for election to the other place. Among her other roles outside
your Lordships’ House, my noble friend Lady Hodgson is patron of
the Afghan Connection and a member of the Association of Oxfam. I
understand that she not only listens to women’s concerns but has
unfortunately got a little too close to the action on occasion in
Afghanistan. Of course, she is known for her expertise in gender issues
and international development and will make a worthy contribution to
your Lordships’ House, but I also know from having worked
alongside her in Conservative Campaign Headquarters that she brings

many women in the Middle East, the Arab spring has brought little
change in terms of the law but not in terms of courage. The simple act
of a woman driving a car in Saudi Arabia is a protest and putting such
footage on YouTube is courageous, as every computer is, I believe,
traceable by the regime. That shows how much we women sometimes take
for granted in the UK but we should not be too complacent as
Tunisia’s Parliament now has 27% women and the UK has only 23%.
However, all eyes in the Arab world are on Egypt, which is currently
writing its new constitution, and it is Egypt that I wish to focus on
this
afternoon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000030">The
position of women in Egyptian society since the military intervention
earlier this year has now arrived at a tipping point. Previously, under
President Mubarak, women were sparse in the political arena and were
not really visible. The protests in January 2011 included mass protest
by women, and it looked as though the tide was turning. However, under
the period of rule by SCAF and then President Morsi matters started to
decline
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000031">In my
own visit to Egypt in October 2011, I found women in Alexandria scared
to go out in public. This was not only because the lack of a police
force meant a decline in law and order, but because they felt under 
<?notus-xml column=130?>increased pressure to veil themselves whenever in
public. Christian families were reportedly asking their daughters to
wear headscarves so they could not be picked out in any way. The
radicals were empowered as women were objectified. There were reports
of acid attacks and other assaults, and the security forces did
nothing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000032">However,
I believe that two factors halted this declining trajectory. The Morsi
regime tried to hand power to the Al-Azhar University, but the
university refused to take it. Its members did not want to be the
ultimate interpreters of the constitution in Egypt, which is what
President Morsi offered them. They would not allow him to remove the
Grand Imam, and I understand that in future that post will not be
appointed by the President. These were key moves towards a theocratic
state, and they were thwarted. As the only pan-Sunni institution to
have survived the fall of the Caliphate in 1924, Al-Azhar’s
influence extends across the Sunni world. I believe women across the
region will in future be very grateful for the institutional
independence and courage shown by Al-Azhar. I do hope that Her
Majesty’s Government have thanked them
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000033">The
second matter is the women themselves, who could see how this
trajectory would affect them and their daughters in the future. A fear
barrier was broken in 2011 and it was not going to be resurrected.
Bishop Angaelos of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom,
who was in Egypt during the anti-Morsi protests this year, recalled to
me that he saw a young veiled woman in Tahrir Square holding a placard
of Morsi with a red cross through it. This action would have been
unthinkable three years ago, as would the current presence of women in
the Egyptian media as talk show hosts and political commentators,
and—due to the cost of living in Egypt—as an increasingly
vital part of the labour market. Women have been given a platform and
have risen to the occasion. Feminism is not being seen as some kind of
foreign import but increasingly as an Egyptian value. Egyptian women
were not going to allow the revolution of 2011 to be taken from
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000034">In
Parliament last month, it was a privilege to hear from Mrs Mona
Zulficar, vice-president of the Egyptian constitutional drafting
committee and an international corporate lawyer. The very fact that a
woman is in such a prominent and influential position is remarkable in
itself, and her passion to ensure the rights of all Egyptians was
matched only by her keenly felt responsibility on behalf of women
across the Middle East and north Africa. Women’s rights groups
from across the region have been contacting the Egyptian constitutional

I believe that the UK and the EU’s efforts for human rights and

Arab spring was the people’s revolt against dictatorships and
authoritarian regimes, although its impact on women remains
unclear. Women stood hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with their

military rule—a couple of days after, in fact—and a few
of us stood and talked with protesters on the square and with those
occupying the presidential palaces. We witnessed men and women standing
together for their country’s future. As a mere observer, I
believed, like many others, that women would participate in the
development and building of their new nations and Governments.
Political parties on the ground acknowledged the importance of
including women in governance. A report by UN Women noted that the high
presence of women protesters calling for change raised hopes for
freedom and equality for men and women in Arab societies, and it said
that it was an exciting moment to hear women’s political voices
campaigning for democracy. Women were able to express opinions
publicly, not only about dictatorship but about their aspirations for a
better future, education, employment, justice and peace.
Significantly—this is a point on which I want to
concentrate—many women reported their experience of violence and
sexual assault, particularly at the hands of military personnel, when
they took part in protests or were arrested.</hs_para>

descended into chaos, murder, summary justice, judicial killing and
civil war, women and children have suffered mortifying violence, the

2010, I raised the matter of rape as a weapon of war and conflict, and
I drew your Lordships’ attention to rape being used as a weapon
during the war between Pakistan and Bangladesh, when hundreds of
thousands of women were raped, tortured or killed. Many have since died
without seeing the perpetrators brought before the courts, without
having their struggles believed and without seeing justice. We have
come far since then and I applaud the Foreign Secretary for his
leadership in getting rape on the agenda. I remain concerned, however,
that the practicality of implementing our good intentions has yet to be
worked out. Rape, including of children, continues to be used widely in
today’s global conflicts. Does the Minister believe that
measures are in place to ensure that agencies working on the ground can
record allegations of rape so that the perpetrators can be identified

uprising was undoubtedly a crossroads for many women in the Arab world.
It opened up dialogue with women in countries and across borders and
regional boundaries, aided by technology and the Facebook generation.
It gave many more women a platform for their voices to be heard, albeit
temporarily. The opinions of women are now extremely divided. Many have
argued that the situation of women in the region has worsened
post-revolution and that the uprising has eroded many of the legal

EU meeting with Ministers from the Middle East and north Africa in
Paris on 12 September on strengthening the role of women in society
coincided with EU negotiations to review and revise aid and trade
relations with the countries of the MENA region. While the EU has
committed to promoting a “more for more” approach,
whereby aid recipient states receive funding if they implement
democratic reforms, the approach does not explicitly mention
women’s rights. That was a point highlighted by the noble
Baroness, Lady Berridge. How does the Minister think the EU will hold
recipient countries to account if they fail to respect the rights of
women to take part in decision-making institutions and

the Minister indicate what steps the Government will take to factor
benchmarks on women’s rights alongside wider benchmarks on good
governance and human rights into the UK’s and the EU’s

consulted on the development of these benchmarks? An environment should
be supported whereby women politicians, women’s rights
organisations and women’s rights activists can freely operate
and be protected from intimidation. The Government should ensure
flexible funding mechanisms for women’s rights organisations so
that capacity can be built and improved and communications can be
established, and they should ensure that they have the resources to

fulfil their traditional gender roles. I once again ask the Minister
what assessment the Government have made and what action they are
taking to understand and tailor policies to the impact of the crisis on
the women affected, including violence against women and girl refugees.
What steps will Her Majesty’s Government—both DfID and

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend Lady Hussein-Ece for bringing such an important issue to the
Committee, and all noble Lords who have participated in this important
debate. It would be remiss of me not to single out my noble friend Lady
Hodgson, who I welcome to our Benches in the House of Lords and
congratulate on 
<?notus-xml column=135?>her excellent maiden speech. It was both thoughtful and reflective of
her great expertise across many areas, but particularly in the
international field in relation to women’s rights. I look
forward to working with her in the years ahead on this issue
and on other matters. I wish her a very warm welcome.</hs_para>

noble Lords on their contributions. The noble Baroness, Lady Uddin,
made a point about there being agreement across the board, and I
believe that on this issue we all stand as
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:44:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

promote gender equality and to tackle violence against women as a
matter of principle. We believe that human rights are universal and
should apply equally to all people, regardless of gender. Where women
have equal access to education, healthcare and political and economic
opportunities, societies, as several noble Lords have mentioned, are
healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful.</hs_para>

Arab spring in 2011. Those who looked at their television screens and
those who tweeted or went on to Facebook would have seen those great
flags of hope, as young men and, importantly, young women came out in
the hope of a new beginning. They took courageous stands in protests
across the region, and enduring symbols of the Arab spring stay with us
today. Men, women, youngsters and the old participated together in
demonstrations, calling for a realisation of their political and
economic aspirations. The noble Lord, Lord Collins of Highbury,
highlighted that very well.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110765000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000061">Since then,
some—I use that word carefully—progress has been made.
Many women have participated in democratic elections for the first
time, shaping new Governments. In Libya, for example, women’s
groups play an important role in civil society, but as my noble friend
Lady Hodgson pointed out, many challenges remain in terms of political
participation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000062">In
Yemen, women now hold 126 of the 565—that is, 22%—seats
in the National Dialogue Conference. I did a bit of a self-test
here. I went to our House of Commons, where there are currently 146
women out of the 650 representatives, which I believe is also 22%, so
perhaps the focus is not just, as it is today, on the MENA region;
there is also much work for us to do elsewhere.</hs_para>

taking the lead in their societies. Let us not forget Tawakkol Karman,
who jointly won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize for non-violent struggle for
the safety of women and for women’s rights to full participation
in peacebuilding work. I have also learnt recently that she has given
back the $500,000 that she won to be used in greater fights for
freedoms and equality in her country. Earlier this year, my noble
friend the Senior Minister of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, Lady Warsi, met another prominent woman from the region, the
United Arab Emirates’ Development Minister, Sheikha
Lubna.</hs_para>

remain. As my noble friend Lady Hussein-Ece highlighted, the future for
many women across the region remains uncertain, and there have not been
the gains that we had hoped for—and, more importantly, that
those in the region had hoped for—in democratic or political
participation and opportunity. Let us be clear: women are
underrepresented 
<?notus-xml column=136?>at senior levels of government and commerce in the region. Moreover,
they often face basic economic inequalities, such as pay
gaps.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110765000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000065">The
challenge is compounded by the political crises affecting parts of the
region. Many noble Lords have rightly referred to Syria, where women
face the challenges inherent in living in a conflict situation. In
Libya, many women have become victims of sexual and domestic
violence, as the noble Baroness, Lady Uddin, highlighted, and there is
weak access to medical services. In Yemen, increased instability since
2011 has seen a major humanitarian crisis. As my noble friend Lady
Berridge highlighted, the hopes that we saw in Tahrir Square in
Egypt have not been realised in terms of political
participation.</hs_para>

doing? Several noble Lords raised questions, and it is right that we
highlight the steps that the Government have taken and continue to
take. We recognise that increasing women’s participation is a
vital part of supporting transitions and building stability in the
region. As such, the UK is taking strong action to support
women’s empowerment through a number of
approaches.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000067">The
noble Lord, Lord Collins, and my noble friend Lady Berridge raised the
issue of the EU fund and the donor policy. We have set up the Arab
Partnership Fund, which was created in 2011 to support positive
long-term reform in the region, and more than £110
million has been allocated between 2011 and 2015. Last year,
approximately £2.6 million of that fund was allocated to
projects that specifically benefited women. In Egypt, for example, we
have provided assistance to women candidates in local elections. In
Libya, we have funded work to strengthen women’s participation
in the General National Congress. In Morocco, we are working to
establish a women’s affairs committee in

Lady Tonge, spoke with great clarity about some of the challenges faced
by women and raised the issue of Bahrain and the Government’s
position. Let me assure her that Her Majesty’s Government
continue to work on supporting the process of national dialogue and
political reform in Bahrain, including promoting international human
rights standards and political reform. Those are key parts of the
dialogue and in all our representations at ministerial level, we remind
the Bahraini Government of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000070">During
the recent event, the DfID Secretary of State, my right honourable
friend Justine Greening, announced the creation of an Arab women in
business challenge fund. The UK has contributed £10 million to
this fund, which will co-finance initiatives with the private sector to
deliver new job opportunities for women in the region. The UK has also
been working with several major law firms to establish a legal task
force to recommend ways to address legal barriers to women’s
economic participation. Additionally, we have selected women’s
empowerment as one of the three 
<?notus-xml column=137?>themes of our work as co-chair of the G8-BMENA process. The aim of that
work is to bring civil society and Governments in the region closer

pay tribute to the work of my noble friend Lady Hodgson on the steering
board currently advising the Foreign Secretary on his initiative to
prevent sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict countries. The
Foreign Secretary has made clear the priority he gives that issue, and
it provides a further opportunity to engage with Governments in the
region on women’s rights. The declaration of commitment to end
sexual violence in conflict that the Foreign Secretary launched at the
United Nations on 24 September has so far been endorsed by 134
countries, including almost all countries in the region. The noble
Baroness, Lady Uddin, also spoke about that issue. I assure her that in
all our discussions, whenever we meet Governments from across the MENA
region, we raise the issue with them and the instances of human rights
abuses, particularly sexual violence against
women<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:52:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000072">On

have given just some of the initiatives we are taking but the UK is
working hard to strengthen the role of women across the MENA region. I
fully accept that many challenges remain and the opportunities afforded
by the transitions in the region have yet to lead to widespread
concrete and sustainable gains for women. Now is not the time to draw
back our efforts, and we shall not, but rather to maintain and
strengthen them. The potential gains are huge. For example, research
has shown that if female employment rates in Egypt matched those of
men, GDP would increase by 34% by 2020.</hs_para>

conclusion, women played a key role in the demonstrations of the Arab
spring and there is an absolute need to ensure that they continue to
take a central and pivotal role as we build the democracies and new
constitutions of the region. This Government remain committed to
backing those aspirations and to turning that hope into reality. We
stood with many of the protesters in these countries—men, women,
the elderly and children—as they sought to bring change, and we
will stand with them in their transitional progress. We heard about the
vision of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the formation of Pakistan but perhaps
many of the countries that put Islam at their centre need to reflect on
the origins of Islam, where women played a pivotal and central role in
the empowerment and progression of the faith. I end with a quote from

OSCE whether in government or in opposition, both as a forum for
high-level political dialogue on security issues and as a platform for
practical—and that is an important word—work to improve
lives and communities. We believe as OSCE does, that the three
dimensions of security, namely politico-military, economic and
environmental and, thirdly, human, differences can be bridged and trust
can be built through co-operation. From the Helsinki Final Act in 1975
to today is not only a long period in history, but it is obviously a
time that has seen fundamental changes to Europe. The creation of CSCE
served an important role, as I understand it, during the Cold War, and
in 1994 it became OSCE. Now, nearly 20 years later, we believe it
continues to play a significant role in today’s very different
but still very difficult world.</hs_para>

question comes back to something that the noble Lord, Lord Bowness,

particular. The Lithuanian rapporteur’s report prepared for the

are all old enough to have been in at the beginning. I remember the
negotiations in Helsinki in 1972 to 1974, which led to the final act of
what became the conference on security and co-operation in Europe. The
co-operation baskets which were negotiated were in effect a trade-off
between an emphasis on security and arms control, confidence-building
measures and the economic co-operation which the Soviet Union, as it
then was, very much hoped for, including in particular a degree of
technological transfer, and the human rights basket which the West
wanted in

lot of us well remember, that led to the establishment of Helsinki
groups in a number of eastern European countries. In the 1980s, when I
was the British secretary of the UK-Soviet round table it certainly led
to some very interesting conversations, in which our Soviet
counterparts recognised that if they wanted to be accepted as a
European country there were European standards, as expressed in the
Helsinki Final Act, to which they had to pay some attention. That is
still there in the background of what has become the post-Cold War
OSCE. All the countries which emerged from the Soviet Union are of
course members of the OSCE, some more enthusiastic than
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000109">With

with slightly overambitious thoughts about how important the OSCE would
be as an international organisation. However, we all recognise that it
remains a useful organisation, although a very difficult one to work
within, because it operates by consensus. That means that we move at
the pace of the slowest or most awkward partner, and I think we all

also now includes environmental and energy co-operation. These are not
easy subjects when we are dealing with one of the world’s
largest oil and gas exporters as a member of the OSCE. The whole
question of conventional arms reduction across the area covered, which
has proved more and more difficult, includes confidence-building
measures, in which we are supposed to observe each other’s
manoeuvres and inform each other in advance of major troop movements.

closed in 2011. We also regret that the conflicts with which the OSCE
is institutionally engaged in Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia
and South Ossetia are stuck and so little progress has been made. The
Minsk Group continues to meet over Nagorno-Karabakh in particular. In
some ways it is the most potentially dangerous of these three

continue to support the OSCE, and it is an organisation in which a
certain amount of plain speaking can continue. I very much hope that
the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, also feels that the Parliamentary
Assembly is an organisation in which a good deal of plain speaking can
take place. In that organisation we involve parliamentarians from a
number of countries that have not had very much contact with European
perceptions of how democratic political systems should operate. That in
itself, although no doubt sometimes rather painful and occasionally
rather unproductive, is nevertheless a useful activity. As I was
explaining to a group of students some time ago, a great deal
of diplomacy does not lead to a definite result. Nevertheless, in many
ways the conversations are productive and much of what the OSCE does

number of questions about the attitude of the British Government
towards further enlargement, in particular with regard to Afghanistan.
I have to admit that I am not briefed on that and I shall have to write
to the noble Lord. It is an interesting question. After all, this is an
organisation that has the word “Europe” in its name; it
is the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The great
expansion was to bring in the countries of the south Caucuses and
central Asia when the Soviet Union broke up, which has been very
valuable. Mongolia has come in on top of that. As the new countries of
central Asia have developed—some of them rather more democratic
than others, or perhaps I should say some rather less democratic than
others—we have been able to engage at more levels than we would
otherwise have been able to. That is not an easy thing to do but we
have the standing to be able to do so. The OSCE continues to do that
and in many ways it is a worthwhile activity to have Kazakhstan as
chair; it did help to bring the Kazakh Government and a number of
officials and parliamentarians into a wider view of their place in the
world.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110765000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000114">The

international parliamentary assemblies are unavoidably talking shops

my memory of a bilateral meeting when a delegation from the British
Parliament went to Moscow 
<?notus-xml column=145?>and we had a stand-up row with the foreign affairs committee of the
Russian Parliament. I certainly felt that we were exchanging fairly
vigorous messages on both sides on that occasion. All of these
exchanges help, at the margin, to shift attitudes. The work that
members of the Parliamentary Assembly at the OSCE and the Council of
Europe do on election monitoring is extremely valuable and we support
its continuation.</hs_para>

hope that has answered many of the questions. Of course, Russia is the
most important partner that we have within the OSCE, but the central
Asian countries and the countries between Russia and the European Union
remain of considerable importance. At present, we are struggling with
the issue of whether Ukraine will sign an association agreement with
the European Union at Vilnius at the end of this month. The Russian
Government are extremely unhappy with the proposal that Ukraine,
Georgia and Moldova should sign an association agreement with the
European Union. That is very high on our current foreign policy agenda.
We are struggling with the enormous problem of how to relate to
Belarus, a country where an authoritarian regime has survived on
playing off Russia and its western neighbours and hoping to be
subsidised by both sides. We struggle to cope with the problems of the
south Caucasus and to contribute to development there. We have an
active interest in Azerbaijan, which, as we all know, is not one of the
world’s most open or democratic countries. Indeed, the IHR
concluded that the recent elections were not entirely fair, but we have
substantial economic interests in that country. We also have interests
in Georgia. I visited Georgia and Armenia just before the summer and
got a very good impression of the semi-democratic dimensions in both
countries. In Tbilisi I had lunch with opposition and government MPs
and they had an extremely vigorous argument in front of me, which I
thought was a good sign of how they are moving towards development. I
could cover the other central Asian countries but I think we all
understand the many difficulties
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000118">I end

orders may seem a dry and obscure subject—one little understood
by the public or indeed by Members. When I mentioned to a colleague
that I had this Question for Short Debate, I had to explain what
commencement orders were. However, they are extremely important, and
the fact that they are little understood is a major problem, bearing on
public confidence in the political system. Commencement orders are
essentially what stand between what Parliament has said can be the law
and what is the
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000121">Unless an
Act states otherwise, it takes effect upon Royal Assent. However, it is
common to provide for provisions to take effect on dates stipulated by
Ministers. Were provisions of Acts of Parliament brought into effect as
a matter of course relatively soon after Royal Assent, allowing time
for whatever administrative arrangements needed to be made, there would
not be a problem. However, that is not what happens. There is a
plethora of legislative provisions—agreed by Parliament and
embodied in Acts of Parliament—which have never been brought
into effect. These provisions are substantial, both qualitatively and
quantitatively. The Easter Act 1928 is frequently offered as an example
of an Act that was never brought into force. However, there are
modern-day equivalents. The statute book is littered with substantial
parts of Acts which have never been given
effect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000122">Some
noble Lords have tabled Questions to the Government to find out how
extensive this practice is of not bringing legislation into force. The
noble Lord, Lord Hylton, in June 2010, asked which sections of, or
schedules to, Acts passed since 1997 had not been commenced. On my
count, the list encompassed no fewer than 147 Acts of Parliament that
had sections or schedules that had never been commenced—147 Acts
since 1997. They include one Act that is unimplemented
in its entirety. The Acts were not minor pieces of
legislation, with just one section or schedule unimplemented, although
there were a number of those. They included 
<?notus-xml column=147?>major pieces of legislation with several sections or
schedules unimplemented. One Act, for example, had, on my
count, 45 sections and seven schedules unimplemented wholly or in
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000123">For
Parliament to pass legislation that is not then given effect is an
inefficient use of Parliament’s time—indeed, a waste of
time. We spend time discussing the merits of provisions that we expect
to become law but which then simply lay on the face of the Act without
being brought into effect. Perhaps more importantly, it confuses the
public. People think that when Parliament passes an Act the Act is then
law and takes effect. They do not realise that its provisions may not
take effect until an order is made to bring them into effect and that
Ministers may not actually make such
orders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000124">Some
provisions are not commenced until the necessary administrative work is
completed. I understand that. I know that there are now common
commencement dates and departments are expected to comply with those.
However, the Government may need to consider how they explain to those
affected by a measure the reasons for any delay in giving effect to
their
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000125">However,
my principal concern is with legislative provisions never given effect

has passed and how he would explain that to the

appreciate that the responsibility for the current situation rests as
much with Parliament as with government. The two Houses approve Bills
that give power to Ministers to make orders to bring particular
provisions into effect. We discuss the substantive provisions of Bills,
but rarely give much attention, if any at all, to the
supplementary provisions. We see the headings under the supplementary
provisions—commencement, transitional provision, extent and
Short Title—and tend to see them as standard provisions
requiring little consideration. By that stage, Members tend to think
that their work is
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:04:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000127">There
is a case for Parliament to be more vigilant in future in checking such
provisions and perhaps limiting their scope. Why allow Ministers an
open-ended power to bring provisions of an Act into effect? Why not be
more prescriptive or set a time period within which such orders may be
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:05:07"></hs_TimeCode>? My
comments are addressed as much to colleagues in the House as they are

is not the first time that I have addressed the issue. I chaired the
Commission to Strengthen Parliament, which was set up by William Hague

we wish to see one particular change to existing practice. The
commencement clauses normally give power for the Secretary of State to
bring provisions in on dates set by the minister. Parliament could, of
course, ensure that commencement clauses do not provide excessive
latitude. We think there is a case for a more systematic constraint. In
the Parliamentary Government Bill that he introduced in 1999, Lord
Cranborne included a clause to provide that any provision of an
enactment which is not commenced within five years of the passing of
the Act shall cease 
<?notus-xml column=148?>to have effect. We find the argument for such a
provision persuasive. We therefore recommend that there be a statutory
provision that any sections of an Act which are not brought into effect
within five years of Royal Assent shall cease to have

other words, provisions of Acts that have not been brought into effect

address the issue. In particular, it will be helpful if my noble friend

a remarkable coincidence, which occurred while I was sorting out books

to confess that I had forgotten the recommendation. Since this debate
may become a modest quarry for future students of the subject, I remark
that that recommendation appears on page 43 of our report. It is the
last major paragraph in a section headed, “Legislative
Scrutiny”, and on page 63 it is the final item in a list of
seven recommendations entitled “Legislative Scrutiny: Primary
Legislation”. Its provenance was in the text of a Bill
introduced also in 1999 by Viscount Cranborne, from whom we had taken
oral evidence. His Bill was entitled Parliamentary

rereading our report this week, I was agreeably surprised by its
universal good sense and also by how many of the issues that we raised
have been taken up since. Nor am I in any way receding from the
particular recommendation that we are debating. Its
text runs, as 
<?notus-xml column=149?>my noble friend has demonstrated, to less than
150 words, so there is no great substance to disembowel,
and it possesses a logic that invites agreement without
provoking disagreement. The five years that we allocated as the fallow
period during which the sections of an Act could survive untrammelled
following Royal Assent without commencement orders have the
additional virtue of being at a sufficient distance in time from Royal
Assent for everyone to have forgotten who the Minister was who had
fruitlessly introduced these now lapsed and neglected
propositions and invited parliamentarians to use parliamentary time to
dissect them. Moreover, those five years were a good test of any
continuing relevance or any circumstance that made the sections less
relevant after all. In a world where parliamentarians and commentators
regret the sheer amount of legislation passed, their removal from
availability as law may be a salutary prophylactic.</hs_para>

course, it is not as easy as that. There is a school of thought that
does not want to throw anything out of Mother Hubbard’s
cupboard, but parliamentarians have never hesitated to set limits for
local authorities to monitor the duration of planning permissions being
granted before the permission lapses, and these constraints are a
notable stimulus to timely action.

ever, I have been helped and my horizons extended by the excellent
briefing provided by our Library. In this instance I particularly
enjoyed the guidance for co-ordinators and policymakers and appreciated
the statistics on Acts passed, especially when reinforced by subjects.
The statistics show the volume of Acts passed in given calendar years
and the subject breakdown in sessional years, which makes comparison
less than totally accurate, but over a period of 30 years
that prevents false or distorted impressions. My own
computation was that over the period from 1983 to 2012 almost exactly
20% have been devoted to constitutional Acts and those embracing
criminal justice.</hs_para>

Louth has performed many signal services to our parliamentary democracy
in this country and his introducing this subject today with such
concise and crisp logic was but another example of the services that he
has rendered. Of course, my noble friend Lord Brooke of Sutton
Mandeville has also been a marvellous public servant who has 
<?notus-xml column=150?>done so much to enhance the reputation of
Parliament, which is more than can be said for many Ministers over the
time that he served.</hs_para>

taking part in this debate by my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth and
I was delighted to respond to that provocation. We devote an enormous
amount of time in the two Houses to debating legislation. Frequently,
the cry goes up from your Lordships’ House that ill digested,
ill considered legislation has been placed before us, whole chunks of
which have never been debated, or have been debated only very briefly,
in the House of Commons. That is bad enough.</hs_para>

complain about, as I did on many occasions in another place, is the
number of Henry VIII clauses, as they are called, which give almost
untrammelled powers to Ministers to do things within the general
purview and ambit of the Act. I deplore both those things. Of course,
when we are then brought up sharp by the noble Lord, Lord Norton, as we
were by the commission that he chaired all those years ago, and have it
pointed out to us that many of the Acts over which we slave and to
which we devote many parliamentary hours, either never come into force
at all or whole chunks of them never come into force, we face what is
no less than a parliamentary scandal. It is incumbent on us to address
this subject at last with some vigorous action.</hs_para>

clinching recommendation based on the Marquess of Salisbury’s
Private Member’s Bill, but I would go further than that and make
one or two suggestions to your Lordships this afternoon. No Bill or Act
should be introduced or passed by Parliament unless it is the specific
and stated intention of the Government of the day to bring it into
force within the lifetime of the Parliament in which it is passed. If
any law passed by Parliament has not been brought into force by the end
of that Parliament, it should disappear from the statute books. That is
a sharpening- up of what I would call the Salisbury/Norton
recommendation and something that the Government should take
exceptionally
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110765000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000141">I
am also a great believer in the efficacy of Joint Committees of both
Houses and I think that there should be a Joint Committee of both
Houses on commencement orders. We talk often about the necessity for
pre-legislative scrutiny; we talk about the desirability of
post-legislative scrutiny; but we have not, as far as I remember,
talked in any detail on the Floor of either Chamber in the 43 years
that I have been here about commencement orders. If we had a Joint
Committee of both Houses, which had as its remit the constant
examination of this subject, surely it could only sharpen the minds of
Ministers and make them consider: is this law truly
necessary?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110765000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110765000142">We
pass far too many laws in this country. The extent to which the statute
books have been increased during the time I have been a Member of one
House or another is, frankly, horrifying. We should be concentrating
our minds on trying to improve the quality of legislation, and the
first question before introducing any Bill in either House should be:
is this necessary and will it improve things? If the answer to
both those questions is in the affirmative, it is
indeed incumbent on those who have the ultimate control to ensure that
the law in question comes into force.</hs_para>

apply it to the present moment—whether it is a Government of my

given by my noble friend Lord Norton of 147 Bills since 1977 not being
enacted in full and one not implemented at all, and I wondered
if there were some very good reasons for this. The first that occurred
to me was that Bills that are not fully enacted or commenced
straightaway might well suffer from a change of government, with the
new Government not wanting a particular section to become law. The
other thing that occurs to me is that it may well be a parliamentary
accident that a Private Member’s Bill is not enacted at all or
is enacted only in part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000003">Some 20
years ago, as Under-Secretary of State in the Department of the
Environment, I had responsibility for defending at Question Time the
fact that a particular section of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 had
not been brought into effect. I have not looked up what I said on that
occasion nor to what extent I was criticised by Members of your
Lordships’ House, but subsequent to that I became involved in
the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, on which I served for
nine years. That also prompted me to look at this particular subject
and at statutory instruments in general, not least the terms in which
they were couched.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110772000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000004">I had always
understood that the right body to look at Acts of Parliament and the
current state of the statute book was the Law Society, which does such
an amazing job at doing just that. The trouble with
my noble friend Lord Norton’s proposal is that it would
have to be done within departments. Civil servants are naturally
cautious about changing what 
<?notus-xml column=152?>they or their colleagues have drafted with such
immaculate care so I do not think that this is a job for civil
servants, even in the Cabinet Office. I would leave it to the Law

Royall of Blaisdon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, for this interesting short debate

commission was set up by the Conservative Party but this is very much a
non-political point and I would probably sign up to everything in the
report—I do not know but I will certainly take a closer look
now. As has been noted, Governments of all persuasions are equally
culpable. It is an issue that I have thought about in the past in
relation to our citizens’ trust and the relationship that we
have with them because in Parliament we quite rightly spend a lot of
time debating legislation and sometimes we incite the interest and
concern of the public. The public know about these things going through
Parliament and, understandably, they automatically assume that the Acts
will be implemented but, as has been pointed out, far too many of them
are not. Were the public to know this, they would be deeply concerned.

been said about the time that we as parliamentarians take in
scrutinising legislation and, as was pointed out by the noble Lord,
Lord Brooke, there is a contrast between what we are doing here
today—having a very leisurely, enjoyable debate—and what
is happening in the Chamber, and we really have to do something about
that. Interestingly, someone told me that they overheard a colleague in
the other place talking about a part of a piece of
legislation that had not been implemented. It was said that
this particular section of the legislation was introduced via an
amendment in your Lordships’ House and the person down the other
end of the Corridor was heard to say, “Well, it doesn’t
really matter because they won’t implement it
anyway<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:26:18"></hs_TimeCode>”.

Cormack, suggested that there should be a Joint Committee of both
Houses to look at the issue, which is potentially interesting, but I
happen to think that there are two ways forward: first, if every piece
of legislation, especially every constitutional piece of legislation,
was subject to proper pre-legislative scrutiny, that should obviate the
need for that sort of committee; secondly, noble Lords may recall that
the Leader’s Committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad,
who is not in his place today, recommended that there should be a
committee on standards in legislation. If that sort of committee were
to come into force, it could deal with some of these
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:27:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I said, I probably would sign up to many of the recommendations
of the report that has been mentioned and I think I would personally
favour the 
<?notus-xml column=153?>recommendation made by the noble
Viscount, Lord Cranborne. I would be interested to hear what the
Minister has to say about that today. But I would like to take this
slightly further. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, mentioned
statutory instruments and spoke of his experience on what used to be
called the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. Of course, I well
understand that not every statutory instrument deals with enactment or
commencement orders but, having looked at the tables that were
helpfully produced by the Library, they clearly demonstrate not only
that there are far too many SIs but that they have become much more
complex over the years. For example, in 1975 there were
1,340 SIs, which amounted to only 8,379 pages,
whereas in 2009 there were slightly more SIs—1,420—but
there were 11,414 pages. They have become a lot more complex and
Governments of all persuasions these days are relying far too much on
statutory instruments as a consequence of framework
legislation.</hs_para>

go back to the need that is clearly demonstrated so often for
pre-legislative scrutiny and well drafted legislation that knows what
it is doing and why it is there. There is much to be done in improving
our system of government and the laws that come before us. We also have
a duty as parliamentarians to ensure that the structures and systems
that we follow are more effective in ensuring that we really can
deliver what citizens think we are delivering and, therefore, regain
their trust.</hs_para>

the work he undertook for the commission for the Conservative Party. If

prospect to reply when your Lordships have the experience that you all

Government undoubtedly have responsibility for the maintenance of the
statute book. I agree with noble Lords that it is not in principle
desirable for there to be parts of enacted legislation on the statute
book which remain uncommenced for long periods. In briefing myself on
the debate, I became aware of the Easter Act—I must say that I
was not before—which is of very long standing. I agree with the
noble Baroness that that would undoubtedly cause confusion, indeed,
probably bewilderment, among the public if they were to hear about
that.</hs_para>

from study, I am conscious of the amount of legislation. I should say
that in a different life, I have been a strong supporter of less
legislation rather than more, and of higher quality
legislation. My noble 
<?notus-xml column=154?>friend Lord Cormack was rightly strong on that
point. Given the amount of legislation we have, actually a very small
proportion of it is not brought into force within, at most, two to
three years of it being passed, although I in no way downgrade the
point made by my noble friend Lord
Norton.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000015">It has
been a long-standing practice of all Governments to treat commencement
of legislation on a case-by-case basis. Noble Lords will have seen a
wide range of provisions relating to the commencement of legislation in
their scrutiny of Bills. That reflects the fact that it is usually
necessary to provide a certain amount of notice to those affected by
the legislation before it takes effect and that the notice period
required will depend on the nature and complexity of the Act concerned.
I understand my noble friend Lord Cormack’s proposal about the
end of a Parliament. The problem would be that in the last part of the
Parliament, it would be particularly difficult to transact any sort of
legislative

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> That might bear out some of my earlier

where legislation is relatively limited in effect or otherwise
straightforward, it is possible for that notice period to be stated in
the Act. A two-month period is often regarded as the minimum, but
sometimes it may be appropriate for Acts to take effect immediately.
Commencement orders are used to provide the Government with a degree of
flexibility in the timing of implementation; I think that my noble
friend Lord Norton agreed with that. That may be necessary to allow
time for the establishment of new organisations, for industry to adjust
to any new regulatory requirements or for consultation on the detail of
implementation, which is often undertaken via secondary
legislation—I am conscious of what my noble friend Lord
Skelmersdale said about statutory instruments. Sometimes, a
commencement order may be required to commence different parts of an
Act on different days or for the Act to apply first in specific areas
or to specific people or situations. It is also sensible for Ministers
to retain the ability to ensure that everyone is fully prepared for
implementation before legislation is brought into
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000019">It
would perhaps be unduly restrictive or possibly counterproductive for
Ministers to be held to an arbitrary time period fixed in the original
legislation. This would not allow Ministers to take into account any
changes in circumstance which might quite reasonably delay
implementation. Conversely, it would not be wise to risk legislation
being lost on account of a failure to agree the details of
implementation by a specified time period. This is the potential
consequence of certain sorts of sunset provision.</hs_para>

in the vast majority of cases one should expect legislation to be fully
brought into force within a year or two of Royal Assent. However,
there may be exceptional circumstances in which it
may not be possible to make progress within that timescale, but it is
none the less desirable to keep open the
possibility of implementation at a future date. However, that is not to
say that sunset clauses should 
<?notus-xml column=155?>never be used; on the contrary, they may well be
justified, but perhaps act to provide a degree of certainty to
businesses that new regulations will not be introduced once a period of
time has expired, or as a legislative backstop to be used if
required.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110772000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000021">I
was particularly struck by the Electronic Communications Act 2000,
which contained a statutory regulatory scheme that would be brought in
if self-regulation by industry failed. The statutory scheme was subject
to a five-year sunset clause if it was not needed. In the event,
self-regulation worked and the provisions were accordingly repealed. I
think that is a good example of what all of your Lordships are seeking.
My point is that the desirability or otherwise of a sunset clause of
this nature should be considered on its merits and on a case-by-case
basis. In seeking to answer directly the question posed by my noble
friend, I hope I will not shock your Lordships by saying that the
Government do not have precise plans to reform the use of commencement
orders. But if my noble friend is making the case that very careful
consideration should be given to the use of commencement orders and to
sunset clauses, I entirely agree and that is what the Government seek
to do. I think it is, in good faith, what all Governments should seek
and have sought to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:37:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:37:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the additional ways in which the concerns expressed by your Lordships
could be addressed. First, the Government believe that post-legislative
scrutiny, which my noble friend Lord Cormack referred to, has a very
important part to play in ensuring that the statute book is kept under
review and up to date. For the benefit of Parliament and others, the
Government publish a post-legislative assessment of every Act between
three and five years after enactment. These assessments include an
explanation for any provisions that have not been commenced. Indeed,
your Lordships are already contributing to this scrutiny process. In
the previous Session, the Select Committee on Adoption Legislation

are currently two committees of your Lordships’ House
undertaking post-legislative scrutiny in respect of the Mental Capacity
Act 2005 and the Inquiries Act 2005. Departmental Select Committees in
the other place carry out similar inquiries from time to time,

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> The work of the Law Commission is
extremely valuable. It undertakes periodic reviews of particular areas
of legislation and does the detailed preparatory work on what we know
as Statute Law (Repeals) Bills. These are valuable, if somewhat unsung,
exercises which help to tidy up the statute book,
by repealing unnecessary and uncommenced legislation. Noble Lords may
recall one such Act, the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 2013, which received
Royal Assent recently.</hs_para>

hope, but I am not sure, that all noble Lords are aware of the good law
project that is currently being led by the Cabinet Office, in
particular by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It is designed
to improve the quality of legislation by identifying ways to further
improve its drafting and reduce complexity. I entirely agree with the
noble Baroness: I have looked at some legislation and found it
extremely difficult to understand. To reduce that complexity and make
the law more accessible must be a good principle to hold. Among other
things, the project is also considering how the law in both printed and
digital form can be made more easily understood; for example, it may be
possible to examine how information about whether provisions are in
force is presented to online users of legislation. Although I am very
conscious that many do not use online facilities, I think it is
increasingly the case that many do. We should try to facilitate
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000027">I should
have said at the outset that all suggestions from your Lordships are
welcome in this project. This is a project of good will and it is in
good faith that many of the points that your Lordships made today are
understood. We need to find a resolution to how we can best ensure the
quality to which my noble friend Lord Cormack referred. The quality of
the statute book is important to us all, because we are its creators.

been an illuminating debate and briefing, and seeking to answer it has
certainly been illuminating for me. I believe that your Lordships and
my noble friend are right to hold the Government to account to maintain
the statute book properly and uphold good legislative practice. I have
mentioned post-legislative scrutiny, and I believe that pre-legislative
scrutiny is a desirable thing as well. I expect that it is the case
that all Governments have had moments—I freely admit
it—when pre-legislative scrutiny would have been extremely
desirable. I suspect that it is a note of caution to all Governments

SPLM-N has agreed to allow access to international aid organisations,

Khartoum itself, the Government have been ruthlessly suppressing
legitimate protest and freedom of speech. Journalists have been
arrested and reputable NGOs have been expelled. Therefore, brutality
has gone largely unreported. More than 200 protesters were killed by

briefly to the problems of Abyei, earlier this year the Ngok Dinka
paramount chief was murdered by Khartoum's forces while travelling with
UN officials—again with impunity. Having given up on the
referendum promised by the African Union, the Ngok Dinka 
<?notus-xml column=158?>conducted their own referendum in spite of intimidation and boycott by
the Khartoum Government, which attempted to bomb bridges to prevent
people from returning home to vote. Despite these attempts to sabotage

republic of South Sudan, just two years after achieving independence,
faces many inevitable problems. As president Salva Kiir said at the
time of the birth of a new nation, his people were not rebuilding:
there had been nothing left to rebuild. Many problems need to be
addressed urgently, including provision of essential services such as
immunisation—a critical issue reflected in the return of polio,
which had been virtually
eradicated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000040">Of
course, there have been serious and well reported problems including
corruption and inefficiency. The radical changes in government were
undertaken to address some of these issues. However, the situation is
clearly not helped by the aggressive and subversive policies of the
Government in Khartoum, including exacerbation of intertribal
conflicts, especially in Jonglei region. There is evidence that
Iran-made, Sudan-origin weapons and ammunition have been made available
to David Yau Yau's and other insurgent

there are very disturbing reports of a massive Sudanese military
build-up with sophisticated equipment, including strike aircraft,
helicopter gunships, tanks and heavy artillery, in the southern parts

suffering inflicted on the innocent civilians in these lands has been
allowed to continue for far too long. Again and again, I and many
others have urged Her Majesty’s Government to initiate action to
end the impunity with which al-Bashir and his Government continue to
kill their own people. Again and again, we receive the same answer:
“We must continue to talk to Khartoum”. But Khartoum
continues to kill while it talks, and has been doing so for more than
20 years. Alternatively, we are told that it is for the UN to act, in
the knowledge that it will be highly improbable to attain consensus to
do anything effective. This is not good enough. The UK has a special

implementation of the comprehensive peace

I ask the Minister—again—if Her Majesty’s
Government will consider the imposition of targeted sanctions on the
Government of Sudan, such as denial of visas, which would at least end
the culture of impunity. People in Sudan and South Sudan frequently say
to me: “The British Government intervened in Libya, where the
suffering was nowhere on the same scale as here. Why do they not
intervene to help us? Is 
<?notus-xml column=159?>it because we are black and African?”. They fear we are being

hope that the Minister is not going to imply moral equivalence between
the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan. We all recognise the widely
reported fallibilities of the leaders of South Sudan. But the
Government of South Sudan do not attack and kill their own people,

against their own people in Darfur and the southern
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000046">I
conclude with two requests, reflecting the passionate wishes of the
citizens of Sudan and South Sudan. First, local people are pleading for
the African Union or UN to send fact-finding missions to investigate
and report on the situation in the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, and to
Khartoum to investigate human rights abuses there.</hs_para>

Majesty’s Government engage constructively with democratic
opposition parties in Sudan? During the Cold War, western nations
helped opposition groups behind the Iron Curtain, both to resist
totalitarian oppression and to prepare for the day when freedom and
democracy would come. There are respected opposition parties in Sudan
that are working to promote human rights and develop the essentials of
civil society. Will Her Majesty’s Government consider some
support for democratic initiatives; for example, those promoted by the
opposition movement led by Yasir Arman and Malik Agar, who have
demonstrated genuine democratic political leadership? Malik Agar was
the democratically elected Governor of Blue Nile State before he was
ruthlessly deposed by al-Bashir. Any analysis of the writings and
policies of these opposition leaders demonstrates their genuine
commitment to democratic
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000048">I hope
that the peoples of Sudan and South Sudan who will read this debate
will be reassured that, at last, Her Majesty’s Government will
take a lead in calling the Government of Sudan to account and in
promoting initiatives to bring justice and genuine peace to all the
citizens of these two nations, who currently see the United Kingdom
apparently condoning oppression instead of fulfilling our historic and

all that, the international community has chosen to focus on the
low-level conflict that rumbles on between Sudan and South Sudan. That
has always been the intention of the Sudanese Government. They know
that the world lacks the knowledge and the vigilance needed to see what
Bashir is up to in Sudan. There is now no UN special representative
after the departure of Robin Gwynn, and the capacity of the
FCO’s Sudan unit has been diminished by the exit of staff who
have not been replaced. Also, as the excellent Rosalind Marsden departs
from her EU role, her replacement, Alexander Rondos, is expected to
take on responsibility for the whole of the Horn of Africa. The message
that all that conveys to those in power in Khartoum is that the world
community is unable or unwilling to focus on Sudan while Syria and
Somalia preoccupy security interest. The need for concerted
international action to deal with the crisis continues, but
international engagement
shrinks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000052">For
years, there have been calls for Khartoum to give unhindered
humanitarian access to the starving and displaced people sheltering
from the Sudanese bombing raids in Blue Nile and South Kordofan.
Khartoum knows that it can carry on killing its own citizens with
impunity because there is absolutely no response other than media
statements and ministerial condemnation. For years, we have expressed
concern about Khartoum’s brutal repression of free speech, the
disappearance and torture of intellectuals and the sexual abuse of
thousands of young women guilty of no greater sin than wanting to go to

trade missions and British links when we should be warning British
companies that Sudan is rated among the worst in the world for
corruption, high inflation, opaque banking and dubious overseas payment

my noble friend seen the <I>Rapid Food Security and Nutrition</I>
assessment published by the Enough project on South Kordofan? It
concludes that the bombardment of civilians, together with the bar on
international humanitarian aid has resulted in severe malnutrition and
dire food security outlooks. The authors say that the condition of
refugees from Blue Nile state indicates that the conditions there may
be comparable with those in South Kordofan. These are further war
crimes and the Minister may want to say something about the possibility
of further indictments at the
ICC.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000059">Another
group of victims in a desperate state are the 40,000 South Sudanese who
were left behind in Khartoum at the time of independence three years
ago. Their camp was flooded and latrines are overflowing, spreading
disease to these homeless and stateless people, weakened by
malnutrition. The UN Central Emergency Response Fund has allocated $5.5
million for emergency shelter, healthcare, education and public health
initiatives for the victims of flooding, including the South Sudanese,
but for the latter it is a short-term solution only. The International
Organisation for Migration has a plan to airlift 20,000 of the most
vulnerable to South Sudan at a cost of $20 million. Can this plan be
expanded so that the IOM repatriated all the people to their homeland
with the help of donors such as the UN Central Emergency Response
Fund?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000060">Meanwhile,
UNHCR is already having to cope with 220,000 refugees in South Sudan
and another 40,000 in Ethiopia. Can my noble friend say what the budget
for these operations in 2013 is and whether it is being met? These
people were mostly bombed out of their homes in South Kordofan and Blue
Nile and their plight is the direct result of Bashir’s military
campaigns against civilians. Now the ground attack is being reinforced
by the acquisition of Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft and Mi-24 ground attack
helicopters. My noble friend says that these breaches of the UN
sanctions will be dealt with by the panel of experts’ report in
January 2014, but surely where there is credible evidence, 
<?notus-xml column=162?>such as we have from Radio Dubanga—a
reliable witness in the past—and from the Satellite
Sentinel project already mentioned, the Security Council should take
prompt action to call Khartoum to account over its breaches of its
international
obligations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000061">At
the same time, the African Commission on Human and People’s
Rights should investigate the wave of extrajudicial killings and
arbitrary detentions as proposed by 11 international and African
organisations last week. At least 170 people have been killed and more
than 800 detained following widespread protests against the ending of
fuel subsidies. Newspapers and broadcasters have been shut down,
editors have been told what they are to say about the protests and the
head of the Sudanese Doctors’ Union was detained when he spoke
on BBC Arabic about the number of casualties admitted to his hospital.
The UN rapporteur on extrajudicial executions and the working party on
arbitrary detention should collect evidence and report on those events,
preferably after visiting Sudan, but in the absence of an invitation,
based on witness statements collected in response to a public appeal. I
know that that is not the normal method of working by UN special
procedures, but their hesitant approach accounts for their lack of
effectiveness in stopping these human rights
abuses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000062">How
can the international community secure an improvement in
Khartoum’s behaviour? The IMF persuaded the regime to cancel
fuel subsidies in an attempt to control its rocketing external debt,
scheduled to reach $46 billion this year. But the US special envoy to
South Sudan and Sudan, Donald Booth, said last month that Khartoum is
spending the same on military operations in Darfur, South Kordofan and
Blue Nile as it did on the fuel subsidies. If the IMF made the ending
of these conflicts and of purchases of sophisticated foreign military
equipment a condition of debt relief, there would be a double benefit
to the Sudanese economy and to the hundreds of thousands of victims of
Khartoum’s
aggression.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13110772000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000142">4.19

Alton of Liverpool (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
Lady Cox for once again focusing our attention on the suffering peoples
of Sudan. I begin by expressing sadness and some shock that, despite
all the debates and all the attempts to create a climate for peaceful
development, the suffering in that war-torn country continues unabated.
My first visit to South Sudan was during the civil war, which claimed
2 million lives, and, in 2004, I went to Darfur and saw
first hand a conflict which had claimed between 200,000 and 300,000
lives. While the world looked on, 90% of Darfur’s villages were
razed to the ground. At the time, I published a report entitled, <I>If
This Isn’t Genocide, What Is?</I> Throughout 2011 and 2012, I
tabled questions and spoke in your Lordships’ House about the
new genocide unravelling, as we have heard, in South Kordofan and Blue
Nile, which was described by Dr Mukesh Kapila, a former high-ranking
British and United Nations official, as,</hs_para>

violence on their own people are undoubtedly mass murderers and
fugitives from 
<?notus-xml column=163?>justice, having been indicted by the International Criminal Court for

2.3 million people are already displaced, a further 350,000 people have
been displaced since January and 1.3 million people are now in

there is a climate of fear and terrorisation and a rapid downward trend
in security; and that the situation is getting worse. We heard that
there may be another 50,000 people displaced in Adela but no one,
including a UNAMID force of more than 20,000 personnel, has access, so
no one really knows. For INGOs, the situation is fraught with danger

staff are fully informed of the situation, and that we are finally
getting to grips with the fact that, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Kinnock, said, the Doha document for peace in Darfur is on its last
legs. I hope that the Minister will tell us when we last raised the
Darfur and the situation in South Kordofan in the Security Council. The
Security Council resolutions banning military flights over Darfur are,

prepared for today’s debate, it was with a genuine sense of
sadness. It is more than 10 years ago that, on the eve of a
breakthrough in negotiations between the Government of Sudan and SPLA
rebels, I welcomed the new atmosphere of hope, but also warned that a
ceasefire would be no guarantee of democracy or justice for all. More
than 10 years later, it is clear that the CPA that followed has failed
to bring change, democracy, or justice to the Sudanese peoples of Sudan

<?notus-xml column=164?>or South Sudan. That remains today a distant dream
in many of those places. I also feel shock because, despite the ongoing
and mounting tragedy of a further decade of war, the attention of the
world appears to have turned away from the
region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000069">It is

of central and northern Sudan, who flocked to the streets in September

Sudan’s security services. More than 200 protesters were shot
dead. The awfulness speaks for itself. Consider also the situation in
Jonglei, where it is thought that militias loyal to the Government in

than 10 years ago, I said to the House that Sudan’s modern
history is littered with temporary peace agreements which were
eventually broken. The CPA has been broken for the people of South
Kordofan and Blue Nile, and it has been broken for the people of Abyei.
The various Darfur peace processes were flawed and have not been

get behind calls for fundamental change in Sudan? What are Her

I wonder if the Minister has seen the report launched by the noble

rather different point is a question about the implications of further
destabilisation of Sudan for the country’s international
neighbours. I think that that is an important point. I visit Nigeria
regularly, and I am due to fly out to Abuja on Sunday. Four years ago,
I was able to go to the province of Maiduguri up in the north-east. I
cannot go there now, at the moment anyway, because of the political
situation. Maiduguri is a long, long way from
Sudan—many miles away. Nevertheless, I believe that
there is a
connection.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110773000003">When
I was there four years ago I visited some of the townships on Lake Chad
itself, and was asked by a small Christian community to go on the lake
in a little fishing boat with an outboard motor. I heard of the
troubles and the difficulties there—not least the difficult
political jurisdictions around Lake Chad, on which I will not
elaborate—and of the problem of a receding 
<?notus-xml column=165?>lake and what that will do to those communities.
When I got back I was told that the relationship between the small
minority Christian communities in one of those townships and the
majority Muslim population was very good until people came from Sudan
through Chad, over Lake Chad. Then the trouble
started.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110773000004">There
is a real question about the escalation of ethnic and religious
violence, and its spread from east Africa to west Africa. That is
anecdotal, but my intuition is that it is probably right, although at
the moment in relatively small scale. The noble Baroness, Lady Cox,
could say more about that, as she is very aware of the situation in
Nigeria. I therefore ask the Minister perhaps to touch on the risk of a
more general destabilisation of east and west Africa spreading from

deteriorate.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13110773000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110773000032">4.28

of us around the world thought that the conflict in Sudan would be
resolved once the partition of Sudan took place and South Sudan became
an independent country. Unfortunately, even after two years of South
Sudan’s independence, the conflict does not seem to be coming to
an end. There are many reasons for that. I am glad that the African
Union is taking more interest in helping to resolve the outstanding
issues between Khartoum and Juba, and the presidents of both countries
have met and are talking to each other, which is a good sign. Sitting
around and resolving issues by negotiation rather than by taking up

to concentrate on something that is not helping the population and that
is the role of the new country’s armed forces, which have not
yet adapted to their new role and are still acting very much like a
militant organisation. According to the latest report of Human Rights
Watch, dated September 2013, since December 2012 the Sudan
People’s Liberation Army—the SPLA, South Sudan’s
army—locked in conflict with the ethnic Murle rebels from the
South Sudan Democratic Movement, has committed serious violations of
international humanitarian and human rights law. SPLA soldiers have
unlawfully killed at least 96 people, mostly civilians, from the Murle
ethnic group during the conflict, and they have engaged in the
widespread looting of homes, clinics, schools and churches. The abuses
by SPLA soldiers have had a devastating and potentially long-lasting
impact on this marginalised minority ethnic group from Pibor county and
have caused widespread fear and displacement, contributing to a
strongly held perception of persecution among the Murle civilian
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110773000008">The
abuses have taken place against a background of ethnic conflict. Dinka
Bor, Lou Nuer and Murle ethnic groups, all in Jonglei State, have been
locked in 
<?notus-xml column=166?>a cycle of cattle-raiding attacks and increasingly
brutal revenge attacks for several years. The rebellion and the SPLA
counter-offensive have further aggravated pre-existing ethnic tensions
in the area, which, in the case of anti-Murle sentiments, may have
played into the extent of the abuses and slow government response. The
potential for further grave violations and violence is very high, in
part because the SPLA, an army still in transition, faces significant
command, control and discipline challenges and also because ethnic
tensions are so high in Jonglei, especially anti-Murle

Triesman (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in congratulating the noble
Baroness, Lady Cox, not least on her tenacity, and other noble Lords
who have taken part in this debate, I hope that they will forgive me if
I wince and say, “Yet another debate on Sudan”. Those of
us who have been there often will feel it the most acutely. The noble
Lord, Lord Alton, used the word “anger”, to 
<?notus-xml column=167?>which I subscribe. There have been more years of
conflict and more than 1 million additional people have been affected
in the past two years. There are 190,000 more Sudanese refugees in
South Sudan. There is further conflict and differences between
different groups on political objectives, including between the herders
and other farmers. There is, I suppose, conflict between settled
communities and those who see very little relevance in being settled
because they move with their herds and because borders are not
particularly relevant to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000086">Two
months ago, mass demonstrations about the cost of living and the
economy of the country were met by a brutal regime with live ammunition
and tear gas, and with mass imprisonment. Negotiations on the safe
demilitarised border zone have gone into reverse. Nothing is safe.
Nothing is demilitarised. No border zone has been agreed. An African
Union peace initiative, through the African Union Peace and Security
Council, was twice rescheduled amid sharp African Union criticism once
again of the Government of Sudan, and was not responded to by that
Government. There was a rather better report on the Government of South
Sudan, but none of it yet is making a
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:37:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000087">It
has to be said that South Sudan is both a source of and a destination
country for men, women and children who have been subjected in some
cases to forced labour and sex trafficking, including women and girls
from Uganda, Kenya and the DRC. Inter-ethnic abductions continue but at
least the South Sudanese Government have recognised the issues and are
trying to intervene. The economies of South Sudan and Sudan, with their
high level of interdependency, are continuously disrupted by border
disputes and oil transmission fees. I understand that oil reserves are
set to halve within 10 years if no new fields come on stream.
Exploration of new fields is of course almost impossible amid the
military clashes.</hs_para>

Nations operation, with at least 4,000 troops in Abyei and 7,500 in
South Sudan, has had far too little impact. As the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Guildford said, instability is spreading right
through the region—through the DRC, and to a lesser extent in
Uganda, and the Central African Republic. Uganda’s help for
South Sudan historically has been the basis for the Sudanese
Government’s sponsorship of murderous groups, including the
monstrous Lord’s Resistance Army and now other groups which have
taken its
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:39:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000089">I
suppose that, with a feeling of some desperation, we are tempted to ask
what is new. There is little point in demanding a great deal more
intervention from the UK Government, much as I would wish to. I think
that the Government lack the means or the local alliances to do much,
and I fear that they lack the will. Of course there will be protests
and those protests are important. There will be realism about
humanitarian aid. I urge the Government to find alternative routes for
aid rather than those through Khartoum. That will not do any longer. Is
there more that could be done? Are we destined to return to this debate
again and again, to these issues with no real answers? I am one of 
<?notus-xml column=168?>life’s optimists but this would be a dismal prospect for all of
us and I ask if there is new ground we could break. Let me make a
modest
attempt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:40:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

African issues will be resolved ultimately in Africa for the most part,
and by Africans. That must make us focus on the African Union and its
machinery and on the sub-continental regional bodies. The issue of
capacity in those bodies is critical. It has been for years. The
problem is not just money or a lack of outstanding individuals, because
there are some outstanding individuals, and it is not just the presence
of a mass murderer at the head of the Government of Sudan. Would the
Government consider, as a European initiative, a joint EU-AU review of
the financial and skills needs of the African Union, carried out
routinely at intervals of not more than three years, with a report on
the outcome of those discussions and an annual report on the
milestones? Then we at least could see some machinery and assess
whether it works.</hs_para>

would<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:45:13"></hs_TimeCode> the
Government, through the Security Council, advance the case for a
standing arrangement—I am not saying a standing
force—that can call into existence a peacekeeping force much
more rapidly, rather than with the delays during which many
more people die? Will the Government through our multinational
treaties, alliances and membership organisations, seek the full
commitment of everyone in those bodies to act on the arrest warrants in
all the jurisdictions that they cover? Al-Bashir is a wanted mass
murderer. Will Her Majesty’s Government introduce targeted
sanctions? The response in the Chamber to a question just a few days
ago was that we had talked to the Nigerians about this without any
indication of what happened next—that truly will not do now. It
will not

will the Government, through its aid programme in the multi-national
infrastructure initiatives, look for economic developments which would
make a much greater difference? There has been a wider discovery of oil
far from ports and from infrastructure. Most of it would be
transformational but the countries involved need to co-operate in order
to make any difference. Will we assist them to make a difference and
give some economic
hope<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:42:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:45:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

have heard the aspiration to join the Commonwealth expressed in Juba. I
do not know whether that is a workable concept—it may not be
yet—but it would certainly provide skilled resources in
training, including in health and in the treatment of polio. It would
provide links to trade and expertise in all Commonwealth countries. It
would provide local trade links, for example in Uganda, Kenya and the
region, which might be fundamentally helpful in the development of
South Sudan. It would provide a secretariat able to assess the capacity
needs and the choreography for the provision of greater capacity; and
it would tell the enemies of democracy that they face a worldwide
community of democratic nations who will not let this

right reverend Prelate pointed out that what we see happening across
the border between Sudan and South Sudan is also happening across Sudan
and South Sudan’s borders with their neighbouring states. This
is part of a set of regional conflicts which now sadly flow across the
Sahel and central and east Africa. The Lord’s Resistance Army
has just made another cross-border attack. As we know, it operates from
Uganda, through South Sudan into eastern Congo. Recent events in the
Central African Republic, where the Government have been overthrown,
have reportedly been supported by groups from Darfur; groups in Darfur
have very often obtained their weapons from Libya, Chad or the Central
African Republic. Some of these groups move very easily across
frontiers. We recognise that part of this is tribal, part of this is
ethnic, part of this is racial, and part of this now, sadly, is also
the militant Islamic ideology which attracts youths from across those
countries. It brings in foreign fighters and foreign ideas of the sort
that the right reverend Prelate commented on, breaking up what had been
relatively peaceful relations between different communities and
different faiths and raising severe problems for all of us, across
Africa. I am happy that we will be debating the dreadful situation in
eastern Congo in the not too distant
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:45:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000096">Within
Sudan, neither the Government in Khartoum nor the Government in Juba
control their entire territory. The Government in Khartoum have the
advantage of armed forces and external arms supplies and, as we all
know, are misusing them in South Kordofan and Blue Nile. There are
linked conflicts across the border, with each Government claiming that
the other continues to support the rebels within what they regard as
their territories; and the border, as established under the
comprehensive peace agreement, is not yet accepted by either side. We
must recognise that the SPLM in the north refuses to recognise the
borders as
established.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000097">We
have heard a lot about events surrounding the demonstrations in
Sudan, which Ministers have condemned both publicly and privately. We
certainly want a more democratic space to open up in Sudan. We deeply
regret that the Government of Sudan continue to get arms supplies from
outside. We are not entirely sure which countries they are coming from,
but they are clearly from the forces in what we used to call the
Eastern Bloc. We have a fairly good idea where some of them come from.
We meet regularly with opposition groups both within and outside the
country. That includes meeting the leadership of the SPLM-North,
although we do not support its stated aim of overthrowing the regime by
force. We also recognise that the Sudan Revolutionary Front is itself a
loose coalition of different bodies and not entirely cohesive in its
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110772000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0001.htm#13110772000098">I
must say to the noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock, that we do not channel
aid through the Government. We are co-operating with technical
preparations for debt relief, but we have made it abundantly clear that
debt relief will not be possible until the conflicts are resolved and
that the benefits must flow to promoting development in
Sudan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:47:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Darfur, we continue to look with horror at what is happening, while
increasingly understanding that some of the militias are not entirely

the Doha document has not in any sense been adopted and that the

noble Lord, Lord Alton, talked about the comparison with Libya. It is
much easier to enforce a no-fly zone, or even to intervene, in a
country where almost the entire population lives within 50 miles of the
coast than it is to enforce a no-fly zone a very long way from the
coast—across the borders between South Sudan and northern
Sudan—let alone over Darfur. We continue to work with others on

Restrictions on access to Darfur are part of the problem. We all
understand how appalling what is going on in South Kordofan and Blue
Nile is. Local organisations, with support from international partners,
are gathering evidence of abuses. We do not have access to those areas
to gather evidence first-hand. Noble Lords will know that the two
Presidents have met on a number of occasions. We hope that the recent
improvement in relations between Sudan and South Sudan will help to
resolve the conflict, but we all recognise that the conflict has a

South Sudan, there are also problems of internal conflict. The noble

these have aspects of ethnic conflict between tribes. I am tempted to
say that some of these are cattle raiding with AK-47s. Unfortunately,

the frustrations that led to it taking place and the extent to which
external forces and pressures imposed an extra layer on what were

the most actively engaged. We have to recognise that, as people like me

That is a highly desirable development and I will take that back. As I

Loomba (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this opportunity to
debate progress towards the millennium development goals concerning the
education of women and girls in developing countries. I know that my
noble friend Lady Northover was going to respond to this debate but is
unable to do so. I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Bates, in her place and
I hope he is as passionate about the plight of women and girls in
developing countries as she is, and I look forward to his
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000014">The
UN’s flagship millennium development goals campaign launched in
2000 gave many of us great hope. It gave us hope that by 2015 important
issues, such as education, promoting gender equality and health, will
have been significantly improved in developing countries. While I am
delighted that some progress has been made in these areas, I remain
concerned that 2015 is now on the horizon but not enough progress has
been made in order to hit these goals within this
timescale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000015">Education
should be the birthright of every child. Unfortunately, the statistics
tell us a very different story. More than 57 million children around
the world do not go to primary school. Even more shockingly, at least
250 million children cannot read or count, whether or not they go to
school. Despite some progress, the UN is falling short of its promise
to ensure
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13110773000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000030">“by

is the key to solving many of the health crises across the developing
world. It is also the key to minimising conflict. It is well known by
the UN, Governments and NGOs that investing in education for women and
girls is one of the most effective ways of reducing poverty. I am proud
that the UK Government have committed to spending 0.7% of income on aid
to help the world’s poorest people. They, like I, realise that
children are our future. This money from our country will go towards
educating 11 million of the 
<?notus-xml column=173?>world’s poorest and most disadvantaged children. Ring-fencing
this money was the right thing to do and I commend my right honourable
friend the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, for fighting for this to
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000017">The
Department for International Development’s priorities for
education focus on improving learning, reaching more children and
keeping girls in school. It is right to focus on keeping girls in
school as there are so many places around the world where they are
stopped from receiving the education they need. Stemming from this
important priority is the Girls’ Education Challenge, which was
set up by the department in 2011 to help up to a million of the
world’s poorest girls have an opportunity to improve their lives
through education. I was disappointed to see on the department’s
website that only £7.5 million out of the possible budget of
£61 million has been spent so far through this initiative. I ask
the Minister to look into this and see whether improvements can be
made.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110773000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000018">The now
infamous case of Malala Yousafzai, shot by the Taliban for campaigning
for girls to be educated in Pakistan is sadly one of many examples
throughout the world of women being held back from
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000019">The
reasons why girls are not on a par with their brothers in education
across developing countries are complex and diverse, but in many cases
interconnected. Research shows that boys are still favoured by parents
to receive education over girls in many countries. Early marriage,
early pregnancy, domestic responsibilities and a gender-insensitive
curriculum are just some of the reasons cited for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:05:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Those
issues must be addressed by the respective Governments in partnership
with the UN to make more progress on the MDG
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:05:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000020">What
practical steps can Governments take to get more girls into education
across the world? The culture of boys being favoured over girls to be
educated must stop, and attitudes need to change. There is a growing
body of evidence to demonstrate a strong relationship between the
presence of female teachers and the attendance and performance of girls
in schools, particularly in rural areas. Female teachers are often seen
as role models for the girls and their parents. Breaking down barriers
such as that one is essential to
success.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000021">Having
greater female participation and influence in public life in developing
countries is another key to growing the number of girls in education.
That will ensure that female-specific needs and interests are promoted
and defended. On a practical level, that could be as simple as ensuring
that schools have female toilets and drinking water, which will
encourage girls to go to
school<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:06:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000022">Government
support and leadership in developing countries is essential to deliver
more girls into education. I declare an interest: through my charity,
the Loomba Foundation, I have seen that first hand. We do a huge amount
of work in India educating the children of widows. There are 500
million children of widows across the world, according to UN figures,
and 51% of them are girls. Despite making good progress in many parts
of India, we had difficulties in the north-eastern states. That was
primarily due to the lack of regional 
<?notus-xml column=174?>government support and leadership. That lack of government support is in
my view one of the key contributing factors to why MDG framework
targets have not been met in many developing
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:08:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000023">I
leave your Lordships with this. It is vital that the UN sets ambitious
but achievable goals, targets and indicators within the post-2015 MDG
framework, especially about ensuring that more women and girls have the
opportunity to be educated. That will have a positive ripple effect on
other problems facing developing countries, such as general and
maternal health, gender equality and help to reduce child
mortality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000024">Education
is the best gift that anyone can give a child, and I welcome the
continuing support from our Government to developing countries in that
area. However, I ask our Government to do even more to get larger
numbers of girls into education and to put pressure on the UN and other
Governments to help to achieve
that.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13110773000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000034">5.09

Chalker of Wallasey (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my
noble friend Lord Loomba on raising this issue because now is certainly
the time to put pressure not only on our own departments but on all the
international organisations in which we work. While girls’
education is becoming accepted in some countries, I am afraid the vast
majority of girls in the developing world probably have the opportunity
of education only in the primary stage and not beyond. Should they
marry early or fall pregnant, that opportunity is frequently removed
from them by one means or
another.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000027">I
have been looking at what the United Nations Girls’ Education
Initiative has been doing across many countries and, while it is
laudable, it is very patchy. It does not extend and I have tried to
find examples. Most of my mine come from Africa but there are others. I
want to highlight a couple that are indicative of what can be done in
other places and are known to have worked. In Rwanda, the United
Nations Girls’ Education Initiative has functioned as a
multistakeholder partnership and if that were extended to other
countries, it would work very well. It is not just a question of
getting parents to send their girls to school; there is also the
problem of getting educationalists in national government departments
to realise the importance of girls going to school. So you have to work
from both ends of the problem—through the individual departments
of education and through the families.
You<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> also have to
work through the churches and the mosques. With the mosques we have a
problem, which I am not qualified to talk about, in the sense that so
many do not think girls’ education is valuable. But I firmly
believe that there is much more that can be done by setting an example
in government departments, in districts of countries and through the
various
institutions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110773000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000028">Certainly,
the revised education sector strategic plan that came into effect in
July this year in Rwanda was easier to enact there because it is a
small country. In a huge country like Ethiopia which is difficult to
get around and where communications are not yet of a nature where you
can rely on the internet, it is notable that since a gender budgeting
guideline was developed 
<?notus-xml column=175?>there some five years ago, there has been much
better debate on capacity building and gender mainstreaming. This is an
interesting area which I hope to follow up in December when I am there.
There are also new measures in Zambia, helped by the influence of
UNICEF, which has some very good ideas, such as its re-entry policy
guidelines for teenage mothers, the finalisation of the child
protection policy for schools and its gender review of HIV and AIDS
policy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110773000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110773000029">I
could quote many other examples, such as in Tanzania and other African
countries, but what I note above all else is the fact that there are so
many gaps between what is accepted in international forums and
what happens in Governments and, based on an understanding of the
problems, we have to bring pressure to bear on those national
Governments as well as encouraging families to keep girl children in
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:13:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/153E6A6A0302C98D187E501050C4EF80574434BC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

Browne of Ladyton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, wish to
congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Loomba, on securing this important
debate and creating an opportunity for this issue to be brought to the
attention of your Lordships’ House and to engage with the
Government on it. It is an enormous privilege to follow the noble
Baroness, Lady Chalker, and I commend the previous speeches for setting
out the issues which need to be addressed. In the short time I have I
intend to address just one discrete
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000003">Women
and girls are marginalised enough but when multiple inequalities
intersect, they are marginalised even more. More than one-third of the
57 million children who are not in school have a disability. There are
very limited data on disability and they need to address this lacuna
and make it one of the key messages of the global disability movement
for the post-2015 framework to address. However, if there were
statistics they would almost certainly show that girls are unequally
represented among the children with disabilities who are out of school.
There are a number of reasons for this and the noble Lord, Lord Loomba,
enumerated some of them. They include broader gender inequality and
entrenched cultural attitudes towards girls and women. Often girls and
women in households are responsible for caring, cooking and cleaning or
just working to support the family. There are often early and forced
marriages of girls and a lack of female teachers or school managers or
other female role models to encourage girls to participate.
Unfortunately, gender-based violence and harassment, particularly on
long journeys to school, make girls feel very unsafe. Among other
things, poverty causes families to make choices about which children
they should send to school and they often favour sending
boys<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:15:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

universal primary education of girls have made considerable progress
but, as the MDGs make no mention of disability, the harsh fact is that
this progress has not reached girls with disabilities. The high-level
panel’s shift on “leave no one behind” is to be
welcomed. The UK Government have a special responsibility to ensure
that this emphasis is not lost, as the discussions continue at UN

am aware that girls’ education is a major priority for the
Department for International Development. One of the headline goals is
keeping girls, particularly 
<?notus-xml column=176?>the most marginalised, in school. A target for
2011-12 to 2014-15 to support 11 million girls and boys in school is a
significant challenge and the sub-target of 1 million of the most
marginalised girls is even more challenging. I welcome this focus and
DfID’s flagship Girls’ Education Challenge, which is

Walmsley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Loomba for securing this important debate. I think we would all accept
that when you educate a girl you also benefit her family. Although
eliminating gender disparity has been a major focus of the MDGs, there
are still 31 million girls of primary age not in school.</hs_para>

poor quality of schooling in many parts of the developing world causes
many girls to drop out and return to domestic or agricultural work. In
some places the teachers do not turn up, demand bribes or are simply
not well enough educated themselves. Among many other charities, the
Steve Sinnott Foundation is trying to do something about that by
training some of the teachers over here. As has been said, another
reason why girls in rural areas do not go to school is because they
simply fear for their safety on the journey. Among adult women,
literacy rates are rising and the gender gap is narrowing. Even so,
women represent two-thirds of the world’s illiterate
adults.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000009">If we
draw any conclusions from the MDGs it should be that development must
be holistic to have any real impact. The charity Network for Africa
found that Rwandan women were unable to attend their free literacy and
numeracy classes or vocational training sessions because they were
worried about the safety of their children who were left at home. When
childcare was provided, girls were no longer being kept home to care
for younger siblings; mothers attended training programmes; and
toddlers, who benefited from just one year of nutritious meals and
cognitive development games, gained years ahead of their peers in
health and mental ability. The women in the project quadrupled their
income, on average, after six months. When women know that
their babies are safe, they will attend classes and improve their life
prospects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000010">Sadly,
MDG progress sometimes disguises the fact that social norms still
perpetuate discriminatory behaviour toward girls and women. Until
someone challenges the idea that we cannot question traditional
culture, no great strides will be made. Therefore, in the MDGs
post-2015, we need indicators for social norms embedded into every
aspect of development
programming.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000011">The
MDGs tackle the easy part. The tough part is challenging cultures that
keep discrimination against women in every aspect of their lives. The
myth that gender equality is culturally sensitive and must be treated
with kid gloves has to be challenged and debunked and the importance of
universal human rights stressed. The position of adolescent girls is
crucial and ought to be one of the focuses post-2015. Adolescence is
when girls realise that their dreams are 
<?notus-xml column=177?>unattainable because of cultural traditions and
persisting views about gender roles. It is all very well aiming
attention at schooling but if negative attitudes still exist in the
home they will dominate girls’
lives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000012">Finally,
I wish to make a point about the importance of education in
emergencies; it is an aspect of global education that is often
forgotten. Nowhere is this more critical than in complex emergencies
like the crisis in Syria. Currently in Syria, 2.3 million children
inside the country and 400,000 refugee children are without education.
More than 4,000 schools have been destroyed, damaged, used as shelters
or occupied. In countries surrounding Syria, refugee children have put
a strain on the local education systems. Without education and adequate
psycho-social support, these children are at risk of accepting violence
as normal and replicating it, undermining their own futures, the future
of their nations and the stability of the region. The future of an
entire generation lies in the balance; the global community must be
more strategic in its planning and take steps now to avoid this lost
generation and destruction of the region.</hs_para>

points. The first is to re-emphasise something that the noble Lord,
Lord Loomba, said; namely, that girls’ education is not only
good in itself but is good as a means for other things. As people
probably know, I speak from a background in health and my understanding
of the fact that it is empowered women and educated girls who have big
impacts in all kinds of areas of life. The noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to the cultural context. DfID has
done some very good work in a number of areas on health where it has
engaged traditional leaders, particularly around issues such as
maternal mortality. I wonder—simply because I do not
know—the extent to which DfID has engaged traditional leaders in
Africa and other places to put pressure on their communities to get
girls to school, as they have done with maternal mortality.</hs_para>

repeat what someone else has said because, broadly, we are talking
about a common understanding. My second point is about primary
education. There is a developing issue in Africa, which is where I
notice it, with people who have got primary education asking,
“What happens next?”. The issues about higher and further
education apply not only to girls of course. It would be good to hear
from the Minister the Government’s view on that and on educating
people to a certain level but not recognising the whole
system.</hs_para>

final point is on disability. I chair Sightsavers, which is concerned
with the blind. We are very conscious of the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Browne of Ladyton, that people who have multiple
disadvantages are the least likely to get educated. If girls are less
likely to get educated anyway, a disabled girl is going to have a
bigger
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000018">I

know that the Government, the Prime Minister and the high-level panel
have made these pledges about leaving nobody behind, but that makes
sense only if we can measure it in some way. It will be critical to
understand how the Department for International Development and other
agencies around the world will help to ensure that there are some
measurement processes in place that will record whether girls with a
disability are actually being excluded from education or are getting
their fair share of it. How will monitoring be
undertaken?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/D3DF03505EA0AB4DBA32B221714D328F818891E7" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 November 2013">Thursday,

the introduction of the MDGs, the world of sport has applied
significant resources to development, helping to promote formal
education, culture, healthy lifestyles, human rights, sustainability,

In my opinion, education underpins the entire set of MDGs. It is

educate youth around the world through sport and its values.</hs_para>

reflect the notion of sport as a school of life. The IOC’s
Olympic Values education programme forms an essential part of this
perspective. The project was designed for children and young people,
with developing countries in mind. The IOC has now rightly teamed up
with the United Nations, with its observer status, and in particular
with the work of UNESCO, to apply this programme to its network of
schools in line with the organisation’s mandate to enhance and
enrich quality education

equality is also critical to the world of sport in general. It is a
matter of fairness. It is a human right that women and girls should be
accorded the same opportunities as the other half of humanity. All of
us involved in sport accept the universal reality that women are
underrepresented in all aspects of life—political, economic and
social—and that we all must do our best to contribute to the
international agenda of righting that situation. The situation in sport
reflects the importance of this balance both on the playing 
<?notus-xml column=179?>field and in administrations. The goal was and is to
ensure that girls and women across the developing world are given equal
opportunities to engage in sport and physical activities throughout
their lifespan. The development of women’s sport is one aspect
of a more general societal, social and cultural evolution which
provides increased recognition of the roles and needs of women in
society. These roles and needs are very similar to those already
enjoyed by men and are signposts of a healthy society.</hs_para>

many other challenges that the women of the world face in their daily
lives, but the issue of women in sport is directly related to human and
social rights. Sport is an integral part of society and exerts an
influence on our lifestyle and social perceptions. The fundamental
principles of the Olympic Charter state that every human being must
have the possibility of practising sport in accordance with his or her
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000025">I point
to just one practical example; namely, the International Olympic
Committee’s support of the UN Secretary-General’s Zero
Hunger Challenge leading up to the 2016 Olympics in Rio. There is no
level playing field in sport or in life without adequate nutrition for
all. Few people appreciate the importance of good nutrition better than
athletes, but hunger stunts the potential of 165 million
children—one in four around the globe—and we have
regrettably failed to meet the millennium development goal to halve
hunger by 2015. Athletes can help to get these messages out as they
know better than anyone the impact of nutrition on
performance.</hs_para>

UN Secretary-General has made 100% access to food for all an essential
element of his Zero Hunger Challenge. Former President Lula’s
Fome Zero programme in Brazil was the inspiration for the Zero Hunger
Challenge, which was launched in Rio in 2012, making it a neat fit with
the Brazil 2016 Olympics. At the closing ceremony of the London 2012
Olympics, the Brazilian Government formally promised to make hunger and
nutrition a focus of the Rio 2016 Olympics; such is the power of sport.
All of us who are involved in sport need to build a coalition of
sporting personalities from around the globe—especially from
developing countries—to speak in support of the Zero Hunger
Challenge. The UN has wisely suggested that leading athletes could
promote zero hunger through field project visits, media messages,
speeches, editorials or

close with the reflection that the empowerment of women is at the core
of an essential process which we need to put in place. Strengthening

Kinnock of Holyhead (Lab):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, education is
of course a basic human right, and it is one of the very best ways to
reduce poverty within families and indeed across generations. It is key
to efforts which have to be made to advance gender equality and
women’s empowerment. Education provides the building blocks a
girl needs if she is to participate 
<?notus-xml column=180?>fully in society, earn a living and care for her
children and family. It also prepares her to stand up for her right to
make her own decisions about her own life and her own future. Education
is the one constant positive determinant of practically
every single development outcome we
seek.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000029">Yesterday
I met Manizha and Samira from Afghanistan, who are women’s
rights activists. They described the regular attacks on girls who walk
to school, the girls’ schools which have been burnt down, the
acid attacks on girls, the poisoning of girls’ school drinking
water, and the threats and violence that teachers face if they teach
girls. Extremists clearly do their best to terrorise girls who still
dare to go to school in Afghanistan. They told me about their concerns
that there is insufficient monitoring by DfID of funds allocated to the
Ministry of Education in Kabul. I would therefore appreciate
information from the Minister on what checks and balances are in place
to ensure that the funds are properly managed and distributed so that
girls get their fair share of those
funds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000030">In the
limited time that I have, I also ask the Minister whether he agrees
that UN discussions must focus on the urgent need to work to ensure
that there is universal literacy by 2030. That has to include tackling
the gender gap in access to literacy across the generations. An
Education for All statistic tells us that of the 760 million
illiterate adults around the world, two-thirds are women. This is
despite the clear evidence that, unless there is a much stronger
commitment to access to education for women and mothers, they will
continue to be excluded and marginalised. Is it not time that
Governments placed greater emphasis on tackling the blatantly
discriminatory social norms which continue to dictate that boys’
education is to be valued more than girls’ education? Simply
emphasising getting girls into schools is not enough. Unless a firm
priority is given to the need to tackle the root causes of gender
inequality, frankly it just will not ever
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000031">The
new global framework to be finalised in 2015 will include access to
secondary education. Will the Minister outline DfID’s view on
how girls’ transition to secondary school can be supported? Will
the UK move beyond the high-level panel report recommendations and
support a stronger position which recognises those underlying causes of
gender inequality? I trust that the UK will convey a strong message on
the need for a strong and explicit focus on gender inequality and
women’s rights post-2015. The fact is that millions of women and
girls simply cannot wait for the fulfilment of their right to a quality
education.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:34:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:34:48"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="13110778000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000065">5.34

statistics published by various national and international agencies
mask some of the realities of the problems facing women and girls in
Asia and Africa. I should like to focus on some main issues relating to
women and young girls. They are 
<?notus-xml column=181?>those of education and healthcare for women and, in
particular, young girls between the ages of eight and 16. Many young
girls are unable to go to school because many schools, both primary and
secondary, do not have toilet facilities. That is a big issue and a
deterrent that stops young girls attending schools. Many mothers of
those young girls who have not been through any formal education are
themselves unaware of those problems. The second issue on the health
front for young girls is access to affordable sanitary towels. Right on
the ground, those NGOs that work on this issue find that rags of
clothing are used again and again, causing immense health
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:36:22"></hs_TimeCode>. Please

Britain is contributing substantial funding through DfID in the third
world, I draw the Minister’s attention to the issues facing many
women who come to Britain from third-world countries to join their
families. Research shows that many women who come from third-world
countries are unable to speak English or connect with the wider
community. As a result, finding jobs becomes almost impossible. Their
inability to talk to their doctors and those at their children’s
schools is well known. ESOL for those isolated groups of women, to
bring them from the margins to the mainstream, is very important. Very
little funding is available from local or central government, and I
hope that the Minister will look into the issue and inform the

want to make two points about how important girls’ education is.
The first is to do with reproductive rights and control over their own
fertility. We know that there are 215 million women in the developing
world who want to delay or avoid pregnancy. We also know that all the
information available from across the world, some of which was

second link is between illiteracy and sexual violence. Yesterday, I
read an article in the <I>Nairobi Star</I> from Kenya. A report had
been published on the Ganze sub-county that states that higher literacy
levels 
<?notus-xml column=182?>are partly to blame for the increase in cases of
sexual, gender-based violence. The reason for this is in this report.
Basically, the high illiteracy level hinders the conceptualisation of
information about gender-based violence. In other words, young women
and parents cannot report gender-based violence because they are
illiterate. They do not understand how to do these things. Indeed, the
children’s officer who compiled the report pointed out that
literacy classes would be enormously beneficial in this

Bates (Con):</Member></B> I thank all noble Lords for taking part in
this debate. I particularly pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Loomba
for introducing this debate so effectively and comprehensively. He has
great authority from his work over many decades in this area of
levelling the playing field to help women and girls around the world.
He was also quite right to refer to the fact that my noble friend Lady
Northover, the lead Minister for DfID in the House of Lords,
particularly wanted to be here, but due to a close family bereavement
she is unable to be. I am sure that the whole Committee will want to
send our condolences to my noble
friend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:43:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000042">As
the 2015 deadline for the millennium development goals approaches, it
is right that we come together today to explore the core issues around
the progress of education for girls and women. Progress on MDGs 2 and 3
has been made. Globally, more girls go to school; in sub-Saharan
Africa, the net enrolment rate for girls rose from 47% to 75% between
1990 and 2011. Gender parity in primary enrolment has improved
significantly in regions that started the decade with the greatest
gender gaps. Literacy rates are on the rise, and gender gaps are
narrowing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000043">However,
under Millennium Development Goal 3, the target of gender parity in
primary and secondary education has been achieved by only two out of 
<?notus-xml column=183?>130 countries. Gender gaps in access to
education have narrowed, but girls are still disproportionately absent
from the classroom; 31 million girls are still out of school, and 70%
of these are from the most disadvantaged communities in the world. In
10 countries, at least half of poor, rural girls have never been to
school. Girls suffer double discrimination; first because they are poor
and secondly because they are
female.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000044">I now

Loomba, asked a specific question about allocations of the gender fund
which has been established. He mentioned his disappointment with the
information from the website which showed that perhaps not much of it
had been drawn down. Of course, the updating of websites is an
essential part of communication; I looked into that and found that the
figure was from April. As of now, £225 million has been
allocated, and £25 million has been spent. This is an innovative
process where people are bidding for funds and therefore to ensure that
there are the correct checks and balances, the period during which
those funds get distributed is longer than normal.</hs_para>

2015 the UK will have supported 11 million children in education in
primary and secondary schools and 190,000 teachers. There are some very
innovative examples taking place in the Punjab region, which will be of
particular interest to the noble Lord. Stipends have been introduced
for children to encourage them to take part in school. This means
actually sending them the books and the pens and giving them some
resource to enable them to attend school. That applies to 400,000
children in the Punjab area, which I think is a positive
initiative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:46:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the other place with my noble friend Lady Chalker when she was Minister
for Overseas Development, before it was so fashionable. She served in
that role with great distinction for eight years and it is thanks to
her that much of the legacy continues. She mentioned Rwanda and
Ethiopia and I listened carefully to her points, particularly about the
importance of having supportive governance in place at a provincial
level to encourage education and make it a priority. It reminds us that
educating girls is only the first step towards empowering them to take
greater control of their whole lives, and to then move on to becoming
more economically active, to have a greater base and then to move into
government, governance and institutions. It was well pointed out that
as well as being educated, women are also educators; if you have an
educated parent then you will have an educated child.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Browne, asked a specific question about disability.
There is some progress there. The noble Lord highlighted—and
with astute knowledge because of his experience—where the
canards are in this particular debate, because the absence of reliable
data is one of the things that the high-level panel noted needed a
great deal more work. One of the new millennium development goals was a
data revolution, and how you disaggregate that data to show gender
differences and then disaggregate that further to show differences
between disability. I would just mention two points to the noble Lord.
First, DfID has a strong 
<?notus-xml column=184?>commitment to the education of people with
disabilities and it seeks to ensure all new educational construction
directly funded by DfID is accessible to people with disabilities.
Secondly, it is also working with other organisations, including the
World Bank and NGOs, to improve and get better data so that they can
tackle this issue. One of the pieces of data which quite shocked me
does not relate to a specific area, but says that the limited
statistics that are available indicate that only 3% of adults with
disabilities are literate in the poorest countries of the world, and
only 1% of women with disabilities. The data issue is a key part and
that is something which DfID is looking at.</hs_para>

noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, spoke powerfully about Syria in
particular, and she used the words “the lost generation”,
which is a great tragedy with so many refugees who are coming. On a
recent visit, the Secretary of State established the lost generation
fund of £30 million for children in Syria and the
surrounding areas to ensure that they have better access to education.
Therefore, we hope that the diplomatic efforts will be gathering pace,
although that might take time. Of course, these are critical years for
these children, some of whom I have seen myself in schools in the Bekaa
area. She also mentioned access to good-quality education, which is
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:50:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Crisp, mentioned completing education as well as
making a point on data. He referred to his work with Sightsavers, which
I know makes a huge difference around the world. Some 10 million
children drop out from primary school education every year.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:51:01"></hs_TimeCode>
Girls’ Education Challenge will ensure that barriers preventing
girls from benefiting from education are tackled at root by collecting
data in a systematic way, by trying to track progress through the
secondary school system and by asking those who qualify for the fund to
collate data on the proportion of women marrying by the age of 15,
attitudes towards age of marriage and choice of marriage partners. That
data will help inform further work and further
allocations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:51:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000051">My
noble friend Lord Moynihan spoke about Olympic values, which of course
have equality at their heart. As an Olympian of note, he has done a
huge amount in this area. Last year, he rightly was awarded the Olympic
Order of Merit for his work not just on the London Olympic Games but
over many years on the international side and the development side. He
works as a trustee of International Inspiration as well. He mentioned
the Hunger Summit and the Hunger Challenge which came out of
2012<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:52:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Before I
came to the Moses Room, I read the new IOC president’s speech to
the General Assembly of the United Nations yesterday to mark the
Olympic Truce, which he and I worked on last year. He will have been
heartened by that. It referred to the millennium development goals and
the hunger pledges that were made, particularly towards Rio, which
reminds us that education is body, mind and
soul<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:52:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Kinnock, served in the Foreign Office as a Minister and knows this
area well. She spoke about the importance of ensuring funds to help and
support Afghanistan in particular. The point is that women and girls
are up front and central in all DfID’s considerations. The
funding of £47 million over three years which DfID has allocated
to the 
<?notus-xml column=185?>Ministry of Education is being supervised with that very much in mind.
Just yesterday, my noble friend Lady Warsi met with officials from
Afghanistan on that very
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:53:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110778000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000053">The
noble Lord, Lord Bhatia, raised a specific point on the experience of
migrants in education in the UK. Perhaps I may write to him on that. I
would be very happy to meet on the margins of this debate to
take better note of that issue. The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton,
spoke about reproductive rights, which of course is a key part of
giving women control over their own lives and bodies. It is a critical
area that we need to look at. She also recognised the work of Gordon
Brown as the UN Secretary-General’s envoy, particularly on
global education. All who saw the incredibly moving speech by Malala in
the margins of the General Assembly really brought hope to us about the
importance of education. The more that her voice is heard, the
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:54:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the Government place women and girls at the centre of their
approach. All 
<?notus-xml column=186?>UK education programmes in developing countries prioritise the education
of girls and, where needed, have specific interventions to address
gender-specific barriers to educational opportunities. UK aid has so
far supported 6.4 million children at primary and secondary level, of
which 3.1 million were girls. Looking beyond 2015, the UK, through the
Prime Minister and his co-chairmanship of the high-level panel, has
been at the forefront of building momentum around the standalone goal
for women and girls in the new development framework. However,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:55:20"></hs_TimeCode>this battle is
far from won. We will continue to work with others to push
this important agenda forward over the next two

important that we focus on keeping NGOs, charities and the private
sector engaged in developing projects that will expand education
opportunities for women and girls. The noble Lord, Lord Loomba, began
our debate by reminding us that education is the best gift you can give
any child. Much has been done but more needs to be
done.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13110778000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-gc0002.htm#13110778000076">Committee

specific allegations were that there had been manipulation of the gas
market in Great Britain on 28 September 2012. These
allegations concerned trading 
<?notus-xml column=24?>on that day in the period leading up to 4.30 pm, when price reporting
agencies produce a benchmark price for the day. Such benchmark prices
are often used in a range of other contracts. It was alleged that gas

downwards the benchmark price produced by price reporting
agencies.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110767000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-wms0001.htm#13110767000010">As
is right and proper, these allegations were scrutinised by the
independent regulators for the affected sectors. Ofgem has the lead
responsibility for the physical energy markets, with the FCA leading on
financial markets. The reviews entailed detailed analysis of relevant
information in order to understand the market conditions and the
trading positions of relevant market participants, including contracts
priced by reference to price reporting agencies’ closing prices.

explanations provided. In light of this, they conclude that no further
action is required in connection with these allegations.</hs_para>

outcome of these particular allegations I am fully committed to
ensuring we have a transparent energy market where the risk of abuse is

in developing the EU regulation on wholesale energy market integrity
and transparency—known as REMIT. REMIT prohibits insider trading
and market manipulation in wholesale energy markets across the EU and
has been in force since 28 December 2011. The UK was one of the first
countries to implement REMIT in full, when we put in place civil powers
to allow the regulator to tackle manipulation of the energy markets, in
June 2013. In view of the importance of the energy markets set out in
the Annual Energy Statement I now plan to consult on the introduction
of criminal sanctions for energy market manipulation
activities.</hs_para>

monitor wholesale energy markets, and has an established whistleblower
policy to encourage people to bring any examples of market abuse to its
attention. REMIT already requires those organising transactions in
wholesale markets to report suspicious trades to Ofgem. Ofgem is also
working with European colleagues to further develop our cross-border

case were that prices used by Price Reporting Agencies were
manipulated. We need confidence that there is a rigorous price
assessment process, providing a fair assessment of the market. Ofgem
therefore ran a call for evidence on benchmarks in gas and electricity
sectors on: potential risks; whether the current processes are fit for
purpose; and whether further action is necessary. Ofgem is currently
analysing  
<?notus-xml column=25?>the responses received. It will be for Ofgem to set out their approach,
but if action is warranted their responses could range from
facilitating effective self-regulation by PRAs, to more significant
regulatory interventions. Whatever approach is adopted must take
account of international initiatives in this area. PRAs are
already implementing Principles for oil benchmarks developed by the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) at the
G20’s request. We are working within the EU to ensure that any
new regulation of PRAs under their proposed Benchmarks Regulation
enhances the robustness of energy
benchmarks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110767000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131107-wms0001.htm#13110767000016">Transparency
in the energy market is another important element of our overall
approach to deterring market abuse. That is why I have asked Ofgem to
carry out a detailed assessment of energy suppliers’ financial
reporting practices and set out the necessary steps to improve
transparency. This assessment will be delivered by Spring 2014. In
addition, the Prime Minister has announced that Ofgem, OFT and the new
