I get into the substance of the Bill, noble Lords might be interested
to hear that I found out recently that an ancestor of mine, the third
Earl of Berkeley, who was later the First Lord of the Admiralty, was a
leading member of something called the Kit-Cat Club. I do not know how
many noble Lords know about the Kit-Cat Club but in the early 18th
century it was one of those organisations—largely a Whig
one—which were united in their belief in the authority of
Parliament over the monarchy. One has to consider how much has
changed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000005">This
Bill proposes comparatively small changes to the relationship between
the monarchy and Parliament, and perhaps starts the process of what I
hope will be quite a long discussion over the coming years. There are
three clauses in the Bill. The first one amends the Sovereign Grant Act
2011 in respect of royal travel. This is a serious issue because there
is a question over how many royals and royal duties should receive
taxpayer-funded travel, as well as the scrutiny that Parliament has
over these arrangements. I have been following this for some years, as
noble Lords will probably know, and have noted that Parliament gets
less and less detail of how many journeys there are by air and rail and
how much they cost.</hs_para>

Andrew flew to Jeddah for a funeral, chartering his own aircraft at a
cost of £86,000 to the public purse, when the return fare for

for having your own plane to go to a funeral when there is a scheduled
direct flight? At the other extreme, Princess Anne does an awful lot of
good for 
<?notus-xml column=444?>transport particularly, but I noted that she took a helicopter to visit
two gymkhanas in one day. That is fine if you are horsy but is it

to the second half of the clause, as a resident of Cornwall, I hear a

structure of the Duchy remains pretty feudal, and that it is
intentionally so, as it seems to suit all those involved not to rock
the boat and incur what one might call royal

start with a big debate about whether the Duchy is in the private or
the public sector. There is secrecy, obfuscation, Crown immunity and a
failure to respond to questions. It is worth going back a bit in
history. The Duchy has been around for a very long time, but I
discovered that the Duchy of Cornwall Act 1860
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13110858000303" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000303">“All
the provisions of the said Act of the ninth year of King George the

means that the Duke of Cornwall is effectively in the position of King
of Cornwall. We can debate whether that appeals to the people of
Cornwall, but it is confirmed in a preliminary statement by the Duchy
of Cornwall in a foreshore dispute in 1856. It suggests that the three
Duchy charters are sufficient in themselves to vest in the Duke of
Cornwall not only the government of Cornwall but the entire territorial
dominion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T10:13:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13110858000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000013">It
is also interesting to note that, whereas the sheriffs of the counties
of Britain swear an oath of allegiance to the sovereign, the Sheriff of
Cornwall swears an oath of allegiance to the Duke of Cornwall as
sovereign 
<?notus-xml column=445?>of Cornwall. Those examples appear to provide strong confirmation that
the Duchy is a public body and, as such, subject
to environmental, housing and other laws. That was confirmed
in a judgment concerning Port Navas on the Telford river on the
question of whether the Duchy should be subject to environmental
legislation. The Duchy lost the case, perhaps influenced by evidence
from the Duchy which said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13110858000318" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000318">“the

is an issue of tax. The Public Accounts Committee published a report
last week which, I thought, was very deferential. I am sure that if I
or any other noble Lord had been questioned by the Public Accounts
Committee about not paying tax, we would not have received the response
that, yes, there ought to be a bit more investigation by the Treasury.
The Treasury responded even more deferentially. That was an opportunity
lost to get things on a proper footing. Then there is the question of
Crown immunity. The Duchy does not pay capital gains tax or corporation
tax, and Duchy income is taxed on a voluntary basis. Would not we all
like to be taxed on a voluntary
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T10:15:43"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000015">The
Duchy accounts state that, in accordance with the memorandum of
understanding of 1993, the Prince of Wales pays rent on Highgrove, his
house in Gloucestershire. There is no lease in place and, as I
understand the evidence given by Sir Bertie Ross for the Duchy, the
Prince is entitled to the income from the Duchy, so it would be a
matter of the Prince taking money from one pocket and placing it in
another, so he does not actually pay rent. He can claim tax relief on
that proportion of the rent which relates to Highgrove being used for
public purposes, so it appears that he is claiming tax relief in
respect of rent which is paid in theory but not actually paid or which,
having been paid, is returned to him. I hope that noble Lords can
follow
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T10:16:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000016">On
the issue of housing, Mr Alan Davis, who lives in the Isles of Scilly,
wants the right to buy his leasehold property from the Duchy. He is
challenging the Prince on his decision in the Prince’s Council
to resist that because the Leasehold Reform Act does not apply to the
Duchy because of Crown immunity. There is an awful lot of confusion and
documents have been lost. Mr Davis’s case comes before the
tribunal in Truro, so I shall not comment on it further. It seems wrong
that people who live in houses leased from the Duchy cannot buy their
own houses in the way that other people can because the Duchy claims
that it wishes to manage the built and national environment. There is
legislation to do that. The Leasehold Reform Act may not be perfect,
but the exclusion of the Duchy from it is a matter of
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T10:17:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000017">The
next issue is the rents that the Duchy charges for its properties.
According to Richard McCarthy, who is chair of the Duchy Tenants
Association, average Duchy rents in 2011-12 were £130, whereas
council 
<?notus-xml column=446?>rents averaged £70 and housing association rents averaged
£100. The average household income on the Scillies is just
£277 a week, compared with the national average of £390,
so those rents are very hard for tenants in the Duchy to
afford.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000018">My
last example is something called bona vacantia. It applies to people
who die in Cornwall without a will. Their estate then goes to the
Duchy. It is worth about £500,000 a year. I think
that the people of Cornwall think that that money should be spent on
good causes in Cornwall, but it appears from the Duchy accounts that it
is distributed to Strata Florida in Wales, Gordonstoun School, which
Prince Charles attended, and a Kennington residents’
association. Because the money came from Cornwall, there is a feeling
that the funds should be distributed to good causes in
Cornwall<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T10:19:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000019">I
have been able to give just a snapshot of the obfuscations,
uncertainties and spurious claims by the Duchy of being in the private
sector or in the public sector and having Crown immunity,
which seems to vary on the time and the subject, all coupled with the
secrecy from both the Duchy and, sad to say, the Government, whose
obsequiousness sometimes seems more appropriate to a feudal era, when
the Prime Minister would get his head chopped off if he did not do
whatever the sovereign or the heir to the Throne
wanted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000020">I have
had lots of support from the people of Cornwall about this; many of
them fear that they cannot speak out, and one can understand why. So my
solution is to separate the Duchy estate from any historical link with
the monarchy and turn it into a public trust for the benefit of the
people of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. There is over 600 years of
history to unravel and that is not easy, so this would need secondary
legislation and perhaps some primary as well, but the opportunity
should be taken to clear up all the anomalies about the status of the
Duke of Cornwall and his rights. In this context, my Bill would ensure
that the Prince of Wales should no longer be King of Cornwall in the
feudal sense. I think that he should retain his links with Cornwall as
he does with Wales—but he does not own Wales. That is the
purpose of that clause.</hs_para>

been overtaken by events. It concerns the issue of consent from the
Queen or the Prince of Wales before a Bill receives Royal Assent. The
Minister kindly indicated the consent at the start of this debate. I do
not need to go into this topic in any particular detail because, in
evidence to the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee on 31
October, the Clerks of both Houses of Parliament basically said that
Parliament could change that; it would not need any legislation but if
it wished to stop this, it could do it. To demonstrate why we need to
change the current arrangements, I have a couple of examples of cases
where approval was not signified for a Bill. The Clerks’
evidence is that this has happened twice. Although the legislation was
not refused—this is a deferential way of “not saying no
but meaning no”—two Private Member’s Bills were
affected. One was the Second Reading of the Military Actions against
Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill on 16 April 1999, in which Tam
Dalyell tried to require Parliament to give approval of declarations of
war, which did not go 
<?notus-xml column=447?>ahead because the Prime Minister of the day almost
certainly advised the Queen that it would not be a good idea to go
ahead, perhaps because he might want to bomb Iraq without getting the
approval of Parliament —we can debate that. The other was the
Third Reading of the Pig Husbandry Bill on 3 May 1991. I do not know
whether the Royal Family keep pigs in Windsor Castle, but why that did
not go ahead I also do not know. All I can do is quote John Kirkhope, a
public notary and chartered insurer who has given me a lot of help with
this
information:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13110858000304" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000304">“I

conclusion, there is much that needs doing, sorting out and cleaning up
in many areas of the relationship between the monarch, the Prince of
Wales and Parliament. I hope that the constitutional monarchy survives
and prospers but at the moment the Prince of Wales in particular is put
in an impossible position in seeking to do what he believes is best in
a kind of feudal environment that started 600 years ago but in the 21st
century is not appropriate. Change is necessary, but we have to get
away from this deferential relationship of obfuscation and silence that
is hampering the debate. I hope that the Bill, covering only a small
part of that relationship, will start an open debate and eventually
some very necessary change. I beg to

Cormack (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I suppose you could call that a
Duchy original. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, is a very
genial man outside this Chamber, but I have to say this morning he
reminded me of that wonderful character from ITMA, Mona Lott, in that
it is being so cheerful as keeps him going. What we have had this
morning is an extraordinary series of disconnected accusations and
observations. He referred to Clause 3 of his Bill and said that
legislation was not needed. I would say that legislation was not needed
on this particular subject, full stop. While I yield to no one in my
admiration for the noble Lord and recognise that he is the last person
that anyone would dare to call obsequious, nevertheless I think that
today he has got it wrong.</hs_para>

reputation for being a fine engineer. I am sure that he is. As a fine
engineer, though, he knows that precision is very important. He knows
that if you are called out to repair something, you do not go along to
repair modern machinery with a bag of wooden tools. That is in fact
what he has been doing today.</hs_para>

points to your Lordships in opposing the Bill, which I am delighted to
do. Yesterday we were debating Magna Carta and the importance of the
rule of law. Earlier, my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth had an
interesting debate in the Moses Room on commencement orders, to which
my noble friend Lord Gardiner, sitting on the Front Bench, gave a most
excellent reply. The theme of that debate was 
<?notus-xml column=448?>that legislation must be demonstrated to be necessary and designed to
solve a specific problem or provide a proper remedy, and then it must
be properly enforced. One of the underlying themes of that debate,
particularly emphasised by the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon,
was that pre-legislative scrutiny was really a necessary precondition
wherever possible—one accepts terrorism legislation sometimes,
and things like that—for all legislation. If ever there was a
need for pre-legislative scrutiny, it is here.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110858000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000026">I do not believe that
legislation is necessary, and I certainly do not think it should be
embarked upon without the most careful examination. I suggest to the
noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, that what we should be doing is referring
some of the matters that give him concern to the Constitution Committee
of this House and there should be a proper, thorough and objective
examination. Merely to base one’s case on a number of isolated
examples, as happened towards the end of the noble Lord’s
speech, is no way to proceed to legislation in this House, particularly
on a very sensitive matter.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110858000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000027">I refer again to the
noble Lord’s career as an engineer—a very illustrious and
successful one. He knows as an engineer that a delicate mechanism can
be thrown completely out of gear by the removal of one apparently
insignificant part. One often finds this quoted particularly in the
case of clocks and watches. If there was ever anything that was
delicate and needed the most careful handling, it is our British
constitution. It is not a written constitution. Some may wish that we
had one, as some did in last night’s debate, but we do not. We
therefore have to look very carefully at what we are doing when we come
to constitutional
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000028"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T10:29:30"></hs_TimeCode>This
Bill is, in a sense, the son of the Succession to the Crown Bill,
because during the passage of that Bill the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley,
moved amendments, referred to his concerns about the Duchy of Cornwall
and advised the House that, at some stage in the future, he would seek
to introduce legislation. On 14 May, he was as good as his
word when he produced a Bill which had its First Reading on that
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000029">Many of
us were concerned about the Succession to the Crown Bill because we
believed it had not been sufficiently thought through. There were
implications for the Church of England—the established
church—which concerned the Bench of Bishops. Indeed, the
Minister, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, who
had charge of that Bill in this House and handled it with great skill
and sensitivity, was at pains to ensure that, in answer to a
Parliamentary Question, certain correspondence with the Roman Catholic
church was published.</hs_para>

that that Bill had perhaps been a little rushed were not against the
essential principle about the succession of a woman—of course,
not—but we were concerned about some of the implications. It was
suggested that because the Duchess of Cambridge was with child, it
would be as well to get this Bill through quickly. Of course, the child
arrived, the child was a boy, there was great rejoicing, and the sense
of urgency—if ever there was one—disappeared, so there is
no urgency about this. That underlines the point I made a few moments
ago, that if these subjects are to be looked at, they need to be looked
at carefully and 
<?notus-xml column=449?>deliberately, and if there is to be legislation of
any sort, it needs the most careful pre-legislative scrutiny. The whole
issue would benefit very much from the considered observations of the
Constitution Committee of this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000031"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="13110858000359" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000359">Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean (Con):</Member></B> I have been thinking about my
noble friend’s watch analogy. Does he not think there is
something of an irony about a hereditary Peer given a life peerage

privileges and a lack of
accountability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T10:32:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Cormack:</Member></B> My noble friend Lord Forsyth,
not for the first time, puts his finger on a number of interesting
issues upon which the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, might reflect. When he
is contemplating the illustrious past of his family, and its
contribution to the Kit-Cat Club, the portraits of whose
members hang in Brooks’s Club to this day, he might
just wonder whether, in fact, he has not been guilty of a little
inconsistency.</hs_para>

the Bill that I find particularly niggardly. It is the part dealing
with travel. The noble Lord wants to restrict those who can have
official travel to six members. He bases this on the fact
that the Succession to the Crown Bill specifically mentions
the six next in line who have to seek the permission of the
sovereign to marry. We had debates on this and amendments were moved,
including, if I recall correctly, by my noble friend Lord Lang, to
extend the number to 12, but the Bill went through with six in it.
However, there is no analogy. One has to realise that there are many
members of the Royal Family who give unstinting public service and
whose presence at public events is greatly welcomed. I do not want to
be invidious and give a long list, but I single out particularly the
Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. The Duke of Gloucester is punctilious
in fulfilling a range of engagements. I have attended a number of
engagements which he has attended. The pleasure that he gives by going
and the interest that he takes in the people he meets are of enormous
value and worth. I believe that it would be niggardly in the extreme to
say that only six members of the Royal Family should be allowed to
travel to fulfil their official duties at the taxpayer’s
expense.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000034">In
his concluding remarks, the noble Lord referred with what seemed a less
than enthusiastic endorsement to constitutional monarchy. I believe
very passionately in our constitutional monarchy. For well over 60
years now, Her Majesty the Queen has served this country absolutely
impeccably. I believe that we are all enormously in her debt and that
of members of the Royal Family, and I do not believe that
now is the time to be nitpicking about the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy
of Cornwall goes back 600 years. That, in itself, may be a reason to
say we should have a look at things, but it is no reason to embark with
a rather blunt instrument on an attack on an institution that has
served us very well.</hs_para>

is good to have debate in this House, and it is important that when
issues such as this are raised, there is an opportunity to comment on
them from both sides of the argument. I do not
believe that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has this morning made a 
<?notus-xml column=450?>case for this legislation. I believe it would be hasty and ill
considered and that, if we are to look at these subjects, they need to
be looked at in detail and in depth, dispassionately, objectively and
carefully. All those qualities can be brought to bear by your
Lordships’ House. They should be brought to bear. There should
be no question of letting this Bill proceed anywhere near the statute
book. I am confident that it will
not.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_08_PT_1/0AEA2096A06283E3DA8F142849851778D5ADC51D" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 November 2013">Friday,

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very proud to be a resident
of Cornwall. I represented Cornwall, together with the Isles of
Scilly—which are mainly a Duchy possession and are very proud to
be separate from Cornwall—in the European Parliament and was a
member of the unitary authority for Cornwall when it was first
established in 2009.</hs_para>

the speeches from noble Lords so far is an argument about the position
of royalty and the monarchy, and all that rather contentious area. I am
sure that that was intended by both noble Lords. I rather
support the Bill because it covers a number of very sensible issues in
a very short way. I do not necessarily agree with all of it, but there
are certain areas where changes make an awful lot of sense. Such
changes would, ironically, probably strengthen the monarchy in the way
that it operates in the future. I shall very briefly look at a couple
of points that are brought up in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000038">The
first is consent. I was interested to read the excellent briefing put
together by the House authorities. I had never realised that it is a
convention that both Houses of Parliament consult the monarch or the
Duke of Cornwall on legislation that would affect their interests. I
find that quite strange. I was pleased to see that the Clerk of the
Parliaments and the Clerk of the House of Commons made clear that there
is no need for legislation, as this could be changed by resolution of
both Houses. Having said that, I think it is a good issue to bring up.
It is strange, and most people would find it quite at odds with the way
that a sovereign Parliament would be expected to act. The issue is well
worth pursuing, and I would be very much in favour of removing the
requirement of consent. It seems to unnecessarily put a question about
the way that the sovereign or the Duke of Cornwall acts before
legislation comes before Parliament. I would have thought that it would
be useful to everybody if that process no longer
happened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000039">In
terms of who the title of Duke of Cornwall can pass to, Parliament has
decided that the royal succession should now be gender-neutral, and it
is obvious to me that that principle should be applied to the Duchy of
Cornwall. It seems to be a complete anomaly. I understand absolutely
why the Government did not include that in the Succession to the Crown
Act 2013, because they needed to keep that Bill as narrow as they could
to meet the needs of other Commonwealth nations that have the Queen as
head of state. However, I see absolutely no reason why we should not
move forward on that. In fact, that would be extremely
positive.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000040">The
future of the Duchy of Cornwall estate is perhaps far more contentious.
As it is currently, it does not sit comfortably. Particularly in the
Isles of Scilly, 
<?notus-xml column=451?>there is the practical issue of residents feeling
that they are in quite a difficult position in terms of how the Duchy
operates, the agent and all the issues which affect the lives of the
islands’ citizens and families. I am not sure that it is as
comfortable or correct as it should be. In a constitutional monarchy,
it makes sense that the heir to the Throne and the sovereign should
have similar or identical budgetary and financial procedures. I do not
see why we should have a separate Duchy of Cornwall estate any longer.
Having said that, I am absolutely sure, knowing Cornwall very well
indeed, that even if the estate went into a public trust, that would
not send away all the arguments about it and about how the money should
be used. Would it stop my honourable friends in the other place,
including my own MP, from receiving letters about how this money is
used and assets are distributed, disposed of or developed? I am
absolutely sure that it would not. It would certainly not be a silver
bullet. However, it would be an improvement. These areas all
deserve further investigation. They are sensible suggestions and would
in fact strengthen the constitutional monarchy in this country, which
is perhaps ironic for the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000041">One
thing I will say, from my experience in Cornwall, in business and as an
elected politician, is that the Prince’s Trust, which I have
worked with a number of times, has been absolutely excellent. The work
that it undertakes is extremely good, in terms of helping younger
people enter business and make a much greater contribution to society.
Those programmes have been excellent and most successful. The issues in
the Bill need looking at, although how important they are is perhaps
another matter. I suspect that the Bill will not take up a huge amount
of the House’s time between now and the next election. The
issues are important in principle.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we owe my noble
friend Lord Berkeley a vote of thanks for raising an issue of this
nature. It has not been an easy debate for him to launch, but he has
struggled on with it. As he said, he has been following these issues
for some years. The note from the Library which came around earlier
certainly exemplifies that, with the number of questions that he has
been asking and the detail that he has been trying to dig
out.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000043">The
noble Lord, Lord Cormack, obviously takes a different view and did so
in his very interesting style. As somebody on these Benches said to me,
it was a speech that could have been made at any time in the past 400
years. There is credit in that; it is a compliment, not necessarily an
attack. He referred to yesterday’s debate on Magna Carta, which
was extremely interesting because, among the issue that we talked
about—how Parliament would celebrate Magna Carta in June
2015—there was a current about the constitutional
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000044">There
is no doubt that Magna Carta in its original form and various
manifestations since then—something like 14 different charters
were issued until it died out in the mid-15th century—was and is
a particularly important document for the way we organise and run our
society. Is it a constitutional document? Almost certainly, and two
clauses in it are still extant in our laws. However, 
<?notus-xml column=452?>the point is that we do not really understand where
our constitutional documents lie. People often ask for a written
constitution. As I said yesterday, that is a mistake: most of the
constitutional arrangements are written down, but the difficulty is
that they are not brought together in a codified form. Even if that
were to happen, as I strongly believe it should, difficulties would
remain with the royal prerogative and other areas of our constitution
which are not as well exposed as they could be.</hs_para>

this Bill. My noble friend Lord Berkeley makes a number of specific
proposals, but the general point is about trying to throw a light on
activities which affect individuals up and down the country, but
particularly in Cornwall. That plays to a larger concern about the
extent to which those areas of our constitutional arrangements which
are not as well scrutinised as they might be can sometimes affect
particular aspects of the process of government in which we are all
involved. It may well be that pig husbandry is not the most important
issue. However, this is probably not the only Bill—there was
another one—in respect of which thought was given to whether, if
put forward in its present form, it might need to be changed later. My
noble friend Lord Berkeley is pointing up, in this section of the Bill,
the hidden areas of activity which make up the law-making and governing
of our country.</hs_para>

will apply in other ways to different areas. However, it seems to me
and these Benches that we should not miss the chance to have a good
look at some of these areas and the specifics that my noble friend has
raised in his Bill. We should be concerned about whether or not this is
the right way of proceeding with this sort of legislation. The noble
Lord, Lord Cormack, is right to say that all legislation would be
better if it were subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. I wish his party
could put more effort into that—I am thinking in particular of
the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union
Administration Bill, which is a classic. The noble Lord nods well, but
I wish that he would join us in discussion sometimes. I look forward to
seeing him on those Benches on Monday when we will talk about Part 3,
which was subject to no consultation whatever before being introduced.

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, this is the second of
two Private Members’ Bills we have had in this Session which
attempt to “tidy up”, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley,
said, our history. I have mixed views on this. The noble Lord himself
holds a feudal title which is old enough to descend along the female
line. As a liberal, in many ways, I am thoroughly in favour of a
rational and written constitution. I think I am right in saying that
the Act of 1863, one of the first of the modern Acts which regulate the
Duchy of Cornwall, was passed under a Liberal Government at the same
time that that Government proposed for the 
<?notus-xml column=453?>first time that the Law Lords should be separated from the House of

nearly 700 years. I have a sense from debates on Lords reform that
there is not an enormous appetite in the Chamber for rationalising our
constitution. I have myself come up against some interesting historical
anomalies. Many years ago, when I was first in this House, I asked some
questions about the Crown dependencies. The chief executive of Jersey
came to see me the following week and started by saying very
vigorously, “I hope you understand that we were promised in 1204
that the Channel Islands would be a low-tax jurisdiction”. Some
while later I asked to see the charter which had promised that and was

separate parts. The first proposes restrictions on the use of the
sovereign grant for travel. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, made a
number of pointed criticisms of current members of the Royal Family,
which in some ways we should as a House regret as they got relatively
personal. Her Majesty the Queen asks a number of members of her family
to stand in on her behalf as engagements demand and some of these, as
has been said, are members of the Royal Family who are lower than sixth
in the line of succession. The Royal Family carries out a large number
of public duties and the sovereign is well placed to assess who can
best take her place at functions—particularly as she still
carries out a great many duties but obviously not as many as she was
able to do some 20 or 30 years

second part proposes amendments to the Duchy of Cornwall estate. The
Duchy of Cornwall is an interesting anomaly. It is a private estate
that funds the public, charitable and private activities of the Prince
of Wales and his family but, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has
commented, it is nevertheless governed by a number of Acts passed in
the past 150 years, the combined effect of which has been to place the
Duchy’s assets in trust for the benefit of the present and
future Dukes of Cornwall and to govern the use of the assets. Many of
the assets are in Cornwall but quite a large number of them are outside
Cornwall. Mention was made in this debate of the Kennington
estate.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000053">His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall is entitled to
the annual net income of the Duchy. He is not entitled to the proceeds
or profits from the sales of the Duchy’s capital assets, which
are retained in the Duchy to provide income for the Duke and future
beneficiaries. Since it was established in the early 14th century, the
Duchy’s main purpose has been to fund an income independent of
the monarch for the 
<?notus-xml column=454?>heir apparent. The current Prince of Wales chooses
to use a substantial proportion of his income from the Duchy to meet
the costs of his public and charitable work. At present the Duchy funds

William and Prince
Harry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T10:52:23"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Bill’s proposal to place the assets of the Duchy of Cornwall in

on succession to the Duchy of Cornwall and this overlaps with the
previous Bill we were discussing on the succession to the Crown. I have
some sympathy with the anomalies at stake and the peculiarity of this
charter. There are many peculiarities in succession. I was talking to
the noble Countess, Lady Mar, yesterday about the succession to her
Earldom and the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, himself benefits from a
particular sort of succession. Rationalising all of these may be part
of what we need to do in the 21st century and I recognise
that, when it comes to the Royal Family, this is a particularly
interesting issue to attack. However, if we look back at recent history
there have been long stretches when there has been no Duke of Cornwall
and the Duchy has continued to manage its affairs well. There is
nothing to stop a female heir having an active role in the running of
the Duchy should the sovereign so wish. I can also reassure the House
that a female heir apparent will not find herself at a financial
disadvantage because the Sovereign Grant Act 2011 broadly ensures that
financial provision equivalent to the income from the Duchy is made for
the heir

removal of the Queen’s and Prince’s consent—a
rationalisation of one of the ancient practices of the two Houses of
Parliament. It is a long-standing parliamentary requirement that the
consent of the Queen and the Prince of Wales should be given for
certain Bills. The parliamentary authorities decide which Bills require
that consent, not the Government. Signifying the consent of the Queen
and the Prince of Wales for certain legislation is a parliamentary
requirement and the Government will continue to do that for as long as
Parliament requires it. The Government’s role is to ensure that
consent is sought for government and Private Members’ Bills when
it is required by Parliament. This requirement reflects the unique
relationship between the sovereign and the legislature which is rooted
in the historical royal prerogative and provides for a formal
parliamentary process by which the sovereign can be informed of, and
consulted on, legislation which affects the sovereign’s
prerogative and interests. The Government will generally seek consent
for Private Members’ Bills even when they oppose the Bill on the
basis that Parliament should not be prevented from debating a matter on

barely edible. At many hospitals patient meals are viewed as a
bureaucratic necessity and not as an integral part of care. Hospital
life is boring. When in hospital, patients want three things. They want
to go home, they want visitors and they want good nourishing food,
because it is food which punctuates the day. That should be something
to look forward to, but many patients dread it. The Francis inquiry

have an appetite which changes from day to day due to the medication
they receive. Hospital food is complicated, but there are hospitals
where they really think through these issues, have a love of food and
organise it well—while in similar hospitals in the same city, of
the same size, almost in the same catchment area, the food is simply
appalling. I am sure that noble Lords will agree with me, and I know

nourish patients, and much of it is wasted. Government figures suggest

hospitals in England spend more on nutritional supplements for patients
than on the meals served to them during their stay. While of course I
recognise that nutritional supplements are vital in the cases of some
patients, should they have become the routine prescription given to
patients who are unwilling to eat hospital meals, or failing to gain
nourishment from them? Patients should be nourished with enjoyable food

Government have given hospital trusts greater control over how they

influence the shape and direction of the NHS. That is absolutely right,
and I strongly support it. However, it is no less important to have a
safety net to ensure that the NHS 
<?notus-xml column=458?>does not fall below acceptable levels and that standards of care are
regularly monitored and enforced. Standards are not goals; they do not
restrict a hospital’s freedom. They provide basic levels of
assurance for organisations commissioned to provide healthcare. So we
are not setting a precedent; there is an abundance of standards already
in place in the NHS, which reflects the important role that they play,
including employment standards; care standards for patients with
specific ailments, such as diabetes; and standards for financial
auditing, to name but a few. Standards for hospital food should be no

Bill requires the Secretary of State to appoint a body of experts to
draft hospital food standards and make it mandatory for all patient
meals to meet those standards. The Care Quality Commission and the
Chief Inspector of Hospitals will be required to check that the
standards have been adopted and are met. If they are not, it gives the
CQC power to act, ultimately by withdrawing a hospital’s
registration. The CQC is working hard to increase the regularity and
effectiveness of its monitoring exercises, and is ensuring that
patients participate in them. The CQC already evaluates patient
satisfaction with meals, so this Bill would require only that
monitoring is carried out to assess adherence to more specific
standards. This solution does not in any way necessitate burdensome
regulation, and does not require the Government to take greater
administrative control over the provision of hospital meals. In fact,
patients themselves are likely to take a leading role in monitoring
hospital food, as more and more of them sign up to join inspection
teams, as encouraged by the Care Quality Commission’s new Chief
Inspector of Hospitals, Professor Sir Mike
Richards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T11:11:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000072">Finally,
I address the issue of cost. At the moment, taxpayers are being doubly
charged for poor hospital food. Not only are they paying for the cost
of patient meals but they are funding the associated costs that bad
hospital food incurs, such as food waste, malnutrition and longer
recovery times. I frequently hear people say that good hospital food is
expensive and costs too much for hospitals to afford, but the facts do
not bear this out. It has been shown that there is no correlation
between the cost of patient food and its popularity with patients. Many
of those hospitals serving the best food, produced and prepared to very
high standards, are actually paying less for it than are hospitals
where patients are dissatisfied with what they are being served and
where food is wasted. For example, according to data from NHS Estates,
Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust spent an average of £13.59 on food
for each patient per day in 2012, yet less than half of patients at the
hospital surveyed by the Care Quality Commission rated the food as
good. In contrast, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in London
spent £5 on food for each patient per day in the same period,
and more than seven out of 10 patients surveyed by the Care Quality
Commission described the food as good. So those public sector
organisations that have set standards for their food have done so
without incurring extra
cost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000073">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T11:13:16"></hs_TimeCode>

was that organisations buy more organic food, more fresh fruit and
vegetables, and sustainable fish. The evaluation concluded that the
organisations would not pay more—and, indeed, they do not now
pay more—for higher quality food. If patient meals contain
high-quality ingredients and are cooked by highly skilled caterers,

Foundation, the Hospital Caterers Association, the Royal College of
Physicians and thousands of members of the public. I contend that
hospital food standards must be made mandatory if all patient meals are
to be of a sufficient high quality, are to be nutritious and made to
minimum standards of production.</hs_para>

are taken into hospital at one of the most vulnerable times of their
lives. They become patients in a second, and face the illness itself,
the shock of hospitalisation, disorientation and the feeling of being
alone to face sudden and apparently insurmountable problems. For many
of us, it is a traumatic and frightening experience, even for those of
us who are usually confident and sure of what we are about and how to
react to what is happening around us. At such a
time, we need comfort; food should be part of that comfort
and something to look forward to—but, alas, too often it is

am pleased to say that I have not spent much time in my life in
hospital. I had been reasonably lucky with my health over the years
until about three years ago, when I was diagnosed with leukaemia. For
the first period of my illness, I had to remain in hospital
in a room set aside from the main ward, because I was very vulnerable
to germs and needed a sterile environment. The medical care that I
received was second to none; I am still receiving it, and it is
wonderful. The problem arose when I was confronted with what
I can describe only as “food from hell”. I did not expect
cordon bleu cookery, but I expected to eat nutritional food and some

the sweets were just that—sickly sweet beyond belief. On one
occasion, the Irish stew, as it was described, was so awful that, had I
been Irish, I would have been tempted to sue the hospital on the
grounds of the insult to the Irish nation. When I first went into
hospital, there was a choice of cheese and biscuits, but it was quickly
removed on the grounds of cost. There was no fresh fruit offered, and

the failure of voluntary initiatives in this area over decades, there
are a few shining examples of good practice. I first came across one of
them when I was a Somerset county councillor and the council was
looking at food procurement. The Royal Cornwall Hospital took a very
different approach by procuring its food locally, thereby ensuring that
it was fresh and that it contributed to the local economy. It also
commissioned a completely different approach to hospital kitchens by
putting catering staff at the heart of making people better. As a
result, the hospital’s food became much more appetising and the
amount of waste went down. Food waste is still a tremendous issue. I
think that that hub now supplies three other hospitals in Cornwall. It
is an amazing example of what can be done when the will is there and
the leadership of the hospital makes that
effort<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T11:23:12"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
voluntary initiatives are not always sufficient, given that the Royal
Cornwall Hospital initiative was introduced back in the early years of
this century and if other hospitals had wanted to follow that example
they would have done so by now. That is why I think the Bill is very
important because unless we have mandatory standards nothing will
happen. The Campaign for Better Hospital Food summarised the history of
the past two decades as one in which every year a high-profile
initiative is introduced by either a Minister or a celebrity chef, but
one, two or three years later it bites the
dust<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T11:24:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000087">The
people to whom I have spoken about the Bill have found it jaw dropping
that there are no mandatory standards for hospital food. They find that
incredible. As the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, mentioned, I have
the privilege of chairing the Food and Health Forum. Back in January
2012, we listened to presentations on this subject and I was struck by
two points in particular. One of the presentations was given by members
of the Royal College of Nursing, who forcefully made the point that
hospital food contains too many harmful elements—salt, sugar and
saturated fat have been mentioned in the debate—and far too few
of the elements that provide good nutrition. For example, the noble
Baroness, Lady Gibson, mentioned the lack of fresh fruit. We listened
to another presentation from the charity Heart of Mersey, which seeks
to combat heart disease. That charity has campaigned very hard to
improve hospital food because diet is very much implicated in hospital
admissions for people with heart disease. How on earth are they meant
to get better if hospital food exacerbates their health

3(b) of the Bill is very important. The Government may say that it is
too onerous to impose requirements relating to good procurement and

too long the topic of hospital food has been a running sore. It has a
reputation for being of poor quality and indifferently served, as borne
out so clearly by my noble friend Lady Gibson. Often too little help is
given to those who have difficulty feeding themselves. This is not to
say that nothing has been done about it. As all the previous speakers
have said, a large number of initiatives have been launched over the
years at considerable cost but with, by and large, disappointing
results. Governments of both political persuasions have launched
initiatives and guidelines but these have all been on a voluntary basis
with no sanctions for non-compliance. Although there have been a number
of successes where good standards have been reached, as has been
mentioned, many more remain far from satisfactory. Many of us are
grateful for the briefing provided by Alex Jackson of Sustain,
co-ordinator of the Campaign for Better Hospital Food, which has been
referred to. He has drawn up details of no fewer than 21 voluntary
initiatives since 1992 which have come to nothing after initial
fanfare, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller,

has improved little over the years. Good nutrition is likely to save
the NHS a lot of money. A recent international study published in the
<I>Lancet</I> has shown that faulty or inadequate nutrition plays a
part in 40% of deaths world wide. That applies not only to the
developing world but to our main problem—chronic,

course, providing for large numbers of patients in an average-sized
hospital on a limited budget is not easy; the logistics of the
operation can be formidable. Quality tends to be inversely proportional
to the size of the hospital. However, there are examples of good
systems in large units that work. Earlier this year I spent a week in
UCLH having a knee-joint replacement, and it was clear that thought had
been applied to the catering on offer. For one thing there was a choice
of menu, although you had to decide on this a day in advance. The food
was unexciting and rather too substantial for my post-operative
appetite, but was of fairly good quality, courteously served and
adequately hot, having been reheated on the ward. A healthcare
assistant was on hand to help those with a problem feeding themselves.
I am not too sure of the food’s nutritional credentials,
however. I found that the halal choice was the most attractively
presented and tasty, though a bit too spicy for a westerner. But the
experience of friends and relatives in NHS hospitals has not been so
good, as my noble friend Lady Gibson most graphically pointed
out.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000098">The ward

standards are still to be found in some hospital food, as has been
graphically pointed out. Recently, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Cumberlege, mentioned, one hospital meal was found to have a higher fat
and salt content than a Big Mac. As we all know, the diet of many
people in England is far from optimal and contains too much sugar,
saturated fat and salt, and too few of the vitamins and
trace elements found in fresh vegetables, fruit, fish, lean
meat and eggs. Dietary intake is more often than we realise
too low in many older people. In hospital there is a captive audience,
an ideal population on whom to demonstrate how well cooked good food
can be attractive, delicious and not too expensive. The food will taste
better and may have better nutrient value if it comes from sustainable
sources with good animal welfare standards. I am glad that there is
provision for that in the

so many initiatives failed? My guess is that hospital food is of low
priority on the agenda of hard-pressed managers who are often
struggling to meet targets and stay within budgets. The effects of poor
diet do not show up in most hospital statistics,
whereas mortality rates or waiting times can easily
be 
<?notus-xml column=464?>measured, and executives and clinicians held to
account. The considerable benefit that good nutrition can have is not
fully appreciated. Poor ward diets are often complacently tolerated by
management because their quality and acceptability is often not
monitored. The introduction of mandatory standards with strong
sanctions for non-compliance would eliminate any complacency because
the relevant manager would be held to account. As the noble Baroness,
Lady Cumberlege, said, other public sector institutions and schools are
now required to conform to and have adopted mandatory nutritional
standards, as has the National Health Service in Wales and Scotland.
Interestingly, Compass, probably the largest catering firm in the
country, has said that it supports mandatory standards because they
level the playing field among suppliers and caterers while maintaining
a high
standard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000101">I am

since I started working as a young doctor in the NHS in the 1950s and
1960s, 50 or 60 years ago, hospital food has been something of a
joke—a joke that is not particularly funny for patients, many of
whom either refuse to eat it because it looks so unappetising or,
having tasted it, can eat very little of it. No one who listened to my
noble friend Lady Gibson and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, could
possibly doubt that. It is hardly surprising to find that many patients
lose weight in hospital and that there is enormous waste as so much has
to be thrown away. I fear that it is becoming pretty obvious that I,
too, have read the excellent briefing that has been placed before
us.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000115">However,
that is not for want of trying to improve matters. According to the
report by the Campaign for Better Hospital Food entitled

F</I><I>ood </I><I>F</I><I>ailur</I><I>e</I>, there have been numerous
government initiatives, over many years, urging hospitals to pay
attention to the standards of their food. There have been no fewer than
21 different initiatives in 20 years, which is more than one a year and
two for each of the 11 Secretaries of State for Health who have held
office during that
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000116">Each of
those initiatives has urged a voluntary improvement by hospital trusts
but these seem to have fallen on deaf ears. We are just as bad as ever,
according to reports from Age Concern and the Royal College of Nursing.
And it is not just the appearance and attractiveness of meals that are
wanting; the nutritional value is even more problematic. Insufficient
fresh fruit, vegetables and fish, and too much fat and salt, as we have
heard, are far too commonplace. It is hardly surprising that patients
often rely on family and friends to bring in food for them, and this is
all happening despite efforts to enlist the help of a number of
celebrity chefs. Sending now for Jamie Oliver without some form of
regulation or legislation will simply not
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000117">It is
the case that fewer than half the meals are cooked on site and that
only a minority are made from British produce. There is of course an
additional problem which is not tackled in the Bill and that is the
complaint made, in too many places, of either food and drink being
placed out of the reach of infirm patients at the end of
their beds where they can see it but not reach it, or perhaps the food
is within their reach but they need help to cut it up and spoon it into
their mouths. Age Concern found that over 40% of patients needing this
sort of help actually got it. That problem has to be solved by better
training and the culture change that we keep banging on about in this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000118">So far
as the Bill of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, is concerned, there
seems little doubt that voluntary initiatives have not worked and that
we desperately need something more. We need to mandate better food and
catering, and it is clear that this will not cost any more. We also
need a proper inspection system. It is interesting to note that food
standards are 
<?notus-xml column=467?>mandated in prisons and schools but not in our hospitals. It is even
more interesting that there are mandatory standards for hospitals in
Scotland and Wales, and that much of the food offered in English
hospitals would not meet their standards. We need also a robust
inspection regime, although perhaps not too robust. Perhaps the CQC in
its regular inspections could simply sit down to lunch or dinner with
the patients and make an assessment. That should not impose too much
bureaucracy. It might cause some nausea.</hs_para>

of our first grandchild. I suppose that, because there are lots of
relatives on maternity wards who bring food, cakes and all sorts of
things, there might not be quite the same problem. However, I was very
impressed by two things. First, there was access to the kitchen on the
ward for patients and their families to make toast, warm drinks and so
on. Secondly, the food was very plentiful and nourishing, and a lot of
fruit was available. I am referring to a very large London teaching

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by congratulating my noble
friend on securing the introduction of this Bill, which seeks to set
standards for healthy and sustainable food in hospitals. The Government
warmly welcome the role that my noble friend’s Bill has played
in bringing this important issue to the attention of your
Lordships’ House. Few subjects matter more than food and drink.
Poor diet can cause serious illness and even increase the risk of early
death. My noble friend has a supporter here when she talks about high
standards. We both want nutritious food that meets the recovery needs
of patients and the health needs of staff and visitors, and sustainable
food that supports our farmers and accounts for the needs of our
livestock. Above all, we want tasty food that that looks good and is
available whenever it is needed. My noble friend and I are at one on
this.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000134">We
agree that more needs to be done to be certain that hospitals comply
with high standards. We are proposing a series of measures that include
instruction, incentives and inspection—the three Is. These build
on the work announced last year by my right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Health and will raise awareness and increase
transparency so that there can be no excuse for poor
food.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000135">The
cornerstone of this approach will be our hospital food standards panel,
under the chairmanship of Dianne Jeffrey, chairman of Age UK. The
panel, which I can tell my noble friend Lady Miller includes Sustain as
well as patient representatives and others, will start with the needs
of patients, especially older people. It will look at nutritional
quality, mealtime experience and the help given to patients to eat. It
will check the evidence on food production systems to understand how a
meal can leave the kitchen as an attractive, tasty dish, but arrive at
the patient cold and unappetising. Noble Lords who share my own
frustration when struggling with a sachet of sauce or pat of butter,
will be pleased to hear that the panel will not let such small details
escape their
scrutiny.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000136">The
panel will also consider sustainability. This year, around 80% of food
commodities purchased through NHS Supply Chain will be UK-produced, but
the panel will look at how we can further reduce our environmental
impact, including waste from food and food packaging. The panel will
also consider animal welfare.</hs_para>

my noble friend’s main concerns. However, our ambitions go
further. We have asked Dianne Jeffrey to consider food served to staff
and visitors, including food sold in vending machines. Noble Lords may
be surprised to learn that less than half of the food served in
hospital is eaten by patients. The majority goes to staff and visitors.
We must not neglect their
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000138">We have
a serious obesity problem in this country and so have a responsibility
to help people make healthier choices. That does not have to mean
banning chips and fizzy drinks, but should certainly mean delivering
healthier options to make it easier for people to choose healthily as
well as simple to understand information and labelling on
food—using the calorie labelling and front-of-pack schemes
increasingly evident on our high street and in
supermarkets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000139">This
is not about undermining personal autonomy. What freedom exists in
choosing between two meals if both are high in saturated fats and salt?
Where is the freedom in choosing between a standard chocolate bar and a
king-sized one? We are asking the panel to examine how the NHS can
increase choice, not reduce it, and enable informed
choice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000140">Twenty-one
trusts have committed to measures for encouraging healthier
restaurants, vending outlets and buffets under the responsibility
deal’s pledge on healthier staff restaurants. We want more to do
the same. How will we make all these things happen? Like my noble
friend, we have been frustrated to see continued variation in food
standards across our NHS. That is not because hospitals do not know
what good food looks and tastes like. Good guidance and standards
already exist, and the best hospitals are using them. For instance,
government buying standards for food and catering were introduced in
2011, covering nutrition, sustainability and animal welfare. We have
the British Dietetic Association’s guidance on nutritional
content of patient meals, and we have our own guidance on healthy
eating. So rather than produce new standards or guidance, our panel
will identify which existing guidance should apply as a matter of
routine, which should be aspired to as best practice and which should
be left for local determination.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110858000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000141">Standards are important
but compulsion, in our view, is not. There is no evidence that making
standards mandatory in Scotland or Wales has led to food that is any
better than in England. Indeed, patient satisfaction ratings with
hospital food in Scotland have actually gone down in recent years. Nor
should standards relate to whether food is prepared in-house or not.
Each NHS provider must decide for itself how to deliver its food
services. What matters is not who provides the meals or how but that
they are of high quality and meet the needs of patients. We are unaware
of any clear relationship between the quality of food and whether it is
cooked on-site or delivered frozen or chilled and regenerated. I agreed
with the noble Lord, Lord Rea, on that point. There are many ways to
produce food in hospitals. All can deliver good
food.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000142">We are
determined to make sure that this happens. However, this Government
have committed to creating new regulation only as a last resort, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, observed. Because of that, 
<?notus-xml column=471?>we have identified other, highly transparent ways of delivering the
change that my noble friend wants to see. Of course, legislation has a
role. All healthcare organisations must register with the Care Quality
Commission, whose powers are enshrined in law. The
department is updating the CQC’s registration requirements to
include new fundamental standards of care that all providers have to
meet, and the CQC is developing compliance guidance. We will ensure
that the work of the panel aligns with
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000143">Crucially,
we have asked NHS England to amend the NHS standard contract so that it
helps to deliver improvement. In the new contract, due out next month,
hospitals will be required to have regard to guidance on the provision
of catering services, including government buying standards for food
and catering. We will work with NHS England to ensure that the
panel’s work is appropriately highlighted in later contracts and
technical guidance. Commissioners of NHS-funded services have the power
to require remedial action to be taken where there is clear evidence
that providers are failing to meet the terms of the standard NHS
contract.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000144">There
are also incentives for excellence. Under the system of commissioning
for quality and innovation, which we call CQUIN, commissioners can
reward providers for delivering high food standards. For instance,
providers might be rewarded for improving food quality, or meeting
external standards such as those of the Soil Association’s Food
for Life Partnership.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110858000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000145">My noble friend also
calls for a new inspection regime. We can respond to her call in the
following way. The CQC has appointed Professor Sir Mike Richards as
Chief Inspector of Hospitals and he is establishing a robust system of
registration, regulation and inspection. The programme is not a rigid
one-size-fits-all process, but a more measured, risk-based approach.
This requirement has all the power of the Health and Social Care Act
2008—we do not need further
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000146">The
Care Quality Commission has pledged to start rating NHS acute trusts
and foundation trusts from December this year and aims to complete this
process before the end of 2015. It will introduce a more specialised
inspection model with a greater focus on culture and leadership and
teams that include clinical and other experts and people with
experience of care. It will use information and evidence in a more
focused and open way, including listening better to people’s
views and experiences of care in order to predict and respond more
quickly to services that are falling
short.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000147">However,
we need strong monitoring. We now review the food served in every
single NHS hospital via annual patient-led assessments of the care
environment —we call them PLACE inspections. This year, a small
army of more than 5,000 patient assessors, including a patient who is a
member of our panel, took part in PLACE assessments, including tasting
the food on offer. If the vegetables were overcooked, or the gravy was
cold, they reported it. If the custard was lumpy or the sandwiches dry,
they reported that too. Their feedback directly helps hospitals to
improve. As my noble friend said, there is no evidence of a direct link
between cost and the quality of food. We are looking further into this
to see if we can establish any link. Our PLACE inspections have given
us detailed information 
<?notus-xml column=472?>directly from patients, which will help us understand how good food can
best be produced without wasting
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000148">We also
use PLACE to record whether hospitals comply with recommended guidance.
We already ask about the government buying standard for food, and next
year we will ask about the Soil Association’s Food
for Life catering marks. Once the panel has reported, we will include a
question about other recommended standards. Commissioners and providers
together can use this information to improve services.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110858000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000149">We know that this
approach can work. In 2011, government buying standards for food and
catering services were launched. They were compulsory for central
government departments, but voluntary within the NHS. Yet already
around half of all hospitals comply, with another quarter pursuing
compliance. My colleagues at Defra are reviewing these standards, and
members of the panel are involved in that.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110858000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000150">My noble friend also
asked for action where hospitals fail to comply with standards. The CQC
already has these powers and can take action through civil enforcement
or under the criminal law. As I said, commissioners can also act where
the standard contract terms are breached by requiring providers to take
remedial action and, in the case of serious failures, they can escalate
that action. However, it is not just about punishment. What my noble
friend wants, quite rightly, is improvement. Our approach is designed
to achieve this, which is why PLACE requires hospitals to publish an
action plan to show how they will address any problems. This has
already started. In Sheffield, hospitals already score well on food but
plan to increase menu choice with a £7 million capital
development of their catering infrastructure. East Lancashire Hospitals
NHS Trust plans to review ordering systems and improve service delivery
by opening a second food production belt. It is also reviewing its
vending machines. These are tangible improvements, identified by
patients and planned and delivered locally. They are evidence of
success.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000151">The
noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, spoke about the sourcing of food, a subject
I mentioned a moment ago. He may like to know that some 60% of the food
ingredients supplied to the NHS is procured under contracts negotiated
at a national level by the NHS Supply Chain. It requires suppliers to
provide information on product quality and provenance and to have a
verification process in place. It is working with its contracted food
suppliers to identify products that meet the food GBS and make the
information available through its website. However, it is important to
remember that, under public sector procurement rules, the NHS cannot
promote or appear to promote a buy-British policy.</hs_para>

Cumberlege referred to the use and cost of nutritional supplements. It
is always better if patients can get the nutrients they need from
proper food rather than supplements—there is no argument about
that—but some patients cannot digest normal food, or need extra
calories, and they need supplements. The cost of £320 million
that noble Lords may have read about is actually related to spend in
the community, not in hospitals. It also includes the provision of real
food such as gluten-free bread or 
<?notus-xml column=473?>low-protein biscuits. I would not want noble Lords
to be misled by any press reports they may have seen on that
score.</hs_para>

causes, a theme that was taken up to the noble Lord, Lord Rea, but it
is most often seen in conjunction with other illnesses. The British
Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition estimated the cost in
2007 at more than £13 billion, but it did acknowledge that some
of these costs may be unavoidable. This is because serious illness and
injury will always result in loss of appetite associated with changes
in the body’s metabolism, which in turn results in tissue
breakdown and muscle loss. These costs are linked to malnutrition
rather than being direct costs, so they cannot be assumed to translate
into potential savings in the cost of care.</hs_para>

Rea, and my noble friend Lady Cumberlege referred to unhealthy foods
being served to patients, such as foods that are high in fat and salt.
The best food does no good if it is uneaten. For very ill patients who
cannot eat large amounts, it may be better for them to eat
high-calorie, higher-fat food. Our panel will work hard to strike the
right balance between long-term health needs and the short-term
requirement for high-calorie food. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, and
the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, referred to the problem we hear about so
often of food being left out of reach and patients not being given the
help they need. It is unacceptable for food to be left out of reach.
Where a patient is at risk of malnutrition, specific plans of care are
introduced such as serving food on a red tray, which signals to the
team that extra support is required. We support the notion of protected
mealtimes whereby all non-essential clinical practices are avoided
during those periods. Family members and volunteers who have
had additional training are often invited to help patients
with their meals.</hs_para>

want. This Government want food that boosts health and recovery, that
tastes good and impacts lightly on our environment. Our approach rests
on what I referred to earlier as the three Is: instruction, incentives
and inspection. Instruction is provided through registration standards
and the NHS standard contract, incentives via the CQUIN scheme and
inspection by PLACE and the CQC. These, we believe, are the way to
success.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_08_PT_1/5E4BC599EDE715FC969F87B6CA774FE09617D5F9" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 November 2013">Friday,

All Governments want to improve hospital food, but it is a question of
how that is done: how do we make it happen? We know that the NHS is
very good on policy, on discussions and on—what do
they say?—paralysis by analysis, but it is the implementation
that it is weak on, and that is what particularly concerns me about
hospital food. I have a quote from one of those years: “It is

catering staff, while in others there are dedicated catering staff who
have an absolute love of food, and you can see the difference. There
are merits in each of the different ways of approaching this, and that

Dholakia (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, my Bill is designed to raise this
country’s unusually low age of criminal responsibility from 10
to 12. At present, in England and Wales, children are deemed
to be criminally responsible from the age of 10. That means that
children who are too young to attend secondary school can be
prosecuted and receive a criminal record. A 10 year-old who
commits a “grave crime”—that includes serious
violent and sexual crimes but can also include burglary—can be
tried in the Crown Court. A child of 10 or 11 who is accused
with an adult will also be tried in the adult Crown
Court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000173">At
10 years old, the age of criminal responsibility in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland is the lowest in Europe. In Ireland, in 2006, the age
was raised to 12 with exceptions for homicide, rape or
aggravated sexual assault. In Scotland, in 2010, legislation provided
that children cannot be prosecuted below the age of 12. Outside the
British Isles, the age of criminal responsibility is invariably higher.
In France, Greece and Poland, it is 30. In Germany, Spain
and Italy, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, it is 14.

neurodevelopmental immaturity, during which children’s capacity

evidence from international research is overwhelming. Anyone who has
sat in youth justice courts or family courts and knows that it is
clearly demonstrated. It shows that children of 10 and 11
have less ability to think through the consequences of their actions,
less ability to empathise with other people’s feelings and less
ability to control impulsive behaviour. That does not mean that
children aged 10 or 11 have no responsibility for their
actions—that is not what I am trying to say—but on any
reasonable interpretation of the evidence, they must be regarded as
less responsible than an older adolescent or an

cannot be right to deal with such young children in a criminal process

employment, the age of consent to sexual activity or the age for
smoking and drinking—where we regard children is fully competent
to take informed decisions until later in adolescence. The age of
criminal responsibility is an anomalous exception. Ironically, a 30
year-old who had a mental age of a 10 year-old child would probably be
regarded as unfit to plead and yet, by some twisted freak of logic, a
child of 10 is seen as capable of participating in the criminal justice

is sometimes argued that there is no need to raise the age of criminal
responsibility because the number of 10 and 11 year-olds who receive
youth justice disposal is small—we are given the figure of about

<?notus-xml column=478?>2,000 a year, a very small number. Even though this represents a small
proportion of those going through the criminal justice system, however,
what happens to 2,000 vulnerable children can hardly be regarded as a
matter of little importance. The fact that the numbers involved are
relatively small is in fact a strong argument for the Bill; it means
that it will not be a huge burden in terms of resources to make
alternative provision through welfare interventions and, where
necessary, family court proceedings for the children who would
otherwise have been charged and prosecuted.</hs_para>

that dealing with these children through non-criminal processes would
put the public at risk. On the contrary, dealing with 10 and
11 year-old children through non-criminal procedures would
be more effective than using the criminal justice process. The evidence
shows that children who are dealt with through the criminal justice
process are more likely to reoffend than those who are diverted from
the criminal justice system and dealt with in other ways. Children who
are officially labelled as offenders often react by trying to live up
to the label and acting in increasingly delinquent ways to achieve
status in front of their friends. As the Centre for Social Justice
report put
it,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13110858000322" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000322">“raising
the minimum age of criminal responsibility would achieve important
changes. Young children would not be tarred with the stigmatising

neglected”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="13110858000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000182">This
is a particularly important point, as children who go through the
criminal process at a young age are often young people from chaotic,
dysfunctional and traumatic backgrounds involving some combination of
poor parenting, physical or sexual abuse, conflict within families,
substance abuse or mental health problems. The prospects for diverting
the child from offending will be far better if these problems are
tackled through welfare interventions than by imposing punishments in a
criminal court. A welfare approach would avoid unnecessarily giving
children a criminal record, which can make it harder for them to gain
employment when they reach working age. As unemployment increases the
chances of reoffending, this is another way in which criminalising
children can increase rather than reduce the likelihood of future
crime.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000183">Of the
10 and 11 year-olds who are charged and prosecuted each year, the

criminal responsibility will not increase the risk from these young
people.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000184">Some
people who generally support raising the age of criminal responsibility
argue that an exception should be made for the most extreme cases, such
as homicide or serious sexual offences. I am willing to consider this
point in Committee but at this stage my inclination is to resist making
any changes or exceptions. The most serious child offenders invariably
have the most complex welfare needs. Their backgrounds include
experiences of serious physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse
and neglect, parental mental illness, rejection and abandonment by
adults, traumatic loss, conduct disorder and serious emotional
disturbance.

children could really understand the complexities of a lengthy criminal
prosecution and trial, whether they should have appeared in the full
glare of media coverage, whether they understood all the issues and

in Europe. It should be equally unthinkable here. The two boys should
have been dealt with in family proceedings and detained in secure
accommodation, without all the ill effects that resulted from a public

punitive towards their children. The current age is counterproductive

reinforce those feelings of guilt in young children is unhelpful and
unkind. It is most encouraging that recently there have been indicators
that we are becoming more confident parents. This Government have
sustained the increasing reduction in the incarceration of children.
There has been a very impressive drop in the number of children locked
up in recent years. There has been a clear consensus that too many of
our children were being locked up. Furthermore, the right honourable
Iain Duncan Smith MP and Graham Allen MP have driven forward a much
increased awareness of the importance of early years and attachment to
their parents in young children and infants. Andrea Leadsom MP and
Frank Field MP have led a cross-party campaign to increase support
during pregnancy and in the months after birth to help build strong
family bonds. Her Majesty’s Government have charged Louise Casey
to meet the needs of trouble families, and the results have been very
successful. I feel that we are becoming more confident about our

They are quite likely to experience local authority care, to have a

gang, if they have not done so already. They are more likely to be

have such a low age of criminal responsibility? What does it matter
that so few children are being placed in custody now that the
Government have done welcome work to reduce custody use? Part of the
reason it is harmful is that it reinforces the sense of guilt that
these children have. For instance, many of these children will not have
a father in their families. They may well feel responsible for the loss
of their father. I heard yesterday of one of these children’s
parents having committed suicide. The question the children were asking
was, “What did we do wrong? How did we cause this?”. In
my own experience, I had a dearly loved housemaster at school who had
to move on to a new job. I remember wondering what wrong I had done to
drive him away. It is plain from my experience of looked-after young
people that many of them carry a heavy sense of guilt for things for
which they were never responsible. When one listens to adults who have
been through such experiences, they often have a sort of internal
monologue by which they are told, “You are worthless. You can
never do anything right”. If they do something well they will
find fault with it because they have a deep sense of guilt, perhaps
because if a parent does not love a child for whatever reason, the
child will not think, “Well, the poor old parent is addicted so
they cannot be around for me”. They will think, “There is
something deeply wrong with me that causes my parent not to love
me”. It is deeply unhelpful to reinforce children’s sense
of guilt at such a young

Lord Bishop of Derby:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Lord, Lord Dholakia, for introducing this topic and I heartily endorse
all that the noble Earl has said. This is a very complex issue, and we
are having this debate in a national context in which public opinion
wants justice to be seen to be done. A strong scapegoating mentality
exists which indicates that there is also a high level of anxiety in
society. The key people to be scapegoated tend to be criminals and
immigrants. We have to take that part of the context seriously in
having this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:53:06"></hs_TimeCode>.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:59:12"></hs_TimeCode> second
context, as we have heard, is the UN recommendation on the rights of
the child, that the age of criminal responsibility should be at least
12. Many countries, as we have heard, go even higher than that. A third
context is that 
<?notus-xml column=483?>there are suggestions, as there is in Ireland, of raising the age to 12,
but of allowing some flexibility in dealing with serious crimes. So
this is a very complex issue in an anxious society which is nervous
about seeming to give positive signals to bad behaviour and social
deviancy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:53:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

lines of approach. The Government, as I understand it from the briefing
papers, are minded to stay with 10 years because of the argument that
children at that age know what is right and what is wrong. That is one
way of looking at it. Opponents say that the evidence of emotional and
intellectual development means that children are too immature at the
age of 10, even if they know what right and wrong are. The noble Earl
eloquently mentioned the growth in maturity. I suggest that one of the
dangers in this whole debate is treating children as
individuals—which, of course, is a modern disease. Life is much
more complex than about any of us being an individual. The Centre for
Social Justice begins to recognise this. One of the arguments in its
book on raising the age is about the need for what it calls a
“whole family approach”, seeing the child in
context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:54:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000205">However,
as we have heard, family is not a positive context for many of the
children who become offenders. We have to consider the context of the
child as the key criteria for making an assessment, not treating them
as an individual. The noble Baroness talked in a previous debate about
her grandchild. My daughter has a young child who, as Christmas comes,
is more and more targeted through television adverts as an economic
unit at a very young age. That is just a little example of how children
are seen as individual people and economic
units<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:55:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000206">However,
of course no one is an individual—that is a modern myth. Each
human being is a person who is who they are because of their
relationships with others. Crime is when relationships go wrong or are
handled destructively. Human beings are formed through relationships. I
suggest that the key in assessing children and in finding an age on
which to hook criminal responsibility is not to treat them as
individuals, whether they have measureable psychology and development
or whether they know right or wrong. It is to look at what I call the
science of social formation, which is about where they are made a
person, where they negotiate that, or where they work out their
frustrations at not being the person they think they would like to be.
We need to consider a number of sites of social formation in a debate
such as
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:56:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000207">The
first site of social formation is the family. Tragically, as we have
heard, that is a weak link for many young people. The second site is
the school. Certainly in my work with schools in the city of Derby,
many young people who get drawn into crime have a very uneasy
relationship with school, so it ceases to be a good formational site.
Schemes of rehabilitation try to create opportunities for social
interaction, but they are undermined by lack of resources. As we have
heard on the mentoring of young men, the voluntary sector has an
important part to play. In that sector we can create sites of social
formation that are more fluid and flexible than the family or the
school, and which can operate in much more informal
ways<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:57:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

will give a small example of this. Last night I presented awards to
choristers who had achieved a certain standard of singing in church
choirs, many of whom were young people and children. We all know that
to sing in a choir is about learning discipline and accountability and
having a sense of achieving something for others. As we know, young
people get drawn in to gangs and peer groups, but that needs to be put
in a broader and bigger context. The voluntary sector has a lot of
resources to offer young people that broader context—often an
intergenerational one—which is a site of social formation that
is more mature, richer and more likely to help young people develop
responsible
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:58:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000209">We
should not, therefore, look at this age issue only in terms of the
young person being a moral agent or in terms of their maturity. We
should look at how they progress in terms of social relationships and
where there is support for that, and measurement. For instance, in the
church the age for confirmation is generally 11. Being the Church of
England, we allow all kinds of exceptions one way or the other; some
people might be in a strong Christian family at a younger age of nine
or 10. However, confirmation generally takes place at age 11 and above
because people are then in a secondary school environment, which is a
much richer social formation environment than primary school—a
much richer, more complex, more challenging one. That is where young
people need to be helped to grow and to be
accountable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T12:59:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000210">I
make a plea that we not be intimidated by the scapegoating mentality of
the wider society in which we sit, which forms a backcloth that might

as individuals, whether economic units, moral units or developmental

Christian gospel highlights the miracle of forgiveness, which we need
to remember in this debate—the possibility to join in a
different kind of set of social relationships that are more wholesome,
nourishing and flexible. For children, the promise and possibility of
forgiveness is very important. We have all done things when we were
small that we needed the chance to recover from, and that needs to be a
very important part of our calculations. If we are going to resist
scapegoating and objectifying and take the social context of the
formation of children seriously, and know that that, love and
forgiveness and another chance are what grow people into full human
beings, in the context of those things, I am minded to support the
noble Lord’s suggestion to move from 10 to 12 years, and I can
see lots of advances in perhaps raising the bar even higher one

in the other place that the way in which it treats its crime and
criminals is a true test of the civilisation of any country. I was
thinking about that when my noble friend shot my fox by mentioning the
report written by Professor Sue Bailey, who once briefed me on the
situation regarding the two people publicly pilloried over the years
for the killing of Jamie Bulger. Both boys were aged 10, but Professor
Sue Bailey told me that they had a developmental age of four. Bearing
in mind the background from which they came, that confirms everything

We should remember that the aims of that system are the prevention of
offending, safeguarding the public and the delivery of justice. The
relevant three questions are as follows. How culpable are young people
for the unlawful behaviour in which they engage? How competent are they
to participate in the criminal and youth justice systems as individuals
alleged of having committed a crime? What is the impact of involving
them in the criminal justice system as a whole? I think that there are
developmentally informed answers to each of these questions, combined,
as I have mentioned already, with an understanding of the
children’s rights that the United Kingdom has agreed to protect.
Examination of these issues confirms that the current age of 10 is far
too low to achieve either the stated aims or to satisfy the logic of

domains undergo substantial development during adolescence, which I

cognition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T13:05:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
First, I want to focus on executive functioning: that is, the skills
involved in the control and co-ordination of thoughts and behaviours,
including working memory, 
<?notus-xml column=486?>selective attention and inhibition of emotional
responses. They are used in everyday tasks such as decision-making,
problem solving, long-term planning and social interaction. The
evidence says that maturation of these is not completed until the age
of 18, and that on the way to that maturation there is the likelihood
of impulsivity, sensation seeking and risk-taking behaviours
—all the things that we experience in our own children and
grandchildren. As other noble Lords have said, that does not mean that
young people bear no responsibility for their behaviour but it does
mean that they are likely to be less
responsible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T13:07:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000217">The
noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, rightly mentioned the ability to take part
in the legal process, what is described as adjudicative competence,
fitness to plead and effective trial participation. We should think
through what that actually means. It means understanding the court
processes, charges, defences and their possible consequences, deciding
how to plead, challenging jurors, instructing lawyers, giving evidence
and responding to cross-examination. That is not just a list that I
have drawn up, it is the official list as laid down for adjudicative
competence. Pre-adjudicative competence was listed by the Home Office
in 2008 as including fitness to be interviewed and understanding the
purpose of interviews, the questions asked and the significance of
answers given. Do any of us think that at the age of 10 anyone is
capable of going through all that? What worries me about the present
Government is that not only is the age of 10 the age of criminal
responsibility but next week we start work on an anti-social behaviour

other noble Lords have said, there is a very high level of correlation

the prevention of offending, which is the aim of all this, depends, at
least in part, on effective action to tackle those deep-seated and
complex needs. To my mind, that points to addressing the welfare and
well-being of these young people rather than focusing first of all on
the punitive approach. As someone who cares very deeply about the

social, political, neurological and academic arguments on this

produced for us and explained powerful evidence for change. However,

debate is to be had, which is to be welcomed. This Bill is part of and
will lend impetus to the important discussion that needs to take place

need also to convince those who feel that it is not a right and just
way forward. It is without doubt a very important matter indeed and
noble Lords have made the case most powerfully. I am looking forward to
hearing what the Minister has to say and to the further debates that
will take place about the age of criminalisation as this Bill moves

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend Lord Dholakia for introducing the Bill and for giving us a
further opportunity to debate this important issue. I align myself with
the sentiments expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, who said
that this is a serious matter and a serious debate, and it is right
that we in this House, with our clear expertise, discuss this from both
sides of the argument. I pay tribute to my noble friend’s work
in this area and his continuing interest in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T13:12:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

outset—and the right reverend Prelate mentioned this—the
Government currently have no plans to raise the age of criminal
responsibility from 10 to 12. We believe that children aged 10 and
above are able to differentiate between bad behaviour and serious
wrongdoing and should therefore be held accountable for their actions.
When a young person has committed an offence, it is important that they
understand that it is a serious matter and will be dealt with as such.
The public must also have confidence in the youth justice system and
know that offending will be dealt with
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000224" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000224">As
several noble Lords have said, serious crimes committed by children are
mercifully rare and we do not want to see all 10 and 11 year-olds
prosecuted for minor offences. However, it is important to ensure that
serious offences can, where appropriate, be prosecuted and the public
protected. We are aware that offences committed by young people may
have a devastating effect on both victims and the wider community, and
it would be wrong to ignore this. The tragic case of the murder of
Jamie Bulger—which we all know so well and which my noble friend
mentioned—immediately comes to mind in this context.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110858000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000225">It is of key importance
that the youth justice system retains its ability to respond flexibly
and effectively to offences committed by young people, and this must
include the ability to make use of robust sanctions in the event of
serious offending. This includes the use of custody as punishment and
to protect the public where appropriate. Indeed, between 2002 and 2012,
13 10 and 11 year-olds received a custodial sentence.
However, 
<?notus-xml column=488?>setting the minimum age of criminal responsibility at 10 does not lead
to the prosecution of a large number of 10 and 11 year-olds. For
example, in 2012 only 262 10 and 11 year-olds were proceeded
against at court, compared with 859 12 year-olds. Of those
10 and 11 year-olds, 147 were given community sentences,
and the others were found not guilty, fined or given an unconditional
or conditional
discharge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T13:15:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

committed by those aged 10 or over will result in prosecution. We are
keen to ensure that, whenever possible, children are not prosecuted.
The principal aim of the youth justice system is to prevent young
people offending. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, referred to the
importance of early intervention. I reflect back to my maiden speech in
your Lordships’ House, which was on this very issue. I join the
noble Earl in paying tribute to the important work that people such as
Graham Allen are doing in this respect. The Government take note of it
and consider it at all
times<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T13:15:49"></hs_TimeCode>. I also
align myself with the noble Earl’s comments about the work of
both the previous Children’s Minister, Tim Loughton, and the
current Children’s Minister, Edward Timpson, and I will
certainly convey his remarks to them. I thank the noble Earl for his
kind remarks in this

Dholakia asked an important question about welfare. Legislation
requires courts to have regard to the welfare of all under-18
year-olds. Section 44 of the Children and Young Persons Act
1933 provides that every court, in dealing with a child or young person
brought before it, shall have regard to their welfare. This is
reinforced by detailed guidance contained in the sentencing guideline
<I>Overarching Principles—Sentencing Youths</I>, which sets out
for the courts the principles to be followed when sentencing under-18s.
This places a strong emphasis on the need to take into consideration
welfare issues and to use interventions that are most likely to prevent
reoffending<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T13:16:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Prelate the Bishop of Derby, in his most thoughtful contribution,
raised the concept of the science of social formation. He talked about
the importance of the three pillars of family, school and
rehabilitation. As a person of faith, I associate myself with the
sentiments that he expressed on the concept of forgiveness. He also
referred to his family and talked of his daughter’s child being
an “economic unit”, becoming a more active economic unit
when Christmas comes. I say to the right reverend Prelate that I have
two economic units at home, and they persist as such throughout 12
months of the year and not just at Christmas. However, that is perhaps

Dholakia talked about mental capacity. The sentencing guideline
<I>Overarching principles —Sentencing Youths</I>, to which I
referred, ensures that proper regard is had to the mental health and
capability of the young person, and to the learning disability,
learning difficulty, speech and language difficulty or any other
disorder, any of which is likely to affect the sentence. The guideline

criminal responsibility at 10 years of age also enables
offenders to be identified at an early stage. This allowed multi-agency
youth offending teams, which include representatives from 
<?notus-xml column=489?>health, housing, children’s services and education, to become
involved with the aim of putting interventions in place to address the
child’s behaviour. These interventions can include addressing
their attendance at, and attitude to, school, referral to a speech and
language therapist if there is an identified issue with communication,
and, finally, youth crime prevention programmes, which work to keep
young people away from

first-time offence, the police, in consultation with the youth

a young person aged 10 to 17. We also introduced this new out-of-court
framework for under-18s in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of
Offenders Act 2012, which came into effect for offences committed from
8 April 2013. This new framework simplified and rationalised the
previous framework to provide a flexible approach which allows for
professional discretion to apply the most appropriate disposal. That
did away with the escalator in the previous reprimand and warning
scheme, which forced further offending up the criminal justice system
regardless of the seriousness of the

youth caution may be given for any offence where the young offender
admits an offence or there is sufficient evidence for a realistic
prospect of conviction but it is not in the public interest to
prosecute. Youth cautions aim to provide a proportionate and effective
resolution to offending and support the principal statutory aim of the
youth justice system of preventing offending by children and young
people, a sentiment with which I know all noble Lords who have
participated
agree<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T13:20:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110858000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0001.htm#13110858000233">Where
a youth caution is given, the police have a statutory duty to refer the
young offender to the youth offending team. For a second or subsequent
youth caution or where a young person has previously received a youth
conditional caution, the youth offending team has a statutory duty to
carry out an assessment of the young offender and to consider putting
in place an intervention programme aimed at preventing reoffending. The
youth offending team may carry out an assessment and offer a
rehabilitation programme for a young person who has never received a

conditional cautions require young people to take responsibility for
their actions, including agreeing to conditions that require them to
put things right or seeking help for their behaviour. They provide an
opportunity in appropriate cases to achieve an early positive response
for those young people who are willing to admit their offending and to
comply with certain conditions. Like youth cautions, they aim to
support the principal aim of the youth justice system, which, again, I
reiterate, is to prevent offending by children and young people. For
example, they allow for a proportionate response in appropriate cases,
for offenders to make swift reparation to victims and communities, and
for offenders to be diverted at an early opportunity into
rehabilitative services, reducing  
<?notus-xml column=490?>the likelihood of
reoffending<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T13:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>. The
conditions that can be attached to a youth conditional caution must

made up of two specifically trained community volunteers and a member
of the youth offending team. The panel agrees a contract with the young
person, which may include reparation and interventions to address any
risk of reoffending. By holding the young offender to account for their
actions, the young person can find the process very
challenging<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-08T13:23:30"></hs_TimeCode>. In

to the debate. Every time I prepare my contribution, the first thing I
write mentally is the speech that the Minister is supposed to make, and
he has not disappointed me. Perhaps I can say very simply to him that
if this is good enough for the rest of Europe—many countries and
international examples have been cited—I think he needs to look
seriously at why we are falling behind on this issue. I will not be
making an inroad on the time of the House on a Friday afternoon when

Selsdon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, over my years in this House, I
have found that two subjects always come to the front and
the back of my mind at the same time. Those are privacy and freedom. If
we are not careful, we will find that legislation can handicap and
control us, bureaucracy takes over, and we lose that most critical
quality of individuality. For me, privacy in one’s own home is
as important as anything. It is for this reason that, over a period of
10 years, I introduced a Bill on powers of entry, not necessarily to
produce new legislation, but to bring forward regulations that would
forbid someone to go into a person’s home without permission or
without a court

you want to do something here, you start with a Starred Question, and
you have a little debate. Then you table a Question for Written Answer,

are seeking information. If you do not get it, you try a Private
Member’s Bill, which effectively opens up the issue for
discussion and debate. That is the purpose today. I am very grateful to
the Government for giving me permission to speak and to introduce the

telephone communications are commonly known as a nuisance phone calls.
I do not know who thought of the term “nuisance” first,
but that includes unsolicited live direct marketing calls, automated
recorded message calls and silent, abandoned calls. That is as if
people were entering your home without permission unless they have said
who they are. Many of these calls cause considerable distress. They
come under the control, indirectly or directly, of Ofcom. Recent
research by Ofcom of UK adults with landline phones found that 82% had
experienced a nuisance call over the four-week period of that research.
More than 54% reported experiencing a silent call and an estimated 17%
an abandoned call. Other research drew attention to the stress and
anxiety caused to many recipients by that invasion of privacy, as one
might call it, including a report that more than 3 million people were

is easily soluble by regulation. We have to bring in this great thing,
the European Economic Community. The principle at the moment is that if
you use Ofcom, you have a chance to say that you do not want nuisance
calls, but that does not actually help you very much. The purpose of
the Bill is to say that if you want to receive calls, you register with
Ofcom; if you do not want to receive calls, you do not do
anything. EC Directive 2002/58 states that it is up to
member states to decide whether they have an opt-in or an
opt-out policy for marketing phone calls. Therefore, the Bill does not

Now, is that Christian name the name of the young lady who is answering

because of a particular interest of mine arising from my
earlier role as vice-chairman of the Financial Services Consumer Panel.
We were dealing with PPI 
<?notus-xml column=495?>and pressed first the Financial Ombudsman Service
and then the FSA very hard to take action on its
mis-selling. We thought that we had achieved a lot when it was realised
that, while the product was not necessarily bad in itself, it was being
mis-sold. It took a long time to persuade people of that, but
when we had it was clear that a number
of them would get redress. I was therefore not ashamed but immensely
disappointed to discover that the unintended consequence of
that was this absolute barrage of phone calls; many noble Lords,
many of whom may not be here today, have
recounted stories of being offered money back

know—there was an exchange on this just yesterday—we are
quite chuffed that we have now got a similar move forward on the
ability of tenants and landlords who might have been mis-sold
something, or mistreated by a letting agent, to take that to an
ombudsman. That will become legislation and will come into force some
time in the coming year. However, I fear that the same lot of people
will again be after rich pickings and will start phoning up tenants and
landlords in the same sort of way. We cannot just deal with this

I draw particular attention to the all-party group that has been set up

said this week, I was struck by how much it chimed with much of what
the noble Lord has been saying. It has a list of 15 or 16

if he is happy to do that, because, speaking in my capacity as chair of
the StepChange debt charity, I have some thoughts about some of the
ways in which those who market and sell financial products prey on

The essence is straightforward, but if it is to be
done by a third party

Bill will have to deal with its rights and responsibilities. It may
increase the number of unsolicited calls because being on the list

If you are currently registered under the TPS, that does not prevent
you receiving calls that originate outside the UK. This is a well known
gap, and it is something that government has looked at from time to
time. When the Minister replies, I hope he will say where we are on

address firms getting access to consumer lists, whether they are opt-in

of the key problems of the current system is that the ICO and Ofcom

similar but different difficulties in this area. Between them, they

week.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000275" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0002.htm#13110858000275">These
reflect the clear fact that, despite the Privacy and Electronic
Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 being in place,
unsolicited marketing nuisance calls are a source of great annoyance
and inconvenience for consumers. Indeed, when I pick up a message which
starts, “That’s right!”, I am pretty certain that
it is not. I also may well ignore being instructed to press a certain
number to get further information. To many, however, and especially the
elderly and more vulnerable, as all noble Lords have said, this causes
confusion and great anxiety. I wish that there were a magic wand that
could be waved to eradicate the problem but, sadly, that is simply not
possible.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0002.htm#13110858000276">I
assure noble Lords that we are absolutely determined to take action on
this issue. That is why the Minister for Culture, Communications and
Creative Industries has initiated and led a serious of meetings over
the past 18 months which have brought together the key interested
parties to press for change. Unsolicited calls and texts are a problem,
but we have to be careful that, in dealing with this issue, we do not
harm the direct marketing industry, which is a legitimate industry that
provides employment and opportunities in support of our economy. The
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, made precisely that point. Direct marketing
can be beneficial for consumers—for example, calls from telecoms
or energy companies advising on better deals or tariffs potentially
save consumers money. An opt-in register, as in the Bill, would
severely constrain such activities. We must therefore consider the
matter carefully.</hs_para>

Government taking? From those meetings, we now have clearer and
improved guidance and information for consumers, to help ensure that
they are aware of where to go to register complaints on
regulators’ websites. I realise that, of course, to many of the
elderly this may not be an option, but this information is now more
consistent and readily available. The consumer organisation Which? has
also been engaged in the meetings and has developed a useful mechanism
on its website by which consumers are automatically directed to the
right place to access information as well as to make
complaints.</hs_para>

ensured that the monetary penalties that the Information
Commissioner’s Office and Ofcom can use have been increased and,
equally importantly, used more frequently to fine companies 
<?notus-xml column=498?>which break the regulations. We have made clear in tasking regulators
that, through robust action, they must send a clear signal that those
who flout the rules will be caught. We are pleased that, since January
2012, more than £2.3 million has been issued in fines and would
want to see more.</hs_para>

companies are also now named and shamed on the Information
Commissioner’s Office website, so that those who engage in poor
practice are made known to the public, as informed consumers are safer
consumers. There is also greater collaboration between regulators,
sharing knowledge and expertise to improve compliance throughout.
However, we are fully aware that much more needs to be done.
That is why our future proposals for nuisance calls were set out in our
strategy paper published on 30 July. These include legislating to
ensure that Ofcom can share information more easily with the
Information Commissioner’s Office. We will be implementing this
through a statutory instrument that will be laid shortly, with a view
to it coming into force by 6 April 2014 at the latest, if not
sooner.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110858000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-0002.htm#13110858000280">We
are also actively considering the scope to legislate to lower the legal
threshold the ICO needs to demonstrate before issuing a monetary
penalty, which the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, mentioned.
We are assessing the business case and the cost before we take action
on this. In view of the large number of nuisance calls relating the
payment protection insurance sector, which the noble Baroness, Lady
Hayter, referred to, we are also working closely with the Claims
Management Regulator. It is welcome to see that the CMR is taking
action against claims management companies which fail to comply with
the rules.</hs_para>

Bill is changing from the current opt-out requirement to an opt-in
system for unsolicited direct marketing calls. There is a feeling that
this is unlikely by itself to make an impact on the present situation,
as calls to consumers who are registered with the Telephone Preference
Service, provided they have not given explicit consent to receive such
calls, are already outlawed under the Privacy and Electronic
Communications Regulations. Germany has an opt-in system but, according
to a study in 2011 by trueCall Ltd, complaint levels are broadly
similar those in the UK. The Government’s view is that those
breaking the law by calling consumers registered with the Telephone
Preference Service are just as likely to ignore the law, regardless of
whether there is an opt-in or opt-out system. Tackling nuisance calls
would be better addressed by focusing on improving enforcement rather
than changing the nature of the register; legislation of this nature is
unlikely to be the answer.</hs_para>

continue to work with regulators, network operators, consumer group
representatives, interested Members of Parliament and Members of your
Lordships’ House to find solutions. A combined effort by all
parties is needed. This is now beginning to happen and we are ensuring
that work by the industry is also under way including, for example, the
ability to trace calls where the calling number is deliberately
withheld or spoofed. This will also help contribute towards achieving
more long-term solutions. We welcome the fact that TalkTalk last week
launched a network-level solution for its customers and that BT will be
displaying full call-line identification for incoming international
calls, where available, on its network by next autumn. Last week, the
Telephone Preference Service launched its accreditation scheme, TPS
Assured, which seeks to improve best practice among companies. We know
that there are already products on the market which can help consumers
filter calls. We are keen for the UK to take a lead in developing the
solutions that put the power in the hands of consumers. We are aware
that, as part of the joint action plan to tackle nuisance calls and
messages, which was launched by Ofcom and the Information
Commissioner’s Office in July, research is being undertaken to
see what further improvements can be made to the Telephone Preference
Service. All this is extremely welcome.</hs_para>

securing what my noble friend’s Bill seeks to achieve. We
already have regulations in place that protect consumers, so the focus
needs to be on better enforcement in support of them. In addition to
the measures noted earlier, we are actively considering proposals for
further reform. The recommendations of the report from the All-Party

forthcoming report of the recent CMS Select Committee inquiry will be
useful in informing further our thinking in this area. The work is

not know what these calls are. This is about the uncertainty and

Prevention (Norman Baker) has today made the following Written
Ministerial Statement:</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=31?><hs_para UID="13110856000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-wms0001.htm#13110856000019">A consultation on

role is to set the quality standards expected of organisations
providing forensic science services to the criminal justice system.
These standards help ensure the accuracy and impartiality of forensic
evidence used in police investigations and in court, protecting the
innocent from wrongful convictions and ensuring criminals are brought
to justice. To date, the Regulator has been successful in securing
uptake of these standards on a voluntary basis.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110856000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-wms0001.htm#13110856000021">However, our
discussions with the police, commercial forensic service providers and
the Regulator, taken alongside market developments and changes in
legislation, have indicated there is a risk that voluntary quality
standards might not, in the future, provide the high level of assurance
required for forensic evidence. For that reason we now propose
introducing stronger powers, including putting the Regulator’s
codes of practice, which set out the quality standards for forensic
science providers, on a statutory basis. It would then be mandatory for
every organisation carrying out forensic analysis for the criminal
justice system, including commercial providers to the police and to
defendants, and the police themselves, to meet these standards. There
has been support from the Regulator, many commercial providers and the
Science and Technology Select Committee for these proposals. This
consultation is an opportunity to seek wider views, before determining
the most effective and proportionate regulation system for forensic
science.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110856000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-wms0001.htm#13110856000022">A

2007, the previous Government abandoned the systematic collection of

Review of Education Capital, Sebastian James recommended that we put
this right. He proposed that we gather all existing local condition
data into a central database. In July 2011, I announced that we would
start work immediately to collect up-to-date information on the
condition of school buildings by re-surveying the estate.</hs_para>

this by Autumn 2013. In order to make this achievable we looked to use
locally prepared data where it was believed to be up-to-date and of
good quality. Approximately 90 local authorities submitted local
condition surveys for analysis on that basis.</hs_para>

my Department to extend its central surveys to cover all schools for
which local authorities have supplied data. This means undertaking an
additional 8,000 surveys, which will take approximately a further eight
months to complete. By next summer we will have collected up to date,
reliable and validated condition information for the entire schools
estate. My intention remains to target funding to where it is most
needed and I will use the information from the surveys to do that from
2015-16.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110856000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131108-wms0001.htm#13110856000033">Proceeding

Warsi:</Member> The special collections are public records as defined
in the Public Records Acts (PRA). No decisions have yet been taken on
transferring these records to The National Archives (TNA). Under the
PRA, Section 3, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is
responsible for selecting, appraising and releasing its records under
the guidance and supervision of TNA. Currently, the special collections
are retained by the FCO under a legal instrument granted by the Lord
Chancellor. The current period of retention (which expires in December
2013) has been granted in order to provide the FCO with time to prepare
the detailed inventory and a prioritised plan for the preparation of
special collection record series for transfer to The National Archives
(TNA). The FCO will present this draft plan to the Lord
Chancellor’s Advisory Council on National Records and Archives
at the Council’s meeting on 14
November.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">

quarterly reports on the Iranian nuclear programme make clear, Iran
continues to install centrifuges at an alarming rate, in violation of
United Nations Security Council Resolutions. Iran has installed more
than 7,000 new centrifuges in the last year alone, bringing its total
number of centrifuges to in excess of 19,000. This includes 1,000 more
advanced centrifuges, capable of enriching at a significantly faster
rate. Iran currently has no credible civilian use for the large
quantities of enriched material that it already has, let alone what it
might be able to produce in the near future should it decide to do so.
We hope that the negotiations between the E3+3 (made up of the UK,
along with France, Germany, Russia, China and the US) and Iran will
soon lead to Iran taking concrete steps to address international

under-18 Young Offenders Institutions (YOI) and Secure Training Centres

from an

under-18 YOIs, Prison Service Order 1215 “Professional
Standards: Preventing and Handling Staff Wrongdoing” sets out
the mandatory requirements and guidance on preventing wrongdoing,

with the organisation outside of their particular business area. The
procedure is communicated to all new staff as part of the Initial
