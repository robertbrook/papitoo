showcase Glasgow to the world. Following my recent meeting with Gordon
Matheson of Glasgow city council, I am left in no doubt that the games
will provide a long-lasting legacy of which the people of Glasgow can
be proud. The United Kingdom Government are taking every step to
promote the business opportunities that the games present, and I should

That is a real and deep concern for households across the country and
that is why the Government have taken action on a number of fronts.
This year, 230,000 homes will be warmer because of the increased energy
efficiency measures that we support and 2 million vulnerable households
will get help under the warm home discount. That is £135 off
electricity bills for some of the poorest pensioners. The ongoing

Gentleman says. The facts are these: under the control order regime,
seven people absconded under control orders. Control orders were being
endlessly hacked away at by the courts, so we needed to put a new
system in place—a system that has the confidence of the police
and the security services. Of course we will look at every single thing
we can do to make sure the system is as good and robust as it can be,
but we in this House should be frank that we are dealing with people
who we are not able to charge and lock up, many of whom we would like
to throw out of our country but currently cannot. We have to have some
sort of regime like this, but we will do everything we can to make it

shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy and, in particular, the
aircraft carrier
project.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0001.htm#13110656000189">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T12:36:15"></hs_TimeCode>
the House will know, the previous Government entered into a contract
with the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, an industrial consortium led by BAE
Systems, to build two 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers—the largest
ships in the Royal Navy’s history. In the strategic defence and
security review 2010, the incoming Government, faced with the challenge
of dealing with a £38 billion black hole in the Ministry of
Defence budget, was advised that under the terms of the contract it
would cost more to cancel the carriers than to build them. The Public
Accounts Committee has subsequently described that contract as
“not fit for purpose” and identified, in particular, the
misalignment of interests between the MOD and the contractors,
manifested in a sharing arrangement for cost overruns which sees, at
best, 90p of every pound of additional cost paid by the
taxpayer, and only 10p paid by the contractor, as the root cause of the
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T12:37:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0001.htm#13110656000190">I
agree with the PAC’s analysis. In 2012, I instructed my
Department to begin negotiations to restructure the contract better to
protect the interests of the taxpayer and to ensure the delivery of the
carriers to a clear time schedule and at a realistic and deliverable
cost. Following 18 months of complex negotiations with industry, I am
pleased to inform the House that we have now reached heads of terms
with the alliance that will address directly the concerns articulated
by the PAC and
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T12:38:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Under
the revised agreement, the total capital cost to Defence of procuring
the carriers will be £6.2 billion, a figure arrived at after
detailed analysis of costs already incurred and future costs and risks
over the remaining seven years to the end of the project. Crucially,
under the new agreement, any variation above or below that price will
be shared on a 50:50 basis between Government and industry, until all
the contractor’s profit is lost, meaning that interests are now
properly aligned, driving the behaviour change needed to see this
contract effectively
delivered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T12:38:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0001.htm#13110656000191">The
increase in the cost of this project does not come as a surprise. When
I announced in May last year that I had balanced the defence budget, I
did so having already made prudent provision in the equipment plan for
a cost increase in the carrier programme above the
£5.46 billion cost reported in the major projects
review 2012 and I did that in recognition of the inevitability of
cost-drift in a contract that was so lop-sided and poorly
constructed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0001.htm#13110656000192">I
also made provision for the cost of nugatory design work on the
“cats and traps” system for the carrier variant operation
and for reinstating the ski-jump needed for short take-off and vertical
landing operations. At the time of the reversion announcement, I said
that these costs could be as much as £100 million; I am pleased
to tell the House today that they currently stand at £62
million, with the expectation that the final figure will be lower

the commercially sensitive nature of the negotiations with the Aircraft
Carrier Alliance, I was not able publicly to reveal these additional
provisions in 
<?notus-xml column=252?>our budget, since to do so would have undermined our negotiating
position with industry. However, the MOD did inform the National Audit
Office of these provisions, and it is on that basis
that it reviewed and reported on our 10-year equipment plan in January
this year.</hs_Para>

am therefore able to confirm to the House that the revised cost of the
carriers remains within the additional provision made in May 2012 in
the equipment plan; that as a result of this prudent approach, the
defence budget remains in balance, with the full cost of the carriers
provided for; and that the centrally held contingency of more than
£4 billion in the equipment plan that I announced remains unused

shipbuilding order to fill that gap, the MOD would be required to pay
BAE Systems for shipyards and workers to stand idle, producing nothing
while their skill levels faded. Such a course would add significant
risk to  the effective delivery of the T26 programme, which

variant of the River class and including a landing deck able to take a

anyway have had to make to keep the yards idle, is less than
£100 million, which will be funded from budget held within the

Clyde. It will sustain around 1,000 jobs as the carrier construction
work reaches completion, secure the skills base there and ensure the

Type 26 ships, which will have to be built to a very tight budget and a
very tight timetable, was made by the company—endorsed by the
MOD, but made by the company. I can tell him, as I think I said in the
statement— 
<?notus-xml column=262?>or, certainly, as the Prime Minister said earlier on—that 940 job
losses are anticipated at Portsmouth between now and the end of 2014
as a result of the decision to end shipbuilding.
About 11,000 jobs in the dockyards and the supporting infrastructure
will
remain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000265" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0001.htm#13110656000265"><Member ContinuationText="Sammy Wilson" PimsId="4642" UID="13110656000606" xid="915" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0001.htm#13110656000606"><B>Sammy

number of workers who are nominally based on the Clyde are being bussed
on a daily basis to Rosyth to boost the work force during the carrier
assembly phase, so the announcement made by BAE Systems should be read
in that context. My understanding from Babcock is that the yard at
Rosyth has a bright future with private sector work—offshore
work—as well as with the programme to assemble both the Queen
Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales, which itself will keep the yard busy

consolidation of the shipbuilding industry is not a single event; it is
a process that has been going on for decades, and the absorption of VT
by BAE Systems was part of it. I am afraid that the inexorable logic,
given the size of the Royal Navy and the budget we have for building
new ships, is that we can support only one naval shipbuilding location

Successive UK Governments have failed Scotland and have failed
shipbuilding, against a background of more than 100 ships being built
in Norway last year. The little that remains in Scotland, as we know
from Lance Price’s diaries, is due only to a strong SNP and our

shipbuilding out of Scotland finally and would be the last nail in the
coffin of the industry. Today, we have announced that the Clyde will

around to support that industry, and that we will place new contracts
to support the yard and ensure that it maintains the skills to build

the Bill is to help to reduce nuisance calls. The issue is significant
and should not be underestimated. My constituents in the Vale of
Glamorgan and others across the country are fed up with the menace of
nuisance calls. They are annoyed about receiving unsolicited telephone
calls trying to sell them gas or electricity that they do not want, or
financial services or holidays in which they have little interest. They
do not want to claim for mis-sold payment protection insurance on a
loan that they never had, nor do they want to sue the local authority
for an accident that never occurred or a buy a boiler from a company
they have never heard of.</hs_Para>

constituents are subject to frequent telephone calls offering those
services and more against their will. BT reported that it received
50,000 calls in one month to its nuisance call bureau, yet only a
fraction of that number of complaints is made formally to Ofcom or to
the Information Commissioner’s Office. I suggest that that is
because of the difficulty of the process, and a large part of that is
due to the problem of identifying the marketing organisation that makes
the call. Enough is enough. Credit must be given to the consumer
organisation, Which?, which was amongst the first to highlight the
problem. The Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the
hon. Member for Wantage (Mr Vaizey), too, should take credit for taking
significant steps to help to tackle the issue, leading to hefty fines
for some companies levied by Ofcom and the Information Commissioner.
More action needs to be taken, and legislation needs to be changed if
that action is to occur. The Minister has made a commitment to publish
a strategy document later this year, which shows the high priority that
he gives to the issue.</hs_Para>

parliamentary group on nuisance calls published a report last week with
16 recommendations aimed at combating the problem. There were two key
themes. The first focused on third-party consent, and my hon. Friend
the Member for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart), co-chair of the
all-party parliamentary group, sought to make progress on that with his
private Member’s Bill last Friday. The second theme relates to
caller identification, which is covered by my Bill. The measure will
help people to take action against such calls. It will enable them to
complain effectively when a nuisance is caused that could lead to fines
and penalties, subject to Ofcom and ICO investigation. It will also
allow people to choose whether or not to answer the phone. My
constituents want to live in peace and answer the telephone to friends,
family and others to whom they choose  to
talk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000315">Much
of the difficulty derives from the fact that it is nearly impossible to
tell who is calling, in spite of the fact that the caller ID facility
is widely available. That is 
<?notus-xml column=271?>largely because marketing organisations choose to withhold their number.
Legislation and guidance already exist to allow individuals to opt out
of receiving marketing calls. Constituents can register with the
Telephone Preference Service, effectively advising marketing companies
that they are not permitted to call without prior consent. In theory,
that should stop the vast majority of calls and allow complaints to be
made against companies that break the code. However, it is almost
impossible to complain about an organisation breaching the rules
without knowing its identity. That is the position in which many
constituents find themselves as a result of withheld
numbers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000316">Under
the code, the organisation should identify itself at the outset of a
call. However, if a company breaks the rules by calling a
TPS-registered number in the first instance they are highly unlikely to
adhere to the condition that requires identification to the person
answering the call, particularly if that person is
irritated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000317">When
the caller ID facility became available during the early ’90s a
few organisations withheld their number. In general, that was limited
to the police, medical organisations and charities such as those
supporting victims of domestic violence. Now, however, a significant
proportion of marketing organisations choose to withhold their number,
making the choice of whether to answer the call almost impossible, but
also making it extremely difficult to make a complaint to Ofcom or the
ICO.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000318">One
of my constituents, Mr Haynes from Cowbridge, simply refuses to answer
any call when the number is withheld in the expectation that it is a
marketing call. As a result, he could well be ignoring calls from his
local police station or GP practice. I have also found it difficult to
contact him from the parliamentary estate, because the parliamentary
system withholds the telephone
number.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000319" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000319">Requiring
all non-domestic callers to display their numbers unless they have good
reason not to do so, as in the examples I have already mentioned, will
help people such as Mr Haynes and millions across the country to take
action against those who call against the rules. In the Bill, I propose
that Ofcom be required to consider applications for exemptions. The
general rule should be that the organisation, whether public or
private, would have to disclose their number unless there is a good
reason why they should not do so. I have already mentioned the police
and domestic violence charities, and there may well be others that need
to be considered, but they should be seen as the exception rather than
the general rule.</hs_Para>

requires telephone network operators to make the caller ID facility
available free of charge. I was alarmed to hear some weeks ago that if
a customer did not sign up to an annual contract two major UK telephone
network operators would charge for adding that facility. That is simply
unacceptable. It effectively charges a customer who has been plagued
with nuisance calls to complain about breaches to the code. When the
issue was scrutinised in the all-party parliamentary group’s
evidence session, one operator sought to excuse the policy, and
suggested that it could have arisen as a result of additional energy
costs in displaying caller ID. We rejected that absolutely, and we
received widespread support for doing so, including from mobile
operators that provide the facility free of charge. I was pleased to
hear Ofcom’s strong response, and I hope that operators will
reflect on its comments, as well as those by all parties present at the
all-party group.</hs_Para>

make a significant difference to constituents across the country. It
will allow responsible organisations that adhere to the respective
codes to continue their work. It will put much of the control back in
the hands of the receiver of the call. They can choose whether to
answer it, and report breaches to the ICO or Ofcom. Of course, it may
take time for the Bill to become law, but in the interim, I urge
non-domestic callers to display their number voluntarily. It would be a
simple action that would gain much respect from the public. In that
vein, I appeal to network operators not to charge customers to use the
caller ID facility and to review their policy. The impact of not doing
so would be to charge customers to make a complaint about nuisance
calls. Offering the facility would offer the network operator a
marketing advantage.</hs_Para>

small part of helping to combat the issue of nuisance calls, and I am
pleased to have the support of Members from all parts of the House, It
is a Bill that has little financial consequence, but which could have a
significant benefit for many of our constituents. Many of those who are
at home during the day, particularly the elderly and the most
vulnerable, are plagued by nuisance calls. I urge hon. Members to
support the Bill.</hs_Para>

the outset I want to deal with a few of the myths that the Government
have resorted to peddling in the absence of any credible policies of
their own and because they are confused about how to respond to our
proposals. The first myth is that the price freeze cannot or will not
happen or that the idea is a con. Let me tell the House that there is
only one situation in which this price freeze will not happen: if the
Conservatives or Liberal Democrats  
<?notus-xml column=274?>win the next election. If we are elected, this price freeze will happen.
The idea that a price freeze will not work if wholesale prices increase
is complete and utter
rubbish<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T13:52:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000338">As
the energy companies themselves admit, they are not buying today all
the energy they need to supply their customers tomorrow. They buy their
gas and electricity two, three or even four years before it is
supplied, precisely in order to manage the risk of fluctuation in
wholesale prices. The Secretary of State must know this, so the
Government’s argument does not stand
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T13:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000339">The
second myth is that companies will undermine the freeze either by
hiking up their prices beforehand or by increasing them afterwards, but
as I asked the Secretary of State at the last Energy and Climate Change
questions, if companies collude to increase their prices beyond
anything that can be justified before the next election, will he stop
them? If he will not, let me be clear: we will take action. As for what
happens after the price freeze ends, the reason it lasts for 20 months
is that that is how long we think it will take to enact our reforms to
overhaul this market. By that point, we will have a new regulator in
place, with the power to force companies to cut their prices when
wholesale costs fall, which will prevent the kind of mark-up and
overcharging that we all know is happening. This price freeze will
happen and it will

Labour Administration who—the House might
recall—introduced winter fuel payments, which the current
Secretary of State described at the times as a gimmick, insulated over
2 million homes through Warm Front and lifted over 1.5 million people
out of fuel poverty. Before Labour came to power, consumers could not
even switch electricity supplier. As he knows, the restriction on
suppliers also being generators was removed in 1993, under the previous
Conservative Government, which led to the vertical integration we have
seen over the past two decades. If the Secretary of State wants to

important for Governments to step in, because failing markets do not
provide competition or the security that people want

though the price freeze is, it is not the only part of the package
before the House today. There is widespread agreement that
Britain’s energy market is neither as competitive nor as
transparent as it should be. There are two connected reasons for that.
The first is the vertically integrated structure of the big six energy
companies. The principle underpinning privatisation was that supply
companies would compete with each other to drive down generation costs
and keep prices efficient, but today all the big six energy companies
both generate and retail power. Collectively they supply over 98% of
the retail market and account for 70% of electricity generation. The
problem is that if suppliers are also generators, what incentive is
there to keep wholesale costs down if the effect is to reduce the
profits of the company as a whole? While energy companies often claim
that their profit margins are only 5%, they omit to mention that their
profits on generating electricity are, on average, closer to
20%.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110656000376" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000376"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T14:08:54"></hs_TimeCode>The
second connected problem is that if the big six can supply most of
their customer base from their own power stations, there is little
incentive to trade on the open market. It is not possible to determine
what physical volumes of gas and electricity are traded within
vertically integrated companies as that information is never disclosed,
and the prices they charge themselves are never published, but
according to the London Energy Brokers Association just 6% of energy is
traded on the open market. That makes it difficult for independent
generators to secure long-term deals to sell their output, which in
turn inhibits future investment. At the same time, independent
suppliers are prevented from expanding and new suppliers are deterred
from entering the market because they find it difficult to access
forward contracts that provide the volume and shape to meet their
customers’ needs.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110656000377" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000377">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T14:09:47"></hs_TimeCode>
is why the motion proposes two fundamental changes to the way in which
the market works at the moment. First, it would force the big six
energy companies to ring-fence their generation businesses from their
supply businesses. This would counter the natural conflict of interest
within vertically integrated companies and ensure that the interests of
supply businesses are better aligned with those of their customers in
enabling them to seek out the best possible prices. It would also
prevent self-supply, which, in turn, should increase the 
<?notus-xml column=279?>volume of energy being traded openly and create a more competitive and
transparent market. If the Secretary of State disagrees, will he
explain how the public interest is served by allowing energy companies
to generate energy and supply it to themselves at a price that is never
disclosed, and in a way that makes it almost impossible for other
players to get a foothold in the market? How does that help consumers,
how does it help competition, and how does it increase transparency? If
he does not disagree, why will he not back our proposal, or what is his
alternative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T14:10:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T14:10:50"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000378"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Davey" PimsId="2851" UID="13110656000685" xid="154" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000685">Mr

retail sides. We have said in this House—I will obviously send
this information to the Secretary of State—that we need to
create, as we did with the networks, a separation in relation to the
way in which the companies run things. That does not necessarily mean
having two companies, but it does mean having two different legal
entities. The Secretary of State is, in effect, saying, “Oh,

the moment, poor liquidity is recognised as the single biggest obstacle
to improving competition in the energy market. If all electricity had
to be traded via an open exchange, or a pool, that would create a level
playing field that would enable any market participant to compete on
price in order to retail power to the public. This would be different
from the previous pool in two important respects. First, under the
previous pool there were only two generators, who were therefore able
to exert considerable influence on the market price and, indeed, to
ratchet it up over time. Today, there are many more generators.
Secondly, when the old pool was originally established in 1990, only
generators were able to place bids, which again gave them excessive
market 
<?notus-xml column=281?>power. Today, there is no reason why a two-way pool, with generators and
suppliers both placing bids, could not be introduced. Indeed, if
the Government look around the world, at the Nord
pool in Scandinavia or the power exchanges in the United States, they
will see plenty of examples of markets with more exchange-based trading
of this kind that are more liquid, more transparent, and encourage
greater
competition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110656000395" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110656000395">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T14:17:15"></hs_TimeCode>
course, we should do this in the most cost-effective way. Given the
volumes that are already being traded on the day-ahead exchange, we
would be open to creating a pool by requiring all generators and
suppliers to trade 100% of their output on the N2EX exchange. If the

Opposition know that the first and last test of economic policy is
whether living standards are rising for ordinary people. Today, the
House faces a choice: a choice between whether it is people’s
bills that will be frozen this winter or their homes; a choice between
whether we reform broken markets or defend them; a choice between
whether we stand up for the 60 million people who live in this country
or the big six energy companies, for the 2.4 million businesses or the
big six energy companies. The reality is that if we do not fix this
broken market, nobody else is going to. Today, in this House, we have

Lady is right that the big six can sell it to themselves, but
independent generators cannot do so—they must sell it to someone
else. That is a big risk for the independent generators, and they need
to be able to cover it. Primarily, they do so at the moment through
purchase power agreements or through bilateral trades, which are used
mainly when selling to businesses. However, they say that they cannot

generators face another risk. The question is not only whether they can
sell energy, but whether they can buy it. If they have a contractual
power purchase agreement and their generation capacity is not working
for a particular month and they are unable to supply, they fail their
contract. To be able to enter more contracts and expand their
businesses, they therefore need to know that they can buy energy in the
wholesale markets if their generating capacity is not
working.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110677000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110677000073">It
is therefore essential that we have a liquid market for four months,
six months and 24 months ahead. Guess what? The previous Government did
nothing to enable that competition in generating markets.
Interestingly, the policies the Opposition have proposed today will
also do nothing about the real problem. The description that the right
hon. Lady gave of her policies proves that point. If she had read the
document, she would have seen on page 8 the analysis by
Ofgem—working on all the contributions from the independent
suppliers and all the people in the industry—is that the problem
she has identified is no longer a problem. It has marked that problem
“green”. The problems that we have identified, which we
and Ofgem are fixing, are all marked “red”. She really
needs to do her homework. There is no point the official Opposition
coming to this House with ill-thought-through policies that will not
work. Our policies will work for the consumer, push competition into
the market and get prices
down.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110677000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110677000074"><B><Member ContinuationText="Neil Carmichael" PimsId="5604" UID="13110677001173" xid="1191" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0002.htm#13110677001173">Neil

its proposals for a market maker, which will ensure transparency so
there are none of the secret deals that the right hon. Lady keeps on

producing the competition proposals and they are coming into force.

nuclear projects, renewables projects and in due course, I hope, carbon
capture and storage. If companies looking to invest in those areas
think that the terms under which they might invest could be changed
retrospectively to their disadvantage, they will move away from the UK.

price of gas, which is beyond—I believe—even the control
of the right hon. Lady and Governments of any colour. The International
Energy Agency says that we are moving into a golden age of gas, but it
warns us not to assume that it will be cheap, as countries such as
Japan and Germany move from nuclear to gas and growth in China and
India means a greater demand for gas there as well. Those will remain
the issues really determining
prices.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:17:37"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

policy is based on a deliberate falsehood about the causes of energy
price increases and would be counter-productive, even if companies did
not increase their prices to take account of it. It might play well
with focus groups and work as a short-term political initiative, but it
will do massive long-term damage to our ability to attract investment
into the country, and in the process will do massive long-term damage
to consumers, who will end up picking up the tab.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:18:11"></hs_TimeCode>That is

what do we do? First, we need to have an honest debate about the
factors driving up prices and to link that with an understanding of the
long-term investment we need in this country and how we are going to
secure it. As the Secretary of State said, we need once more to take
politics out of energy policy, just as John Hutton and Malcolm Wicks
did and as we tried to do in the early years of this Government. That
is an important objective in its own right. We also need action now on
the changes that Ofgem is proposing. These decisions should be taken by
the regulator, not by politicians. One of the changes that we have made
is to say that the Government should set the policy framework and that
a robust regulator should then deal with how the
market operates, rather than having politicians constantly
wanting to be regulators as well as policy makers.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:19:27"></hs_TimeCode>We also need to
focus on ease of switching, and we need to do more to ensure that

I want to talk about what we in the Government can do to reduce the
impact on bills. We could take some of the extra charges off the bills.
In this regard, I have some sympathy with the amendment tabled by the
Scottish nationalists. There are two elements of our energy bills that
are highly regressive. The charges are borne by consumers including
those on the lowest incomes, but the benefits often go to those on much
higher incomes. They relate to energy efficiency and to feed-in tariffs
for microgeneration, and I hope that the Government’s review of
those policies will look at what could be done to fund those areas out
of general taxation. They are good, important policies that we should
support, but the way in which they are paid for at the moment means
that people on the lowest incomes are paying a disproportionate amount
towards their
delivery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:20:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government have rightly decided to review that matter, and I hope that
that will offer some early relief for consumers.</hs_Para>

is an important debate. We need to get away from the simplistic
measures proposed in the Opposition’s motion. We also need to
take this opportunity to have a debate about this country’s
long-term energy needs, and about how we are going to meet security of
supply requirements in a low-carbon way and, above all, in a way that
will keep energy affordable now and into the

is refreshing that we are here talking about reducing energy prices. In
a lot of energy debates, I usually go through the Division Lobbies
trying to stop the Opposition from increasing energy prices. We have
divided, for example, on the decarbonisation target and on a perfectly
respectable and reasonable proposal from the Minister of State,
Department of Energy and Climate Change, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) to reduce the solar
tariff from six times grid parity to four times grid parity. As I
mentioned earlier, Labour tabled an amendment in the House of Lords

decrease bills.</hs_Para>

I explore that further, let me highlight an inconvenient truth that is
at the heart of this debate. That inconvenient truth is comparability
with other countries in the EU. I heard the shadow Secretary of State
make two observations about other EU countries. I think she said that
Spain already had a cap. That is true; she is right. Spain’s
energy prices, however—for gas and electricity—are higher
than ours. I do not think there is much point in having a cap if energy
prices are higher than ours. The right hon. Lady also mentioned
Scandinavia and its pool as a model for her pool. Again, if she looks
at the gas and electricity prices in Denmark and Sweden, she will see
that they are the highest in the EU—considerably higher than
ours. We need to be careful, therefore, to look at these things in the

we should evaluate them on the basis of their return on capital
employed. A margin of 4% is a huge margin for a foreign exchange dealer
and for a petrol retailer, but a very small margin for any other
retailer. When someone asks if £7 million a day is too much
profit or too little, that is a very hard question to answer. The big

and Germany reining back—unabated building of coal-power
stations and vetoing the emissions trading system and all that goes
with that—it is not reasonable for us to be constrained by
unilateral carbon leadership. If we are going to do that, we need to be
honest about the cost. Frankly, too often people say some of these

unlikely; it is quite unlikely that we will discover we have to do

am a customer of British Gas, although perhaps not for much longer. To
be fair to the CEO, Sam Laidlaw, he has decided not to take his bonus
this year. I hope that others will listen and follow suit, because it
is immoral that these companies are saying, “We are making only
a modest amount” yet they are paying themselves more than a
modest bonus out of their profit. They tell us that the internal market
between generation and retail is working okay and that they are

energy market is flawed, as Government Members have actually agreed.
The Secretary of State, who made an appalling speech and left quickly,
did not tackle the issues at all and did not come up with any
suggestions. He said that the Government were doing things for the
consumer, but the reality is that the Select Committee and others have
been lobbying hard for Ofgem, the regulator, to help the consumer. It
is doing slightly more but not enough—and it is too late. It is
a disgrace that the Secretary of State leaves so quickly after making
so many interventions in this debate—he is not even prepared to
sit there. The energy team has been reduced by half a Minister, as one
of them is doing a job share with the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, yet the Secretary of State cannot sit down
there. Instead he has to get a Whip to sit on the Front Bench because
the team has been depleted. Energy is at the top of people’s

in Britain are paying more because of what this Government have done

Munt</B> (Wells) (LD):</Member> Labour's 20-month price freeze has hit
the headlines and will prove superficially popular with the voters, but
there are many reasons why it will not work, much as we all want to
reduce people’s bills. It is a hopeless strategy to try to
control the sales price of businesses that have volatile raw material
costs, because prices will go up before the freeze as companies try to
hedge against the risks of a Labour election win. In fact, that has
probably already begun. Prices will go up again after the freeze as
companies seek to recover any losses that they think they have
sustained.</hs_Para>

freeze prices will stay artificially high even if raw material costs go
down. Having begun to take the drug of price fixing it would be hard to
kick the habit after 20 months. Why not 24 or 30, or doing it again the
following winter, or the one after that? The proposal risks further
damage to the market as a result of uncertainty, which may well spread
to other industries. There would be huge political pressure to freeze
prices in other sectors, risking further chaos and a return to the
situation facing us in the 1970s.</hs_Para>

to be paid for—that is the economic inevitability. History shows
that price fixing does not work and damages the economy in turn. The
willingness of the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) to
interfere with the market would unsettle other sectors, break some
smaller suppliers such as First Utility, which was promoted with the
switch of the

system clearly needs modernisation and massive investment. The proposed
price freeze increases the political risks for this country and for its
new investors. All of this will put up long-term prices—the
consumer will pay. Any Government who freeze prices would undermine the
role of the independent regulator, Ofgem, and no doubt would succumb to
the temptation to recruit their own staff of bureaucrats and inspectors
to enforce their policy.</hs_Para>

ensure that Ofgem does its job; keep up the pressure on the big six
suppliers; look at encouraging more new entrants; do lots more to save
energy in the first place; get a fair deal for people on pre-payment
cards and meters; ensure that consumers receive bills that they can
understand; support the development of many more green energy
provisions on a local basis such as the Wedmore power co-operative
solar array, which opened this weekend in my patch; and make it swift

is unclear whether the shadow Secretary of State was
advocating a windfall tax rather than a price freeze. However, such a
tax seems to be a better idea by far as there would be an opportunity
to redistribute any windfall to those who need the most help. Every
pound spent to support those with disproportionately high bills,
particularly on energy-saving measures for those very households, is a
pound well spent. Planning a price freeze demonstrates a lack of
understanding of business, and shows the impact of interfering in this
market, which would cost consumers more, not

an interesting debate. I am sorry that the Secretary of
State has left the Chamber, but I note that he apologised for doing so.
I found it astonishing, however, that he asked for consensus, but went
on to make one of the most provocative speeches that I have
ever heard in the House, particularly on a subject where he is on a
weak wicket. I can imagine going round my constituency
speaking to elderly folks and people with disabilities, and
people—far too many—suffering from fuel poverty and
saying, “Well, we’re not doing anything about
the cost of energy, but we’ve reached consensus.” I do
not believe that consensus can be reached because, like many
of my hon. Friends, I have been involved in these issues for
more than 10 years. If right hon. and hon. Members have a
minute or two, they might want to study the
debate that I secured in Westminster Hall on this subject on
23 January 2007, in which the hon. Member for Wealden
(Charles Hendry) made a good speech. I have to say, with respect, that
I do not recall quite the emphasis on investment that we heard today;
nevertheless, I cannot take away from him the points that he made on
that
occasion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:00:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

switch to one company than that company put up its prices. There was

what it had to say. It responded to one of our representations on 1
January 2007, the day after Hogmanay—Scots Members will
understand what I mean—by issuing a press release stating that
if the energy companies, the big six, continued what they had been
doing, in its view they would have “jam on their

will mention those later if I have time—it should have spoken
much more

are entitled to ensure that the public are no longer duped about the
actual cost of energy. I would have expected that to be the role of a
proactive regulator. For example, the four major companies that have
raised prices blamed wholesale prices, green levies and
network costs for the latest bill increases of between
£100 and £150, which have led to an average bill of
£1,400 a year. In 2010 npower’s electricity wholesale
prices fell by 13%, but that was not passed on to the consumer, and the
average wholesale price fell by 4% in 2011 and
rose by less than 2% in 2012, yet the company increased retail prices
by 5.1%, 7.2% and 9.1% respectively in those
years, and E.ON and EDF behaved likewise.

working and that if we leave it alone things will work out? I do not
know about the word “cartel”, but I know that there

A price freeze simply freezes the problem and does not enable a

not the right way because it will prevent firms from responding

ironically, that there is a tension between wanting to have lower

Department of Energy and Climate Change is both poacher and gamekeeper.
We need to continue investing in green energy. I will always promote
green energy because my constituency has a lot of important companies
that are working extraordinarily hard to develop green technologies.
However, we must respond to the price issue as well. That is why the
Government are right to calibrate the green taxes more sensibly to
reduce prices in the energy

storage. We do not give enough attention to that subject. Energy

that has not been discussed in the debate thus far is competitiveness,
not just in this country, but across Europe. In January, the Prime

strengthen the single market in energy. He was absolutely right. We
have to recognise that there are lower commodity prices on the
continent. We must be able to benefit from those prices. We need to
attract investment from the continent and we must invest in the

proposal from the leader of the Labour party to freeze energy bills,
certainly for consumers but very much for businesses as well. In my

treated appallingly by energy companies and/or their brokers.
Businesses have been expected to put down unrealistic bonds or deposits

consider how consumers are treated by energy companies. Over the past
few days there has been talk in the press about how energy companies
are deliberately hanging on to their customers’ money. I am in

companies, and I will give the House two or three examples of what
energy companies are doing with their customers’
money.</hs_Para>

is something of which I have personal experience. Until two years ago I
had a prepayment meter. Someone on a prepayment meter receives an
annual statement that sets out what they have used and what they are
likely to use in the next 12 months. It predicts how much energy
someone will use, and what the likely cost will be. I decided,
understandably, to move to direct debit to reduce the bill. I phoned
the energy company—British Gas—and the call handler
explained that they had to go through a process of assessing what my
bill was likely to be. I pointed out that a prediction had already been
made in the annual statement, but of course they insisted on going
through the process of counting the number of radiators and asking how
many people were in the household. Lo and behold, to nobody’s
surprise the company suggested a higher direct debit on a monthly basis
than what I had been paying for the past 12 months.</hs_Para>

the company was trying to bamboozle me into paying more per month. I am
fairly forthright and insisted that it stuck to a reasonable amount of
money, but my concern is that many people, particularly those on
prepayment meters, are some of the most vulnerable in our society and
could easily have been bamboozled into paying a higher direct debit
than they should have paid. I am convinced that that call handler had
been encouraged to take people down that route so that they would pay
more<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:23:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

articulates an important point about vulnerable customers who are
paying above the odds on prepayment meters. However, it is not just
those on prepayment meters who pay direct debits; we all have the
opportunity to do that. I have raised this point before in the House,
but is my hon. Friend aware of actions by companies such as E.ON, which
was previously my energy provider? I see myself as very forthright, but
when I called it to amend my direct debit—I knew I was paying
above the odds on a monthly basis—it would not allow me to amend
it. I had to pay the price it offered me, and that was it. I had to pay
above the odds, and it was essentially allowed to accumulate money from
me. That was the only choice offered to me; otherwise I had to pay a

Mike Weir</B> (Angus) (SNP):</Member> I hope everyone in the House
agrees that the rising cost of energy is putting huge strains on
families throughout the country. The motion calls for a freeze on
energy prices. That is superficially attractive, but it is mired in
difficulties, not least because it freezes the inequalities in the
system. It is true, however, that the energy companies have serious
questions to answer about the reason prices are rising. Every year we
are told that it is due to the wholesale price of energy, and the
Energy Secretary repeated that in last week’s statement.
However, the chief executive of Ovo Energy, appearing before the Select
Committee and on TV this week, stated that the cost of gas he is buying
is lower than it has been in the past four years. Ofgem originally
questioned whether there had in fact been a price rise, before rowing
back. Its position can 
<?notus-xml column=319?>best be summed up as: “It depends how you read the
figures,” which hardly instils

fully understand that the situation is probably not straightforward, in
that the need to ensure sufficient supplies well into the future and
the volumes of energy purchased by the large companies, effectively as
futures, as against that of smaller companies who may buy on the spot
market, may make a difference, but both the regulator and the
Department must act decisively. If there is any suggestion that
wholesale prices have not risen as claimed, the rises must be cancelled
or curtailed. It is not good enough to call for a Competition
Commission inquiry. That will take years and we need quick action now
to find out the truth of the claims.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:37:26"></hs_TimeCode>To that extent,
I support the call to ensure that when wholesale prices are reduced
they should be passed on to the consumer. The consumer is rightly

have said on other occasions, and will repeat it again, that we would
be prepared to look at any proposals for reducing energy bills, but I
have concerns about the Labour proposal for a one-off energy price
freeze. What would happen, for example, if energy companies
substantially increased prices prior to, or immediately after, the
freeze? Would a Labour Government force a reduction? Would they bring
in a permanent control of prices? How would they deal with the urgent
need for investment in our energy infrastructure? In an intervention, I
asked about contracts for difference and the pool system. Hon. Members
will recall that contracts for difference were supposed to guarantee a
price to stimulate much needed investment in energy infrastructure. I
do not understand how that would fit into the proposed
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:38:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) spoke at length about
splitting up energy companies, but she seemed to be talking about the
split between the two wings of energy companies—the wholesale
and the retail supply side. That has dangers. Anyone who watched the
recent “Dispatches” programme on energy prices would have
seen what was said about E.ON and the rather unique way it deals with
that. Apparently, the retail side makes no money because it pays huge
rates of interest on money borrowed entirely from associated companies
within the group. How will that be dealt with in the proposed system?
E.ON is already effectively split between wholesale and retail, but
that is not having an effect, because it is a matter of artificial
accountancy, borrowing money from other companies within the group. As
an alternative, we have proposed transferring from energy bills to
general taxation the cost not of all green measures, but specifically
of the fuel-poverty measures and the energy company obligation, which
we calculate would reduce energy bills by 5% or about
£70 each and every year—it would not be a
one-off saving. This would have the added advantage of delivering a
more integrated fuel-poverty programme than could be achieved if we
left it to the energy
companies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:39:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110677000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0003.htm#13110677000286">In
the energy statement last week, the Secretary of State again repeated
that the Government had taken powers to implement the Prime
Minister’s promise to put everyone on the lowest tariff. I have
pointed out before, and will do so again, that the measures in the
Energy Bill will not have that effect. The Bill requires energy
companies not to put everyone on the lowest tariff, but only to make
the offer, which might be lost in 
<?notus-xml column=320?>the mass of paper we receive from them already. Is not part of the
problem that there is such a lack of trust in energy companies that
whatever they offer will be met with total scepticism by consumers,
even when they offer free loft insulation or suggest the most

proposed changes will even fail to help the poorest in our society who
have to rely on prepayment meters—this is another difficulty
with the energy price freeze. For someone on a direct debit tariff, it
might be fine, but anyone on a prepayment meter will still be stuck on
a higher tariff, because generally their tariffs are higher than direct
debit tariffs. If we are truly intent on ensuring that everyone has the
lowest possible bills, these measures should not only operate within an
existing contract, but allow people to move to a cheaper contract.
Instead of freezing the price, we need to mandate that people be moved
to a cheaper

prepayment meters are one of the few examples where consumers pay much
more if they pay cash in advance. That is important, because Citizens
Advice Scotland recently issued an energy report showing that the
majority of people coming to it with energy problems have trouble with
prepayment meters. It cited examples of people putting £10 in a
meter, only to see £7 taken to meet existing debts, leaving them
with only £3 of energy, which is completely insufficient to heat
homes.</hs_Para>

motion calls on the Government to put all over-75s on the cheapest
tariff. Although any help is welcome, it rather depends on the tariffs.
If the cost of energy continues to rise, the amount payable will also
continue to rise throughout the various tariffs, so this measure would
not hit at the heart of the problem of the relative affordability of
energy. It is not clear whether the motion intends that people should
be put on the cheapest tariff that their present supplier offers or the
cheapest overall tariff. The best option is to have a cheaper specific
tariff that is identical across all companies and available to the
over-75s. That would attack the
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:42:41"></hs_TimeCode>. A

that suppliers will experience during this price-freeze period are
relevant, too. Suppliers will experience regular increases in costs for
distribution and transmission, and unless they are in a position to
change their prices before the freeze comes into effect, that will be a
direct hit. Although some Labour Members may believe that the big six
can take that hit, it is a much bigger challenge for smaller
competitors to be able to absorb it. In fact, a market in which losses
need to be absorbed for a period of time before it is possible to break
even acts as a barrier to entry. If we want a more competitive market,
introducing a new barrier to entry and to the viability of new entrants
will clearly not help bring about
competition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:51:40"></hs_TimeCode>. In

smaller competitors to challenge the big six during this period, or

was in the long-term interest of consumers for Government policy to

seems to me incontrovertible that an industry experiencing a Government
intervention which forces a price freeze for a period of 20 months will
have the effect of raising the cost of capital. Investors do not have
to invest in the sector if they do not wish to do so; they can invest
elsewhere. If they know that the Government have frozen prices, that
will be a reason for the cost of capital to increase. Ultimately, that
would push up prices for consumers, even after all the reforms that the
shadow Secretary of State outlined. That would not be in the best

Alan Whitehead</B> (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</Member> Perhaps the best
thing we can do this afternoon is to shoot a number of canards standing
in the way of grasping the central issue of how to reset the market in
such a way that it will work in favour of consumers and customers
instead of against customers’ interests. Frankly, saying that
proposals to reset the market will lead to a deterioration in
investment prospects or a loss of market value that will prevent people
from investing is the first and one of the biggest of such
canards.</hs_Para>

substantial amount of investment is needed, but it cannot be judged on
the basis of the interests of integrated utility management; it will
come from companies investing in the wires, in smart meters and in new
forms of generation that are independent of the utilities. Indeed, the
balance sheet of the big six suggests that not a very high proportion
of that £100 billion-plus investment is likely to come from them
in any event. It appears that the factors relating to the investment
will be manifold, and will not necessarily be related to the fortunes
of the big

say that resetting the market will cause it to work in a terrible way
in the future is effectively to say that breaking up what is currently
a seriously dysfunctional system will lead to problems. That strikes me
as a counsel of despair not just where the market is concerned, but
where consumers are concerned, and it is, perhaps, the second big
canard to be shot. It is claimed that the Energy Bill will put a number
of things right, and it will, but what it will not put right is the
malfunctioning of the market. What is extraordinary about the
Bill—as with the energy reform White Paper that preceded
it—is that the one thing it does not do is reform the energy
market. It lets the market carry on just as it has in the past, and we

question. Currently, gas is the market-maker and companies that produce
energy that is not gas-based sell their energy into the retail market
at the electricity-equivalent of the price of energy produced by gas.
It is to be hoped that one of the effects of energy market reform will
be that a change in the balance of production, in particular as a
result of increasing amounts of renewables, will mean that gas is no

considerably. The UK market is currently based around the gas price. If
gas is no longer the market-maker over the medium and long term, a
number of interesting consequences will arise, particularly in terms of
how we would relate volatile markets to retail

is one of the issues that would be dealt with by the

into which everybody transparently sells their products and the pool
then sells to energy retailers, that would deal with a number of
problems that have arisen as a result of the imperfections in the
market, and which would remain despite the Energy Bill trying hard to
address them. If there was a pool, they would be dealt with even if gas
was still the market-maker, but the market would be much more efficient

in the future, because it is certainly true that world energy prices
continue to increase and that there would be price increases for the
consumer. It is not true, incidentally, that under those circumstances
energy companies would simply take back the money lost during a price
freeze, because there would be regulation reflecting world prices.
Although prices have gone up, the world gas price has not gone up over
the past year and a half. A fair relationship between world energy
prices and retail prices could be achieved through a combination of new

Abrahams</B> (Oldham East and Saddleworth) (Lab):</Member> I wish to
start by putting the energy bill crisis into the context of the cost of
living crisis. As we know, since May 2010 prices have risen faster than
pay every month apart from this April. Why was April different? It was
different because people on high incomes wanted to take advantage of
the tax break that this Government had given them. We also know that
one in four children live in poverty—in some wards in my
constituency the figure is one in two—with the level set to
increase in the next few years. By 2020, because of this
Government’s policies, 1.1 million more children will be living
in poverty. These are the choices that this Government have
made.</hs_Para>

heating bills are a major factor affecting costs to households and to
businesses. Last year those costs increased by between 6% and 11%, and
since this Government came to power an extra £300 has been added
to energy bills. So why is this happening? Until the last few months,
this country had a flatlining economy—we have had three years of
it. Although the growth over the past few months is welcome, if we had
had just 1% growth since 2010 we would have generated £335
billion more in the economy, with all the associated jobs and personal
income that that would have brought. If we had had 2% growth, we would
have generated £551 billion, and many economists believe that
that will just not be recoverable.</hs_Para>

to that situation has been the fact that pay has either gone down or
been frozen. Some 400,000 more people are living below the
living wage, bringing the number of those doing so up to 5.2 million.
In Oldham, the level of weekly pay has fallen from £432 in 2010

issue is not just the impact on consumers. Labour is very much the
party of small business. Our policy of an energy price freeze is an
example of that. Annual energy bills for small businesses have gone up
by an average of £10,000 since 2010. Small businesses will
benefit hugely not just from the price freeze, but from a market that
works for consumers. In addition, our plan to cut business rates for
small business would mean an average saving of nearly £450 for
1.5 million business properties. These two policies demonstrate to
small businesses that it is only Labour that will stand up on their
side and cut their costs so that they can reinvest in new jobs and new
products. Labour’s policy is good for consumers, good for
business and good for the economy. I am proud to say that I will be
supporting it and voting for it

There are 6,196 households in my constituency that are in fuel poverty,
using the 10% of income measure, but those statistics are from 2011 and
are the most recent. Since then prices have risen at least twice, while
real wages are stagnating, so I am sure those figures will be much
higher now. Energy prices are a key driver of the Prime
Minister’s cost of living crisis, which has seen on average
£1,200 wiped off the real value of the annual incomes of working
people in the north-east.</hs_Para>

decent income, but for which energy costs are just one of a number of
ever-rising costs that they have to meet, such as rent, child care
bills, kids’ clothes, school uniforms, food and groceries. It is

the second it was over. He appealed for consensus
with the Opposition at the start, but only on terms that suit his
friends in the big six. His only proposal to reduce prices was by
competition, which everyone can see has patently collapsed in the
present semi-monopoly system. He had no plausible answer whatsoever for
stopping the current gross overcharging. He spoke about

marker in his conference speech two months ago. The debate has thrown
the Government into a tizzy, which they do not know how to handle.
The Prime Minister was rushing around threatening to remove
the green levies, which is the opposite of what he said a few months

understanding of many Government Members. An energy price freeze is not
a policy programme in itself—of course it is not—but
merely an important element in wider reform. As Opposition Members have
made perfectly clear, it will be followed by a return to trading energy
through a pool system, which will be more transparent than the current
system, together with separation or unbundling of the different arms of
the energy companies. They are currently vertically integrated, which
means that they can both generate  
<?notus-xml column=337?>energy and supply it to the customer, which makes it very hard, if not
impossible, to assess the extent of their profits, because they trade

are good reasons to review the current energy market structure and the
business model on which it is based. Ever since Kyoto, global warming
has made mitigating CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions the dominant challenge.
The decline in the UK’s indigenous natural gas fields has made
ensuring the security of supply and managing the energy sector’s
impact on the balance of payments key objectives. Whether the
liberalised market alone is capable of achieving those objectives

has happened in the past two decades to deal with that policy
fragmentation? There has been a persistent accumulation of directives,
rules and subsidy schemes that are intended to cure the liberalised
market of its intrinsic indifference to decarbonisation and the
security of supply. All that has been programmed and overseen by a
growing army of regulatory bodies, quangos and advisory institutions.
We have thus ended up with the worst of both worlds—a byzantine
industrial structure theoretically co-ordinated by the market
mechanism, but one that nevertheless requires omniscient policy makers
to mastermind everything it does. I submit that that is not

or without a price freeze, we face the distinct possibility of a
capacity shortage—in other words, the lights going out—by
the middle of this decade. If the lights go out, it will not be because
of a temporary price freeze; it will be because a market based on a
private oligopoly has not concentrated, and perhaps cannot be expected
to concentrate, its efforts on fundamental issues of national security
rather than on the short-term gains of senior executives and
shareholders. Surely the lesson is that restructuring a broken and

an emergency measure to stabilise a situation in which price hikes have
clearly got out of control, and to provide leeway to introduce wider
reforms, a limited price freeze is certainly needed. It is also
justified, as other hon. Members have pointed out, when Ofgem data
suggest that wholesale prices over the past year have been almost
flat—rising by perhaps 1.7%—but retail prices are now
being pushed up by the big six by between 8% and 11%. Indeed, according

schemes, the impact of policies on wholesale prices, boiler regulations
and the EU minimum standards of electrical efficiency—will cut

seemed to wake people up. The Conservative party, however, cannot get
away from its history. It created the big six by its decision, in the
1980s and 1990s, to privatise the utilities industries. The
Conservative Government started by dismantling the most technically
advanced coal industry in the world, an industry that was leading the
world on clean coal technology—could we not use some of that
now? They then went and told Sid to buy shares in gas, electricity and
water. They were actually using public money to bribe people to get
themselves back into power. It worked very well for them, but the
chickens are coming home to roost and the people feeling it are sitting
at home at night wondering if they dare put the fire on. We have left
billions of tonnes of coal under our feet to lie dormant, while we are

all colleagues—at least on the Opposition Benches—who
have spoken, the issue of rising energy prices comes up every week in
my surgeries and public meetings. It is utterly complacent for the
Secretary of State to lecture us about rising disposable incomes, as if
that were the solution to the problem and energy prices did not really
matter. He should try and tell that to people who, on top of rising
energy prices, have been forced to accept a drop in hours, a wage

date, the Government’s measures have not worked, as they have
implicitly recognised, because if they were working, why would the
Prime Minister have announced, on the hoof, his two major changes in
energy prices? Last year, came the promise to put everyone on the
cheapest tariff, which then became a promise to simplify tariffs, from
which millions of energy customers will 
<?notus-xml column=341?>not benefit; then, this year, came the sudden review of green levies,
which has now become simply the transfer of some energy efficiency
measure into general taxation, or so it would
appear.</hs_Para>

downward pressure on energy prices. First, as my hon. Friends have
said, the Government are relying on competition, but as even the
Secretary of State would seem to accept, competition is not bringing
down prices. After all, given that the prices charged by the major
energy companies all seem to rise at roughly the same time and at
roughly the same rate, we may be excused for being sceptical about
competition. We now seem to be relying on switching, but after three
and a half years in power, the Government have realised that it is not
as easy to switch as they suggested, so they are going to introduce

Lazarowicz:</Member></B> That is a good point. One problem with relying
on switching is that the Government’s measures do not tackle the
problem of people switching and then finding it does not bring the
expected advantages and so deciding to switch again. I have experience
in my constituency of people who are tied into a year’s contract
that they cannot get out of. Conservative Members gave the House
examples of people making wonderful savings by switching, but I wonder
whether those consumers will still find switching to be advantageous in
a year’s time. I accept that switching is important, but it is
ridiculous to suggest that it is a panacea, as the Government seem to
be doing.</hs_Para>

also create the risk that the limited saving to customers would

disappears into Treasury coffers, to be recycled into a nationwide

insulation, modern boilers and renewable energy such as domestic PV,
solar hot water and biomass heating. That could bring nine out of 10
homes out of fuel poverty, lower people’s bills, deliver four
times more carbon cuts than current schemes and create 200,000 jobs. I

conclusion, I welcome the greater focus on the problem of high energy

life and death, not just of discomfort; we are talking about people who
are going to be suffering from radically ill health and about the
premature deaths associated with fuel poverty. So I welcome this
debate, but I regret that most of the solutions put forward do not
fully address the root causes of fuel poverty and high energy costs. A
fundamental shift should be at the heart of energy market reform. I am
worried that we have heard much more about tinkering around the edges
of a system that keeps the big six in power and far too many people in
fuel poverty, rather than about much more radical energy
transformation, which we are beginning to see in other countries. There

Pincher</B> (Tamworth) (Con):</Member> I thank you, Madam Deputy
Speaker, and my legion of fans. I apologise for not being here for the
opening exchanges of this important debate, but I had to attend a
funeral. I congratulate the Opposition on tabling this motion but, in
as much as we are discussing long-term structural energy issues, as
much as it is a challenge to the Government, it is also an admission by
the Opposition of their failure during their 13 years in government,
when they had the time, the money and the majorities to make changes
but did not do so.</hs_Para>

need to develop more home-grown energy. Of course, she is right, but
the question then must be: why during 13 years of Labour Government was
no new nuclear power station opened? The last to open was in 1995 and
the next will be opened under a Conservative-led Government in the
future. Labour also had no keenness to explore shale gas. These things
the Labour Government failed to do. Labour Members have said that we

it is too good to be true. A price fix is too good to be

prices, as many experts have said, will only mean that the energy
companies will hike their prices in anticipation of that fix. That
means that people will be paying artificially high prices, particularly
if the wholesale price falls during the period of the freeze. It is not

Opposition also say that we need to get more competition into the
energy market, but if we listen to Steve Fitzgerald, the darling of the
Select Committee who ran rings around some of the players from the big
six at that meeting, or to First Utility, the Leader of the
Opposition’s provider of choice, we hear them say that a fix
will make it more difficult to operate in the market. It will not allow
small players in and will entrench the position of Labour’s big
six. The Labour party ought to admit

Opposition also say that investment will flow into our infrastructure
anyway. I do not believe that is true. We need to spend at least
£110 billion in the next 
<?notus-xml column=349?>10 years on our power stations, our pipes and our pylons to keep the
lights switched on and we need much of that investment to come from
private companies.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:31:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead), who made a thoughtful speech and
is my colleague on the Energy and Climate Change Committee, said that
he does not believe that the energy companies will invest that sort of
money. We learned in the Select Committee inquiry just a week ago that
E.ON alone has invested £7 billion in its generating
capacity over the past five years. If we extrapolate that over the big
six, that would suggest that they are spending some £40 billion
on the infrastructure we so desperately need.</hs_Para>

the investment dries up because of a price freeze and that sends the
wrong message to the markets, the poor old taxpayer—the van
driver, the nurse, the doctor, the teacher and the
pensioner—will have to pick up the tab. That is why I think the
Opposition’s proposal is a con. It is a scam. It is a swizz. It
is voodoo economics. It is political charlatanism. They know it and the
electorate can see it, too. What we need is not some artificially high
price freeze in the future but price cuts now. That is what our
electorate want and what our constituents tell us. If we roll back some
of the green levies that account for some £112 on the average
dual fuel bill, if we make it easier to switch, saving people some
£200, and if we get people on to the lowest tariffs, saving them
about £158, we can reduce bills now for hard-pressed consumers.
That is the way to deal with our energy challenge.</hs_Para>

will recall from his involvement in the final stages of the Energy
Bill, after his two predecessors started the process—we
scrutinised the Bill and, on balance, supported many of the measures
contained in it. However, on Second Reading—the Minister, the

aspects of the problem, for at least a year, and raising some aspects
for nearly two years. The Secretary of State said that he wanted
consensus back. We have consensus on some of the measures in the Energy
Bill, but we said at the outset that there were things missing from the
Bill. That is what our policies aim to rectify, and if Ministers could
get over themselves a little bit they could introduce those reforms,

Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry), one of the Minister’s
predecessors, discussed long-term signals and the importance of
securing investment in energy infrastructure. That was the focus of the
process called electricity market reform, which became the Energy Bill.
There is also an important point about consent. If we expect investment
to happen, people who pay energy bills need to know that the market
functions effectively and that they can trust their energy supplier.

with small suppliers, with people in the supply chain, and with a whole
range of people across the sector, and they have made it clear that
they want a situation in which they can be trusted. They want
transparency in the market. Indeed, some of the small suppliers that
have been prayed in aid in speeches by Government Members have said
that the most important thing is to have an open and transparent system
in the energy market, which is what our reform is about. Then we will
be in a position where we can have a fair debate about these issues and
ensure that investment can flow, because people can understand and
trust the system that will be in place.</hs_Para>

SSE put up its prices recently, it tried to quantify the cause of the
increase. It attributed 4% to wholesale costs, 10% to network costs,
13% to Government policy costs, 8% to VAT, which adds up to 80%,
leaving 20%. It said that an additional 20%, which was not in
SSE’s press statement but in the small print and in
conversations afterwards, was to increase its profit margin. That is
what is happening in the market, and not just in the case of
SSE—npower did something similar. I recommend that Members who

a better share of that market in order to build their customer base.

Minister’s announcement on green levies, which was made in front
of the Environmental Audit Committee a couple of weeks ago—the
Energy Minister is in his place. It stated that the Government were
looking at each of those levies. I asked a parliamentary question on
which levies they were looking at and received a response today from
the Secretary of State. It stated that they are looking at 
<?notus-xml column=353?>investment incentives, but not for the renewables obligation, contracts
for difference or feed-in tariffs. The Prime Minister said earlier
today that they were looking at every subsidy and every levy. There is
complete confusion at the heart of the Government about what is and is
not in scope for the review. If they are concerned about the impact on
confidence and investment, they need to look at the shambles of their
own policy over the past couple of weeks.</hs_Para>

report “Explanatory statements on amendments” is a
serious piece of work undertaken, in the main, by my predecessor, and I
was lucky enough to inherit it in October last year. The Committee is
saying that explanatory statements to amendments are an extremely good
thing: they allow for informed debate, and for people to have an
understanding of what those tabling amendments are trying to achieve.
We have, however, taken a permissive, rather than a prescriptive, view.
We believe that the Government, if given the opportunity to do so, will
want to do the right thing, and that the right thing is to put forward
explanatory statements to amendments. I look at
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T19:16:38"></hs_TimeCode> Chief Whip
and the Deputy Leader of the House and see two people totally committed
to doing the right thing. They have done the right thing throughout
their parliamentary careers—one of those careers has lasted for
more than 40 years—and I am certain that that will continue to
be the case for what remains of their illustrious parliamentary
careers. I note that the Chief Whip is not smiling too much, so I will
move on.</hs_Para>

possibly be a deterrent to debate? His confidence in his
colleagues’ willingness to do the right thing is somewhat
undermined by the fact that they did not do that when there was a

the Committee stage of the Small Charitable Donations Bill 42
amendments were tabled by Back Benchers, the Government and the
Opposition, and 40 of them had explanatory statements. On Report, all
37 amendments had explanatory statements. If I am misreading that, I

the bit to help Back-Bench colleagues attach explanatory statements to
their amendments. They are ready, waiting and willing to do these
things. I also hope that there is an army of Whitehall civil servants
wanting to seize the day and impress their Ministers with their
diligence and brilliance. I look, too, at the Opposition, in all their
glory, and know that, despite our living in straitened times with
limited resources, they will turn to their researchers and their
special advisers—they are not really special advisers, but that
is what they are called—and will demand that they step up to the
plate and provide explanatory statements. I appreciate that it will not
be possible on all occasions, but let us make this a new beginning for
the way we conduct business in this place. If the House does not take
this opportunity, however, the Committee will revisit the matter and
bring forward more prescriptive

When I first arrived here, I was immediately struck by how difficult it
was to work out what all the amendments tabled on the Floor of the
House actually sought to do; and I did not seem to be alone, so I
joined with others who also wanted a brief explanation of amendments so
that everyone could know what they sought to achieve. At the moment, as
we run from another meeting, we look to see what we are voting on and
find something like: “Clause 1, page 1, line 5, leave out

including responsibilities to undertake work in Committees, to attend
Westminster Hall debates and to chair and attend meetings. As a result,
colleagues frequently cannot sit in the Chamber all the time a debate

When I run down the escalator from Portcullis House at the same time as
many other colleagues, I often hear people saying “What are we
voting on; what are we voting on?” I am not whipped, so I have
to find that out myself, but many colleagues do not necessarily have
that information, and I think that they should. This is not a criticism
of colleagues. I have no doubt that MPs do not like trying to find out
what the vote is on as they run down the escalators. The point is that
this information is not being properly provided. It is good that the

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> No, I would not go as far as that. One of the
great divides in parliamentary life is represented by the fact that the
Government always have officials beside them. We see in the Box this
evening three extremely distinguished gentlemen who are there to advise
the Government and help them to plan their legislation. The Opposition
have some Short money, which helps them with their parliamentary
activities, but, unlike the Government, they do not have the depth of
resources that would enable them to provide the explanations that might
be needed.</hs_Para>

is assumed that we live in a perfect world in which legislation is
presented after pre-legislative scrutiny and there is much time for
consideration and deliberation, but that is unfortunately not true. A
great deal of legislation is quite rushed, and comes to the House at
quite a late stage. The Opposition sometimes have to trawl through many
hundreds of clauses in a Bill, and, while they may have just about
enough time to write out their amendments, even if each amendment takes
only five minutes to explain, 100 Opposition amendments will mean 500
minutes that Opposition Members may not have when a Bill is due to
begin its Committee stage within a week or two—or sometimes a
day or two—of being presented to the House. I therefore think
that the burden placed on the Opposition would be unfair and

that I am speaking partly from personal experience as a Back-Bench
Member of Parliament, I want to pay particular tribute to the Clerks of

Back Benchers how to formulate an amendment so that it is in order.
However, to ask them then to write an explanatory memorandum when so
many hundreds of us could be calling on their time would be to place an
unreasonable burden on them. Their patience, courtesy, capability and
knowledge of the history of Parliament are an absolute joy to behold,

takes us to the heart of the way in which the Government are held to
account through the legislative process. Those of us who table
amendments know that 
<?notus-xml column=369?>our amendments will almost certainly not pass into law. Indeed, on most
occasions when I have tabled amendments I have not pressed them to a
Division, because I have known that the massed serried ranks on the

table amendments to ensure that the issue is debated, that the Minister
is able to think about it, and that it is considered in proper detail
by the Minister and the Minister’s officials. The Opposition do
exactly the same, in the knowledge that the points that they raise will
be considered during the overall process. That process would be
weakened and made more difficult if the explanatory memorandums were
compulsory. If they were compulsory, the Opposition would perforce
table fewer amendments, and Back Benchers would be deterred from
tabling amendments because of the extra burden that it would place on
them, and because of a certain diffidence about putting more pressure
on the Clerks of Legislation.</hs_Para>

theirs. The reality of legislating, however, is that it is often done

support amendment (a). Despite what I have just said, I believe that
the Committee’s modest position represents a major missed
opportunity, in that the gain from making brief explanatory statements

it—and here I strongly disagree with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T19:39:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Somerset—is minuscule. At present, particularly
on Report, Members who have not participated in Committee often do not
know, and have made little or no effort to find out, what precisely
they are casting their vote for. Anecdotal evidence suggests the
proportion could be as high as seven or eight out of 10. This is of
great significance because, particularly if the Government Whips have
exercised a tight leash over Committee stage, the Report stage is often
the only real opportunity for the House to modify the content of the
Bill. The debates on Report are usually focused on important issues
where strong views are known to be held by the public. Echoing what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T19:40:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) said, it is a reasonable
assumption that if the public were more widely aware that these 
<?notus-xml column=370?>matters of considerable importance to them were treated in such a
cavalier fashion by many, if not a great many, Members who often vote
blind—and I confess that I am one of them occasionally, because
of the difficulties of finding out exactly what we are voting

proper functions.</hs_Para>

undoubtedly do this, but in most cases I submit it will be a minority.
In the absence of obtaining the necessary documentation and reading it
in order to understand the point at issue and reaching a considered
view, the default position, as we all know, is for Members to follow
their Whips on arrival in the

function of Parliament. It can be so easily remedied by requiring that

someone who in my 43 years has taken many Bills through the House, I
know that it certainly takes a huge amount of time to get to grips in

its detailed aspects, to identify areas where modification needs to be
sought and to draft amendments in an appropriate parliamentary form.
Once hundreds of hours have been expended on doing that,

proposer of an amendment was quite different from what they had
imagined when they first read it. That applies not only to Back

not the case. Amendments are often prepared by well-resourced outside
bodies that would have no problem whatsoever providing an explanatory

regard for your observations and the way in which you guide
us through difficult debates. “Erskine May” makes it
clear that colleagues should not read out speeches, but with great
discretion, Mr Deputy Speaker, you allowed the hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) to read her speech. The House
rules would say, following the intervention of the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome, that that would not be allowed. The notion, Mr

David Nuttall</B> (Bury North) (Con):</Member> There are essentially
two issues before us this evening. The first is whether explanatory
statements are a good thing or a bad thing. There is pretty much
agreement on both sides of the argument that they are a good thing. The
second and more difficult question is whether explanatory statements
should be compulsory. My view is that they should not be compulsory. I
think they are a good thing and I congratulate

the debate, my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:02:59"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne made clear the view of the
Committee that, having considered all the evidence, we felt that on
balance a permissive regime was better than a mandatory one. I accept
that the argument is very finely balanced. My own view is that,
although it is easy for the Government to table explanatory notes, as
they do in the case of a Bill, which is entirely right, it should not
be made mandatory for a Back-Bench Member to do so. However, any Back
Bencher who takes their amendment seriously and wants to persuade the
House of its merits will want to table an explanatory note, but it may
be that, for whatever reason, they do not wish to do so. They may
prefer to inform Members of the merits of their amendment by
circulating a letter to colleagues, circulating an e-mail, holding a
briefing meeting or even establishing a website or tweeting about the
amendment. They may have other ideas about how to do it. I do not think
that they should be precluded from tabling an amendment just because
they have not filed an explanatory statement.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:05:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) would find that
his amendments had greater support if their purpose was set out clearly
for Members to see. Many Members have referred to the extra costs that
might be involved, but surely they are nothing compared to the costs of
poorly drafted legislation. As for the cost in trees, not a single
extra tree would have to be felled if the House moved towards the 21st
century and had all amendments and explanatory notes delivered to
Members’ iPads so that they could be absolutely clear about what
they are voting for. I see no excuse for not moving towards such a
system, which would improve the quality of legislation. I hope that
Members will support the amendment.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:08:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) said, for Members
tabling 100, 200 or 300 amendments that amounts to quite a
lot of minutes, but I believe that they should be given the
administrative support they need to achieve that. However, that does
not apply for Back Benchers, because they rarely table more than a
small handful of amendments, unless they have set out to become
parliamentary pests. They will have spent a lot of time understanding
how to table them, so the extra five, 10, 15 or perhaps 30
minutes required to explain them is not much to ask. If a Back Bencher
is not willing to invest those 30 minutes in the explanatory notes,
perhaps they ought not to be wasting our time with the amendments in
the first
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110694000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0004.htm#13110694000109">This

anomaly in the current system that we have enjoyed so far in the pilots
whereby it has not always been possible to call on the Public Bill

making sure that explanatory statements are available. We are pleased
that the Committee is recommending a further period in which to allow
this innovation to embed itself, because more time is needed to test

are two reasons, as we see it, for supporting this approach. First, it
is important for the House to bear in mind that the official
Opposition, who of course have to take a comprehensive approach to the
scrutiny of legislation passing through this House, would face a
significant extra burden through engaging in the business of drafting
explanatory statements to all amendments that they wish to table for
discussion in the Chamber. Much of the legislation we deal with is very
complex and requires careful consideration on a political and a
technical level, and we have to bear this in mind if we want to avoid a
situation in which we actually deter effective scrutiny of legislation
because we have, in practice, restricted the number of amendments that
can realistically be tabled by the Opposition. It is probably the first
time I have been able to say this, but I agree with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:12:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:12:58"></hs_TimeCode>

we need to test how the Government respond to any significant extension
of the use of explanatory statements, in the sense that it could prompt
serious questions about the timetabling of legislation in this House.
The pressure on the official Opposition to develop their approach to
scrutiny of Bills in Committee is, more often than not, intense, and an
extra work load would make it even more incumbent on the Government to
improve their scheduling to ensure that adequate time is made available
for the development of Members’ approach to scrutiny. Having

hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David) on the Bill teams
for the Electoral Registration and Administration Bill and the recent

our view, the permissive approach rather than the mandatory approach

report to which the motion refers was published by the Procedure

Paper before the summer recess, but consideration of this issue can be
traced back to Modernisation Committee report in 2006 recommending that
the Procedure Committee draw up a set of rules governing the tabling
and publishing of explanatory statements on amendments to Bills on an
optional basis during Committee stage. That followed evidence from the

discussions in this Parliament between the Procedure Committee and the

place on two Bills, the Electoral Registration and Administration Bill
and the Small Charitable Donations Bill. Criteria for evaluating the
pilot were agreed and the Public Bill Office was tasked with preparing
a memorandum evaluating the pilot. That was published as part of the
Procedure Committee’s report, so I will not attempt to summarise
it. The memorandum led the Procedure Committee to recommend a system of

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:20:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)—a gamekeeper turned
poacher in this respect. He referred to Short money being available to
the official Opposition. That is true, but he will remember that when
we were in opposition, even with Short money, there was difficulty
dealing with the volume of amendments. I am sure he will also
acknowledge we are now in a coalition Government, and Short money is
not available to the coalition partners. In fact, in many cases when
one of the parties seeks to table an amendment, there is no support for
that at all. I must therefore disagree with my hon. Friend, as I do
with the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:21:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith), who must acknowledge that
simply producing explanatory notes is no guarantee that a Member of

accepted, I think, that the burden would fall heavily on Her
Majesty’s official Opposition, who table a significant
proportion of amendments. It is always best to proceed in this area of
parliamentary reform on the basis of consensus. I am surprised that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:21:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

House decide to go down the mandatory route in future, it would be free
to do so, but it would be on the basis of a fuller consideration of the
burden— 
<?notus-xml column=381?>perhaps with a further pilot on a mandatory basis—and full
consideration of some issues not fully addressed in the report. Those
could include, for example, whether an amendment would be refused for
tabling by the Public Bill Office if it were not accompanied by an
explanatory statement, or if that statement was felt to be in some way
disorderly—that could certainly put the Public Bill Office in a
difficult position. If explanatory statements were made mandatory, more
thought would need to be given to what constitutes adequacy and
accuracy in explanatory statements, and who would rule on such issues.
Those issues could be considered by the House in the future, but it
should not be left to the Chair to consider and rule on such procedural
reforms in the way proposed by the amendment to today’s
motion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110694000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0004.htm#13110694000129">I

Bittern on Thornhill park road in Southampton, but what has happened at
The Bittern has an echo in pub campaigns across the country. In brief,
the point I wish to put to the Minister is that legal loopholes mean
that the intentions of Parliament, which are supported on all sides of

Bittern is a popular community pub on a busy road between two council
estates, in Southampton—Thornhill and Harefield. The next
nearest pub is two thirds of a mile away; and most other pubs are well
over a mile away and serve very different communities. Let me be clear
that The Bittern is not a picturesque country pub; nor is it a bijou
eatery with a bar hoping for its first Michelin star.</hs_Para>

art deco design. Both its interior and exterior are in need of
refurbishment, but it remains largely as it was when it was built. The
distinctive and original Crittall windows are still in place and
functioning, but there are not quite enough of the original features in
place for it to be listed. Yes, the pub could do with a lick of paint
and some sprucing up, and it might not be the pub of choice of all my
constituents, but it is a pub that many local people use and
like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:39:13"></hs_TimeCode>. Some pubs

year, rumours began that the owner, the giant pubco Punch Taverns, was
not going to renew the landlord’s lease and wanted to sell to
McDonald’s. It was no surprise to me that the community wanted
to do everything it could to hang on to its pub. Taking advantage of
new legislation, it decided to get its pub listed as an “asset
of community value”. As the Minister will know, under the
Localism Act 2011, the community would then have the right to exercise
the new community right to bid to try to buy the pub if and when it
came on the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:40:07"></hs_TimeCode>. As he
might also know, the idea of the community right to bid was first put
forward when I was Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, so I am quite attached to the idea of communities being
able 
<?notus-xml column=385?>to buy and run their own pubs. I was delighted, therefore, when the new

legislation.</hs_Para>

value”, a pub needs to be more than a boozer, and the
application stressed the pub’s consistent fundraising for
charities—this is largely a community with more warmth and
generosity than money, but still it regularly raises money for
bereavement charities, cancer research and others—and the fact

intention of the community right to bid is that, once listed, the
community has the chance to raise the money to bid for the pub when it
is placed on the open market. The process does not guarantee
success—it does not force the pub to be sold to a particular
buyer—but it gives people a fair chance to bid and to bring a
new community-owned pub business into play. The reason for this debate
is that that might never happen for The Bittern. The listing process is
rightly public and owners have to be consulted. As the city council
told me, the process has to meet good standards of transparency, audit,
reasonableness and meet the necessary legal
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:42:52"></hs_TimeCode>.
From the outset, the council’s officers took a positive view
both of the principle of the legislation and of the application they
were being asked to consider. They had to consider it objectively, but
this was not a situation, like those I have heard of, where the local
authority was resistant to the idea of listing assets or wanted to make
it as difficult as possible. I will come back to that in a
moment.</hs_Para>

problem is that in order to evade the right to bid, Punch Taverns

been able to move faster—this was the first application it had
received under the Localism Act—it would have had to move with
unrealistic speed to list the pub in the short period between its
receiving the application and an agreement being reached to sell the

Punch Taverns and McDonald’s. There is an exemption from the

third party, including the Save

evidence up and down the country shows that there is a string of
pubs—including the Tumbledown Dick in Farnborough, which is also
being sold to McDonald’s, and the Golden Harp at Maidenhead,
where Tesco is involved—for which communities have achieved

There are examples of sales to developers who then offer to sell back

Plunkett Foundation, which the Government have commissioned to provide

groups seeking the listing of assets of community value are dealing
with an unwilling seller. I want to put on record my thanks, and those
of the community, to the Plunkett Foundation for the advice and support

disappointment, because there is no doubt that the listing of community

from that tonight. The Campaign for Real Ale tells me that more than
200 pubs have been listed. The Plunkett Foundation says that more pubs
have been listed than any other class of community asset. This shows
that there is a huge demand out there for making a real success of the
legislation and the intentions of Parliament.</hs_Para>

organisations also point to problems, however. Some councils have,
unlike Southampton, tried to gold-plate the requirements, imposing a
level of formal and legal status for community bids that is not
required by the legislation. Other cases, such as that of the Albert
Inn in Wyke Regis, have been rejected on the erroneous ground that
there is another pub 700 metres away. CAMRA is also concerned that the
right to bid can be evaded if a pub is sold as a going concern, even if
the purchaser has no real intention of retaining the pub. There is no
ability to freeze the legal status of a pub when the listing process
begins; nor is there any requirement to sell to the community. There
could not be any such requirement to sell to a particular bidder. Those
provisions do not exist in the law at the moment. Councils may use
listing status as a relevant planning consideration, but many do not do
so. Other loopholes are also becoming widely known, including the
leasing of a pub for a period of time in order to evade the provisions
of the law on the community right to bid.</hs_Para>

inevitably, many attempts to get a pub listed as a community asset
begin only when it is realised that a pub is under threat, and the
process gives too wide a window for owners to evade the intentions of
the law. It is not a fair fight when a community such as mine in
Southampton finds itself up against Punch Taverns and
McDonald’s, and something needs to be done to even things up.
Even where a council is as supportive as Southampton was, the onus is
on the community group to get everything right. The owners have the
right to see due process from the council, but they can use the listing
time to evade the intentions of

Minister will agree to an urgent review of the working of the Localism
Act to see whether there are practical ways of closing this loophole.
Perhaps it would be possible, when there is a particular threat, to
place a freeze on the legal status of the pub for a few weeks, to
enable the listing to be considered and to avoid a sale agreement being
entered into. There might be other ways of solving the problem as well.
I have been in Government, and I know that the temptation is often to
wait until the evidence is overwhelming before stepping in, but the
Minister would be well advised to have a look at this matter now;
otherwise, too many community groups will put their efforts into
campaigns that are ultimately fruitless.</hs_Para>

a reasonable assumption is that McDonald’s has agreed to buy,

campaign can hang on to. No planning application has yet been made,
although McDonald’s told the Southern<I> Daily Echo</I> in
August that it had submitted a pre-planning application. Perhaps there
will be legitimate grounds for planning permission to be rejected. If
that happened, perhaps McDonalds would withdraw, and if it did, it

believe Ministers have promised simple guidance on the use of article 4
directions, but will the Minister clarify whether that has been
produced or will be produced? Will he confirm whether an article 4
direction can be used for an individual pub? Will he confirm that the
local authority would need to give a year’s notice of its
intention to use article 4 powers, thus creating another huge window to
evade the community right to bid? Will he confirm, too, that the use of
article 4 exposes a local authority to significant costs—for

wonderful it would be. It pointed out in a letter that if it opened a

with major developers on the disposal of pubs and that individual sales

Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr Denham) on securing the

spoken this evening, and the constructive way in which he engaged with
us on an informal basis beforehand I fully understand both his own
frustration and the frustration that he has expressed on behalf of his
constituents, and I can say to him, as one constituency Member of
Parliament to another, that I understand that frustration for a very
good reason. A similar issue arose six years ago in my constituency
involving the Ashley Court hotel in St Andrews. Although the
local Member of Parliament, both the local councillors and the entire
local community did not want the pub to close, they were powerless to
prevent it from being sold to a property developer. It was subsequently
demolished, and is now a block of

want to describe some of the work that the Government are doing in
recognition of the important role that pubs play in the community, to

the Members for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland) and
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:56:59"></hs_TimeCode>for Burton

Members on both sides of the House in raising the issue of pubs in the
community—and, indeed, the price of beer. As always, that
subject featured on Budget day, when the Chancellor scrapped the beer
duty escalator as well as cutting beer duty, shaving 4p off the average
pint. The right hon. Gentleman will know how difficult negotiations
with the Treasury can be, but on this occasion even the Treasury was
helpful to
pubs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:57:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110694000344" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0004.htm#13110694000344">The
Government have also made it easier for pubs to host live music
performances, so that they can provide the entertainment which, the

extended the doubling of small business rate relief from October 2010
to March 2014.</hs_Para>

main issues raised by the right hon. Gentleman concerned the rights
conferred by the Localism Act 2011. I am grateful to him for paying
tribute to the Government for implementing ideas which I understand
that he may have supported when he was Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government three or four years ago. These are
early days: the Act is still very new, and the community rights
conferred by it have existed only since September last year. However,
as I told the House on another occasion when dealing with a similar
issue relating to high streets, more than 550 assets have so
far been listed by communities across England as assets of community
value, and I know that the list is growing daily. I do not know whether
the right hon. Gentleman follows his former Department on Twitter, but
if he were to do so, he would see that nearly every day another asset
is added to the local register. The Department is pleased to
acknowledge the work that is being done by communities throughout the
country.</hs_Para>

Campaign for Real Ale, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, has
been very active in this regard. Yesterday I met representatives of
CAMRA and other organisations with which the Department wants to work
in order to promote community rights such as this. CAMRA has produced
its own leaflet explaining how to help communities that want to promote
their 
<?notus-xml column=390?>local pubs as an asset of community value, and I commend it for doing
so. Many pubs have exercised these community rights. The first asset to
be listed was The Ivy House pub in Nunhead, which is in the
constituency of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T20:59:47"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman). There are
many other examples. There is a long list on the CAMRA website. The
Rose and Crown in Slaley in Hexham has now been purchased by the
community. Not only was it registered as an asset, but it has gone on
to be purchased. The Anglers Rest in Bamford in the Peak district is
now a community-owned pub. Across the country communities have been
able to take advantage of this legislation, not only to preserve the
pub in their community but to take on the ownership and
management.</hs_Para>

Government have given real practical support to bring this about. There
is not just legislation. We have put £19 million on the table to
support partners such as Pub is the Hub and the Plunkett Foundation, so
they can engage with communities and make sure they know what these
rights are and how to exercise
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T21:00:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110694000348" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0004.htm#13110694000348">This
right has to balance the rights of the community with those of the
owners of the property. Getting something on to the register does not
automatically give communities the assets they want. Indeed, this was
never the Government’s intention. Judging by the right hon.
Gentleman’s remarks, he understands that in a free society we
cannot completely fetter the property rights of someone who owns the
pub, however objectionable we might think their business practices are.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T21:01:31"></hs_TimeCode>The community
rights bid does give communities a better chance to bid for an asset
they value in their local community,
however<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T21:01:43"></hs_TimeCode>. The

right hon. Gentleman talked about planning policy, and he mentioned
change of use. The Government have set out a clear and consistent set
of objectives for planning reform. We want local communities to
exercise power and to promote sustainable development, but permitted
development rights have existed in the planning system for a long time.
As a councillor in Bristol for the city centre district in the
mid-1990s, I campaigned for a reform in the planning use classes at
that time, when pubs and restaurant were together in the A3 use class.
Fortunately, later on that use class was divided into A3 and A4, and
pubs sit in the A4 use class. That means that under permitted
development rights pubs can go up from A4 to A3—and I believe
McDonald’s would be classified as a
restaurant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T21:02:58"></hs_TimeCode>—although
planning permission may be required for associated building
works<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T21:03:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110694000350" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0004.htm#13110694000350">The
right hon. Gentleman referred several times to article 4. Local
planning authorities can achieve objectives outside the use class
system by bringing forward an article 4 direction, and this can be used
to protect community assets such as public houses. In the last year
three planning authorities have made directions under article 4
specifically to control the development of public houses. Two of these
directions have been used to prevent demolition, and the third is in
regard to a change of
use<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T21:03:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110694000351" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0004.htm#13110694000351">The
right hon. Gentleman asked about the geographical extent of an article
4 direction. It can be as specific as a single piece of land and a
single building, or it can be across the entire local authority
area—Southampton in his case. He also asked about costs that
might be visited upon the planning authority. Because an article 4
direction 
<?notus-xml column=391?>reduces the normal planning rights of a property owner, if they
subsequently have to apply for planning permission because of an
article 4 directive, they do not have to pay a planning fee. To that
extent, there is indeed a cost to the local authority.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110694000352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0004.htm#13110694000352"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T21:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>Thirdly,
the right hon. Gentleman asked me whether compensation would be
payable. The advice I have for him is that that possibility can be
mitigated if a planning authority gives sufficient notice. Indeed,
Bristol has recently brought in an article 4 direction to control the
spread of houses in multiple occupation and it gave 12
months’ notice. Over the past two years, 270 article 4
directions have taken place. He also asked about guidance on article 4,
and the Department has been moving on that. A review of guidance was
undertaken by Lord Taylor of Goss Moor and that has been published
online for comments. The period for those closed in October and the
Department is considering what more to do.</hs_Para>

entirely sympathise with the points that the right hon. Gentleman was
making. I was glad that he paid tribute to the community rights that
have been put in place, and I am sorry that on this occasion they were
not able to help his constituents. However, the Government do want to
work with organisations such as CAMRA and others that want to protect
the use of the pub and other community assets. Our message is not to
wait for a threat but to move now. That is what CAMRA is advising its
members up and down the country to do. We are saying, “Do not
wait for a threat. Move now to list your asset of community
value.” That will provide the protection that the Localism Act
affords.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110694000354" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/debtext/131106-0004.htm#13110694000354"><I>Question

Alan Meale</B> (Mansfield) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure  to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hollobone. We have known each other
for a long time, and I am grateful to you for being here today. I am
also grateful for the opportunity to hold this debate on a matter that
causes acute concern in my constituency and many other mining
constituencies across the length and breadth of Britain. Many Members
either have a direct interest in the people and the pits concerned, or
represent people who have moved to their constituencies from mining
towns.</hs_Para>

begin, I want to make a complaint. Yesterday morning, I was contacted
by the BBC about the debate. I was told that the BBC wanted to cover
the whole issue on television and radio, and that someone would contact
me later in the day, which they did. The problem was that they rang up
late last night and changed the whole basis of the programme, and I was
told that it would now cover energy prices, MPs’ expenses and
concessionary coal, which are entirely different matters. It is
appalling that the BBC has not treated the matter as seriously as it
should have done, and I want to put that on record.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110648000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110648000008">Let me set
out the background to this debate. Since the collapse of UK
Coal—the company that the Government chose to run the coal
industry—after a fire in Daw Mill pit a few months ago, most of
the mining jobs have been lost and the liabilities are at risk, which
are both very serious. That occurred because during the nationalisation
of the coal industry, liabilities were transferred from the public
sector to the private sector under TUPE arrangements. As I recall, my
hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner), and my hon. Friend
the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery), who is sitting next to me, warned
some months ago of the collapse of the company and the subsequent
fallout. They predicted that unless immediate action was taken, the
scenario that we have seen would come about. I am grateful to them for
that prediction, but it is sad that they have been proved
correct.</hs_Para>

Minister that when the Government privatised coal mining in
Britain—against the wishes of those who worked in the industry,
retired from it, or lived or ran businesses in communities around it,
and against the wishes of the vast majority who expressed an opinion on
the matter—they promised to honour all obligations and to
guarantee them after the transfer, so that the obligations were at no
risk whatever. It is clear from debates at the time that they were
regarded by the Government as obligations governed by collective
agreements established since nationalisation in 1947, but particularly
negotiated in the ’60s, ’70s and
’80s.  
<?notus-xml column=76?>Indeed, it can be argued that some of the agreements date back to the
beginning of the last century, and I will provide some examples of that
later.</hs_Para>

say that the obligation to provide concessionary coal represents a
benefit in kind, but it is no such thing. It is a negotiated
arrangement by which a portion of the coal dug was pooled for
concessionary coal deliveries, both at the time and in the future, to
anybody who had worked in the industry for more than a specified number
of years. People sometimes speak of the concessionary coal purely as a
benefit when it has, in fact, already been earned.</hs_Para>

that the Minister is likely to argue that his Department has no legal
obligations to UK Coal or the individuals concerned, but I fervently
dispute that. I believe that the Department has a moral and financial
responsibility to those who were promised concessionary fuel as part of
their employment package, and who now find themselves at sea. The
national concessionary fuel scheme for employers was never designed to
be put at risk. No agreement on privatisation would have been reached
in this place if Members had thought that the arrangements might ever
be put at risk. That is why the Government made it perfectly clear in
Bill Committee and on the Floor of the House that they regarded that
obligation as an essential part of the privatisation arrangements. I do
not think that anybody who was involved in that would assert anything
to the contrary.</hs_Para>

both sides of the Chamber want to participate in the debate, so I will
be fairly brief, but I want to look at the facts. More than 2,000

Gentleman on securing this important debate. Constituents from
Swadlincote, Woodville and Netherseal have contacted me about this
issue. We have had meetings with the Minister, and letters have gone
backwards and forwards. The hon. Gentleman makes a really important
point about the fact that the resources have been set aside for future
payments. The workers did not take that as pay at the time; it was set
aside, and the coal would be there, or they would receive cash in hand,
later on. Some of my constituents live in properties with coal-fired
central heating. They do not have gas, and there is no other way of
heating their property, so what are they supposed to do? The situation

make too much of this, but I know  about such illnesses because
my grandfather died of pneumoconiosis when I was six years old. He had
to be taken away from his home because he was in such pain, and he
lived for about six weeks in hospital care before he died. He drowned
in his own blood; his lungs collapsed. We are talking about not one
miner, but hundreds. We can see the seriousness of the issue from the
fact that among the 2,000 mineworkers that we are discussing, there are
an awful lot of widows. The proportion of widows is much higher than it
would be if we were talking about any other industry. Mineworkers die
on the job; their lives are shortened by the work that they do, and we
should be proud of them and support them in their old age. We should

are the costs of the scheme? The Government are getting away with this
cheaply. In 1994-95, they received £800 million from the private
sector in the privatisation of the coal industry. There are surpluses
in the miners’ pension scheme and the British Coal staff
superannuation scheme. I was a Minister in the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions, and every year we talked about
how much the surplus was worth. We formed and built the Coalfield
Communities Campaign out of some of the reserves. There are hundreds of
millions of pounds of surplus every year. The Government have taken
that, both before and after privatisation, and that is a scandal,
because that money should be paid to the miners who earned it, although
that is another matter. The Government should make arrangements to
settle the matter from that money. The estimated cost of picking up the
concessionary fuel liability in its entirety is £34 million. If
we are talking about hundreds of millions of pounds every year and the
Treasury gaining £800 million from the denationalisation of
coal, a mere £34 million is not very much. The Minister knows
that the administrative structure is already in place, so no additional
cost is attached to sorting this matter
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110648000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110648000020">I
know that this does not directly come under the subject that we are
discussing, but workers have also lost 10% of their pension because of
the demise of UK Coal. Now their concessionary fuel will be lost.
Either loss is too much. Many of them had previous service in the
nationalised industry. Some worked loyally for the Conservative
Government during the strikes of 1984-85. I did not agree with that,
but they did not stand idly by; instead, they supported the Government
in keeping the pits open. Many of the people involved in this matter 
<?notus-xml column=78?>are the same people who were involved then. A lot of them are thankfully
in a different organisation now,  but they showed loyalty to
the Government, and the Government should begin to think about how they

that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110648000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110648000021">I
will help the Minister: it is not just the 1994 Act that he can use.
The European Council made a decision on 10 December 2010 on state aid
to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines. That allowed the
Government to make provision to ensure that key liabilities were
transferred from past employers to any new entity, and were funded, so
that UK Coal’s former contractual obligations were met,
including those on pensions and concessionary fuel. It is therefore not
true that nothing can be done. The EU decision allows the Government to
make the payments outside the statutory system. The question is whether
they will. It is possible, legal, just and fair. Let’s do
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110648000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110648000022"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13110648000082" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110648000082">Several

Hayes), who was the Minister’s predecessor and who played an
active role. It was a tragic position with enormous financial pressure
on UK Coal. There was a moment when I worried that we were about to
lose all those jobs, and the implications of that would have been
enormous. Thankfully, with the support of the ministerial team and the
work of UK Coal and a number of others, we were able to secure those

“benefits”, because the hon. Member for Mansfield said we
should not call them that, but the scheme was part of the terms and

did the right thing. We have a moral obligation to assist those who
worked in the mines, as well as their spouses who might be widowed and
find themselves under enormous pressure. As my hon. Friend the Member

want to do that, because his whole lifestyle revolved around getting
out of bed in the morning, lighting the fire and heating his water. His

concessionary fuel arrangement is not, as many people suggest, a
benefit; it is a hard-earned entitlement. It is not a free

underground. When people started work at the pit, they immediately got
concessionary fuel, if they had a house and no one else in the house
had the entitlement. They got fuel immediately, but we are talking
about a lifetime entitlement. It had to be earned through years of
service, so that when they finished work—many miners finished
young, in their 40s and 50s, not too long ago—they had at the
back of their mind their entitlement to fuel because they had worked
the required amount of years listed in the national concessionary fuel

crux of the issue is fairness. I represent many ex-miners, some who
retired before privatisation happened in 1994, some who retired after
1994 and some who have just been made redundant. From my experience of
discussing these issues with them, I know that most  of them
have spent all their lives since school working in the mining industry.
In fact, many of those who have just been made redundant started
working in the industry well before 1994, and many of my constituents
who have been affected were members of the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers. They were the miners who, in 1984, ignored the calls from
Arthur Scargill to try to hold the country to ransom; they supported
other people across the country by crossing picket lines; and they went
into work and got coal out of the ground in Warwickshire.</hs_Para>

people who left the industry before 1994 have statutory protection;
they are still receiving their coal allowance or, if they decided to
trade in that coal allowance, their fuel allowance. However, all the
people who I represent who either retired from the mining industry
after 1994 or who have recently been made redundant have now stopped
receiving their concessionary coal allowance or concessionary fuel
payments. We need to bear in mind that many of them are pensioners on
fixed incomes who rely heavily on the allowance to 
<?notus-xml column=85?>heat their homes. As hon. Members have already alluded to, many of them
still have coal-fired heating systems and, indeed, many of them live in
ex-pit houses, many of which are not the best

but it might be a good thing if my right hon. Friend the Minister could
raise the issue on behalf of my constituents who are affected, and I
sincerely hope that when our right hon. Friend the Chancellor is able

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:16:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Mansfield (Sir Alan Meale), for calling for and securing
this timely debate. I hope that the Minister, who is listening hard to
his party’s MPs, is already mulling over how the
Government’s commitment to abolish green taxes will only mean
anything in reality when Harworth colliery is reopened and re-mined.
The coal there—there is enough for at least 30 years, and the
possibility of more, if more shafts are sunk in the mine, which is on
my constituency’s Lincolnshire border—would provide him
with the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that the Government are
serious about that commitment.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:17:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) has already spoken about them.
Some legal settlements relating to accidents incorporated the issue of
concessionary coal, and therefore the obligation for that sub-group or
subset will almost certainly fall legally on the Government. That is
because those people who had accidents—by definition, through no
fault of their own—including some of my
constituents,  
<?notus-xml column=86?>settled for an amount from the National Coal Board based on
concessionary coal being part of their compensation. For that subset of
people, the Minister has no choice. I hope that common sense will be
used, and that they do not have to waste our time and his, or pay legal
costs to pursue compensation through the
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:18:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000004">I

Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron) to speak. However, I
must mention the issue of gas. In Bassetlaw, which is in north
Nottinghamshire, 6,000 properties are without access to gas, so using
gas is not an option for their owners. Indeed, some of those
properties, which include terraced properties, could not safely have
oil either. With fuel poverty, sometimes a calculated choice is made,
but often there is no choice at all. Indeed, I and others have battled
to get gas to particular streets, in order to provide that choice for
those who want it, but the costs involved are prohibitive, because
installing a gas main is not the cheapest thing in the world, and
villages may be many miles away from other
places<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:19:34"></hs_TimeCode>. For
many, when it comes to fuel poverty, there is no
choice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:19:43"></hs_TimeCode>. The most
vulnerable, and the most vulnerable to fuel poverty, are among my
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000005">Further

because the term “concessionary coal” suggests a
give-away or perk, but the coal is part of the employment conditions
and part of the pension. A good comparator would be Ministers and
Members of Parliament who require remuneration for a second home. They
need a second home to do the job and rightly are not
taxed—indeed, they get the money back—on something that
is legitimately used to do the job. It is right and proper that that is
not a taxable benefit. There are many other areas of life where there
are similar comparators. Exactly the same applies to concessionary
coal. It is not a perk; it is part of the retirement
pension<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000006">I
have only two more things to say, but one will take a little time.
First, though, I want to refer to the letter recently received by my

Hall has received what has twice been described by the administrator as
a “generous offer”. He is being offered two sacks of
coal—not a week, a month or a year, but two sacks  of
coal for the rest of his life. He wants me to make the point that he

Hall’s offer generous. By comparison it is, but a country in
which people living in fuel poverty are given two sacks of coal for

have, or that the Minister aspires to have. I am sure that he would not
want that to be part of his legacy as a

second and final issue of substance that I wantj to raise
is a matter that I have referred this week— the Minister
has been copied in to the letter; it will be 
<?notus-xml column=87?>arriving—to the Serious Fraud Office. I hope that the Minister,
not now but in the next few days and weeks, will investigate this
fully. I do not believe that the splitting up of UK Coal has been done
properly. I am not referring to the old logo being used in adverts at
the moment, because that is peripheral. The company was split in two on
10 December. The land assets were put into a separate company called
Harworth Estates Property Group Ltd, and that is where the value
is—the huge value of those land assets—because this
Government and Her Majesty’s Opposition are keen on house
building, and they want the houses built in places such as Harworth.
These are former coal sites, brownfield sites. There would be
consensus, if the relevant Ministers were here, on building housing in
these places. They would be saying, “Yes, this is exactly the
kind of land on which we want to see lots of houses.” It is a
huge asset—a fortune—that this company is sitting
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:24:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000010">I
am not an expert on the legalities of splitting up companies, which is
why I have referred the matter to the Serious Fraud Office and to the
Minister, but I am pretty sure that people have to be honest about the
values of companies. On 10 December, the company was split. I have with
me a planning application dated 14 December. The planning application
is from UK Coal Mining Ltd—a company that does not appear to
exist any more or, if it does, is the one that we are talking about
today, which owes the miners the money and the coal. The application is
dated 14 December—four days later. This was over a weekend, so
it was even fewer working days later. It is a planning application to
Bassetlaw district council for 996 houses and other employment
opportunities that was put in by this company. The profit on just this
one piece of land is worth more than the money required for these
miners and widows for the rest of their lives, and the application was
put in a few days
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000011">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:25:45"></hs_TimeCode>
reason why I have referred the matter to the SFO is that things have to
be done in the open when company changes are taking place, as far as I
am aware, and I see on the application that the box has been ticked,
and the officers have been named, for pre-planning application
discussions. A little fee has been paid to Bassetlaw council, and there
have been discussions with three named officers. Documents that I have
seen demonstrate that the applicants are told that they will get
approval. They know that the council, which is required by Government
to have housing, wants housing built in that place. These people put
the application in, having split up the
company<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:26:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000012">Which<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:26:36"></hs_TimeCode>
half of the company will see the profits from this when the application
is in the name of UK Coal Mining

to me very straightforward, and this is where we will need Government
intervention. It will need to be the bit that owns the liability,
because it seems to me that that is the name in which the application
has gone in. It is the basis on which these people split the company
up, and the basis on which they approached people, including me, to
argue the case for developing the land assets in order to allow the
mining operations to

went to my council of many years and persuaded it that what we want is

redacted copy of the application, but I see that it was put in by the
applicant just days after the split-up. If that is not fraud, I do not
know what is. These people have split a company up, knowing that there
is a hidden value there—because they have had the discussions
with the council—that needs to be built into the calculations.
That value should be with the part of the company with the liability.
They should not be allowed to get away with this. I am looking forward
to hearing how the Minister will tackle his obligations and give the
guarantees, in the language and detail that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer used yesterday, and also how he will hold to account these

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:41:41"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr Hayes), following the
fire at Daw Mill and the break-up and liquidation of UK Coal. During
that time, the Minister’s predecessor, Members from across the
House, representatives of the unions and others were involved in a
number of discussions, which primarily focused on securing the jobs. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:42:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

raised about the liabilities and the potential effects on the people we

is worth reflecting on the point that this issue has been raised on
both sides of the Chamber this morning, by people who do not
necessarily normally agree with each other on a number of issues.
However, given today’s comments, the Minister will be aware that
there is a unanimous view that the situation we are discussing is

was looking at a written answer from the Minister from June, which
demonstrated that the number of households in receipt of concessionary
fuel under obligations on the Department of Energy and Climate Change
fell from 132,158 in 2003 to 70,419 in 2013, for obvious reasons.
However, between 2012 and 2013, it fell from 75,061 to 70,419, so the
number of people we are talking about is approximately half the fall in
the 
<?notus-xml column=92?>number of households in receipt of concessionary fuel under the current
DECC scheme. It is worth making that point about the scale of what we
are talking about, because the number of people entitled to
concessionary fuel under the scheme as part of DECC’s
obligations fluctuates and falls. DECC may well make projections of
those numbers, but it may not be absolutely sure what they are, so if
we are talking about 2,000 people, that should borne in mind in
relation to DECC’s larger liabilities.</hs_Para>

point made almost in passing by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:44:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Selby and Ainsty (Nigel Adams), and, in a different context, by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:44:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:44:22"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron), about some of the
other liabilities and unpaid debts of the remaining parts of UK Coal,
particularly to small and local businesses. That is an important point,
although it does not relate directly to the concessionary scheme.
Ministers would normally say that this is a matter for the Department
for Business, Innovation and Skills, but given that the Minister is
also a Minister in BIS, he can perhaps give us an answer.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110649000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000046"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:44:48"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
what assessment has DECC made of the impact of the loss of the national
concessionary fuel scheme on ex-employees and on fuel poverty, because
the Department has responsibility for those issues? As we have heard, a
significant number of people are off the gas grid and have no
alternative to the scheme. Their situation in relation to fuel poverty
will be significantly affected by the liquidation of UK Coal and the
ongoing issue we are dealing with.</hs_Para>

the Member for Wansbeck (Ian

to, is a sign that, although there are, as my hon. Friends have shown,
potentially legal powers available to the Minister, as well as duties
and responsibilities he can use, the Government recognise that there is
a moral responsibility that goes beyond those issues. Ministers have to
be careful when people start making arguments about moral
responsibilities on the Government, but I underline that we are talking

legal responsibility. Of the 2,000 people concerned, the majority are
injured, ill or widowed. For those who are ill with silicosis,
pneumoconiosis, emphysema and other such illnesses, the effects build
up over a number of years. They would have contracted their illness in

to the debate, which has been passionate at times, but none the worse
for that. I certainly recognise that the consequences of the
fire  at the Daw Mill colliery have been deeply felt in the

I turn to the specific issues around concessionary fuel entitlements, I
want to report more broadly on our response to the events that followed
the fire. The fire began on 22 February, but the colliery had been at
risk of closure since March 2012, and its operators, UK Coal Operations
Ltd, had previously stated that they anticipated production would
cease, possibly on a temporary basis, in early 2014. Unfortunately, the
severity of the fire accelerated that timetable, and, as colleagues
know, on 7 March, the company felt forced to announce the
colliery’s
closure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:49:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000053">It
was clear from the outset that UK Coal’s management wanted to
identify a way forward to secure the ongoing viability of the remaining
business within the parameters of the law and propriety. There was a
role for my Department in proactively supporting—yes,
supporting—the directors of the company and their advisers to
find a solution and to safeguard as many jobs as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000054">Over
nearly five months in which UK Coal required support, officials from my

Departments and agencies involved, including Her Majesty’s

local level, BIS West Midlands and Jobcentre Plus met local authorities

of the closure on employees, local businesses and the communities that
were directly involved. As right hon. and hon.

events, attended by large numbers of the Daw Mill work force. Jobcentre

national information sources and resources.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T10:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>I firmly believe

the fact that UK Coal underwent a major restructuring in 2012, it soon
became apparent, following the Daw Mill closure, that a viable future
for the remainder of the company and its employees would be achieved
only through further substantial restructuring of the business. So
while it was, on the face of it, disappointing when on 9 July the
company announced that it had entered administration, it was clear to
me that that was the only way the business could secure a viable way
forward.</hs_Para>

as part of the administrative process, the Daw Mill mine was
disclaimed, which resulted in its transfer to the Coal Authority and to
the Crown, under law. That approach is consistent with insolvency
procedures and the terms of the licence. The Coal Authority, as it
would with any colliery where the licence had been disclaimed, has
assumed responsibility for securing the site and ensuring that there
are no public safety implications. I reassure right hon. and hon.
Members, with respect to the new fire that broke out last week at the
colliery, that additional controls and safety measures have been put in
place to contain it and disperse the smoke.</hs_Para>

addition, the authority is responsible for settling any future
subsidence claims by way of security bonds previously lodged with it by
the mining companies. As a result, about 2,000 jobs were secured at UK
Coal’s two remaining deep mines at Kellingley and Thoresby and
at six surface mining operations; an innovative plan was developed by
the directors of the company with the Pension Protection Fund, which
also provided PPF protection on accrued benefits for employees. That
led to the remaining mining operations being successfully restructured
and their assets held in individual companies owned by a new business,
which now operates as UK Coal Production Ltd.</hs_Para>

the business and the majority of the work force, the directors and
administrators had to take hard and, in many cases, unenviable
decisions. It is obviously regrettable that job losses ensued and that
many people continue to suffer as a consequence of those decisions, and
I would not want to belittle that. However, I suggest that what
happened was the “least worst” course of action to secure
the future of the remaining

That can be paid only for mines that were pre-notified to the European
Commission prior to the expiry of the coal state aid decision in 2010.
Neither Daw Mill nor any other UK mines fell into that 
<?notus-xml column=95?>category. Several hon. Members mentioned pensions, and I am happy to
debate the coal pension schemes. The taxpayer, of course, has benefited
from surpluses in the past. However, scheme members have also benefited
from above-inflation increases of more than 20% since privatisation.
They continue to have a cast iron assurance that the cash values of
those pensions will never fall.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) wrote to me, but I have not yet
seen his letter and I cannot pre-judge what the Serious Fraud Office
might say about the issues he raises. However, I understand that the
further restructuring this year involves much of the value of the group
property being channelled precisely to support the pensions for
employees and former employees.</hs_Para>

to concessionary fuel, it is important to understand the distinction
between the national concessionary fuel scheme operated in my
Department for the benefit of former employees of the British Coal
Corporation, and private concessionary schemes operated by private
sector coal companies, including UK Coal. Although they have a common
administrator, they are governed by different arrangements. My
Department’s obligations are governed by the national
concessionary fuel agreements, which take the form of collective
arrangements made between British Coal and the mining unions in the
1980s.</hs_Para>

British Coal was sold in 1994, the clear aim was to encourage a
competitive industry to flourish free of the constraining influences of
public ownership. It was therefore necessary to consider what, if any,
of the corporation’s past legacy it would be reasonable and fair
to expect private sector purchasers to bear. Among the things
considered was the liability for the provision of concessionary fuel to
former employees of British Coal and their widows or widowers who met
the necessary criteria. It was decided that responsibility for those
obligations should remain in the public sector, and they were therefore
transferred to my predecessor Department in early 1995.</hs_Para>

is no obligation on the Government to fund private schemes that were
the responsibility of private companies, and I do not accept that
section 19 applies in the present instance. Our firm view is that, the
liabilities having already been transferred to successor companies by
the restructuring scheme, they cannot be transferred again through the
same mechanism. I also have to consider not only the purposes and aims
of privatisation but the wider context in which employees in other
sectors regrettably lose entitlements to benefits on the failure of
their former employer.</hs_Para>

real conclusion, but it cost £5 million and it deliberated for
three years. Perhaps that was one of its failures—it did not get
down to the business quick enough and trailed a bit. There was also a
lot of anguish on the other side—the carers and teachers
accused—but of course in such an operation the innocent
sometimes have to suffer, which is

police started a trawl, which involved them going to interview at least
1,800 children in Northumberland homes, trying to get some information.

people by then. That is what the police were accused of, but in reality

them days and that’s the way it is.” As we know now with

Mrs Evans. Next was Earsdon children’s home, in 1971; the abuse
was neglect, according to case records of an allegation by his mother,
Mrs Priestner, and the abusers were the house parents, whose names he

sexual and the abuser was Mrs Allenby. At the same home,

are unable to live with their families. My Department takes the issue
extremely seriously. I had an adopted brother who was brought up in a

Priestner must feel extremely frustrated about that. If he remains

convictions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000100">The
fact that abuse occurred in the past makes it no less tragic. I am

historical abuse were carried out in England and Wales. Sir William

Timpson:</Member></B> In the first instance, it is for the chief
constable of Northumbria to consider whether there is sufficient new
evidence to reopen the inquiry. We have seen a similar train of events
in north Wales, with Keith Bristow looking at the investigation that
took place there in the 1970s. There is a process to look at any new
evidence and for it to be considered by the chief constable, but the
decision is for her to make.</hs_Para>

reviews that have taken place since the investigations,
considerable reforms in how children homes are run have been
implemented, including significantly improving safeguards to protect
children in children’s homes. All such homes, fostering services
and other settings where children live away from home are now regulated
and inspected by Ofsted to meet national minimum standards set by the
Government. The standards include specific measures, so children are
safeguarded effectively.</hs_Para>

working in or for children’s homes and all foster carers now
have to undergo an enhanced disclosure and barring service check. They
are carefully vetted and monitored to prevent unsuitable people from
working with children. All children’s homes and fostering
services must now have child protection procedures in line with
Government guidance. They have to be submitted for consideration to the
local safeguarding children board and to the local authority designated
office for child
protection.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110649000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110649000105">At
the heart of those procedures are that any complaints of abuse by
children must be taken seriously and investigated in a timely way.
Quite rightly, listening to children’s voices has to be at the
heart of the process. The hon. Member for Blyth Valley mentioned how
the culture and climate seemed to be different in those days. One of
the reasons for that was that children were not listened to. Local
authorities now have a statutory duty to support children in care to
complain if they are concerned about any aspect of the services they
receive.</hs_Para>

extends to ensuring that children have access to independent advocacy.
Each child’s personal independent reviewing officer has a legal
responsibility to ensure that children know about the benefits of
advocacy and are helped to access that when they need it, rather than
when it becomes available. As part of the Government’s
commitment to put the voice of the child at the centre of care
planning, we are funding, over two years, the national youth advocacy
service and Voice to provide an advocacy advice service for children in
care and care leavers across the country, including children in

previous Government appointed a children’s rights director for
England, who was given the statutory duty to carry out regular

reopen the case is a matter for the chief constable of Northumbria

revelations about the exploitation of  children by predatory
adults in their community have demonstrated the particular
vulnerability of children living in children’s homes. That is

accountability on children’s homes providers and local
authorities to ensure that children are safeguarded effectively and
provided with stable and good-quality care. That will be particularly
important where children

interests and will meet their specific needs. We also want to put in

person visiting children’s homes will have a specific
responsibility for assessing the effectiveness of each home’s

for children’s home managers to carry out an annual risk
assessment of the area where their home is located. Where concerns are

those things because I want to ensure that, in the future, only homes
that can deliver high-quality care for our most vulnerable children
will be acceptable, and that all homes will have a remit to strive for
excellence in respect of the children in their care. My aim is to
develop a revised framework for homes that is no longer based on
meeting national minimum standards, but which requires them to set high
aspirations for the children in their care. There is no greater

he feels he has not received the justice he needs. I am afraid that I
am not able to set up an inquiry, as Mr Priestner has

now the most dangerous place in the world to be a journalist.
Yesterday, I was lucky enough to meet Sandhya, the wife of Prageeth
Eknaligoda, a satirist and journalist who disappeared in 2010. Earlier
this week, the BBC screened an excellent documentary, “The
Disappeared”, which was about the impact of abductions and
secret murders in Ireland during the troubles. Even 40 years
on, victims’ families are haunted by what happened, and their
emotions are still raw. Mrs Eknaligoda’s husband
disappeared just three years ago. The paramilitaries responsible for
his disappearance cannot be dismissed easily as terrorists, as might
have been the case with the IRA; they are agents of the Sri Lankan
establishment.</hs_Para>

Sri Lanka has done next to nothing to help Mrs Eknaligoda to find her
husband. When she reported his disappearance, the case was not
investigated. Instead, she was locked up. Police officers called to
court to account for what happened to her husband routinely fail to
appear. Ministers refuse to answer letters about the case, other than
to acknowledge receipt. Sri Lanka’s chief justice, Mohan Peiris,
blithely told the UN human rights commission that Mr Eknaligoda had
gone abroad, with absolutely no evidence to back up the
claim.</hs_Para>

is not the only one of Sri Lanka’s disappeared. Amnesty reckons
that there have been thousands of disappearances, including at least 39
critics of Sri Lanka’s Government, since 2010. Many are not even
Tamil; Mr Eknaligoda is Sinhalese. Every one of those disappearances is
a tragedy, in a country that is well used to brutality.</hs_Para>

shocking about meeting Mrs Eknaligoda and hearing her story was how
unsurprised I felt about it. Our Government’s complete failure

Britain and hers is a cause célèbre around the world, the

so in 2013… That approach now appears timid. The UK could and
should have taken a more principled stand in 2009, and should have
taken a more robust stand after the 2011 CHOGM in the light of the
continuing serious human rights abuses in Sri

congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford North (Mr Scott) on
securing this timely debate. It is incredibly important, and we have
heard two very moving speeches already. I take on board what my hon.
Friend said about the need for peace and reconciliation, and I agree
with him that before that can be achieved, there has to be justice and
transparency. Although, in my humble judgment, significant progress has
been made in the peace process and in all the work that has been done
since the peace in 2009, there is still significant unfinished business
and many questions remain unanswered. There is a vital need for
justice, transparency and accountability.</hs_Para>

was a grave mistake to give the CHOGM the go-ahead to meet in Colombo.
In 2009, I supported putting on hold the decision on whether the summit
should go to Colombo, and having Perth as the venue for 2011 as an
interim measure. That whole discussion should have continued apace. I
would like the Minister to comment on the decision-making process
within the Commonwealth, and particularly within the secretariat, which
does the heavy lifting work behind the process of selecting the venues,
because a similar situation may occur in the future. Not many
Commonwealth countries are totally unsuitable for hosting a CHOGM,
although one can think of a few, but it certainly should not be going
to Sri Lanka.</hs_Para>

Bellingham:</Member></B> I will come on to that point. Since I started
studying the Commonwealth, and indeed during my time as a Minister at
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, answering for the Commonwealth in
the Commons —when he was a Foreign Office Minister, Lord Howell
had responsibility for the Commonwealth, and my right hon. Friend the
Minister has taken over his work—I have thought that the process
is the wrong way round. The country that hosts a forthcoming CHOGM
should be in the chair in the two years running up to it, rather than
taking over the chair post-CHOGM. That would give it a chance to set
the agenda and work tirelessly on some of the priorities that the
Commonwealth needs to deal with.</hs_Para>

concerned that the Sri Lankan Government will be far too
defensive in their chairmanship of the Commonwealth, and that they may
well use that chairmanship to deflect criticism of some of the
appalling historical abuses discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Ilford North, which have not been accounted for or explained. We must
try to implement a better mechanism to ensure that the chair of the
Commonwealth drives the agenda that the members of the Commonwealth
want.</hs_Para>

Member for Mitcham and Morden mentioned the UN panel of experts. I read
their report, which is highly compelling. They suggested that there
should be a new independent international investigation of the crimes;
that would be a natural extension to the work done by the eminent
persons group in the run-up to Perth. Would it not be an idea for the
Commonwealth to carry out an independent international investigation of
those crimes, as recommended by the UN panel of experts? Will the
Minister put that suggestion to the Commonwealth? It would be a good
way of ensuring that the Sri Lankan Government concentrated on things
that matter, and their involvement in the process would be one stage
removed, because the investigation would be carried out by the
Commonwealth.</hs_Para>

it is incredibly important that we take a positive view post-CHOGM,
because the Commonwealth has an important future. It must concentrate
more on trade, commercial diplomacy and the potential for foreign
direct investment between Commonwealth members. After all, it is an
organisation that encompasses a vast number of people—at the
last count, in excess of 2 billion —and total trade
between members of some $3 trillion. There is potential for increasing
that trade, and using trade and business to break down barriers between
communities; for underpinning peace processes; and, above all, for
helping to bring about justice and reconciliation. Sri Lanka needs
wealth creation and prosperity, but it also needs answers to the
questions that have been raised. The Commonwealth can turn what I
believe was a mistake into something that will be positive for the
future.</hs_Para>

comes to Commonwealth principles. I have visited Sri Lanka twice in the

solicitors, senior police officers and soldiers, Sri Lankan diplomats,
members of civil society and ordinary citizens. My office staff have
flown to Moscow to meet Khuram’s girlfriend, who was raped. I

clear about why this is an example of the breakdown in the rule of law
and why President Rajapaksa is not an appropriate person to chair the
Commonwealth. One of the key murder suspects—the alleged
ringleader at the murder scene—has already been connected to the
murder by DNA reports. He is chairman of the local council in Tangalle
and an active member of the ruling party. He was suspended from the
ruling party, but he was quickly reinstated. People in the Southern
province of Sri Lanka, including British nationals to whom I have
spoken, will tell you that the key murder suspect is a creature of the
President and delivers votes for the President’s party. Since no
case has come to court, the suspect has become emboldened and, indeed,
more violent in the area. He has nothing to fear, because he has the
protection of the President. That is why a trial has not yet taken
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110679000080">I
conclude with this final concern: the Commonwealth cannot allow the
CHOGM to become just an opportunity for President Rajapaksa to showcase
Sri Lanka. It also has to be used to shine a light on the failures of
his regime and to push for change. We are not only on the verge of a
British Prime Minister flying over 5,000 miles to shake hands with a
President who is protecting the murderer of a British national; we are
on the verge of the Commonwealth being led by someone who has no regard

I am listening with great interest to what other Members have said, and
that will become apparent at the end of my speech. At the CHOGM, people
will rightly talk about poverty alleviation, education, access to water

one subject that does not get much attention is lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender rights. In parts, the Commonwealth is
failing on that.</hs_Para>

Commonwealth, 40 countries still criminalise aspects of LGBT life. Of
those 40 countries, 14 are in Africa, eight in Asia, seven in Oceania
and 11 in the Americas. One of them is Pakistan, where consensual
same-sex relations carry a maximum penalty of death. Just think of that
for a second: death. Alongside that, Bangladesh, Barbados, Guyana,
Singapore and Uganda all have a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
for consensual same-sex relations. That is in stark contrast to some
Commonwealth countries that have made great strides. South Africa is
one of them. Same-sex marriage was allowed there in 2006, which was
well ahead of the United Kingdom, where same-sex marriage was allowed
this year. Earlier this year, I watched footage of the New Zealand
Parliament passing similar legislation. I had a 
<?notus-xml column=115?>tear in my eye when I saw people in the public gallery singing after
that legislation was passed. That is in stark contrast to what
is happening in many other Commonwealth countries. The final
communiqué from the CHOGM of 2011 does not overtly refer to LGBT
rights at all. One part urges members to consider becoming party to all
major international human rights instruments, and to implement fully
the rights and freedoms set out in the universal declaration on the
human genome and human rights and so on. If we scratch the surface of
that, we all know what that means. We also know that if there had been
an attempt to put LGBT rights overtly in the communiqué in 2011,
there would not have been a communiqué. We all know how it
works; we have all been in international forums in which we have had to
agree communiqués. I hope that the opportunity will be taken in
2013 to be far more overt about the progress that can be made in Sri
Lanka.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0001.htm#13110679000084">One

Gardiner</B> (Brent North) (Lab):</Member> In 2012, the FCO identified
Sri Lanka as a country of concern in its annual human rights and
democracy report, admitting there had been some “negative
developments”. The report highlighted the number of
abductions and disappearances, as well as the intimidation of human
rights defenders, members of the legal profession and the media.
Meanwhile, President Rajapaksa has repeatedly rejected demands for an
international inquiry into alleged war crimes, including from the Prime
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:12:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000098">In
August 2013, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay,
visited Sri Lanka and noted the country’s worrying
“authoritarian turn”. What concerns me is that there is a
sense of complicity on the part of our own Government with what is
going on in Sri Lanka, where we see the deepening and embedding of
corruption, injustice and violence. I say that because Freedom from
Torture has claimed that, despite the Sri Lankan Government’s
claims of new-found peace, the post-conflict torture of Tamils is
ongoing. The UK Government appear to be complicit, because they have
forcibly removed Tamils back to Sri Lanka, where they know those people
have been met with torture and ill treatment.</hs_Para>

have a strong view—I have not changed it—that the

want to put to the Minister again some of the arguments I have put
elsewhere, including to him at our meeting. First, I hope the Prime

there were war crimes.</hs_Para>

defend the Tamil Tigers—they committed terrible atrocities,
too—but Governments have particular responsibilities, and they
fail them dreadfully. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who I
think is visiting Parliament today, went to Sri Lanka in August. She
was clear in her report that the situation was not improving, but
getting worse. She said she feared that the country was becoming
increasingly authoritarian and that, since the war had ended, democracy
had been undermined and the rule of law eroded.</hs_Para>

I would be grateful if the Prime Minister and Ministers went to Sri
Lanka equipped with a list, based on independent evidence, of the
disappeared, those who have been killed and those who have been 
<?notus-xml column=118?>tortured or harassed. I would like them specifically
to challenge President Rajapaksa and the Sri Lankan Government to tell
us what happened to those people—particularly senior lawyers,
newspaper editors and others who have simply been wiped out.</hs_Para>

I hope we can address the structural need to change the way in which
the Commonwealth works if it is not to become entirely disrespected
over the next two years under the chairmanship of President Rajapaksa.
The idea I have put to Ministers is that we should argue that,
consistent with the Commonwealth charter, there should be a
panel—a small group of, possibly, three people at any one
time—whose job it is to be the Commonwealth’s human
rights panel. They would make sure that, in future, the Commonwealth
does not decide to go to countries that are clearly abusing the
charter’s human rights

I hope we make the strongest representations and engage in the

human rights than the current incumbent.</hs_Para>

2009 decision would have required a consensus among Commonwealth member
states, and it is clear that there was no widespread support for a
change of location. That is why I now believe that it is necessary to
attend the CHOGM to support the Commonwealth as an institution that
matters greatly to Britain, to try to ensure that there is a positive
outcome to the meeting, and to put the situation in Sri Lanka firmly

restore a proper justice system; and ensure that Tamils have basic
human rights, including the right to life and freedom of expression,
movement and assembly. The Government must ensure that the Sri Lankan
Government publish a list of all prisoners and where they are held;
that the International Committee of the Red Cross has access to all
detention centres; that a neutral commission is appointed by the UN to
safeguard property rights  in Tamil areas, and all resettlement
programmes; and that Sri Lanka’s Lessons Learned and
Reconciliation Commission implements the recommendations made in its
interim report more than a year ago. Above all, the Government should
make sure that Sri Lanka complies with the recommendations of the UN
panel of experts report, and arrives at durable justice for the
Tamil-speaking minority. If the Government use the occasion to demand
those changes, they will show real leadership and promote the universal

the Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner) mentioned the Freedom from
Torture freedom of information request and the UK Border

to allegations of torture of people who had been sent back to Sri Lanka

there was no substantiated evidence that people returned there had been
tortured.

the Commonwealth is so important that the British Prime Minister, the

where it is now. Many years ago, the Commonwealth agreed the Harare

have been suspended from or have walked out of the

not giving away any secrets when I say that the British Government
tried to raise these issues in 2009 and subsequently. In a vote in the

de Bois</B> (Enfield North) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure, Mr Amess,
to serve under your chairmanship. Obviously the debate is about the
UK’s presence at the CHOGM. I can understand why so many Members
feel frustrated about the situation, given the big question marks over
the issue of human rights in Sri Lanka. Much praise has been heaped on
Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada, who has decided not to
attend the upcoming summit in protest at Sri Lanka’s human
rights record. Instead, he is sending a Minister from his
Foreign Affairs team. I read his sentiments and agreed with
the main thrust of them. He argued that because the Sri Lankan 
<?notus-xml column=125?>Government had failed to uphold the
Commonwealth’s core values, he should not attend the summit. On
that point, I believe that he is wrong. Indeed, the Canadian opposition
argue that whatever misgivings there are about the host country, the
suggestion that the institutions of the Commonwealth should be
sanctioned by Canada, and by withholding funds, would be misplaced.
That is right. It would be making a false and disingenuous connection
between the merits of a member state and those of the broader and more
important Commonwealth institution.</hs_Para>

the New Democratic party said that if Canada had wanted to send a
stronger message, it could have moved to remove Sri Lanka from the
Commonwealth until there were concrete improvements. I agree, but our
Labour Government supported having Sri Lanka as the home country and
ratified the selection. This Government inherited that decision.
Whether or not Sri Lanka should have been chosen is clearly something
that the Chamber wishes to debate, but Labour must answer for its
decision. Despite the protestations that we hear from Labour Members
now that they are in opposition, when they were in government, they
brought about absolutely no change in the circumstances in Sri Lanka
for the Tamil people.</hs_Para>

all the attention on Canada’s decision, the CHOGM will be well
attended, and rightly so. As the Prime Minister of Australia said, we
do not make new friends by rubbishing or abandoning our old friends. I
know how difficult it might be for some of the Commonwealth countries,
but the conference will proceed with full attendance. The symbolic
absence of Commonwealth Heads of Government may deliver a sense of
satisfaction to opponents of the Government, but is history not
littered with political gestures—boycotts of sporting occasions,
trades and summits? In the end, Governments must talk and then they
must act; it is what they do best. Engaging in Colombo is better than
disengagement.</hs_Para>

saw a time of relative hope in Sri Lanka. The civil war had just ended
and the decision to host the CHOGM was optimistic, but understandable.
As many of us now realise in retrospect and with hindsight, it was the

late stage. I also understand the Government’s reasons for
wanting to attend the CHOGM. The Government argue that it is an
opportunity to 
<?notus-xml column=126?>advance human rights and democracy, and the values
set out in the Commonwealth charter, through dialogue and friendship.

general, such a spotlight is also dependent on media access and
transparency. I suggest to the Government that even at this late stage,
we should question whether the Prime Minister should attend, and we
should make that attendance conditional on four things. First, full and
unhindered access to all parts of the country, including the north, is
needed by not only Ministers and officials but the international media.
Secondly, adequate safeguards and guarantees are needed for those who
speak to international media, Ministers and officials. Thirdly, we need
a rapid assessment of whether we think any progress at all is being
made on, for instance, the recommendations of Sri Lanka’s
Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission. The fourth condition is
about whether the British Government should raise the issue of the
chairmanship of the Commonwealth going forward to 2015.</hs_Para>

and the curtailment of human rights are, if anything, increasing. In

patient confidentiality. The case was later considered in a serious
case review compiled by the local safeguarding children board in
Cornwall. The report highlighted that Ben’s father had
experienced mental health problems for two years and once had
delusional thoughts about his son. The report concluded that no
evidence could be found that mental health staff had considered the
implications for Ben of his father’s return to live at the
family home or considered that Harry’s co-operation with
treatment to manage his delusional and paranoid systems was neither
consistent nor maintained. On the contrary, no agency reported any
child protection concerns regarding Ben or registered any concerns for
his safety at the time of his
death<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:03:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000207">Although
my constituent, Ben’s uncle, remains deeply dissatisfied with
the failure to properly assess the risk to Ben and his mother, or to

The issues cut across several

draw wider attention to some common themes that arise in such cases and

two years ago when Richard stabbed and strangled his wife, before
stabbing and suffocating his sons, aged nine and one. He then set fire
to the family home, dying of smoke inhalation.
Richard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:04:18"></hs_TimeCode> also had

lost his job as a policeman. He killed his wife, Samantha, and
seven-year-old daughter, Genevieve, and he tried to kill his two other
children, Kimberly and Adam, before finally taking his own life. Just
over a decade ago, Robert Mochrie murdered his wife and four children
in Barry, South Wales, before calling the school bus operator to say
that his 10-year-old disabled daughter would not be attending school

which the mother was the murderer. In almost all the cases involving
men, the wife or partner was included in the murders, but in the cases
where the mother committed the crimes, the husband or partner was not a
victim. An example of the latter is the Donnison case in 2010 in
Heathfield, East Sussex, which neighbours the Minister’s

Wilson’s team has suggested that there are certain similarities
that subdivide such crimes into four broad categories.
Anomic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:06:53"></hs_TimeCode> cases are
those in which the family is seen as directly linked to the economic
and financial success of the father. When that is threatened, the
perpetrator responds by seeking to destroy himself, his home and his
entire family. Self-righteous cases are those in which the murderer
blames the mother for a family breakdown. The pre-eminent role of the
father is viewed by the murderer as pivotal to his own image and
concept of family, which causes him to obliterate his family.
Disappointed cases are those in which the father
believes the family have turned against him and,
for 
<?notus-xml column=133?>instance, failed to follow his strictures on family
life or religious matters. Finally, paranoid cases are those in which
the offender harbours mental health delusions about his
family<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:07:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000214"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Andrew Smith" PimsId="732" UID="13110679000442" xid="543" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000442"><B>Mr

must be acknowledged that the incidence of family annihilation is
mercifully low. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children reports that some 60 children a year in England and Wales are
killed by their parents, which is equivalent to about two thirds of all
child murders. The numbers may be small, but child murders still
represent more than 10% of all murders in our country. Although mothers
and fathers are later found to be equally responsible for such deaths,
the circumstances and ages of the killers and of the children killed
are markedly different. Mothers are typically responsible for the
murders of very young children in the aftermath of childbirth, for
instance, because of post-natal depression or post-partum psychosis.
Parliament has long recognised that phenomenon and passed the
Infanticide Act 1938. Older children, however, are much more likely to
be killed by their father. We tend to take small comfort from the idea
that such instances are very rare. We see them as temporary losses of
sanity and done in the heat of the moment when someone snaps. That idea
provides a reassuring framework to explain what would otherwise be
incomprehensible. That may be convenient and reassuring for us, but in
many cases it is just not true. Researchers show that family
annihilations are virtually all premeditated and typically executed
with a chilling calmness and sense of
purpose.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000217">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:10:34"></hs_TimeCode>
trigger for such attacks seems to be, usually, relationship breakdown
or a dispute over children when a relationship might already have
ended. The Birmingham studies have identified a significant rise in
cases of family annihilation during August, in the school holidays, and
at weekends, when children are perhaps being passed from one parent to
another. Half the cases identified by the research related to crimes
committed at

am concerned that the crime statistics do not separately record
incidents of family annihilation, probably because of their rarity.
Statistics are, however, compiled for infanticide, so the argument
about the instance of family annihilation should not exclude
consideration of compiling and publishing such figures. Professor
Wilson has told me that he does not think that his work has been
impeded by a lack of official statistical data, because the cases
typically attract significant press attention, so the internet search
capacity for press stories has tended to highlight most cases for the
purposes of his
research<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:10:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000219">Previous

Psychiatry and Psychology</I>, emphasised the rareness of violence
convictions among those who commit 
<?notus-xml column=134?>such offences. Of 203 cases examined in that study,
only seven involved a killer with a previous criminal record of
violence. That, however, does not tell the whole
story<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:11:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Professor
Wilson has highlighted to me that in many cases subsequent inquests
throw up evidence of some previous domestic abuse. The evidence tends
to come from family or friends, but the abuse had not escalated to the
point of criminal prosecution. That may be another reason why police
forces and the courts should give closer attention to fully recording
details of all accusations of domestic abuse. For too long, clearly,
the domestic dispute has not been taken seriously enough by some
serving police
officers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:11:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000220">For

announcement that Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary is

England and Wales to examine the way in which they approach,
investigate and record cases of domestic violence. I would prefer to
see the review as one of a series of measures better to address the
shortcomings in how we deal with such tragic cases. At the weekend,
<I>The Sunday Times</I> reported that one of the cases the Home
Secretary had in mind in ordering this review was the murder of Rachael
Slack and her two-year old son, Auden, in Holbrook, Derbyshire, three
years ago, by Auden’s father, who later committed suicide. The
father had been treated for mental illness, but we do not know what
information may have been shared by the mental health

annihilation seems to be rarer in the UK than in the USA or in some
parts of Europe, and one of the factors driving that could be our
tougher gun laws. The Birmingham researchers found that in the United
States and some parts of Europe the greater prevalence of such weapons
led to 80% of family murders being carried out with a gun; in the UK,
that number is less than a fifth.
Nevertheless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:12:51"></hs_TimeCode>, we
have seen family annihilation cases in which unstable men had been

Michael Atherton case is one shocking example. The murderer had been
granted a licence for both shotguns and firearms even though he had
been reported for domestic violence on many occasions. In fact, the
weapons had been taken away from him after such an incident, and then
returned. The police officer who had approved his application turned
out to have been running his own dealership in confiscated weapons,
while serving as an officer, which led to him receiving a suspended
prison sentence. Atherton used his weapons to murder his partner and
her relatives before killing
himself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:13:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000223">I
wish to emphasise one further shortcoming. When the perpetrator of such
a crime commits suicide, the duty of the coroner seems to be limited to
identifying how the deceased died and giving verdicts accordingly.
Invariably, the cases are massively distressing for the surviving
relatives, and coroners sometimes seem at pains to be guarded about
saying anything negative about the perpetrator. There is no duty to
undertake any further analysis of the background circumstances or the
state of mind of the perpetrator, except for the purposes of
determining the cause of death and who might have been responsible.
That denies us the opportunity to learn any
lessons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000224">Given
the rare incidence of such cases, it has been suggested that they
should merit a much deeper analysis through what some academics have
called psychological 
<?notus-xml column=135?>autopsy. The true incidence of mental illness as a
contributory factor could be helped by a detailed review of each
case—there are not so many cases, so it should not be an onerous
requirement. Perhaps it should involve examining coroners’
reports and police files, interviewing relatives, friends and contacts
of the deceased, and analysing medical records from hospitals and

themselves or the public, the police should be alerted. That seemingly
reasonable and prudent proposal to improve public safety was later
vetoed by the Information Commissioner on the grounds of patient

is to ensure that we do everything that we can to support local
agencies to reduce the occurrence of such tragic events. To help to

that every local report on a domestic homicide is reviewed and quality
assured by a panel of independent and Home Office experts. I understand
that such a review is ongoing in the case of Kayleigh, Kim and
Kimberley Buckley. Each review results in a tailored action plan that
must be delivered by the area in question to ensure that we learn from
individual tragedies. The Home Office will shortly issue a document
collating the lessons learned from those reviews into a national action

<?notus-xml column=137?>front-line skilled professionals. The guidance clarifies the core legal
requirements, by making it much clearer what individuals and

must do more nationally to reach out to those caught in a cycle of
abuse, which is why the Home Office has piloted two initiatives to
empower victims and to stop domestic abuse in its tracks. The first of
these is the domestic violence disclosure scheme, known popularly as
Clare’s law, which offers the opportunity for anyone to seek
disclosure of a partner’s violent past. Those who have the legal
right to know are provided with information that could save lives,
which empowers them to make an informed choice about their
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000245">Our
second pilot scheme creates a new process to protect victims in the
immediate aftermath of domestic abuse. Domestic violence protection
orders have the power to prevent a perpetrator of domestic abuse from
having contact with the victim for up to 28 days. That offers both the
victim and the perpetrator the chance to reflect on the
incident. It provides the victim with an opportunity to determine the
best course of action to end a cycle of abuse and sometimes stops the
unsatisfactory requirement for them having to leave the house for their
own safety. We are carrying out an evaluation of both of pilots, and we
expect to be able to announce plans for their future this
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000246">The
Home Office has funded a project to improve the understanding of the
different local multi-agency models in place to support the sharing of
information about safeguarding responses for children and vulnerable

point. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:27:07"></hs_TimeCode> am

hon. Friend asked a valuable question about the recording of
statistics. I am happy to reassure him that the Home Office homicide

post-homicide reviews, I understand my hon. Friend’s concern
about the limitations of coroner’s inquests, but I am sure he
will be reassured to hear that coroners are under a legal duty to refer
cases involving the death of children to the local children’s

am sure that my hon. Friend will be pleased about the
Government’s initiation of the domestic homicide review process.
I agree that we must be joined-up in addressing domestic violence,
which is why, for example, I undertook in the House last week to raise

hon. Friend referred to the importance of gun control in the context of
domestic abuse. I am happy to tell him that, as part of the revised
guide on firearms licensing law, we have introduced new, detailed
guidance on firearms and domestic violence for the police that makes it
clear that evidence of domestic violence will generally indicate that a
person should not be permitted to possess a
gun.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000253">So-called
family annihilation seems to transgress the fundamental natural
instinct to protect that we expect a parent to feel for a child.
Understandably, these cases cause shock and outrage, but we must
appreciate the complexity of the circumstances that may contribute to
such tragic outcomes, and continue to co-ordinate a joined-up approach
to tackling child abuse and domestic and sexual violence to protect
those who are most at risk. Through our violence against women and
girls action plan and the national group to tackle sexual violence
against children and vulnerable people, which I now lead, the
Government has made significant strides towards a better reality for
the victims of child and domestic abuse. However, we recognise that
there is still much to do.</hs_Para>

country. For a service built on giving the public the confidence to
sleep soundly at night, that is shockingly low, and that is why I am in

PCCs. So why is there a troubled mandate? Well, the original November
polling day was the worst possible time to hold an election; the large
areas covered by each police authority make traditional campaigning
very difficult; and this was compounded by the Government’s
decision not to use freepost leaflets. It all adds up to a system set

be learned from the developments in Gwent during the past 12 months is
that the PCCs have incredible powers? In Gwent, the chief constable was
in effect dismissed in a way that was legitimate according to the law,
but which negated any kind of natural justice. She was basically told
to retire: “If you don’t retire, you’ll be
sacked.” What is more, that was without any established
employment procedures or practice at all. Again, that was done under
the legislation, but it does create a big question mark, because I do

all the points made by the hon. Gentleman and by other hon. Members
about PCCs and policing, I shall start by talking about the context in
which the PCCs operate. The Government inherited a policing landscape
disconnected from the public. There was a lack of local democratic
accountability, as the public had no direct involvement in the old
police authorities. At the same time, there was too much central
Government interference through centrally imposed targets that stifled
police professionalism and discretion, and there was too little
Government focus on tackling national concerns such as organised
crime.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000286">Reform
was necessary, but it had to take place against a very tough financial
background. Despite that background, we have embarked on the most
radical reform of policing in 50 years. The reform is aimed—PCCs

<?notus-xml column=144?>are central to this—at ensuring that the police are more
responsive to the public and more transparent in their work. I hear
what the hon. Gentleman says about transparency and I will deal with
that in detail in a second. The reform is also aimed at ensuring that
the police are more flexible in their approach and more suited to the
demands of the 21st
century<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:44:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000287">At
this stage, it is clear from the figures that matter that the reforms
are working. Crime is down to the lowest level ever recorded. Let me
narrow the focus to Gwent. In the period from June 2010 to June 2013,
crime in Gwent went down by 29%. In the past year, since the election
of the police and crime commissioner, it has fallen by 4%. I will not
weary hon. Members with the figures for the other three police regions
in Wales, but they are all consistent with that.</hs_Para>

the biggest fall of any of the police regions in Wales, but all of them
show significant falls, both over a three-year period and over the past
12 months. The test that we in the Government put on the
police is now a simple one. We swept away all the targets; we just ask
them to cut crime, and they are doing so. They are doing so across
Wales and in particular in Gwent. Everyone involved is to be
congratulated on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110679000289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/halltext/131106h0002.htm#13110679000289">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:46:11"></hs_TimeCode>
course, we have not reached the end of the reform process—one
never does. The reforms continue, and the next and most radical phase
of police reform is aimed at transforming front-line policing. We want
every police officer to fulfil their potential and to feel a greater
sense of professional pride, so that the public get a better service.

year a record number of 342 of the 415 bathing waters—over
82%—met the highest standard, known as guideline. Almost 99%
have complied with the directive’s mandatory minimum standard.
This means that the compliance rate has returned to the level we would
expect after last year’s extreme weather conditions. It confirms
that investment by water companies and other measures to improve
bathing water quality are paying off over the
long-term.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110650000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/wmstext/131106m0001.htm#13110650000019">Only
five sites failed this year—Allonby, Fleetwood, St Annes,
Seascale and Instow. Failures to meet the standards are caused by a
complex and individual set of circumstances at each bathing water. The

water, particularly during rainfall.</hs_Para>

results are particularly encouraging because we are now only two years
away from full implementation of the revised bathing water directive,
which will introduce much tighter water quality standards from 2015. If
these standards applied now, over 55% would meet the highest
“excellent” standard and almost 90% would pass the new
minimum standard. I remain committed to all designated waters passing
the new minimum standard. Water companies, national and local

am pleased to announce today the heads of agreement on the new
pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS). The PPRS is a voluntary
scheme agreed between the Department of Health, acting on behalf of the
UK Government and Northern Ireland and the branded pharmaceutical
industry, represented by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry (ABPI), under section 262 of the National Health Service Act
2006.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13110650000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/wmstext/131106m0001.htm#13110650000035">The
current voluntary pricing scheme, the 2009 PPRS, will terminate on 31
December 2013. Following negotiations, the Department of Health and the
ABPI have reached agreement on the outline terms of a new scheme which
will operate for five years starting from 1 January

new scheme will provide an unprecedented level of certainty on almost
all the NHS branded medicines bill. The bill will stay flat over the
next two years and will grow slowly after that. The industry will make
compensating payments to the Department of Health if NHS spending on
branded medicines exceeds the agreed growth rate. The agreement
therefore provides stability and predictability to both the Government
and the UK pharmaceutical industry, supporting the industry’s
global competitiveness. It will encourage the use of innovative and
effective new medicines in the
NHS.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13110650000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/wmstext/131106m0001.htm#13110650000037">Alongside
these arrangements, the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) will continue its work to introduce the broader value
assessment for new medicines covered by value-based pricing. We have
listened to feedback from patients’ groups that they would
welcome further opportunities to feed into the development of the new
arrangements for value assessment and have agreed that NICE will carry
out a frill public consultation before implementing the methods for
wider value assessment in autumn 2014. Publication of the complete 2014
PPRS is expected later in the

addition to the agreement, I am also publishing today the Government
response to the consultation on the statutory pharmaceutical pricing
scheme, which contained proposals to strengthen the scheme, and align
it more closely to the PPRS. This scheme provides an important
safeguard for the NHS, controlling the prices of branded medicines sold
to the NHS by pharmaceutical companies that decide not to join the
voluntary PPRS. Through this response document, we are setting out the
changes we will be making, including introducing a 15% price cut on
branded medicines sold by statutory scheme companies. We will shortly
be introducing amending regulations to effect these
changes.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13110650000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/wmstext/131106m0001.htm#13110650000039">Copies

general aviation (GA) red tape challenge ran from 11 April
to 16 May 2013. It received nearly 500 responses, including 298 via
e-mail, three times as many as any other theme to date. These responses
identified many areas where improvements are needed and highlighted the
need for a change in approach to regulating GA. As a result of this,
the Government are launching a substantial programme of reform that
will help support a vibrant GA sector. The GA sector currently supports
around 50,000 jobs in the UK and makes an overall economic contribution
to the UK economy of £1.4 billion per annum. It could and should
be able to contribute
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110650000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/wmstext/131106m0001.htm#13110650000024">The
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the independent regulator of civil
aviation in the UK, recognises the need to create a culture
change in the regulation of the GA sector. As part of this culture
change the CAA is setting up a new GA unit within its current
structure. This is firm recognition that general aviation requires
different, and less onerous, regulation to that of commercial air
transport. The CAA’s GA unit will be dedicated to effective and
proportionate regulation that supports and encourages growth of the GA
sector. The unit will also work with Government to identify potential
funding for new technologies to support the sector. It will be fully
set up within the CAA by April
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110650000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/wmstext/131106m0001.htm#13110650000025">The
CAA has incorporated the findings of the GA red tape challenge into its
own internal review to produce a comprehensive GA reform programme.
This will support a programme of deregulation and self-regulation for
the GA sector. It will also remove complexity, look to deregulate where
possible and where not, consider how to allow the GA sector to take on
more responsibility and accountability for its own safety where
possible and appropriate. This has already started with the launch in
September 2013 of a consultation on deregulating for airworthiness
purposes all UK-registered single-seat microlights. Starting in
November, the CAA will lead a series of workshops with the GA sector to
identify other areas that would benefit most from deregulation or
self-regulation. These moves represent the start of an ambitious
programme of work to
follow.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110650000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/wmstext/131106m0001.htm#13110650000026">The

CAA will strengthen its engagement with the sector to improve
consultative arrangements and ensure effective representation. The CAA
is committed to being

compliance rather than regulation and enforcement, using legal
instruments and powers only as a last

CAA will involve the GA sector in the development of a new regulatory
framework and its associated policies; there will be opportunities for
the sector to challenge the CAA when it believes regulation is unduly
burdensome; there will be more scrutiny of the CAA’s fees and
charges to provide greater transparency; and the CAA will improve the
quality of information it provides. From the responses to the red tape
challenge it is clear that regulatory complexity has led to
misunderstandings. To address this, the CAA will run a
“myth-busting” initiative to clarify what exactly
regulations require. For example, it will debunk the myth that the CAA
requires all aircraft movements within the UK to be
logged.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110650000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/wmstext/131106m0001.htm#13110650000029">To
facilitate the effective and timely implementation of these measures,
the Government are appointing an independent “challenge
panel” including GA industry representatives. This panel will
report directly to Ministers. It will provide a “critical
friend” function to the CAA. The challenge panel will run
initially for six months until April 2014. During this time the panel
will monitor and support the implementation of the CAA’s
deregulatory programme. It will also be asked to identify further
opportunities to deregulate and to promote growth of the sector. It

will task the challenge panel to propose ideas, and will also encourage
the CAA and Government Departments such as the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills and the Home Office, to consider where projects

announcing these measures we are announcing the launch of a
“right to reply” consultation by the CAA into its
response to the GA red tape challenge. This consultation will run until
6 December and is a good opportunity for the GA sector to make its own
assessment of the CAA’s detailed response. The responses to this
consultation will be available to the challenge panel, which will be
able to submit its own views on the CAA response within its January
interim report. These reforms mark an important and significant
step-change in the approach to GA regulation. The new regulatory regime
will be founded on risk-based intervention, proportionate to the safety
needs of informed participants while protecting uninvolved third

2021-22, and includes funding for items such as additional recruiting,
training and spending on infrastructure and new equipment; it also
includes provision for paid leave and pension entitlements, from 2015,
for reservists. Across financial years 2012-13 and 2013-14 so far we

There will also be planning practice guidance available via the new

concerned, the body responsible for deciding designations will normally
be the relevant London borough (or London boroughs where the area

South Sudan to take all necessary steps to ensure that Abyei is
effectively demilitarised, including through disarmament programmes.
The United Nation's Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) is

Fallon:</Member></B> When to undertake a product recall is a matter for
both the manufacturer and Local Authority Trading Standards Services.
Existing product safety legislation places clear requirements on
manufacturers and distributors to inform the relevant Trading Standards
Service if unsafe products have been made available to consumers and
then to explain the action being undertaken by the manufacturer and
distributors to address the problem. Trading Standards also have powers
to impose actions should they consider those of the manufacturer to be
inadequate. Each case is treated on an individual basis and there is a
range of possible actions that can be taken. Recall is a last resort,
and the appropriate solution is very much dependent on the particular
circumstances. Further guidance would not be able to replace the
assessment of individual circumstance. There is also a risk that it may
interfere with the very clear message that the responsibility for the
product is the manufacturer who is liable to civil damages should the
product cause injury or damage to
property.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13110691000618" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/text/131106w0002.htm#13110691000618"><B><Member PimsId="3840" UID="13110691001385" xid="21" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/text/131106w0002.htm#13110691001385">Mr

11 of the 22 high tuberculosis (TB) burden countries are not on track
to reach one or more of the three targets for reductions of mortality,

is the principal mechanism that the UK Government uses to tackle TB in
developing countries. In September 2013, the UK Government committed up

additional hearing venues across HMCTS estate, and increasing the use
of Saturday sessions. All of this is having a positive effect. The

to the UK's Justice and Home Affairs block opt-out decision. No
provisions of the Framework Decision have been implemented in the UK

of the council that the UK had exercised the opt-out. Council Framework
Decision 2008/947/JHA is not one of the measures that the Government
has identified as being in the national interest to rejoin. In order to
implement this Framework Decision, the UK would need legislation to
empower our authorities to recognise, vary and enforce sentences
imposed by other member states, and to be able to transfer sentences
out of the UK. I understand that only a limited number of member states

able to accurately estimate the scale of the potential impact from this

some aspects of the measure mean it would not be in the UK's national
interest to allow ECJ jurisdiction over it. The 1964 Council of Europe
Convention on the Supervision of Conditionally Sentenced or

Vara:</Member></B> The Government is committed to reducing the number
and cost of whiplash claims to help bring down the cost of motor
insurance premiums for consumers. Our reforms will create an improved,
robust system for medical examinations and reporting to ensure that
those who make unnecessary, exaggerated or fraudulent claims are
deterred from doing so. There is no set time frame for the full
implementation of the Government's reform programme. However, my
officials will work at pace with stakeholders and staged implementation
will begin next year.</hs_Para>

Government's response document makes clear that the new scheme will not
only apply to whiplash claims. We intend that the same rigorous system
will apply to similar road traffic accident soft tissue injury claims
such as those to the back and neck. The Government also intends to work
with stakeholders to explore options for ensuring that a medical
examinations and report are completed before a claim can
proceed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110691001109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/text/131106w0003.htm#13110691001109">Details
of the most appropriate funding scheme are still to be developed, but
the Government believes there are areas of common ground with industry
in this area. We are keen to talk to stakeholders about funding
opportunities which would meet the costs of setting up and running the
new system and also deliver the Government's intention that such costs
should not fall on the public
purse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110691001110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/text/131106w0003.htm#13110691001110">There
were a number of other ideas and suggestions put forward by
stakeholders for addressing the issue of unnecessary, exaggerated and
fraudulent claims. The Government may wish to discuss alternative
proposals with stakeholders in due course, but its primary focus is on
the effective implementation of the measures outlined in the 23 October
announcement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110691001111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/text/131106w0003.htm#13110691001111">My
officials will be engaging directly with representatives from both the
insurance industry and from claimant lawyer groups, to ensure there is
a speedy resolution to the issue of sharing fraud data. A reduction in
the number of fraudulent claims will lower costs for insurers, which
will in turn allow them to reduce premiums for their
customers.</hs_Para>

Government position on the issue of raising the small claims threshold
for personal injury claims is clear. We believe there are strong
reasons for raising the small claims limit, but the evidence also shows
that the time is not right to do so now. More work to support litigants
in person and on how best to regulate the claims management market
needs to be pursued. It is also important to assess the impact on the
cost of motor insurance of the civil justice reforms implemented on 1
April before returning to this
issue.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13110691000123" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/text/131106w0003.htm#13110691000123">Prisoners:

Secretary has said about the burqa. This is not a case where the burqa
is responsible. I urge her to look at the role of G4S and the tags that
have been provided. As she knows, last week a number of cases were
dropped after the police found out that there was a suggestion that
tags had been tampered with; in fact, it was a question of wear and
tear. Will she please investigate this again, rather than just accept
that assurance? Was Mr Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed a British citizen? If he
was, when did he acquire citizenship, bearing in mind the fact that he
was a support of al-Shabaab, and does she have his
passport?</hs_Para>
