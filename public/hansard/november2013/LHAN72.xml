My Lords, wherever shale gas operations are conducted
they must be done in a safe and environmentally sound way. There are
regulations in place to ensure on-site safety, prevent water
contamination and mitigate against seismic activity and air pollution.
As part of this rigorous process, my department, the Environment Agency
and the Health and Safety Executive must all approve an application.
Local communities will be consulted before any operations and the
industry has committed to provide a package of benefits from shale gas
production<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T14:37:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Renton of Mount Harry" PimsId="351" UID="13111953000331" xid="1779" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000331">Lord
Renton of Mount Harry (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend very much for that opening, but I want very quickly to say a few
words about the position of shale gas in the UK. On one side, shale gas
is considered as having no real future importance and as not being
worthwhile; but on the other side, the position is quite different. The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury recently wrote that shale gas has
the potential to support thousands of jobs, generate substantial tax
revenue and keep energy bills low for millions of people. If that is
true then our shale gas is very important. Which way would the Minister
vote on
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T14:37:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13111953000332" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000332">Baroness
Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend is aware, of course, that
the Treasury and the Government are very keen to explore all sources of
energy. Shale gas will provide the UK with greater energy security,
economic growth and jobs, and the Government are encouraging
exploration to determine this
potential<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T14:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Barnett" PimsId="3885" UID="13111953000333" xid="1068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000333">Lord
Barnett (Lab):</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, I suppose that we have all
been nimbys at one time or another but it is important now that the
public interest should be the main issue. Unfortunately, it looks as if
the companies that are investing in fracking are being stopped or
delayed, and that is clearly not in the public interest. As I am sure
the Minister knows, all the evidence shows that there is only a low
public health risk, and 
<?notus-xml column=848?>even that could be reduced considerably by proper regulation. In those
circumstances we need the full support of both sides of the House. I
hope that my own party will strongly support the Government on this,
although there may be some critical points. What can the Minister tell
us about what they are doing strongly to support the companies that are
bringing in the private investment which is desperately needed in this

this is an important source for us, and as with all things, we are
making sure that the environmental protections are in place. We have a

there is a big difference between this country and America in that

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, in the United
States the shale gas industry is fragmented and there are
good and not-so-good operators in terms of environmental risks. What
specific lessons have been learnt from the United States? It is
estimated that some 10% of the total UK water supply could be demanded
by shale gas if, as many of us hope, it were to be successful. What
discussions are the Government having with the water industry to make
sure that that area will be catered for if shale gas development takes

Water UK, which represents water companies, is working closely with the
United Kingdom Onshore Operators Group—the representative body
for onshore oil and gas—to make sure that any potential extra
demand for water will be managed sensibly. However, water companies are
already obligated to produce and update every five years a proper water
plan. Water companies will therefore assess well in advance the amount
of water that will be available to the operator before it is
used<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T14:43:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there are other times of the day when the Chamber is not as full as
perhaps we might sometimes wish. As the noble Lord, Lord Laming, said,
in terms of the job that we

and we take part in scrutiny. I have been able to increase the number
of opportunities for QSDs, which I think has been widely welcomed, and
we are getting through them much faster. We have had more
post-legislative scrutiny and more ad hoc committees. I am hoping, in
that way, to address the issue of attendance, which is a greater

are temporarily demilitarised zones intended to allow the safe passage
of humanitarian aid and the evacuation of vulnerable civilians. DfID
supports many humanitarian agencies operating inside Syria. To date,
DfID has received no requests or representations for a humanitarian
corridor from these partners or other humanitarian agencies. We welcome
any option that complies with international law that might save lives
in
Syria.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Boothroyd" PimsId="4075" UID="13111953000360" xid="1541" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000360">Baroness

Nott, the distinguished London surgeon who recently returned from
delivering front-line medicine in rebel-held Syria, that aid is not
getting where it is most needed. Dr Nott made representations to HMG,
to which he has not received even an acknowledgement as yet. Will the
Government work with the international community to insist that a
humanitarian corridor be opened to deliver life-saving medical aid and
bring the severely wounded to safety? Safe passages have been achieved
in other conflict zones. If chemical weapons inspectors can be given
protection, surely protection is possible for humanitarian
aid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13111953000361" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000361">Baroness

noble Baroness has said and for what the surgeon David Nott has said. I
heard the appeal that he made and obviously pressed very hard within
DfID to elucidate this, because it is obviously extremely appealing.
The problem is of course, as the noble Baroness will know, that the
situation in Syria is immensely complex. One needs only to look at the
map of where various groups are, and how that changes from day to day,
to see how complex this is and the number of humanitarian corridors
that would be required. In order for those to be created, all groups in
the relevant area would need to buy in. Alternatively, it would need to
be enforced in a military fashion, which would require a UN Security
Council resolution. I think the noble Baroness can see some of the
challenges in my answer.</hs_para>

military presence. Who would provide it in Syria, and with whose
collective
agreement?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13111953000363" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000363">Baroness
Northover:</Member></B> My noble friend is absolutely right, and that
bears out the answer I just gave to the noble Baroness. We would
require the buy-in of all the parties or that kind of military
enforcement. That is why the major organisations working in the
area—for example, the United Nations, MSF and the
ICRC—have reservations about the proposal for a humanitarian
corridor for the very reason that my noble friend referred to.
Sometimes, these result in civilians being less safe. He pointed to the
Bosnian example, but more recently, of course, there has been the Sri
Lankan example. There are examples where not only civilians, who are
supposed to be protected, are in greater danger, but the humanitarian
workers who may appear to be shielded by particular military groups are
also under greater
threat.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000037"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead" PimsId="5440" UID="13111953000364" xid="2008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000364">Baroness

situations to the ICC has, we hope, a chilling effect for other leaders
thereafter. One can see that building in terms of leaders’
responses, and one has to hope that in the situation in Syria some of
the rebel groups as well as the government groups will recognise the
challenge there. However, at the moment, the most important thing is to
try to bring about a political resolution to this problem so that the

Popat (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, under this Government credit
conditions continue to improve. Survey evidence indicates that more
small and medium-sized enterprises are using external finance. Recent
data from the Bank of England show that gross lending is continuing to
rise year on year and in September reached the highest level since
2009. More broadly, confidence is beginning to return to businesses,
which are now more ready to borrow and invest than since before the
financial
crisis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:00:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000046"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mitchell" PimsId="1929" UID="13111953000374" xid="1349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000374">Lord
Mitchell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, yet again I am asking the
Government why much needed financial support is not getting through to
SMEs. According to the Bank of England, net lending to SMEs was down
£600 million in the second quarter of 2013. The answer to the
Question is obvious: financing that should be going to small businesses
is in fact being used by banks to build up their profitable mortgage
portfolios. Does the Minister accept that banks should be backing small
businesses rather than helping to create another property
bubble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:00:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, it is important to set the picture in
context. According to the British Bankers’ Association, the
current stock of lending to SMEs by the top seven banks is more than
£99 billion. By this measure, around £2 billion is lent
by the banks to SMEs every month. SMEs are actually twice as likely to
be successful when applying for finance than has been
predicted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000048">The
World Bank’s ease of doing business index puts the UK as the top

things are. In any case, we know that there is scope for improvement.

rather than growth. The report went on to say that 25% of SMEs expect
their loans to be turned down, whereas in fact 50% are successful. What

£80 billion has been allocated by the Bank of England, of which
some £17.6 billion has been taken up by SMEs. I agree that a
large proportion of that is in the property sector. We have relaxed
some of the conditions for lending money to SMEs, which are now able to
finance their debt or their stock. Hence we will be lending more money
to SMEs and this figure is gradually going up. Real lending to

start-ups and small businesses, is also very important for small

question from my noble friend, who brings a wealth of experience from
both the private and public sectors. As your Lordships know, the
Government have introduced a moratorium on all new domestic regulations
for three years for new start-ups and businesses with fewer than 10
employees. In addition, in January we introduced a “one in, two
out” rule on all domestic regulations affecting businesses and
voluntary organisations. The Government are absolutely committed to
creating a culture in which all businesses, including SMEs, can
thrive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000055"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:04:47"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Stevenson of Balmacara" PimsId="5801" UID="13111953000382" xid="2067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000382">Lord
Stevenson of Balmacara (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in September 2012,
having failed to persuade the Treasury to break up RBS, the Secretary
of State announced the formation of the British Business Bank. However,
it was not until 17 October 2013 that the first chair was appointed and
then we were told that the bank was in a “substantial expansion
phase” and that it was on target to unlock £10 billion
for expanding companies. Last week we learnt that the bank finally made
its first investments, when it gave £45 million to two financial
institutions, Praesidian Capital Europe and BMS Finance. When will we
see funding actually flowing to the small and medium-sized businesses
that need it and when do the Government expect the bank to

Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, on 1 November RBS committed to a new
direction that will lead it to being a boost to the UK economy, rather
than a burden. It will be dealing decisively with the problems from the
past by separating out the good and the bad and putting the bad loans
in an internal bad bank. RBS will now focus on its core British
business, supporting British families and companies. It will sell off
more of its overseas operations and go on shrinking its investment bank
so it has more capital to support lending to the British economy. RBS
is committed to becoming the number one bank for small and medium-sized
enterprises, as judged by customers, measured by the newly created
survey to be run by the Federation of Small Businesses. On growing SME
lending, RBS continues to be the number one bank for

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, one of the key problems at the
moment in the British economy is not about lending but quite the
opposite—businesses are sitting on cash mountains, particularly
large corporations and even medium-sized and some small businesses. We
need now to liberate that cash so it is invested and drives this
economy forward. Is not the good news economically at the moment the

returning to consumer and business confidence. The figures this morning
from the OECD show that our growth forecast has gone up from 0.6% to
1.4% for 2013 and 2.4% for 2014. My noble friend is quite correct that
a large number of SMEs are holding cash in their banks. A lot of them
are also risk averse, or were until recently, and hence are not
borrowing that much money from the

the noble ideal that no one should ever be prevented by background or

poor care betrays those worthy aims. I do not want simply to prevent
another Mid Staffs; I want our NHS to be a beacon across the world not

to conceal unsafe staffing from the public because from next June all

particularly healthcare assistants and social care support workers who
perform so much vital care. Healthcare assistants and social care
support workers will be required to have a new care certificate to
ensure that no one is ever asked to perform personal care without
adequate training, whether in hospitals or care homes. The title
“nursing assistant” will be used widely in hospitals and
paths to nursing careers will be improved. I thank Camilla Cavendish
for her excellent work in this area. We also need to broaden the talent
pool going into NHS management positions, in particular attracting more
clinicians and those with good external experience. We have introduced
a fast-track leadership programme, sending 50 people a year to a

Francis correctly highlighted the failure of regulatory systems to
identify quickly what happened at Mid Staffs. Subsequently it has
become clear that Ministers put pressure on regulators which may have
led them to tone down news about poor care. This is totally
unacceptable, so we will strengthen the statutory independence
surrounding reports into care quality. The chief inspector will be the
nation’s whistleblower-in-chief and nothing must ever be allowed
to stand in his way. The CQC can prosecute when fundamental standards
are breached. Trusts put into special measures will have a strictly
limited time to get their house in order before administration is
considered. Foundation trusts in special measures will have their
autonomy suspended and action will be taken to ensure that they quickly
improve. No trust will be able to progress to foundation status unless
they are rated good or
outstanding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000077">Proper
accountability must be at the heart of the NHS. I have therefore

There will be a new criminal offence for care providers that supply or

to bar unfit directors from boards. Every hospital patient should have

Hunt of Kings Heath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I remind
the House of my interests as chairman of an NHS foundation trust,
president of GS1 and a consultant and trainer with Cumberlege
Connections. I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement.
What happened at Mid Staffs was a betrayal of the NHS and its
values. The previous Government rightly apologised, but now is the time
to back our words with action. That is why, in welcoming much of what
has been said, I would like to press the Minister on where we feel we
would have gone further and question why, of the 290 recommendations
from Francis, 86 are not being implemented in full.</hs_para>

my right honourable friend Ann Clwyd, Professor Patricia Hart,
Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, Camilla Cavendish, Professor Don
Berwick and of course Sir Robert Francis. Between them they have given
us proposals that will help to prevent a repeat and, more importantly,
change the whole of the NHS for the better.<I> </I>Both Francis reports
found three primary and fundamental causes of what went wrong: a
failure to listen to patients; a lack of properly trained staff; and a
dysfunctional culture. I shall turn to each of those.</hs_para>

the Minister will agree with me that patients and their families must
always, as Francis recommended, be the first priority for the NHS. Was
Francis not right to recommend that the NHS constitution and the ethos
that it sets out should be required reading for all NHS staff? I
congratulate the Minister on agreeing to implement the Clwyd review in

issue of staffing numbers and training. The first Francis report found
that Mid Staffs made dangerous cuts to staffing over a short 
<?notus-xml column=862?>period. I welcome the Government’s new focus on this issue, but
is it not the case that nurse to patient ratios across the NHS have got
significantly worse in the past three years, with nearly 6,000 fewer
nurses, more older patients in hospital and bed occupancy running at
record levels?</hs_para>

the NHS plans to recruit more nurses and is introducing more monitoring
and transparency. The Secretary of State says that things are already
changing for the better, but is the Minister aware that Monitor, the
economic regulator of the NHS, has warned that trusts are planning
major nurse redundancies in the 2014-16 period, far outweighing any
increase planned this year? Will the Government intervene to stop that?
Further, why have the Government stopped short of requiring safe
staffing levels? Is the Minister aware that nurse training places have
been severely cut in recent years and that many NHS trusts and
foundation trusts are now being forced to recruit from
overseas?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000087">Alongside
nursing, more action is needed to raise standards across the caring
workforce. As Robert Francis has said, it is unacceptable that the
security guard at the door of the hospital is more regulated and
subject to professional sanctions than the healthcare assistant
attending to an elderly patient. The development of the care
certificate, as proposed by Camilla Cavendish, is a step forward, but
will it not work only alongside a register of those who hold it and
with an ability to remove it if they fall short? What happens if a
member of staff employed as a care assistant in an NHS hospital has
indeed obtained a care certificate but is then found to be wholly
unsatisfactory to carry out a care assistant’s work? What
happens to the certificate? Surely we need to go back to the Robert
Francis recommendation of a system of regulation for healthcare
assistants. Will the Government reconsider this decision and at least
commit to keeping it under
review?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000088">On
culture change, Robert Francis’s central proposal is a new duty
of candour on organisations and individuals. It is not entirely clear
how an organisational duty alone will help individuals challenge an
organisation where there is a dysfunctional culture. Is it not the case
that an individual duty, as proposed by Francis, is needed? The point
comes over very clearly from the evidence given to Francis from a
senior, soon to be retired consultant. He

duty of openness and transparency should apply equally to all
organisations providing NHS services, including, as Francis rightly
recommended, contractors providing outsourced services. The Government
are clearly bringing in more outside providers. Surely patients need
reassurance that we do not have an uneven playing field where private
providers face less scrutiny. Will the Government extend the duty of
candour to all healthcare organisations as Francis proposes? The
amendments to the Care Bill do not seem to make that clear. Should not
the Minister commit to extending

confidentiality?</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I welcome the noble Lord’s
very positive comments about the various reviews that have been
commissioned in recent months. I am glad that he agrees that, in broad
terms, the Government are on the right lines in accepting the
recommendations that have come forward.</hs_para>

number of questions, the first of which was about why we have not
implemented all the recommendations of Robert Francis in full. Most of
the recommendations have been accepted in principle, in part
or—in the main—in their entirety. In some cases, we are
taking an alternative approach to that suggested in the inquiry if we
believe it is likely to be more effective in reaching the
intended outcome. In total, we have rejected just nine of
the 290 recommendations and where recommendations have been
rejected, a full response outlining the reasons for doing so and the
alternative action that organisations are taking is provided in our
system-wide response.</hs_para>

about the regulation of healthcare assistants, a matter to which we
return at regular intervals in this House. I assure him that the
Government keep this issue under regular review but, for the time
being, our view is to tackle the key issue at its root, focusing on
making sure that healthcare support workers have the right training,
values, support and leadership to provide the high-quality care that we
all want patients to receive. We are committed to ensuring that this
part of the workforce receives high-quality and consistent training. We
have commissioned Skills for Care and Skills for Health, as the noble
Lord knows, to develop a code of conduct and minimum
training standards. We have also announced the development of a care
certificate, which I am sure will be particularly welcome to a number
of my noble friends.</hs_para>

about a situation in which employers might find that a healthcare
assistant or social care support worker no longer met the standards
required by the care certificate. In that event, Health Education
England and the sector skills council will set out in guidance the
requirements for ensuring that appropriate retraining is given or other
disciplinary action is taken. The guidance will be that the worker in 
<?notus-xml column=865?>question should not work unsupervised until the problem has been
resolved and the employer is confident that their care certificate
remains valid. Of course, if a healthcare assistant is found to have
harmed patients or have been a serious risk to patients, the Disclosure
and Barring Service needs to be considered as the ultimate remedy to
make sure that that person does not put patients at risk in future.
However, that is an extreme situation, which I believe will not be the
norm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000105">The
noble Lord referred to the nurse numbers. In the last spending review,
the NHS budget was protected in real terms, with cash funding rising by
£12.7 billion by 2014-15. Alongside that, Health Education
England has been working with NHS trusts to develop the overall
workforce plan for England for next year, reflecting the strategic
commissioning intentions. That work indicates that a number of trusts
have already increased their nurse staffing levels during the current
year and others are planning to do so, as I mentioned in the Statement.
Initial plans indicate that trusts intend to employ an increase of more
than 3,700 nurses this

nursing leaders have been clear—indeed, there is a letter in

rules from the centre is the right way forward. The National Quality
Board and the Chief Nursing Officer are publishing a guidance document
that sets out current evidence on safe staffing. By next summer, NICE
will produce independent, authoritative, evidence-based guidance on
safe staffing and review and endorse associated tools for setting safe
staffing levels in acute settings. From next April, by June at the
latest, NHS trusts will publish ward-level information on whether they
are meeting their staffing requirements. A review every six months will

the issue of candour, we have had a number of debates on this subject,
both during of the Health and Social Care Act and, more recently, in
the Care Bill, and I believe that we have reached a place for which
this House can take some credit because the Government have moved a
considerable distance from their original position. We agree with Don
Berwick’s intention that professional regulators are in the best
position to strengthen the duty of candour for individual professionals
working in a hospital. Of course, the duty of candour applies to the
corporate entity but the GMC and the NMC will be working with the other
regulators to agree consistent approaches to candour and the reporting
of errors, including a common responsibility to be candid with patients
when mistakes occur, whether serious or not, and clear guidance that
professionals who seek to obstruct others in raising concerns or in
being candid would be in breach of their professional responsibilities.
The professional regulators will issue new guidance to make it clear
that it is the responsibility of professionals to report near misses
for errors that could have led to death or serious injury as well as
actual harm, and they must do so at the earliest
opportunity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:38:10"></hs_TimeCode>. We
will seek advice from experts on how 
<?notus-xml column=866?>to improve the reporting of patient safety incidents, including whether

noble Lord referred to the NPSA. He is right that the NPSA’s
function of reporting safety incidents has transferred to NHS England,
into which the National Reporting and Learning System has been
absorbed. I do not see that transfer as, in any way, inhibiting staff
confidence in reporting safety incidents. The essence of the system
remains as it always has

noble Lord asked about the responsibility for patient safety being
transferred back to the CQC. I am sure that, on reflection, he will
agree that patient safety is everybody’s business. In part, it
is the business of the CQC but, above all, it is the business of those
who work in the NHS. It is the business of trust boards and of
commissioners. It is also very much the business of those whose job it
is to look at the performance of the NHS on behalf of
patients—chiefly Healthwatch, but also patient organisations.

However, he should not forget that the standard contract that the NHS
operates binds anyone who provides services to the NHS into certain
contractual terms, and the disclosure of relevant information is a part

death certification, the noble Lord asked me about medical examiners.
We agree that they must be independent of the deceased person and their
medical practitioner. That is because medical examiners need to carry
out independent scrutiny of the medical circumstances and cause of
apparently natural deaths to make sure that the right deaths are
notified or referred to a coroner. However, we need to ensure that
there are sufficient numbers of medical examiners to carry out this
work, particularly in rural areas, so appointees are likely to have
some sort of professional relationship with local care providers.
Therefore the draft death certification regulations for medical
examiners do not require that medical examiners are independent of the
organisation whose patients’ deaths are being scrutinised.
However, we are mindful of the need for a greater level of independence
within the spirit of this recommendation and the Government will review
how they can include further safeguards on this
front<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:41:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000112">The
noble Lord suggested that the NHS constitution was not the right means
of changing the culture of the NHS, and I agree with him. However,
declaratory statements in the constitution are an important part of
signalling to the NHS its vision and values in the broadest terms, and
the duties that people should feel they are under. The values, rights
and pledges set out in the NHS constitution form the basis of
everything the NHS does. NHS England, Health Education England, the
department and CCGs are developing a joint strategy to embed the
constitution further, as we promised they would during the passage of
the Health and Social Care Act.</hs_para>

culture of safety in the

responds to complaints will be critical in shaping a culture that
listens to patients and learns from them and ending a culture of

Knight of Collingtree (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, much of what my
noble friend has said has given us satisfaction, but it is perfectly
true, as we have already been reminded, that troubles were going on not
only in the Mid Staffordshire area but all over the place. It is also
true that it is not just the whistleblowers who warned time and time
again about what was going on and who should have been listened to. I
spent four or five years raising cases of people who had written to me.
On one occasion I presented the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord
Hunt of Kings Heath, with a dossier of some 25 cases, all of which had
been checked very carefully. All the details were correct, all the
patients, or their relatives, had given permission for these cases to
be raised and they were raised in this House. I am not blaming the
noble Lord for failing to take these cases forward, or failing to
listen to the arguments put out clearly in this House, because I think
that he passed them on, but they were never properly
investigated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000134">It
is upsetting that for such a long period warnings were being given and
were allowed somehow to filter into the ground and away, or into the
past. I particularly warned about the practice, which was fairly
unknown at that time, of failing to feed patients because food was put
too far away from them and other examples. I worry about the people who
suffered for those long years when something could have been done if
those responsible at the grass roots had taken care of what was being
said in this House. I beg the Minister not to leave aside the really
serious point that cases raised with great sincerity and truth in this
House should be regarded and not just pushed aside in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000135"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13111953000411" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000411">Earl

great care. Of course, I remember those cases. I was not the Minister
in charge at the time she submitted those cases to the Department of
Health, but she shared them with me, and I share her concerns, which
are, of course, directly relevant to the matters we are discussing
today. We have the new duty of candour and in April the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Act strengthened the main whistleblowing legislation
introduced by the Public Interest Disclosure Act so that an individual
who suffers harm from a co-worker as a result of blowing the whistle
now has the right to expect their employer to take reasonable 
<?notus-xml column=871?>steps to stop this. The idea is to ensure that
people do not feel intimidated from speaking up. The Care Quality
Commission is using staff surveys and the whistleblowing concerns it
receives as part of the data in its new intelligent monitoring system.
That data will guide the CQC about which hospitals to inspect. Since
September, the commission’s new inspection system includes
discussions with hospitals about how they deal with whistleblowers and
handle them.</hs_para>

particularly in relation to the duty of candour. That work will, of

particular about the role of the non-executive director. If an
organisation has what may look like quite a high number of complaints,
it should be regarded as a sign of openness, transparency and the right
kind of culture in that organisation. It is only where suspiciously low
numbers of complaints have been recorded that alarm bells should start
ringing. I agree that boards of directors, led and
encouraged in this area by the non-executives, should make it a
central part of their business to analyse complaints and make sure that
they have been followed through, not just that the matters have
individually been remedied but that any systemic issue has been

Worthington (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, during our scrutiny we have
come to know this Bill as the “decarbonisation Bill” as
it has passed through this House. It has been referred to in that way
by a number of noble Lords and it is a reasonable description. The Bill
represents a significant intervention in the electricity market that is
justified on the basis that it will help to decarbonise our electricity
system. Noble Lords will be aware that we have had lengthy discussions
about the setting of a decarbonisation target in the Bill in order to
give that clarity of purpose and to create a responsibility on the
Government to deliver through the powers that they are taking.
Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in bringing forward the setting of
a date for the setting of such a target. However, on Report the
Minister was kind enough to give a partial concession in relation to
the Government’s commitment to monitoring carbon intensity and
to acting if carbon intensity remained high. The concession was that,
should carbon intensity rise year on year for three consecutive years,
the Government would report to Parliament, setting out why this was the
case and the additional actions that would be taken to counteract that
increase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:05:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000141">The
concession is welcome. It is not a replacement for a carbon intensity
target by any means, partly because carbon intensity is currently at an
astonishingly high level. This is because the merit order currently
favours inefficient old coal plant over more efficient, cleaner gas
stations. Therefore, currently carbon intensity is higher than would
otherwise be the case. Intensity seems unlikely to increase. If it did,
something would be seriously awry with government policy. The
concession, while welcome, does not go far enough but I should hate to
lose it. The purpose of this amendment is to place that commitment in
the Bill to introduce into it a measurement of progress and a mechanism
through which the Government will report back to the House on that
progress and take corrective

is fair to say that the interventions in this Bill and the powers that

Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, for tabling the
amendment. The Government fully support the aim of clear and
transparent reporting. However, like my noble friend Lord Teverson, I
do not think it necessary to introduce an additional statutory
reporting requirement to the Bill as the noble Baroness proposes. I
shall set out quickly the
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000145">First,
as the noble Baroness recognises, at Report I made a commitment
to Parliament that the Government would undertake reporting
measures once any decarbonisation target range had been set. This would
supplement those reporting measures that are already included within
Part 1 of the Bill. I repeat what I said on Report, which was
that,</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13111953000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000267">“where

important to recognise that, under the Climate Change Act 2008, there
are already high levels of scrutiny of the progress made to meet our
economy-wide carbon targets. This includes coverage of the power sector
within the context of our wider economy. For example: the Government
currently report annually on emissions in the power sector through the
UK’s greenhouse gas emissions inventory; the Committee on
Climate Change publishes an independent and impartial report each year
on our progress towards meeting our carbon budgets and the 2050 target;
the Government provide annual responses to the committee’s
recommendations, which include a dedicated chapter on the power sector;
and the Government publish updated energy and emissions projections
each year, setting out the future trajectory we anticipate the economy

the amendment proposes that these reporting measures start from the
date of Royal Assent. The Government’s view is that it is
logical for any additional reporting measures to be triggered by the
setting of a decarbonisation target range rather than by the
enactment of the Bill. That would ensure alignment with the existing
reporting framework that is already included in Clause 3, and we should
not forget that we already report on grid carbon intensity ahead of any
decarbonisation target range being set. Section 5 of the Energy Act
2010 requires a three-yearly report to Parliament on progress in
decarbonising electricity generation. That report sets out the policy
framework and explains trends in grid carbon intensity over the
reporting period.</hs_para>

Government are already proposing a clear and robust target framework
that includes regular reporting on progress in meeting any target
range. That is in addition to the high levels of scrutiny that are
already in place to meet our economy-wide carbon targets. For those
reasons, it would be unnecessary 
<?notus-xml column=874?>to introduce another statutory reporting requirement. I hope that the

agree that we are all mature in looking at these things and that people
who scrutinise and follow this in detail will raise issues as they
occur. However, something is clearly not working, otherwise why is it
that carbon intensity has been allowed to rise to such high levels
recently with the Government apparently incapable of acting to bring it
down? Obviously, many factors play into that, but the whole purpose of
the Bill is to bring some of those factors under greater control and to
allow the Government to intervene in the market to create contracts for

would not otherwise be supported by the

regrettable that the Government are not prepared to start monitoring
that or reporting on it, in terms of actively managing it, until 2016,
which is a number of years away. I understand that the Bill has
existing requirements on reporting carbon intensity, and that it is
routinely reported now, so I am happy to withdraw, but this is

Jenkin of Roding (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, Part 2, which is really
the heart of the Energy Bill, contains all the proposals for the reform
of the electricity market. Chapter 3 of Part 2, in respect of which I
am moving this amendment, deals with a very important part of the
reform, the introduction of the capacity market. As the noble Baroness
has just mentioned, that is of course designed to try to attract
investment which the market might otherwise find it difficult to
support. It is one of the measures that the Government are introducing,
if I may put it crudely, to keep the lights on—to make sure we
have enough generating capacity to keep the power flowing. At this
stage of the Bill, I do not think it is necessary for me to start
spelling out all the details of this, which have been very
substantially debated at Second Reading, in Committee and on
Report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000152">However,
I think it right once again to draw the attention of the House to the
fact that most of the detail of this is to be in regulations. We are
hoping that 
<?notus-xml column=875?>the Bill will be Law before the end of the
year—indeed, I hope well before the end of the year—and
that the regulations will follow next year, and we are waiting for
those. I have to say to my noble friend that the Government have been
extremely good at producing drafts of what all the really important
regulations would contain. It is a substantial document and I do not
propose to read it out, but there is an enormous amount of detail in it
and it is helpful for those who have to operate the new system to have
that detail
now.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111953000313" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000313">4.15

to the regulations, there will also have to be what are called capacity
market rules. They will either be made by Ministers, or can be made by
the regulator, Ofgem. Again, in that document we have been given draft
rules and I will come to them in a moment. Both the rules and the
regulations are currently the subject of consultations and, while this
is clearly essential to get them right and to make sure that they avoid
unintended consequences, it means that even at this late stage of the
Bill, it is not really open to us to debate the details. What we can
ensure is that the Bill provides the necessary rules and guidance to
what we think the Government ought to be aiming at in making these
regulations, and that the processes by which they are made are sound
and fit for
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000154">That
is really what this amendment is about. It is Clause 34 that confers on
the Secretary of State the power to make the capacity market rules. As
I said, it is Clause 34(3) which gives the power to the
“Authority”. That is the phrase used in the Bill, but
that means giving the regulator, Ofgem, the power to make capacity
market rules subject to conditions. These conditions may be about
consultations, and in particular, they must provide that if it is Ofgem
which is to make the capacity market rules, it must consult and then
set out two categories of what one might call the participants in the
scheme—either anyone who has a licence to supply electricity or
anyone who is already a capacity
provider.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000155">It
is my view that this leaves out an important group. Ministers have
recognised that in order to promote competition—there will be a
great deal more about competition on the next amendment that I will
move—it is important that new entrants and independent
generators should be enabled, or indeed encouraged, to apply for a
contract under the capacity market arrangements. They may very well not
already be licence holders, and by definition they are almost certainly
not yet capacity providers. My amendment provides that, in addition to
those two categories in the Bill, there should also be included
anyone,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13111953000288" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000288">“who

important is this? I have already demonstrated that in this volume the
draft rules cover no fewer than 119 pages. They are immensely
complicated; the definitions alone cover 20 pages, which gives a
measure of the complexity of all this. They cover such vital issues as
the timetable for the capacity auctions, how those wishing to bid could
gain the necessary prequalification, how to decide who is eligible to
bid, how the auctions will be conducted and so on. This is all highly
relevant to anyone who is going to take part in these auctions, 
<?notus-xml column=876?>especially new entrants and independent generators that are aiming to
participate in the market. Surely it is as important for these
companies to know about the rules and any proposed changes to them as
it is for firms already operating in the industry. It is a very simple
question and I think that the answer can only be: yes, they must know
about them. I hope my noble friend will give us satisfaction. I beg to

the Bill is very important and should be open to new and independent
players to attract them into the market. If all the capacity mechanism
does is provide security to the existing incumbents, it will have
failed in its aim to deliver capacity at least cost, with a good degree
of competition enabling prices to be kept to the minimum. Given the

of the content of the capacity market rules will comprise provisions of
a technical and administrative nature, designed to supplement the
regulations and ensure the efficient running of the capacity market;

duties to maintain a capacity market register and carry out monitoring

administrative nature of the rules, we therefore expect changes usually

Worthington</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, this amendment follows on
from our discussion about the decarbonisation aspects of the Bill.
Noble Lords will be aware that an important amendment was successfully
added to the Bill at Report. It would close a current drafting loophole
in the Bill that would allow old, inefficient, polluting coal stations
to upgrade and seek extensive life extensions without the need to
comply with any kind of emissions performance standard. This will now,
of course, be debated in the Commons, and we look forward to seeing the
results of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:28:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in having this part of the Bill accepted, an interesting definitional
issue has arisen. Bear with me as I try to explain it. The industrial
emissions directive, which requires tightened quality standards to
apply to coal stations from 2016, applies at a station level. A station
is defined as “a common stack”, meaning a chimney that
can be used by multiple units. This has interesting implications
because the EPS limits can therefore be met by one unit upgrading to
fit filters while another unit remains unabated but still operating
unencumbered and at full capacity.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>Our intention in
closing a loophole that could potentially extend coal’s life
span to late into the next decade was that the EPS should apply at the
same level at which the IED applies, meaning that if a station with
four units decided to retrofit two of the four in order to comply with
the IED, the station as a whole would then be caught by the
EPS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:30:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111953000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000314">4.30

have had representations from industry asking for clarification on this
because, in sitting down to work out the implications of the amendment,
they have looked at the Bill and seen that the definitions are not
clear. The Bill defines a “plant” as a
“station”, which is insufficiently precise when one is
trying to assess this, because plants are made up of units. The
definitions used in air quality standards use “common
stack” for that purpose. The amendment would bring greater
clarity to the EPS part of the Bill and bring it in line with the
definitions in the industrial emissions directive. The implications of
the Bill could then be understood by those making investment decisions
on whether to upgrade their plant or to opt out, run their hours out

for her reply. Discretion gives flexibility but equally it gives a lack
of certainty for industry. I am not quite sure why this proposal is
premature as we need to give clarity to those affected by this Bill as
soon as possible. It seems to me that in maintaining this discretion,
we are prolonging lack of certainty for the industry. I think that it
is very important that we do this consultation quickly and that we give
clarity as soon as possible, whether that is through the regulations
that follow or in a separate process. I am sure that there are many
people sitting in boardrooms around the country looking at their
assets, who need to know this information and need to know how the

department is minded to have an EPS apply only to the units which fit
the filters that make the upgrade, that will have the very perverse
affect of allowing unabated plant—the other corresponding
units—to operate indefinitely at very high load factors. That is
precisely what we are trying to avoid with this amendment. There is a
very strong reason why we do not believe that discretion is necessary
and why the definition should be at a plant level. However, I
understand that the Government may wish to consult and to seek a little
extra time before making this issue fully clear. I hope that that is
completed in the shortest time possible, as prolonging uncertainty will
make life harder for the industry and investors in deciding what their
next move should be following the passage of the Bill. I beg leave to

This duty is to be found in Section 4AA of the Gas Act 1986, with
equivalent provisions in the Electricity Act 1989. These provisions

that if the Bill is enacted as the Government propose, the explicit
responsibility to issue social and environmental guidance will

views remain unchanged: Ofgem’s social and environmental

The review also concluded that Ofgem should remain

confident that if this Government fail to reverse the trend, it will be
reversed by the future Labour Government who, after all, will be the
heirs to all that fine and imaginative legislation between 1945 and

the amendment. My noble friend Lord Jenkin made some very good points
about trust and getting more competition. That is absolutely true.
However, competition narrowed considerably under the previous Labour
Government. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington, have waxed lyrical during our discussions but we ought to
recall that the previous Secretary of State for Energy under the Labour
Government—Mr Edward Miliband—did absolutely nothing to
correct the situation and refused to refer any of the energy companies
to the Competition
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111953000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000226">My

any way harm either the general thrust or the detail of the
Government’s policy, as spelled out in the Bill. As I said on

I am sympathetic to the defence of this amendment that has been put

that a review undertaken by Ofgem will deliver anything. On this side
of the House, we are absolutely certain that it will not. We have had
numerous reviews from Ofgem, and Ofgem has clearly demonstrated that it
is not fit for purpose. That is why the Labour Party and the leader of
the Opposition have been absolutely crystal clear that under a Labour
Government we would have a complete restart of that regulatory body to
refocus it on putting the consumer first and bringing genuine
competition across the market, not just in supply, tariffs and the
consumer-facing parts of the industry, but all the way through the
chain. That includes the generation market and the wholesale market,
but also, importantly, the regulated aspects of this
industry.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111953000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0001.htm#13111953000317">5.15

the passage of the Bill one part of the energy sector has gone almost
without mention. That is the regulated aspects of the industry: the
distribution

consultation on the business plans of the DNOs. We raised this issue in
Committee. They are now extended to eight-year regulated periods.
Starting in 2015, they will sign off on a business plan that will last
eight years to 2023—just think how many Governments that
covers—and that essentially ties the hands of future Governments
who want to look at that aspect of industry. It is an important issue
because these regulated industries are going to change; they will see
changes arising from the Bill. If the Bill does what it says it is
going to do, which is to decarbonise and to help us move to a more
sophisticated demand-management system through capacity mechanisms, it
has significant implications for those regulated aspects of the
industry and yet we have heard scarcely a word about that. We have a
price review which is completely out of synch, and the business plans
have been drawn up before the Bill has even received Royal

evident to me that the regulator is not fit for purpose. I have heard
anecdotally that various parts of Ofgem, not the whole thing, have gone
completely native and are now merely rubber-stamping what the industry
wants. Therefore it is deeply regrettable that we are, at this very
late stage, having such a fundamental discussion. It reflects very
badly on the Government. This would not even be an issue if the leader
of the Opposition had not made it such a political centrepiece of his
conference speech, and here we are, several months later, discussing it

support the principle behind the amendment, but I fear that it is
simply too little, too late. We need a fundamental resetting of the
market to rebuild the trust which, it is clear, has been lost. We must
look at all aspects of the industry again to ensure that we put the
consumer first and, as we strive to meet the many challenges involved
in energy policy, that we put the consumer and value for money centre
stage as we also seek to achieve the very important aims of keeping the
lights on and addressing climate impacts. I am grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin, for raising this at this time, however it is, as I
said, too little, too late. We really need a fundamental review of

newly created Competition and Markets Authority—will conduct an
annual competition assessment of the energy market. The first
assessment will be completed by spring 2014. Together, these 
<?notus-xml column=891?>independent regulators already have extensive powers to investigate the
market and to implement the full range of structural and behavioural
remedies to strengthen competition. The statutory framework includes
important safeguards to give market participants confidence in a fair

a number of responsibilities of the Office of Fair Trading. This will

However, before I come to them I shall respond to my noble friend Lord
Caithness. This amendment simply creates a new power to make
regulations that confer powers on the regulator; it does not attempt to
say what should be in those regulations. Of course they would be
subject to consent by both Houses of Parliament, and I have no doubt
that if a significant new power were required, that, too, would have to
be subject to an affirmative resolution, or possibly a
super-affirmative resolution, in both Houses. I do not see this as
being undemocratic and without parliamentary review. The parliamentary
review would happen inevitably at each stage. I cannot accept my noble

echo my noble friend on the Front Bench. The Opposition have yet to
explain of what this new marvellous—what should we call

of. I believe in building on what we have got and improving it, rather
than taking a leap in the dark and making some entirely new start.
These reviews that have been announced—I caught wind of them
some time before the Prime Minister made his statement in the other

been working largely because of the reduction in the huge number of

first two recommendations are aimed at the Treasury. The Treasury has
to set up the structures whereby consumer interests can be considered

think I am being unduly alarmist by pointing out that if there has been
neglect of the consumer interest in the consideration of the
Government’s infrastructure investments, it is not altogether
unreasonable to assume that it has also been neglected elsewhere in

of giving the Secretary of State the power to require energy suppliers
to provide a breakdown of costs to consumers. This includes both
information about their costs in supplying domestic customers and costs
passed on to domestic consumers through the Government’s
environmental and social programmes. It also enables the Secretary of
State to set out the categories of costs to be included and to
determine the frequency with which this information must be provided. I
am grateful to my noble friend Lord Forsyth, who sadly is not in his
place today, and to other noble Lords who raised this matter on Report.
I listened very carefully to the views expressed and the Government
have brought forward this amendment in

Government are in complete agreement on the importance of providing
clear information on the costs that contribute to consumers’
energy bills, including the costs of government policies. Indeed, that
is why the Government publish each year a detailed assessment of the
impact of our policies in the <I>Estimated Impacts of Energy and
Climate Change Policies on Energy Prices and Bills</I>. However, I
recognise the strength of feeling on this issue and that is why we will
now go one step further and ensure that this information is provided
directly to consumers. We will be working with consumer groups,
including Which? and Consumer Futures, to take this forward. Four of
the largest suppliers already provide a breakdown of their costs on
consumer bills. As a first step, I will be seeking a voluntary
agreement with other suppliers to ensure that they also provide a
breakdown of their costs to consumers.</hs_para>

is right that we should first pursue a voluntary agreement, as this is
the quickest and most cost-effective route to getting this information
out to consumers. In the event that the Government are unable to reach
agreement to a voluntary approach, the Secretary of State will exercise
this power. We need to strike a balance between providing sufficient
detail on the costs associated with supplying gas and electricity, and
significantly increasing suppliers’ costs, which would
inevitably end up being passed on to consumers.</hs_para>

types of costs about which suppliers might be required to provide

following types of categories: wholesale energy costs, network and
distribution costs, costs of complying with government environmental

these costs should be left for them to decide, provided they include
these categories. I believe the approach we are taking strikes the
right balance by providing transparency to consumers on the costs
incurred by suppliers without imposing significant additional burdens.

amendment, which began its life, I think, in an interchange between the
noble Baroness and me in Grand Committee. She has pretty much supplied
everything that I asked for then, and I am very pleased. The only point
that I will make now is that the Government rightly want to make it
easy for consumers to switch suppliers. That is a good thing and it is
very helpful that this information will be made available one way or
another on bills. However, it needs to be made available consistently,
in the same form, by different suppliers, so that if you are comparing
a bill from one supplier with a bill from another, the information is
supplied in the same form on each bill. The noble Baroness did not
quite make that point in what she said. I hope that she can assure us
that these costs will be disclosed—either voluntarily or by the
exercise of the power that she is taking—not only transparently
but consistently and comparably by different

Maddock (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have one question for my noble
friend. She talked about making environmental costs clear to customers
on their bills. In the past few weeks, we have had lots of discussions
about eco and green taxes, and it has become quite clear that the big
six, in particular, have sometimes not pointed out to their customers,
or admitted in their discussions, that some of those costs are social
costs. Everything is in a bit of a state of flux at the moment but,
depending on how things work out, it is also important that we are
quite accurate on the bills about what is a social cost and what is a
so-called green tax. I will also just say that I am very sorry that I
was not here for the previous stage of the Bill when the noble Baroness
accepted my amendment about the clarity of bills. I hope that the point
that was raised by the right reverend Prelate will be covered in the
amendment that was passed on Report concerning the clarity of

amendment. However, I have a concern which is similar to the concern
expressed by my  
<?notus-xml column=895?>noble friend Lady Maddock about how these numbers
are produced. When the price increases came through from the energy
companies, a bill that I saw, to family members, bullet-pointed the
green energy costs as being at the top of the list, giving the
impression that this was the most important thing. We all know that
numbers are subjective. Numbers in company accounts are as objective as
they can be but they are subject to how things are interpreted to some
degree; as we know, for example, in terms of the lack of tax
that is paid by some multinational companies. Do the Government
have any view about how these numbers should be somehow independently
audited or at least be auditable, if we feel that they fall

noble friend replies. I was very glad to hear her say that she would
rather this was done voluntarily, but a back-up power is important to
encourage the right response from the industry. I apologise to the
right reverend Prelate. I was moving amendments on this subject during
proceedings on the last energy Bill but one. Those amendments suggested
that we needed to see more detail in the Bill. As other noble Lords
have said, one needs to have a very clear view as to what these figures
actually mean, which is not always apparent. I get bills with pie
charts and other things from British Gas. I have one in front of me, to
which I have referred before, from Southern Electric. Many of them try
to do their best, but such is the lack of trust now between the public
and the industry that the public need to be reassured that the figures
actually mean what they say. I look forward to seeing what comes from
this but, along with other noble Lords, I very much welcome

Grantchester:</Member></B> From these Benches, I am happy to endorse
the spirit of the amendments in the interests of consumers and
providing them with more information on their bills. These amendments
seem more neutral than those proposed on Report in that they do not
seek in the Bill to mandate energy suppliers to highlight certain
designated costs. The amendments thereby avoid the claim that they are
targeting so-called green levies on behalf of one strident viewpoint. I
listened carefully to the Minister’s words in proposing these
amendments and, like the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, I am not sure
that I picked up entirely how the Minister expected costs to be broken
down to include the social costs. Can she clarify that in her reply?
The impact of different costs, especially the so-called green or
environmental costs, should be balanced and it is important how that is
portrayed to
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T17:39:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

welcome the consultation that this will enable so that all views can be

Lords for, by and large, their support for my amendments. I will
quickly respond to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester and
to my noble friend Lady Maddock about transparency. The Government and
Ofgem both agree that it is important that suppliers are transparent
about their costs, including the costs of complying with government
environmental and social programmes. One part of the list to
which I referred earlier was about complying with greater
transparency on those costs. The suppliers would be expected to be able
to comply on the cost of delivering government environmental and social
programmes. Just to reassure noble Lords, the power enables the
Secretary of State to specify the particular kinds of costs that
suppliers must refer to, so if we need to get further detail, there is
scope to enable that to
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000014">I have

aware of how important it is to regard tackling fuel poverty as one of
the priority aims of energy policy. There will still be millions of

Committee, the Minister herself produced the provision that attempts to
rectify that situation. It was commendable of her to persuade her
colleagues that this was necessary, and the Government’s
commitment in Clause 145 to producing a new strategy for fuel poverty
in a maximum of six months’ time was broadly welcome—and
I still welcome it. However, many of us also considered that more
detail was required to make clear the nature of this strategy. As
colleagues will remember, a number of more detailed proposals for
inclusion in this part of the Bill were considered both in Committee
and on Report. The Government rejected all of those, unfortunately, but
at least the strategy is
there.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111971000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000141">5.45

is pretty neutral. Surely, at a minimum, the proposed strategy should
be about either the elimination of fuel poverty or at least the
reduction of the numbers of people in fuel poverty. That needs to be

regret having to say this but the reason why it is so important that a
reference to a reduction in numbers is included is that there is
considerable scepticism out there about the Government's good
intentions in this area. The Government started by closing down the
only taxpayer scheme designed to improve the energy efficiencies of the
dwellings of the fuel poor and, in effect, abandoned targets and sought
to redefine the problem. Extreme cynics, some of whom I have met, 
<?notus-xml column=898?>would say that the main thing that the Government
have so far done to “address” fuel poverty in the terms
of this clause has been to change the definitions—to
statistically manipulate 2 million people out of the figures without
anything actually having changed.</hs_para>

with the old definition, and in my view there are even greater problems
with the new one. But whatever the merits of the change in definition,
the combination of that with the Government’s abolition of
previous schemes, the slow and somewhat expensive start of the
ECO—which is supposed to address the problem of fuel
poverty—plus the lack of a mention in the original version of
this Bill, has led to some scepticism about the Government’s
intentions. I am moving this amendment so that the Government can make
their aim clear. This relatively modest amendment is as much in the
Government's interest as it is anybody else’s. I hope that they
will simply accept it and make clear what the intentions of this
strategy will be in a few
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000023">Amendment
12 is also intended to provide clarification. It has always been the
case, and is still the case under this Government, that multiple
measures are needed to address the problem of fuel poverty. The tariff
structures, which were addressed at an earlier stage of the
Bill, and income enhancements such as winter fuel payments for
pensioners, are also important. Most important of all, however, is the
need to improve the energy efficiency of the homes of the fuel poor.
That is also important for carbon reduction
purposes. However, the need to address energy efficiency in
buildings is not mentioned in Clause 145 or anywhere else in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000024">When the
Government express the strategy in terms of targets in a few
months’ time, I hope it will be clear that the targets are about
energy efficiency improvements as well as the number of fuel poor. If
that is the intention then it would be useful to have a reference to
energy efficiency in dwellings inserted in Clause 145 to
clarify that intention. That is what the second amendment
does.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000025">It is in
the Government’s interest to clarify this, and it will certainly
be in the interest of the consultation which they intend to hold on the
fuel poverty strategy in a few months’ time. I therefore hope
that the Government will consider these amendments positively. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000026"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T17:49:07"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13111971000161" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000161">Baroness
Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for
his amendment. Rightly, he has again highlighted the seriousness of
fuel poverty, as he has throughout the debates on this Bill, and I know
that on all sides of the House there is a real determination to ensure
that the interests of the fuel poor are represented properly. Indeed,
earlier today I attended an event with fuel poverty experts to gain a
better understanding of how to tackle the problem, at the invitation of
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for which I am extremely
grateful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000027">The
Government are determined to act to ensure that consumers get a good
deal and affordable energy bills. Indeed, our analysis suggests that as
a result of the electricity market reform measures in this Bill,
household electricity bills will be, on average, around 9% lower per
year over the period 2016 to 2030 relative 
<?notus-xml column=899?>to what they would be if decarbonisation were achieved through existing
policy instruments. As such, the impact of EMR will be to reduce fuel
poverty compared to what it would have been without these policies in
place.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111971000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000028">The
noble Lord’s amendments would set an objective to reduce the
number of persons living in fuel poverty and improve the energy
efficiency of their dwellings. The Government are intent on tackling
fuel poverty at its heart, with improving energy efficiency for
fuel-poor households a real priority. We agree that improving the
energy efficiency of fuel-poor homes can make a sustained improvement
to the situation of households struggling to keep warm and it is
therefore the right type of target to aim for. However, the right
balance must be struck between what is set out in primary legislation
and what is subsequently laid out in regulations, in order to maintain
an appropriate use of parliamentary time and the level of government
accountability.</hs_para>

proposed setting out the detail of this objective through secondary
legislation because we believe that this strikes the right balance
between the certainty of a legislative target and the need for
flexibility in the future. We know from Professor Hills’s
independent review that the way in which we understand the problem can
change over time, as well as the best ways of tackling it. Primary
legislation is not the appropriate vehicle to set out the detail of the
target, given the importance of a nuanced, flexible approach to
tackling fuel poverty.</hs_para>

current legislation is that there is a very specific target which does
not make sense in the context of how we have come to understand
the problem of fuel poverty. That is why we have framed the new
provisions in the way that we have, to ensure that there is an
objective to address fuel poverty but with the detail of that objective
set out in secondary legislation. Our proposals ensure that the setting
of the target, and any changes to it, will be subject to full
parliamentary debate, and the importance of that debate is why we have
suggested from the outset that these provisions will be subject to
affirmative resolution by both
Houses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000031">Furthermore,
from a practical perspective, it would not be sensible to make specific
reference to improving the energy efficiency of dwellings, as this
could mean that every time the methodology for measuring energy
efficiency is updated, the primary legislation would need amending. As
this could occur every couple of years, it would not represent a
proportionate use of parliamentary time for what would be very
technical amendments.</hs_para>

to the end of September. The vast majority have been installed through

noble Lords will recall, in Committee the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay,
explained the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning and highlighted, as
indeed did other noble Lords, some of the recent tragic cases. The
noble Baroness tabled an amendment that would have introduced
regulations for carbon monoxide detectors in the Bill. We could not
accept that amendment but it provoked a debate within government which
led me to announce on Report a couple of weeks ago that we would extend
our review of private rented accommodation to examine whether landlords
should be required to install carbon monoxide

Lords will recall that on Report the noble Baroness tabled an amendment
that would have introduced order-making powers on the Secretary of
State. During our debate then I was clear that the Government could not
commit to regulate in advance of the completion of the review I had
announced that day. However, as I could see the merits of having the
power in place should the Government decide that regulations are the
correct course of action, I agreed to discuss this further with my
ministerial colleagues. Having done that, I am pleased to put forward
government amendments today and am also pleased that the noble

us now differ from the one tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay,
on Report in two important respects. First, the government amendments
also cover smoke alarms. We decided that it would be sensible to do so
given that the arguments around carbon monoxide alarms are very 
<?notus-xml column=903?>similar for smoke alarms. Secondly, the amendments
apply only to rented housing, whereas the amendment tabled by the noble
Baroness, Lady Finlay, would have applied to all properties, including
owner-occupied ones. We have restricted the scope of the amendment in
this way because tenants in rented homes do not generally have the same
degree of control over their homes compared with home owners and may
therefore need greater protection. In addition, there is some evidence
that privately rented homes represent a greater risk to the safety of
occupiers than any other
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:01:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000046">In
tabling these amendments, I make it clear again that the Government
remain to be convinced of the need to regulate in this area at this
time. However, as I have said, we have decided that it would be
prudent to take the necessary powers now. We will now take
forward a wide-ranging and fundamental review into property conditions
in the private rented sector. The review will consider very carefully
the case for requiring landlords to install carbon monoxide alarms
and/or smoke alarms in their properties. The review is scheduled to
last approximately six months and to conclude in June 2014. As soon as
possible following this, the Government will publish a report which
will summarise the key findings of the review, set out government
conclusions and detail the Government’s intended actions
following those conclusions.</hs_para>

considering whether smoke and carbon monoxide alarms should be required
in privately rented housing, the review will also look at the minimum
standards tenants should expect when renting a property. This will
include considering the requirements of the Landlord and Tenant Act
1985, the current licensing system for privately rented housing,
current requirements around regular checks of electrical installations
in the home and whether there is a need to introduce a
compulsory system requiring that such installations are checked
regularly. We will also give careful consideration to the possibility
of requiring landlords to repay all or part of any rent they have
received where they rent out a property that contains serious health
hazards or has other major
defects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:03:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000048">It
is important that we do not prejudge the outcome of the review. The
Government are seeking to take these powers now to enable us to move
quickly if the review concludes that such alarms should be mandated in
this sector. I hope, therefore, that noble Lords feel reassured by what
I have said today and are reassured that the Government take this issue
very seriously. I am very grateful to noble Lords for their

my name to this amendment. This is Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week so
the amendment is extremely timely and I am glad the Government have
been prudent, and prudent enough to extend it to smoke alarms
as well. I am most grateful to the 
<?notus-xml column=904?>Minister for the time that she has spent with me on this issue and also
to the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, in her role as Minister taking this
Bill forward. I hope that the Public Health England warning that went
out yesterday over fossil fuel and wood-burning stoves for Carbon
Monoxide Awareness Week will become a thing of the past. It is
important that the cost of a working smoke alarm at European Standard
EN 50291, guaranteed for seven years, is put in context. One
year’s protection costs less than a large cup of coffee at a
motorway service area. Some 40 people a year on average lose their
lives through carbon monoxide poisoning and about 4,000 people end up
in A&amp;E. This is a really important step. I wish that we did not
have to take it but I am sure that we will end up needing to have
regulations made. I will continue to question the Government as it goes
through and I will be watching the review very carefully. In the mean
time, I am most grateful and I am sure that the victims’
families are also grateful that the Government have listened carefully

not stop it there and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and I had a very
productive meeting with her and her officials—she took on board
that we really ought to sort this out. It must be somebody’s
responsibility somewhere. I had hoped that there might be some
regulations somewhere that we could add this on to but that is not
exactly what has happened. I also raised it with my right honourable

will conclude next June. We will be as swift as possible in making
public our conclusions in response to that review. As I have said and
as I have demonstrated today, if the outcome of that review is a
decision that we should regulate, we now have in place the order-making
powers that would make that possible. The noble Lord urged us to go
further, but as I said when we discussed this matter at the previous
stage, his own Government conducted a comprehensive review of this area
only in 2009 and concluded that they should limit regulations to just
the installation of solid-fuel appliances. I accept his challenge and
the pressure he puts on me to make sure that we go further, but we are
doing this by way of review because we think that it is the right thing

expenditure, which must be also approved by the Treasury. It describes
the route as publicly committed, but allows for future extensions as
well as connections to the wider network. It requires an annual report
to be made to Parliament for all expenditure incurred, including any
variation from 
<?notus-xml column=907?>budget. It requires reporting on those receiving vocational
qualifications as a consequence of the project, and, of course, it is a
money Bill. Each phase of HS2 and any future extensions will require a
separate hybrid Bill without which construction cannot begin. That will
be the opportunity to debate and scrutinise the route in detail and the
manner in which the project will be delivered.</hs_para>

arguments for HS2 and the high-speed rail network that this Bill
presages: capacity, connectivity and growth. In Britain, we are running
out of capacity on our most important north-south routes. Demand for
intercity rail travel has doubled in the past 15 years. By the
mid-2020s, the west coast main line, our main rail line connecting
London, the Midlands and the north, will be full. That is calculated on
very modest figures for passenger growth: 2.2% a year. I should note
that for the past decade demand has grown at 4.4% a year or more.
Already in 2011, during the morning peak, 4,000 people were standing on
arrival into Euston and 5,000 people were standing on arrival into
Birmingham. It is close to impossible to get train paths for new
services on the west coast main line.</hs_para>

answer, and that is HS2. It gives us 18 trains an hour in each
direction when complete, each carrying up to 1,100 passengers. By
taking long-distance travellers off the existing lines, it releases
space on the west coast, east coast and midland main lines to be used
for much needed regional and commuter services. Network Rail estimates
that more than 100 cities and towns could benefit from the released
capacity. It also releases essential capacity for freight: demand for
rail freight is forecast to double by 2043, and there is not the
capacity to carry
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000064">I am, of
course, aware that many have proposed alternatives: upgrades to our
existing lines to provide that capacity. Many of the ideas are
interesting—in fact, some will probably be
implemented—but they leave us with two problems. The first is
scale. Including every reasonable alternative, we can achieve a 24%
increase in capacity. HS2 gives us a 105% increase. It is a complete
step change.</hs_para>

disruption. As upgrades mean working on active lines in daily use, we
have to resort to closure for much of the work. This House will have
seen the Atkins report showing 14 years of weekend closures, and that
is with an aggressive work programme of two simultaneous schemes on
each route at any one time. It would frankly be a
nightmare.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000066">HS2
also transform connections across Britain. It will link eight of our 10
largest cities. It links up great cities of the north and the Midlands.
Just as important as cutting times from London to Birmingham and
Manchester, HS2 takes more than an hour off the journeys between
Birmingham and Newcastle, York and Leeds. It will be integrated with
the nation’s main airports, with stations directly serving
Manchester and Birmingham and short connections to Heathrow via
Crossrail and to East Midlands Airport from Toton station. It is this
new connectivity that provides a spur to growth, and it is the reason
why the great northern cities are so supportive of HS2.</hs_para>

Deighton and the HS2 taskforce are looking at ways to maximise the
growth benefits of the line. The great cities are doing exactly that
without prompting. They can see the opportunity to rebalance the

gaining double the benefits of the south.</hs_para>

£15 billion a year by 2037. Construction and its supply chain
alone will provide 19,000 jobs. The Core Cities group predicts that HS2
will underpin the delivery of 400,000 jobs, and 70% of the jobs created
by HS2 are expected to be outside London. HS2 will be an opportunity to
build a British supply chain, as discussed previously in this House,
with skilled jobs for our young people—a supply chain and skill
set that will support not just this project but British industry at
home and abroad in future infrastructure markets. Of course not every
part of the UK benefits from HS2. It benefits more the areas that it
physically reaches. However, so does every transport infrastructure
project past, present and future; that is a characteristic of
infrastructure.</hs_para>

cost. The budget for HS2 is £42.6 billion. That is an upper
limit with a contingency of £14.4 billion. Rolling stock will be
another £7.5 billion. This means a benefit-cost ratio
of 2.3, which is frankly remarkable for a large project, especially
given the limitations of a formula that caps passenger demand three
years after phase 2 is finished. Sir David Higgins, the new chairman of
HS2, has been instructed to bear down on those costs, and he has said
that he can and will do so. The noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, recently
reminded us that part of those costs can be picked by up the private
sector rather than the taxpayer. That is the intention of the
Government and will be part of plans going forward.</hs_para>

that while the sums for HS2 are large, they are only part of
the transport spending budget. In the next Parliament we will spend
£73 billion on transport, only £17 billion of

adding 400 extra lane miles of motorway. We are tackling 195
local pinch points to break up jams. We are delivering the biggest rail
modernisation programme for generations, with more than £9
billion of government funding for major rail projects, including a new
£500 million rail link from the West Country to
Heathrow, an 850-mile national programme of rail electrification,
Crossrail and Thameslink in London and more than £900 million in

another issue that is often raised in this House. An exceptional

started work on what became HS2 five years ago. In March 2010 we
published the Command Paper that set out the case for HS2, together
with the detailed route plan from London to Birmingham and the outline
plan to extend the line from Birmingham to Manchester, Derby,
Nottingham, Sheffield and Leeds, linking to the existing main lines to
Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh. HS2 transforms connections
between London and the major cities of the Midlands and the north in
the spirit of the great Victorian pioneers who built the main lines
from the 1830s—starting with Robert Stephenson’s London
&amp; Birmingham Railway—upon which we still depend
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000075">It was
always clear to me that without cross-party agreement and a fixity of
national purpose to rise above short-term party politics, HS2 would
never happen. HS2 through to Manchester and Leeds is a 20-year project.
The golden rule of high-speed rail is that while everyone wants the
stations, no one wants the line. From the outset of planning HS2, I
therefore consulted with the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats,
and the Cabinet agreed to publish the Command Paper in 2010 only on the
basis of their support. I am glad to say that the coalition Government
have maintained this cross-party approach and very largely stuck to the
2010 plan for HS2. We may disagree on other areas of transport
policy—for example, I am proud that East Coast is doing such a
good job for the public as a state company and believe that it ought to
be allowed to continue as such—but on HS2 I acknowledge the
constructive role played by the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State
and other Ministers in keeping this a national project, not a party
project. This approach is fully reciprocated by my right honourable
friend the Leader of the
Opposition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000076">I
also applaud the decision to appoint Sir David Higgins as chair of HS2.
The biggest infrastructure project in Europe needs the best
infrastructure manager available. Sir David Higgins, fresh from
delivering the 2012 Olympics on time and on budget, is the very best.
As with all major infrastructure projects, HS2 has experienced some
teething problems. Sir David must get a firm grip on management and
costs at HS2, including the recent increase in the total projected cost

<?notus-xml column=910?>from £32 billion to £42 billion—an increase
largely due to a sudden, and in my view hard to justify,
decision by the Treasury to impose an extra £6 billion of
contingency reserve on the project, taking the contingency reserve
alone to £14 billion. HS2 cannot be “at any price”
and this represents a 50% contingency on the costed design of
£28 billion. We look to Sir David to review these costs and to
stress-test the figures with some urgency. I was glad to hear what the
noble Baroness said about that. I know that Sir David will also take to
heart the good advice on project costs and management from the noble
Lord, Lord Heseltine, in his excellent lecture on HS2 to the Royal Town
Planning Institute last
week.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000077">I will
say a few things about the history of HS2. There have been claims that
the 2010 Command Paper was not a thorough analysis, that I and others
were kidnapped by rail fanatics who bamboozled us into mortgaging the
Exchequer simply to cut half an hour off the journey time from London
to Birmingham, and that the whole project has had to be relaunched on
the basis of capacity rather than speed. None of this is correct.
Capacity is and always has been the central argument for HS2. The 2010
Command Paper could not have been clearer. It set out the previous
Government’s intention to proceed with HS2 in these
words:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13111971000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000137">“The
Government’s assessment is that over the next 20 to 30
years the UK will require a step-change in transport capacity between
its largest and most productive conurbations, both facilitating and

additional
capacity”—</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13111971000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000106">I

capacity first, with speed and connectivity significant additional
benefits. That was the argument for HS2 in 2010, it is the argument in
2013 and, if we see this through, it will be the argument on its
completion in 2033—and no doubt on HS2’s centenary in
2133—because capacity is the fundamental problem, solved for a
generation and more by HS2. It is a problem that, if not solved, will
mean that in just 10 years’ time we will have to start closing
the north-south intercity railway to new business, which would be a
betrayal of the future prosperity of this country, given that HS2
connects the five principal cities and conurbations of the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:30:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000079">The
facts on capacity are compelling. Long-distance rail demand has doubled
in the past 16 years alone; the trend growth rate is 5% a year,
consistently ahead of economic growth, as other modes of intercity
transport such as motorways and domestic aviation become saturated or
simply unavailable, and as railway services steadily improve.</hs_para>

not just meet rising demand for intercity travel; by freeing up
substantial capacity on the existing lines, it also provides a huge
capacity boost for freight trains and for commuter and regional
passenger services. Rail freight volumes have increased by more than
50% in the past 20 years and continue to grow fast. Moving freight from
road to rail is a national imperative, placing a special pressure on
the west coast main line, which gets most of the relief from the
additional capacity of HS2 since 43% of all rail freight 
<?notus-xml column=911?>movements in the country use it to get from the ports to the
nation’s major goods distribution centres in the
Midlands.</hs_para>

for commuter rail, demand has also increased sharply over the past 20
years, particularly into the biggest cities served by
HS2—London, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and
Leeds—because the big cities are the national dynamos of
population and employment growth, and they will continue to be so as
the UK’s population increases by a projected 11 million people
in the next two decades. Here, again, HS2 is an essential
congestion-buster, to the benefit of dozens of towns and cities
in and around the major corporations. Coventry, Wakefield,
Bradford, Stockport, Leicester, Peterborough, Stevenage, Bedford, St

question before Parliament and the country is this: if not HS2, what?
Given that we are not going to be building new intercity motorways or
encouraging more domestic aviation—nor should we—the only
alternative to HS2 for dealing with the capacity crunch is massive
further upgrades of the existing Victorian main lines. This would be
very expensive and destructive and yield only a fraction of the
capacity and other benefits of HS2. You do not need a crystal ball to
appreciate this reality. It is only five years since the most recent
upgrade of the west coast main line was completed; it cost £9
billion and entailed a decade of constant chronic disruption, at
weekends and often on weekdays too, without services or with severe
delays and diversions. Upgrading a busy main-line railway is like
conducting open-heart surgery on a moving patient—horrendous for
all
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:33:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000083">The
2010 Command Paper estimated that to achieve two-thirds of the capacity
of HS2 by conventional line upgrades, just for London to Birmingham,
would cost more in cash terms than HS2. In practice, though, many of
those proposed upgrades, like four-tracking the Chiltern line, are
simply unattainable. If I was in any doubt about that, I have been
seriously disabused by the large number of your Lordships who live in
the Chilterns and rightly treasure it, and who have given me freely the
benefit of their advice on these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:33:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000084">The
present Government have since identified a more credible upgrade
alternative from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, which is
set out in chapter 6 of the strategic case document that was published
last month. The key points about the upgrade alternative are these.
First, the upgrade is projected to cost £19 billion. That is
nearly half the cost of HS2 but the capacity increase would be less
than one-quarter—so half the cost for one-quarter of the
capacity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000085">Secondly,
that increase in capacity would be insufficient by the late 2020s even
to keep pace with the lower of the growth projections for intercity
traffic set out in the Government’s strategic assessments. So in
all likelihood we would complete the upgrades of the existing lines,
spending £19 billion, only to be faced with the prospect of
either carrying out yet more expensive upgrades to the existing main
lines or, at that stage in the 2020s, of embarking on HS2. That would
be an even more expensive repeat of the situation that we now face in
taking forward HS2, having already spent £9 billion 
<?notus-xml column=912?>on the most recent upgrade of the west coast main line when we might
have done better to have started HS2 15 years ago.</hs_para>

billion price tag for the upgrade alternative does not take into
account the chronic disruption of the upgrades in question—the
open-heart surgery on the moving patient that I just described. Look at
the description of these upgrades and you will see that to undertake
them would require, as the Minister said, the equivalent of 14 years of
continuous line closures every weekend. Furthermore, the list of
projects involved in the £19 billion upgrade alternative, with
its 14 years of disruption, is colossal, to say the least: a new
30-mile stretch of tunnel and surface line to get the east coast main
line out of King’s Cross, avoiding a series of acute existing
bottlenecks including the Welwyn viaduct; the rebuilding of most of the
major stations on all three of the main lines going north from Euston,
St Pancras and King’s Cross, including those three termini, to
accommodate more platforms and longer trains; and four-tracking a lot
of two-track sections of line, including in urban areas. The idea that
this would be an easy alternative to HS2, let alone a cheap one, is
wishful thinking, to put it mildly.</hs_para>

is true that putting the £19 billion upgrade option through the
Treasury’s benefit/cost ratio methodology produces a somewhat,
but not much, higher ratio figure than comes out for HS2, but from my
experience of major transport projects I would always be cautious about
the value of benefit/cost ratios because they involve so many
artificial assumptions. The M25, the Victoria line and the Jubilee line
extension all had low benefit/cost ratios and faced a deeply hostile
Treasury, but which of those do we now think it would be a good idea to
close? All three of them have recently been upgraded to deal with
congestion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:37:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000088">Much
has been made by the critics of HS2 of the value given in the
benefit/cost ratio to the benefit of time saved by business travellers,
as if they were not able to work on trains. Equally artificial, though,
and far more significant in its impact on the BCR for HS2, is the fact
that the benefit/cost methodology caps traffic growth projections in
2036, only three years after the opening of HS2, on the grounds that
further growth thereafter is too speculative. Do any of your Lordships
seriously think that traffic will stop growing in 2036? Brunel did not
build the Great Western Railway on the assumption that there would be
no traffic growth after 1870—thank goodness, otherwise the GWR
would have been built single-track. He might even have been
told by a Treasury economist that upgrading the canals offered better
value for money. Nor did we build the M25 thinking that traffic would
stop growing in 1995, which would have been an equivalent
assumption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:38:09"></hs_TimeCode>. What
is needed here is a dose of common sense plus a grasp of history, which
shows that in Britain, with our historic aversion to major
infrastructure investment, we have consistently under- estimated the
value of better transport links serving our major population and
economic
centres<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:38:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000089">I
have a few other points to make. Faster journey times, although not a
principal reason for HS2, are a considerable benefit that cannot but be
advantageous 
<?notus-xml column=913?>to the unity of Britain and the strength of its
economy. As HS2 proceeds further north, the time savings become
steadily greater: an hour off every journey between London and
Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds. Journeys will be further shortened by
the proposed interchange between HS2 and the new Crossrail line at Old
Oak Common, just west of Paddington. This will give an 11-minute
connection direct to Heathrow and fast underground trains direct to the
West End, the City and Docklands without going via Euston and its
congested Victoria and Northern lines. This could be a rare British
example of joining up two major traffic infrastructure projects at the
point of
conception.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000090">The
second point is that the notion peddled even by some reputable
commentators that bringing northern and Midland cities closer to London
will suck the lifeblood out of them is utterly farcical. If it were
true that modern transport connections between great economic centres
were a negative factor, we should close existing motorways and

third point is that HS2 not only dramatically improves connections
between these cities and London but between the cities themselves, as
the noble Baroness said. This is a crucial part of the connectivity
improvement brought about by HS2. The Victorian railway companies built
mostly separate main lines from provincial cities to London, which is
why rail links between most of our provincial cities remain terrible.
Birmingham and Manchester are only 67 miles apart, yet the rail journey
takes one and a half hours. It is 40 minutes by
HS2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:40:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000092">Fourthly,
while I do not think that just because most other developed countries
do things we should follow suit, I believe that when a technology has
proved successful elsewhere we should take note. Almost every developed
country with an economic geography similar to ours has over the past
generation built high-speed rail to link their major cities. Japan
started in 1964 with Tokyo to Osaka, about the distance from London to
Glasgow. Since then, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands,
Belgium, South Korea and Taiwan have all followed suit. China is
constructing more high-speed rail than the rest of the world combined,
and the United States is building its first line from LA to San
Francisco—two major cities also about the same distance apart as
London and
Glasgow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T18:41:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111971000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111971000093">In
conclusion, I am not aware of a single country that has introduced
high-speed rail between its major cities and now thinks it was a
mistake. They know that high-speed rail is integral to building a
modern economy and a modern society. I believe it will be the same here
in Britain, so we should get on with
HS2.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_19_PT_1/9F712199D901C6DF95E838BD09ADC54914D68C77" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 November 2013">Tuesday,

Bradshaw (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I warmly endorse the words of the
noble Lord, Lord Adonis. I do so having managed all four lines out of
London towards Edinburgh and Birmingham, including via Marylebone. They
are now full. When I managed them there was about half the amount of
traffic that there is now and very little capacity has been added since
then. The noble Lord mentioned the upgrade on the London to 
<?notus-xml column=914?>Birmingham line but, in fact, it has not produced much in the

am quite convinced of the need for a new line north of London. The
problem is that, whichever way you go, it is going to upset somebody.
There is not a way you can build a line without building it through
areas that will be badly affected. It is therefore extremely important
that the compensation arrangements, to which my noble friend Lady
Kramer referred, are fair and the environmental impact is measured
carefully. This is going to be the case because, while I agree that
during construction there will be damage to the
environment—there is bound to be as there is on any construction
site—once the work is done, the countryside can get back almost
to where it was. The wildlife and flowers will return—whatever
you value will return—as a railway does not interfere with the

has been put about by some of the opponents that once you have the
high-speed line, other places which formerly had a train
service to London will lose theirs, so somehow Coventry and
Rugby, to name two places, will suddenly lapse back into having poor
quality services. That is most unlikely to be the case, because the
case will exist to provide good services on those lines and there is no

strategic need for HS1, because it was about speed through the Channel

the alternative of flying from Heathrow if you are coming from central

noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, and the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, referred

existing railways. I am going to refer briefly to the west coast main
line. Without proceeding with this Bill, in 25 or 30 years’
time, we will have a shambles of a national railway system. We have to
upgrade the capacity. My noble friend Lord Heseltine, whom I served, is
absolutely right to focus on capacity as one of the key arguments for
this line. It is estimated that up to £20 billion is required to
upgrade the west coast main line. I hope that figure is right; it is
certainly that order of magnitude. Upgrading that line, as opposed to
HS2, would create absolute mayhem for many weekends over many years and

points about the alternative of trying to upgrade the west coast main
line. Your Lordships might be interested to know that, at present, in
the final peak hour for passengers coming into and out of Euston on the

friend Lord Bradshaw is particularly concerned about freight, as I am,
too. HS2 will do a great deal for freight, particularly by taking it
off the M1 and the M6. Creating more capacity at the southern end of
the existing west coast main line by moving that passenger traffic onto
the high-speed line will, I am told, deliver 20 extra daily freight
paths on to the line. I see my noble friend Lord Bradshaw nodding, so I
must be right. There will be relief for freight traffic on the M1 and
the M6. Without HS2, that freight traffic can only increase. I am told
that the order of magnitude is of half a million lorry journeys coming
off the motorways per annum. That is what will occur if we not only
proceed with this legislation but build HS2.</hs_para>

Adonis, referred to three other advantages of HS2 which relate directly
to capacity: the link to HS1, so that one could travel from Birmingham

other factors to be taken into account here—factors that have so

I do not agree with everything that the noble Lord says in his speech,
he does echo the recent Armitt report's call for us to do our
infrastructure planning differently in future, although appealing over
the heads of one's colleagues is probably not what Armitt had in mind.
The reality is that the Government will not get their hybrid Bill for
phase 1 of HS2 through in this Parliament. Given that the public
interest would be better served if the proposals could be evaluated in
the context of a fully developed infrastructure plan and a national
planning framework of the type outlined in the recent report by Sir
John Armitt, why not pause—which seems to be the
vogue—the process now? There would then be time to engage in a
proper cross-party debate and take a fresh look at HS2 to help the
Government build in greater connectivity, sustainability and
flexibility, and also help meet local concerns without damaging the
overall national objectives of the HS2

capacity is no longer the principal case for HS2, it must follow that
HS2 Ltd is now free to take rather longer to reach its destination. On
the face of it there should be scope for more flexibility and choice,
thus easing the problems in the countryside and at the London end of

it. It is great that we now have all-party support for this project. I

have very kindly said about rail freight, it is forecast to double over
20 years. We have discussed that, and passenger increase, in previous
debates. Therefore I see High Speed 2, certainly in phase 1 and
continuing into phase 2, as in effect adding two more tracks to the
west coast main line in a way that will not
obstruct or close it while it is being 
<?notus-xml column=921?>built. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, said that he expected
that if we did not have this, there would be a shambles in 20 to 30
years. I believe that it will be closer to 10 years.</hs_para>

preparations, the freight industry is discussing the capacity with HS2.
Noble Lords will understand that when phase 1 gets to somewhere around
Lichfield, where it joins the west coast main line, you have lots of
different train services going onto the west coast main line, which
happens to go into a short section of two tracks that go through
Shugborough Tunnel. We have had very useful discussions with Network
Rail and HS2 about where all these trains will go when seven extra High
Speed 2 trains in phase 1 join the residual services on the west coast
main line—although “residual” is not the right
word, because they are very important services. As noble Lords have
said, there is no intention to reduce those services provided to people
who are not on High Speed 2. If you add to that the increase in
freight, you have a problem. Network Rail is working with the industry
on what to do about that problem, but it will still be there in 10
years’ time. Whether it involves diversions, more night working
or whatever, that challenge will happen now.</hs_para>

previously, if it does not go by rail, it will go by road, and do we
want another three-lane motorway somewhere? I think that the answer, as
my noble friend said earlier, is that we do not. Therefore we have to
find solutions to the capacity problem. It is a problem mainly on the
west coast main line, and funnily enough, it is not just near Lichfield
and thereabouts, but will happen north of Crewe as well, because there
are sections of two-track there when you go over Shap towards Carlisle.
The network needs looking at in a 20-year horizon so that the demands
of freight and passenger—not just up the line but across it and
parallel to it—are met. It is good that it has begun, and we
shall probably have to have quite a few debates about the detail of
this when one gets to the hybrid Bill and the Select Committees to see
what answers and commitments can be made. However, in many ways that is
a good challenge to
have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000027">I was
struck by comments from my noble friend Lord Adonis and the noble Lord,
Lord Bradshaw, and others about the appraisals. It is absolutely crazy
to say that that the growth will stop three years after phase 2 opens.
That is rather like the announcement last week by either the Treasury
or maybe the Department for Transport that the forecasts are that the
growth of cycling in London will suddenly stop in 2015 and will
thereafter decrease. Leaving aside the terrible run of accidents in the
past week or two, what evidence is there that the growth in cycling in
London over the past 10 years, which has been pretty surprising and
gratifying for me, will suddenly tail off? It is probably something to
do with the fact that they do not want to spend any more money on it.
We need a review of the whole appraisal methodology. Maybe the noble
Lord, Lord Deighton, is the person to lead that. The whole structure is
not fit for purpose. Having arguments about what the cost-benefit ratio
on a project the size of HS2 is is a pretty good waste of time, but
still, we have to do it.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, spoke about environmental issues,
particularly in the Chilterns, and about AONB and woodlands; I do not
think that he mentioned bats, but they will come in. I was involved in
a way with the construction of HS1 and had many dealings with the noble
Lord, Lord Freeman, when he was Minister. He certainly tried very hard
and very successfully to deal with the objections of some of the people
who lived along that route. One person said, “You are destroying
the garden of England”. In three years’ time, after the
line was opened and the trees had grown up a bit, he told me that it
had not made any difference to his life at all. The construction will
be hard, but we have to be careful about overreacting to what will, I
hope, be a temporary and well managed construction phrase. When it is
built, it will not be particularly serious. This makes me worry about
how one balances the concerns of people against environmental concerns.
As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, 2,700 properties in Camden are
affected against 100 in the Chilterns. How do we balance those? Are the
Chiltern people more important, or is the environment more important?
That is a very difficult judgment to make, although I am sure somebody
will make it. However, we have to be careful that we do not overreact.
I say this as someone who was brought up in Great Missenden; I know it
very well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000029">I
have had lots of letters from people about objections. Some say that
this is about capacity, others that it is about speed, while others
argue about the economy. However, let us just look at what has happened
to Lille and Lyon in France, which were two of the first provincial
cities in France to be connected to the high-speed network. The city of
Lille paid a lot of extra money to get the station in the middle of
Lille rather than having the line go round the outside, as originally
planned. The two cities are completely transformed. To say that such a
line pulls economic benefit away from such cities to the centre is all
wrong. It will help. Even outside cities such as Lille—up to 20,
30 and 40 kilometres away—there are benefits. We should look and
see what has happened
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000030">We
should also reflect on the fact that the first high-speed line in
France, to Lyon, was built as a means of providing more capacity; it
was nothing to do with speed. It is a virtually straight line from
Paris to Lyon, which goes through very sparsely populated countryside,
and it has done so well in the 20 or 30 years that it has
been open that they have had to replace all the track already and have
signalled it so that, I believe, it can now take a train every
two minutes, because the demand is increasing. That will
probably go
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000031">The track
is very steep and undulating. I remember taking some Members of
Parliament there when I worked for Eurotunnel, and they drove a train;
we were allowed to drive the trains in those days. It was great fun,
although people normally got a bit seasick in the front. It was also
very exciting, and it still is exciting—and it just shows what
the demand really could
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000032">To
conclude, I shall say a word or two about connectivity. A lot of people
have said that the HS2 line is not connected, but I think the
Government are right not to specify what services will be operated
in  
<?notus-xml column=923?>10 or 20 years’ time. The links are there.
They are linking into the west coast main line. They are going to link
to Manchester, to the west coast north, to Leeds and everything. In the
south, Old Oak Common, as some noble Lords have said, is a wonderful
interchange.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000033">I
have concerns about some of the connections in London. The noble Lord,
Lord Bradshaw, and I are coming up with an alternative idea that, we
hope, will reduce the demolition around Euston and provide better
connectivity. I also have concerns about the station in Birmingham and
the lack of connectivity on to Wolverhampton, because people will not
save much time if they have to walk for 15 minutes between the new
station and Birmingham Snow Hill to go on to
Wolverhampton.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000034">However,
these are small details. The key issue is how to get the connectivity
between these new services and the existing ones and city centres. We
have problems in many station termini in London: Victoria, Paddington
and Euston all get very congested in the rush hour, particularly on the
underground. Connecting some of the west coast main line suburban
trains into Old Oak Common and directly into Crossrail will save an
enormous number of passengers from going into the underground at peak
times.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111980000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000035">Those
are the kinds of issues that need to be discussed because HS2 is part
of a network, and I hope that HS2 trains will go to many different
parts of the north and west on electrified lines. That will provide
enormous benefits in capacity. The speed will help in some places, but
the important thing is capacity, because if we do not have the capacity
we will be really lost. We have to get on with this as quickly as we
can. I do not believe that doubling or quadrupling the great central or
the midland main line will be enough. Just imagine the hassle in High
Wycombe and Princes Risborough if we had to demolish half the houses
there and build four tracks. The midland main line will probably have
to be reconstructed as four tracks, as it used to be, in addition to
HS2, within 10 or 20 years anyway. This is the kind of growth we are
looking at. We have to get on with this project. It has been well

Howard of Rising (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this country’s
debt is increasing at a rate in excess of £100 billion a year. I
find it hard—almost impossible—to believe that in these
circumstances Her Majesty's Government propose to enter into a
financial commitment the case for which—I say this in spite of
the eloquence that I have heard today—looked at in the very
best, kindest and most positive way, is weak. Looked at in any normal
way, HS2 is, frankly, insane. No sane businessman, dealing with his own
money, would dream of making an investment based on the criteria being
used to justify HS2.</hs_para>

the economy is improving, so that by the time bills have to be paid the
financial position might be better, but the country will still have a
burden of £1 trillion of public debt to deal with.
There is no certainty about what the project will cost. I do not 
<?notus-xml column=924?>think anyone knows. In 2008 the cost was estimated
to be £17 billion, in 2010 the estimate had increased to
£30 billion, in 2012 it was up to £33 billion, and this
year the figure has increased to £42.6 billion. And that is
without counting the cost of the odd £10 billion for rolling
stock. For what it is worth, the <I>Financial Times</I> has estimated
the true cost to be £73 billion. Who knows what the final cost
will be? Major Government spending plans have a habit of going over
budget distressingly
frequently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T19:26:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000038">Until
quite recently the main argument to support this project has been the
financial benefit to be gained from faster train journeys, because they
would give more time for travellers to get on with their
affairs—indeed, 79% of all benefits in the business case for HS2
are attributed to these savings. However, the vast majority of
passengers on trains do get on with their business: reading, writing,
using laptops and so on. They do not just sit there doing nothing. If
the proponents of this Bill had ever sat on an intercity train they
would have seen this. As a businessman who has never had a head office,
but has had interests all over the country, I have spent many hours
travelling; half an hour more or less on a train has never mattered. In
practice, travelling time on trains is useful, as it enables one to get
on with things, such as writing and reading, without interruption. The
other point your Lordships might care to note is that the time-saving
calculations assume trains travelling at 140 mph—a speed not yet
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T19:27:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000039">More
important is the time spent journeying to and from stations, when it is
considerably more difficult to use the time to good effect. In five of
the seven main provincial cities to be served by HS2 trains, the line
will not even go into main railway stations. In Sheffield, Nottingham
and Derby the HS2 station will be 10 miles from the city
centre. With the extra time required to get from the station to the
final destination, one has to question whether there will be an overall
time saving at all: will the journey door to door take just as long
with HS2 as it did
before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T19:28:14"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000040">With
increasing recognition of the weakness of the time argument, the
justification now being emphasised is the need for the extra capacity
that HS2 will provide. How this will happen with, for example, the
number of platforms at Euston presently used for existing services
being reduced from 18 to 13 is difficult to understand. Figures that
became available in December 2012 as a result of a judicial review show
that intercity trains on the west coast main line were only 52% full in
the evening peak period, and there was still scope to increase the size
of trains if necessary. In spite of what the noble Lord, Lord Adonis,
said, I believe that if there is a need for spare capacity there are
other and considerably cheaper solutions.</hs_para>

and cost £19 billion have been comprehensively rubbished by a
number of different commentators—so much so that the objectivity
of the arguments in favour of HS2 must be seriously suspect. In any
event, it would take 17 years before both phases of HS2 were
complete.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111980000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111980000042">There

communications with the outside world. It beggars belief that Her
Majesty’s Government are proposing to spend quantities of
billions of pounds on a project for which the business case does not
even stand the most cursory examination, instead of getting on with
increasingly desperately needed airport capacity—something the
Minister hardly even mentioned in her long list of money to be spent on

those issues are addressed and answered very fully. I draw his
attention to the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, refers to
the Government selling a 30-year concession in 2011 for High Speed 1 to
a Canadian pension fund for £2.1 billion. I understand that
something in the order of £10 billion could be realised for a

important thing that came out of the debate was a demonstration of the
overwhelming need to add capacity to our railways as a consequence of
the phenomenal growth in demand for rail transport over the past 20

Rodgers, is still in his place, I will go back to 1976 and recall a

particular because the <I>Register </I><I>of Lords’

say that I have never discussed HS2 with either the company or other
rail operators; I have had no discussion with the roads lobby, the
landowners lobby or the airlines lobby; and I have had no discussions
with local government, although I have requested written briefings.
However, earlier this year, HMG was seeking someone to chair the HS2
planning forum, which is the meetings between HS2 Ltd, the Department
of Transport and the local authorities along the proposed route. It was
for just a handful of days per year. I offered. I did not get past the
first cut and I have never spoken to anybody. I have nothing to
register but I am being open and transparent, because the offer is
there in the files, so that trouble makers in the future cannot make

the sad death of my noble friend Lord Corbett of Castle Vale, I was

of Birmingham, Erdington. Colleagues will have driven past it. There
were 34 tower blocks there at one time; there are now two. The link
from the north-south route of HS2 into the centre of Birmingham will
traverse the outer perimeter of Castle Vale. It has not been on the

see a 
<?notus-xml column=929?>problem with that. A new north-south link, which in my view should reach
both Glasgow and Edinburgh, using modern technology, will bring benefit
to generations and regions in the UK. Not many of us here today, as the
noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, said, will see the benefit, but the crazy
way in which the figures are presented is designed to put people off,
designed to put supporters off, even. If it is going to benefit
generations, why are most of the headline figures less than half a

noble friend Lord Adonis in his excellent speech mentioned some of the
alternatives. What are they? We could raise the fares; stop people
using the railways. Reduce demand—it can be done, but it will
not be much good for connectivity, economic productivity and growth.
There could be a major expansion of domestic air flights, with extra
check-in times, more pollution and a few more local runways. Enough
said. We could build more motorways. The road lobby would welcome that.
In fact, I wonder how much it is spending on anti-HS2, but I am not
making any point about that. Of course, we need to improve the motorway
network, junctions and feeder roads, especially on the M40 and the M20,
but a major network of new motorways cannot be what the country needs.
I have to assume that nobody from the Chilterns ever goes on the M6
north of Birmingham. That road has been 60 feet from the
bedrooms of some of my ex-constituents, from 24 May 1972 until today:
an elevated section at rooftop level 60 feet from their houses. Think
about that for the way people move around the country. It works, but we
do not want any more. We do not want a new motorway system. The idea
that nobody travels on the existing infrastructure, which does disturb
people, is, of course, palpable
nonsense<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T19:47:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000007">We
could patch and mend the railway. I have not seen the attack on the
2,500 weekends. Basically, it is 14 years of weekend working, as the
Minister said, on two out of the three north-south lines at any one
time. That is the reality and what is more, it would cost
£19 billion to £20 billion and we would not
get a great deal from it. None of these alternatives will create the
ingredients for regional economic growth and bring the private sector
investment on the back of public expenditure which has occurred
elsewhere. A new classic rail, the figures say, will cost 9% less than
high speed, but high speed rail delivers journey time benefits by a
factor of more than 5:1. It is not about journey times but the factor
has to be taken into account that HS2, compared to the classic rail, is
5:1<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T19:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000008">Not
everything has to done at once, which is the impression given by the
loose talk of some about the costs. The noble Lord, Lord Heseltine,
mentioned that the annual £2 billion on London Crossrail ends as
the HS2 annual expenditure of £2 billion starts. The two things
merge together, and this benefits the whole country, not just the
capital city. That has to be taken into account. Buried deep in the
publications on HS2 is the point that we are talking about generations
benefiting. Therefore, why cannot we use assumptions beyond the 20
years set out in the main body of the documents? The cost-benefit ratio
goes from 1 to 2.3 to 1 to 4.5 if we go to 2040. It is preposterous to
say 
<?notus-xml column=930?>that it will benefit generations and then cut off all the calculations
showing how beneficial it will be at half a lifetime. It does not make
sense. It may be the way that it has been done in the past by the
Department of Transport and the Treasury, but it does not make sense in
making the

like to hear from the Minister about one aspect of the speech of the
noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, as I thought that it was the most important
point he made. He said that the Government should propose development
corporations at points of development on the route in order for the
public to recoup some of the planning gains in exactly the same way we
did in Docklands. Let us face it, in Docklands four local authorities
did nothing for 30 years. That is why Docklands had to be seized into a
development corporation to get the planning gain back for the public
investment. That is exactly what the noble Lord said we can do along
the HS2 route. I would genuinely like to know about that because it has
not been referred to elsewhere. We cannot be certain—nothing is
fixed about this—but the evidence in Docklands, the Thames
Gateway and other areas of public investment, such as in the new city
of Milton Keynes, which is doubling in size, is that along with public
investment comes private investment to create the jobs and an economic
future. We cannot, however, factor that into the calculations, although
it is clearly self-evident. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, made that
point. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T19:50:52"></hs_TimeCode>
public sector must lead on this project. It is no good saying that the
private sector should build HS2; the public sector has to lead but it
does not have to do it all. By using our brains we can recoup
as much of the extra land values as possible, as we have done in the
past.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111983000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000010">I hope
that with this Bill we can hear the whistle blown for HS2 to leave the
station of Whitehall to spread economic and social regeneration
throughout the UK. So far, the only whistle I have heard regarding HS2
is the dog whistle blown by some colleagues in Labour’s high
command, aimed at those living in the Home Counties. Dog-whistle
politics are not honest politics in any case. In this case, it happened
that the dog whistle was heard in the town hall corridors of the
northern cities of this country, and the message came back loud and
clear. I hope that we hear no more of the dog
whistle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000011">This
is a visionary project on a scale that transcends the Channel
Tunnel—although that is unique by definition—and the
post-war new towns. It cannot be right, therefore, for any political
leader to claim the project for themselves, and the Prime Minister is
not doing that. As my noble friend Lord Adonis said, it is to the
credit of this Government that they have taken this project forward.
This has to be all-party or it will not happen; it is as simple as
that. Furthermore, the final decision cannot be left to the financial
bean counters because we know that the finance figures are fiddled. The
20-year cut-off helps to destroy the case, so I do not accept it. I
reject the scrimping “Britain can’t do it”
approach. Leaders need to lead and show vision. They should connect
public good investment, much of which can be recouped, with the
substantial private gains in jobs and economic and social prosperity. A
petty, party, tribal approach is to be condemned and

State sitting on the steps of the Throne during her speech and that of

but it is a matter for which we should have a care, even though in this
House—quite rightly—we do not have the power to send back

unambiguous democratic mandate in this country is at the other end of
the Corridor, and long may it remain so. That is why I have always been

we do not consider as carefully as we might. This is a finite country.
People have been talking this evening about France and Germany, 
<?notus-xml column=932?>which are enormous European countries on our
continent, and have thrown in references to China, which is not exactly
a miniscule country. Noble Lords sought to suggest that because those
countries depend so much on high-speed rail, given the enormous
distances that have to be covered, we should follow suit. I do not
think that to have an efficient transport system in this country we

mind that other priorities should be considered. When I drive from my
home in Lincoln to London, I come down the A1. It is a scandal that the
main arterial route to the north is not of motorway standard. I agree
with the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and I know spaghetti junction almost
as well as he does; for 40 years I represented a seat in Staffordshire,
and from the opening of the M6 onwards I used that road
weekly—year in, year out. I agree with him that we do not want a
lot more motorways, but parts of our road system are wholly inadequate
for the needs of our people, and the A1 is one of those roads. A number

place and the other seeking to speak up for heritage causes. As long
ago as 1976 I wrote a book called <I>Heritage in Danger</I>, in which I
talked about the threats to our landscape from unthinking development.
I well understand why people living near the Chiltern Gap feel as they
do about the M40, skilfully as it has been landscaped. Our country is
precious. Our countryside, once destroyed, can never be brought back.
We must have very real concern about the environmental effects of HS2,
particularly in the Chilterns. I was in that area for a couple of days
last week when we had our brief break. It is one of the loveliest parts

without sounding insulting, I think that some people who are going over

Lea of Crondall (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in following the noble
Lord, Lord Cormack, I doubt very much that he will reflect that he
might be mistaken on the basis of the arguments that I will put
forward. On two things, he ought to reflect on whether he might have
got them wrong. I shall begin with his phrase “a small
island”. Actually, that is the argument for railways, compared
to larger countries. It is undoubtedly the case that as the economy
grows, there is a propensity for the coefficient describing how fast
passenger miles grow to increase. People have more discretionary
expenditure which, as family dispersion proceeds, produces more family
passenger miles as well as more business passenger miles, so these
extra passenger miles will be generated. There is a positive
coefficient in relation to economic growth. No one now flies between
Heathrow and Manchester as they used to some time ago, and so the
alternatives are much greater congestion on the roads or more capacity
on the
railways.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000023">Higher
speed attracts and is part of the equation. So is the fact that the
size of the country is shrinking, if we think of economic geography in
terms of how long it takes to get somewhere. We see as a cluster the
whole city region of Manchester—where I was born—West
Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, East Midlands and West Midlands. It is less
than an hour all the way round. I ask the Minister whether the
department ought to produce a study of a regional cluster compared with
some European and other ideas, because this is a way in which we can
learn from each other. I think that the answer will be that we are
talking about an economic
transformation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000024">I
remember when Alastair Morton, the visionary chief executive of
Eurotunnel, described economic geography as the basis of economic
development. I am an economist myself. That is what I did for my first
few years, and I think that the Channel Tunnel has produced a very
interesting answer; namely, that it is very easy now to jump on a train
in Paris and be in London or Brussels in two hours, and this is
transforming so many things in terms of an economic growth model. So is
the regeneration of Kings Cross. Even the Shard is on London Bridge
station. Whether we have stations on the edge of cities or not, there
will be different patterns of demand which fit.</hs_para>

is not in the centre of London, but on the Surrey-Hampshire border
where I live, we are part of the Heathrow economy. The noble Lord, Lord
Howard of Rising, has got things 180 degrees wrong. There is no
contradiction in talking about the need to deal very quickly with 98%
of Heathrow’s capacity already being full—national
scandal that that is—and getting on with HS2. The scandal of not

say to the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, that we can learn from the
experience of Kent in another way. My noble friend Lord Adonis, who is
not in his place at the moment, knows that I convened a meeting about
four years ago because I happened to know some of the people in Kent
who had been in consultations there. I got the National Association of
Local Councils to bring together all the local councils in the
Chilterns at a meeting here in the House of Lords to find out about all
the stages of the consultation that had been gone through in Kent. The
people from Kent confirmed what I think the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley,
and others have said, that they had been very satisfied with the
experience of the consultation. Although they never became what one
might call protagonists, they all agreed that the noise envelope from
HS1 is nothing like the noise envelope from the M2 and the M20. Those
are the alternatives that we have to look
at.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000027">The noble
Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, tried to ridicule the idea that £50
billion should be spent on a project of this kind. I do not know what
goes on in his mind when he talks about £50 billion being spent
on this, as if it is spent on social welfare in some sense, but it is
value added in the supply chain in the west Midlands and other parts of
Britain. It may well be that we have to look to our laurels to make
sure that the tunnel boring machines are not all from ThyssenKrupp or
whatever in Germany, but that is a slightly different question, about
our industrial capacity. I put a second question to the Minister: has
the Business Department joined up in Whitehall, as on Crossrail, to
make sure that British industry gets the great share—the
lion’s share if I may call it that—of the £50
billion that we are looking at? That is the wages, salaries, profits

entailed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000028">I

is a bit of a shock when you say it like that. Why should we not have
built another railway north of London for 120 years? It is not as if

seem to have the idea that the Victorian era was some sort of golden

person who probably has a society for the admiration and better 
<?notus-xml column=935?>understanding of the Ribblehead viaduct. I would not
be at all surprised, and the noble Lord is nodding his head. He
probably is the president because he is the president of everything

also reminded of when, exactly 20 years ago, in the presence of Her
Majesty the Queen, President Mitterrand said, with a straight face:
“Having travelled at 300 kilometres per hour across the plains
of northern France, we came through the Channel Tunnel and reduced our
speed to 100 kilometres per hour, to better admire the beauty of the
Kent countryside”. I did not know that the French were up to
that sense of humour, but President Mitterrand somehow put his finger
on a fallacy of our national psyche at that

conclusion, I believe that we could be running the risk of another
procrastination by having endless procedures which, in other
circumstances, I could only call red tape. The Government are very
committed to a bonfire of red tape—apart from when it comes to
tying up the trade unions in red tape, although that is not the
question we are discussing this evening. I suggest that, side by side
with a statement about when we are going to see the next stages of
legislation, we have a clear timetable, like the Olympic timetable, so
that the thing does not slip and so that the people who are looking at
the new patterns of economic geography can have some confidence. Many
of the stations will not be in the middle of cities—I do not
think that is necessarily a bad thing but more work can be done in the
city clusters study that I recommend to look at the consequences of
some of the stations not being in the centre of the cities and the
connectivity there. That may have the upside of what I call the
Heathrow Airport type of economic geography, as well as what you might
call the downside, given that we all want to arrive at Kings Cross.
There is a lot of very exciting work to be done and I have very little
doubt that the Government and the Opposition are, on this issue,
speaking for the nation’s future and, also, for the environment
on the small island on which we
live.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_19_PT_1/C78A5F41E44DCF28D74D78E442E10EA03A38388B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 November 2013">Tuesday,

Smith of Leigh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I should declare some
interests, in view of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Cormack. I am
a member of the National Trust, but it does not speak in my name. I am
also the leader of Wigan Council, as most Members know, and chairman of
the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. I confirm to the Minister
that all the local authorities in Greater Manchester, whatever their
political control, are supportive of High Speed 2 coming to Manchester.
Indeed, it has the support of the business community in Greater
Manchester. We have great support and are getting very positive
comments from the consultation for Greater Manchester as a whole and, I
am sure, for each and every one of the local authorities.</hs_para>

strategic case that the Minister and other noble Lords have made. It is
about capacity. Let us get this clear: it is about capacity on the
railways in order for people to continue to travel. The growth that
noble Lords have talked about, in both numbers of passengers and
freight, means that we cannot cope with the existing
infrastructure and we have to invest in new.</hs_para>

of the alternatives, which noble Lords have talked about, is to try to
improve capacity. That has been well established, but I can remember
the misery of being a passenger on the west coast main line during its
refurbishment. It was not much fun; I even missed an appointment with
the Garter King of Arms to come into this place because the train was
late, as was every train on the west coast main line at that time.
Therefore, that is not really an
option.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000035">I am a
former director of Manchester airport so one might think that the idea
of increasing air transport would appeal to me. But we cannot possible
have the capacity at our airports to handle intercity transport within
Britain; we want that capacity to be used for international connections
and not for too many internal connections. We could not do it; it is
not a possibility. Of course, in order to get to airports,
infrastructure needs to be designed. Although I am sure that the noble
Lord, Lord Heseltine, is normally correct, we actually built a new
railway into Manchester airport to enable better
connectivity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000036">Another
option is to do something with the motorways. They are already
congested and if we do not do anything to the rail system or to the
motorways, we will just end up in gridlock. The impact of an increased
capacity on the motorways, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said, is
going to be far greater than anything that High Speed 2 would create.
Therefore, High Speed 2 is really our only
alternative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000037">We
support the economic case even more strongly because of the benefits
that we believe High Speed 2 will bring to cities such as Manchester. I
am willing to take the gamble that it will not suck business out of
Manchester; rather, it will create more activity in our city region. We
think that the benefits of HS2 alone will be about £1.3 billion
but, of course, the additional facility in Greater Manchester of the
airport station will probably add to that by a further half a billion
pounds. Therefore, HS2 could result in an increase in activity in
Greater Manchester of almost £2
billion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000038">Piccadilly
station is bang in the heart of Manchester and will help to regenerate
more of the city centre. There will be additional benefits resulting
from that and the regeneration will be important for Manchester. As the

be developed so that we can maximise the benefits of construction in
Greater
Manchester.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000039">In
Manchester we benefit from this national connectivity. As noble Lords
have said, it is not just connections from Manchester to
London—although that is clearly important—but Manchester
to Birmingham, Leeds and other cities that will be greatly
improved. We also recognise that we need to improve local
connectivity and through the Greater Manchester Community Transport
Forum, we are already investing considerable amounts of money into
improving the tram system and the bus network so that people will be
able to get access from across the conurbation into the new station at
Piccadilly. The airport will provide us with international connectivity
that will mean more
jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000040">If we
are serious about rebalancing the economy in this country, then High
Speed 2 is really important. Otherwise, the south-east will tend to
dominate, as it 
<?notus-xml column=937?>has done in the past. I particularly welcome the
creation of the growth taskforce, which will concentrate minds on how
we can best engineer that growth, and I am sure that the Minister is
aware that we have two members of that taskforce from Greater
Manchester who are, I am sure, making a
contribution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000041">Noble
Lords have hinted that in the early part of the 19th century, this
country had a phenomenal period of building railways. In a period of 20
years we built about 6,000 miles of railways in this country, providing
the basis of the network that we have today. We did it because we had
the confidence and engineering skills, and we did it without the
cost-benefit analysis; no Victorian asked “What will be the
benefit?”. They just had the confidence that this thing would
work—it did, and it produced the benefits for the Victorian
economy that we can see.</hs_para>

the whole, during that period, Parliament was supportive of railway
developments. The only hiccup was when the first Manchester to
Liverpool railway was mooted and turned down, and they had to reroute
it so that it did not go across too much of the Marquis of
Stafford’s land. George Stephenson’s ingenuity meant that
he managed to get it to go across an impossible area of Chat Moss and
to float the railway as he did, meaning that that railway could be
built. Other than that, Parliament supported the building of railways
during the Victorian period and I hope that we can do the same in this
particular
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000043">I want
to briefly mention, as noble Lords have done, this odd contradiction
between what Britain thinks about high-speed rail and what other
countries, particularly in Europe, think about it. Spain has already
got 3,000 kilometres of high-speed line, carrying 29 million
passengers. The Germans are planning a network of about 2,500
kilometres and they have about 78 million passengers. We are planning
to get about 317 kilometres and we currently have 9 million
passengers—somewhat behind Belgium. Then, as noble Lords have
mentioned, there is France. France was the leader in high-speed
rail, planning for nearly 5,000 kilometres, speed rail, with
well over 100 million passengers currently on the TGV
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000044">On
holiday in France last summer, I was delayed by some construction work
near Tours for a new TGV line. When I came home, I checked what was
going on, and it was a new extension of the TGV from Tours to Bordeaux,
eventually on to Toulouse and the Spanish frontier. They announced this
on roughly the same day that my noble friend Lord Adonis was planning
to talk about HS2. It will open in 2017. We are now at the stage of a
paving Bill and the lines in the north will not be completed until
2033. The French seem to be able to do these things somewhat faster
than we
can.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000045">My only
criticism of the Bill and the Government’s plans—not just
this Government but both Governments —is not that we are
building it but that we are building it too slowly. Actually, we ought
to be building the two phases together. I accept that the congestion on
the southern bit of the west coast main line is causing the greatest
pinch points and needs to be tackled, but the economic benefits
are greatly needed in the north and should be considered. If
the Minister wants to examine the relative spending on rail by region,
she 
<?notus-xml column=938?>will find that in the south-east they are spending
roughly £2,700 per head of population; in the north-west it is
£178, so there is quite some way to
go.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0002.htm#13111983000046">There are
two visions of Britain in the future. One is a vision where we try to
make do and mend with the current system; we accept that Britain will
be a second-class country with a second-class economy and a clapped-out
transport system. The other is a vision for the future, a vision for
our children, a vision of a Britain that can compete in the modern
world, and for that we need high-speed
rail.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_19_PT_1/15D8E07D947A7F816A413433ED14CBAF455FAEFD" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 November 2013">Tuesday,

since the Javelins were announced, the train fares were going to be too
much and really it was a waste of time, but then, moving down the

concern that there was going to be a hiatus for a couple of years until
that franchise was sorted out. There was news about Canterbury and
how property prices had increased quite
substantially.

an area where you got on a train and half an hour later you got off at
Charing Cross. It was nothing at all like that. A two-hour journey has

It cost £9 billion. It was a pretty feeble and incredibly
awkward upgrade that was inconvenient, I am sure, to local citizens,
let alone travellers, for a whole 10 years. I could never understand
why, at a time when France was rolling out its TGV programme—it
had been doing it for a decade and was about to connect Strasbourg to
Paris at that time—we ever thought of upgrading the west coast
main line. We should have built a new one with technology that was
already tested in Europe and elsewhere. The upgrade was the wrong
option then; to increase capacity you need a new line. Clearly one
would never build a new line to old, slow standards. You would build it
to fast standards. That is quite obvious. I cannot see that you could

Europe—we have talked about that. Forging-ahead eastern Asia is
also doing high-speed rail. I have been on the trains in Taiwan. The
noble Lord, Lord Adonis, mentioned Japan. I think the bullet trains
started in 1964 for the Olympics. I do not think it a complete

necessary. If we decarbonise the electricity energy sector, we can have
a much more environmentally friendly and less carbon-intensive form of

my point of view, this is not a complex question, as other noble Lords

think that there is only one answer to that and only one way to do
that. What I have been terribly disappointed about during the past
couple of years is the lack of political leadership on this matter
within the Government of whom I am a great supporter. They have said
yes, they have pushed it forward and this Bill is here, but somehow we
have managed to muffle the message. That is why I am also delighted
that my noble friend Lady Kramer is here on the Front Bench and is

Lord Adonis, sending from the Opposition Front Bench that really strong
message again that we can bring all parties together for this essential

Snape (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the
noble Lord, Lord Teverson, whom I have not heard speak on these matters
before—although that probably reflects neglect on my part rather
than on his. I agreed strongly with much of what he had to say. I am
not seeking to make any particular political point here, but he was not
quite right when he said that £9 billion was the total cost of
the west coast main line upgrade. It is not finished yet; it was
stopped at £9 billion in order to stay within that amount. He
said that he does not use the west coast main line very much. If he
makes the mistake of doing so next year, he will find that the
re-signalling of Watford, which was not done in the original upgrade,
will cause quite a bit of delay and dislocation to that
line<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T20:36:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000058">This
debate follows one that we held a matter of only a few weeks ago, so I
shall try to avoid repeating anything that I said then. I do, however,
think that it is incumbent on those who oppose the scheme to tell us
what the alternatives are, which few of them ever do. The noble Lord,
Lord Cormack, whom I have listened to with appreciation—I hope
that he will understand that—for nearly four decades in both
Houses, accused me of grinning like the Cheshire Cat during his
contribution. It would have been appropriate if I did, because I was
born in Stockport, which was in Cheshire before Ted Heath and his
colleagues destroyed local government in the 1970s. Why I was smiling,
rather than grinning, during the noble Lord’s contribution was
because he did not see any contradiction between his impassioned plea
for the environment to be defended and his demand for the A1 motorway
to be widened so that he could drive from Lincoln to London in a bit
more comfort than he does at present. That is a slight contradiction in
terms. The noble Lord shakes his head—not like the Cheshire
Cat—but the fact is that it is a
contradiction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000059">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T20:37:32"></hs_TimeCode>
heard my noble friend Lord Rooker, whose constituency was adjacent to
mine when we were in the other place, mention road building—and
motorway building in particular. In his case, the motorway was 60 feet
from the bedroom windows of his constituents. 
<?notus-xml column=941?>If the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, thinks that that is
not an environmental disaster, I would be surprised. The fact is that
most people who are interested in transport policy in this country
acknowledge that the days of motorway building—to a certain
extent, widening is permitted—lie in the past. It is much more
damaging to the environment to build new roads, which is something that
my noble friend Lord Stevenson, too, might reflect on. Today is the
second or third time that I have heard him make his impassioned plea on
behalf of the citizens of the area in which he lives, which he is
perfectly entitled to do—but he should answer the particular
question of whether the M40 has destroyed more sites of special
scientific interest and done more damage to the environment than the
proposed high-speed railway through the Chilterns will
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T20:38:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000060">We
come back to the question: if not HS2, what? The fact is that we do not
have enough capacity on the west coast main line. I listened
with interest to the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord
Howard. He would be flattered, I am sure, if I said that it was the
biggest load of reactionary nonsense that I had heard for
years—I am sure that he would take that in the spirit in which
it was intended. If he believes that expanding the world of aviation
will mop up the extra journeys that are being made on our railway
system, that should perhaps be the subject for another debate. Some 128
million people a year now use intercity trains. That that would require
a hell of a lot of aeroplanes, I must
say.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000061">He said
that no businessman would touch the financial case for HS2. As the
financial case was devised by the Treasury, indeed no businessman
would. If and when the Treasury makes any contribution to these
matters, it will be to say that we cannot afford it and that it does
not meet the cost-benefit analysis. If it were left to the Treasury, we
would not have built the M25, the Jubilee line, the Docklands Light
Railway and various other schemes that most people would agree are
essential. I will go further: if everything had been left to the
Treasury, when I made my way back to Birmingham this week, I would do
so on the 10 o’clock stagecoach from Tyburn. There would be no
other way of going from London to Birmingham as no schemes, including
the London &amp; Birmingham Railway, would ever have passed the
preposterous cost-benefit analysis so beloved of Her Majesty’s
Treasury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000062">I
propose to the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that he and I should go to
Watford one day. If he thinks that the existing railway can cope with
the 5.2% increase in passenger carryings that we are seeing on the west
coast main line, we should stand together on the fast-line platform in
Watford. He will probably not come because I understand that one cannot
get a decent lunch in Watford, but if we were to go there and gaze
towards London, we would see in the average hour, outside the rush
hour, the following trains: three Pendolino trains from Birmingham and
three from Manchester, a Super Voyager from North Wales, a London
Midland train at 110 miles per hour from Crewe serving the Trent
Valley, an hourly Scottish train and various other trains. That is the
basic timetable for the up fast line between Watford Junction and
London Euston at the present time. Indeed, this up 
<?notus-xml column=942?>fast line is so busy that Virgin Trains was refused
permission to run an extra service to and from Shrewsbury because there
was no room for it. An open-access operator wanted to use the west
coast main line as far as Stockport—the home of the Cheshire
Cat, as the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, might say—and on into
Yorkshire, but was refused permission for the same
reason.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000063">I put
it to the noble Lord, and the other critics of this scheme: if not HS2,
what? The existing railway can barely cope with what it has at the
present time. I do not want to bore your Lordships with stories of my
time on the railway or the connections that I still make—it is a
temptation, but I refuse. However, I can assure your Lordships that the
intention is to close the up fast line that is being hammered in the
average hour by all the trains that I mentioned, for between five and
10 years, from Saturday night to Monday morning, in order to do
long-awaited and essential work. If we are getting into that state with
the traffic that we have at the present time, I cannot believe that we
could take any additional traffic, given the increase in intercity
carryings that I referred
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000064">The noble

Rodgers<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>, who
was, as he reminded your Lordships, Secretary of State for Transport
during my time in the Whips’ Office—he tried to get me
the sack once, but we will not go into that—seems to believe
that the increase in passenger numbers that I referred to will perhaps
tail off over the years. It is the 50th anniversary of “Doctor
Who”; perhaps I should say to my 11 year-old grandson that
instead of building HS2, perhaps in 2033 we will all climb into a
police box and be transported from A to B. He is only 11, but I do not
think that he would believe that. I suspect that, in his heart, the
noble Lord knows full well that we must build new rail capacity in this
country. If we do not, the country will grind to a halt.</hs_para>

we all go by road. Perhaps we could pursue the noble Lord, Lord
Cormack, on the newly widened A1 to and from Lincoln. However, as
everyone knows, widening roads generates more traffic. That is probably
why we have stopped doing it in recent years. As fast as we widen
roads, we generate even more traffic and the widened roads fill up once
more.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111983000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000066">There
is no alternative to HS2, for the reasons that I have outlined. I have
only one great criticism of it, and it is one that has been mentioned
before: at the turn of the 20th century, Brunel managed to convert the
Great Western Railway, as it then was, from broad-gauge to standard in
a long weekend. Will it really take until 2033, when my grandson will
be middle-aged? Although noble Lords on both sides look in extremely
good health, few of us are likely to be around to travel on the new
high-speed rail service, the principle of which I hope we will embrace
under the terms of the Bill. We ought to do it—and a damned
sight quicker than we are proposing to at the
moment.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_19_PT_1/4EB380D4CB089630D9A7389123031F14EB6E851C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 November 2013">Tuesday,

Dubs (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to follow my noble
friend Lord Snape. We were in the Commons together, and every time I
take a train to Manchester and we go through Stockport and Edgeley
sidings, I think of his younger days when he was doing 
<?notus-xml column=943?>very important work there. I am grateful to the
Minister for the meeting that she arranged for us with officials last
week. It was very helpful and certainly clarified a number of issues. I
missed the previous debate on this so I do not have to apologise for
repeating myself.</hs_para>

the argument in favour of HS2, which I fully support, is one of
sentiment but I must confess that I have some affection for
railways. I wonder if I might just mention a little story. I ask your
Lordships to imagine New Year’s Eve December 1947: I was quite
young, my mother was taking me back from London, where we had been over
Christmas, and we were changing trains at Preston to go on to
Blackburn. It was a cold, snowy and damp evening, the waiting room had
no heating and there was nowhere to get any refreshments. The railways
were to be nationalised on 1 January, the following morning. We were
sitting there waiting for this non-existent train to Blackburn, and
someone in the cold waiting room said, “Well, from tomorrow
morning we can blame the Government for all this”.</hs_para>

was a story from way back. I have one other bit of
sentiment—actually, it is not really sentiment, it is harder
than that. When Beeching’s report led to the closure of a lot of
our railways, he did this country an enormous disservice. We closed
lines that we wish we had now, not because they would replace HS2 or
anything like that but simply because we lost something important. They
were wonderful triumphs of Victorian engineering. I remember the line
behind Tintern Abbey, the Chepstow-Monmouth line, which was a wonderful
bit of engineering but is now derelict. I wish that they would
reinstate the line from Penrith to Keswick, which could be
reinstated—there is enough of the infrastructure
there—although then going on from Keswick to Cockermouth and the
coast would be impossible because it has been built over by the A66.
Even then, though, reinstating some of these railways would have
helped.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111983000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000070">I
suppose that those are bits of sentiment. What I am concerned with are
the harder arguments in favour of HS2. I have reflected that if the
financial estimates for the cost of the Channel Tunnel had been
accurate, they would of course have been much higher than they were and
we would not have built it because it would have been too costly. We
have had enormous benefit from the fact that they were wrong. My point
is that if we had deployed the arguments that some people are deploying
against HS2 against the Channel Tunnel, it would never have been built
and the country would have been much worse off because of it. I am not
arguing that we should throw all financial estimates to the
winds—not at all. I am arguing that we need to be careful before
we reject some imaginative infrastructure schemes.</hs_para>

as a country we are not very good at thinking about infrastructure and
developing it—we tend to find too many arguments for not doing
it. Sometimes those arguments win the day and sometimes they delay
things enormously, but at other times we overcome them and then we get
the benefit, and the Channel Tunnel is an example of that.</hs_para>

particular reference—it is quite a long book—but there
was a lot of discussion of local opposition to building the railways. I
thought that some of the arguments could have been applied to
today’s debate. George Eliot used slightly more elegant language
than many of us use, but nevertheless the arguments were there at the

I am not living in the Lake District, we have a house in London. For a
long time, we had a house in Paddington that overlooked the main line
out of Paddington station, the underground and the motorway that
becomes the M40. It was pretty noisy. The reason we could just about
afford it was because people did not like the noise. We put all the
bedrooms at the back overlooking the little gardens, and that was fine.
The trains got quieter, the shunting in the middle of the night stopped
and it became much more bearable. Then the foxes got in and the noise
of the foxes kept me awake more than the noise of the railways.
Although I was opposed to fox hunting, I wanted to make an exception
for some of the back gardens in Paddington. Some of my friends did not
like that

point is that the noise of building is very hard to live with.
Crossrail is causing a lot of anxiety where I used to live in

use the west coast main line a great deal these days. I am conscious of
the enormous disruption that there was for years—referred to by
some of my noble friends—when the work was going on. Frankly, it
was so awful that we could not travel on a Sunday. We said to friends
of ours, “Don’t ever come up at the weekend because it is
absolutely hopeless”. By the time you have changed buses and
changed at Preston, the journey time is unpredictable. I shudder at the
thought that we might do the same thing with our existing west coast
and east coast lines; it would be absolutely intolerable. That is one
of the many reasons why I would much prefer

for years, as I did, on the west coast main line—it is much
better now but it is getting very full—to know that we do not
want years of infrastructure work and disruption. Nevertheless, the
trains are pretty full. On at least one occasion when I failed to book
a reserved seat, because I could not predict my time, I had to stand
all the way to Preston. Quite often, there was no space and that is
north of Birmingham, not just from the Midlands southwards. These
trains may not be full on a Saturday night, but they are full most of
the time when most people want to travel. So I very much welcome the
commitment to extra capacity which would be the result of building HS2.
I hope that some of the freight on the motorways will move on to the
railways, although 
<?notus-xml column=945?>I suspect that they will have to absorb additional
freight rather than transfer freight from the roads as they do now.
Unlike some noble Lords, I would like to see people travelling not by
car, but using the railways. I was lobbied by somebody who said,
“Don’t worry about HS2, flying will always be
cheaper”—not a very environmental argument. I believe

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T20:54:26"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
found this debate a fascinating one and in many ways a more enjoyable
one than the debate that we had only a few short weeks ago on exactly
this topic. On that occasion, there was an indication in the press, at
least, and in some circles of some uncertainty about my party’s
position with regard to HS2. That had been generated because the shadow
Chancellor, my very good friend Ed Balls, had indicated that he was
very concerned at the rapidly escalating costs that were being
reflected in parts of the media. Of course he was anxious about them.
It is his job to look at the way in which a future Labour Government
intend to spend their money.</hs_para>

the noble Lord who spent a great deal of his time commenting on the
weakness of the business case for HS2. There should be a business case.
I very much appreciated the fact that the majority of my noble friends
indicated their support for HS2—all of them, I think, with the
possible exception of my noble friend Lord Stevenson, who had other
fish to fry as far as the line is concerned. They were a little in
danger of glorifying past triumphs with regard to the railway and
indicating that we could take similar, easy risks today. I hate to say
it but in the absence of cost-benefit analysis, a high percentage of
Victorian railway lines went bankrupt. Railway mania was one of the
shocking problems of the 19th century so although we glory in the
architecture that was left us to us, in terms of both our great railway
stations and the significant lines that we still use extensively today,
particularly the north-south lines, we ought not to deride the fact
that we need to be clear about costs.</hs_para>

people—our fellow citizens—are therefore going to be
concerned about costs. That is why it is important that in

they were a huge success for the nation. Everybody derived value from
them so we can make these projects work and we should derive

case was made as soon as the debate opened. The magnificent opening
speech of my noble friend Lord Adonis set the terms of this debate and
in a very real sense put to bed any suggestion of any possible
backsliding by a future Labour Government on seeing this project

concerned, however, about this issue. As we know, hybrid Bills are ones
over which Parliament and the Government have negligible control, yet
we are starting on this Bill. It was intended and hoped that we would
have all the processes of Parliament covered, all legislative processes
in place and all procedures completed by the time of the general

Government being able to deliver against that timetable. Of course,
slippage is costly in terms of the ambitions that we all have for the
successful implementation of the project on time, but delay is also
costly in financial terms. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Howard, is
already calculating just how much the additional length of time will

the real issues have emerged in this debate. I listened very carefully
to another former Secretary of State for Transport, the noble Lord,
Lord Rodgers, when he indicated that he still preserved a degree of
scepticism about the ability of rail to impact on the economic
geography of the country. There is evidence from other countries that
its impact is indeed beneficial. It is certainly the case that, as so
many noble Lords have emphasised in this debate, if we do not do
anything, we will actually reach paralysis. Such is the increase in
numbers of those seeking to use rail travel that if we do nothing, we

in the air and cannot be answered—certainly not from this

if nothing is done the constant problems which we see in all commuting
areas will get worse. I know that when one talks about commuting
people’s first thought is that one is talking about the
south-east and London. However, the pressure on Birmingham
and the West Midlands, on Manchester, Leeds, Yorkshire and Bradford, is
just as acute for people there who want to get to work, to the shops
and to other facilities in their cities. Of course, what hangs in the

hope that the noble Baroness will also comment on one other dimension.
I refer to the recent speech of the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, to
which my noble friend Lord Rooker referred. One of the things we all
know about significant public investment is that it can lead to very
significant private gains. Just look at any situation where a Tube
station in the London area has been opened in recent years and what it
does to house prices. There is a straight correlation between transport
and private gain. Of course we want to see private gain, because we are
providing these services for private people—for our fellow
citizens. However, we ought also to look at the public good. These
resources are invested on behalf of the nation. I hope that the noble
Baroness will take away the noble Lord’s thought about the use
of urban development corporations to canalise some of the gains from
the investment that will derive from the construction of HS2 so that it
comes to the public purse as well. That will perhaps help to reassure

the overwhelming majority of noble Lords who spoke today spoke so
strongly and positively in favour of HS2 and the high-speed rail
network that once again I feel almost that the comments that I can make
are somewhat redundant; they have been almost better covered by other
noble Lords who have spoken. I will begin by trying to pick up on the
questions from noble Lords who were perhaps more sceptical, and in
particular that issue of cost that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of
Oldham, mentioned, which was also mentioned by other noble
Lords—by the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, in particular,
and in a slightly different way by the noble Lord, Lord
Adonis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000093">The
cost of the project—the budget—has been set at
£42.6 billion. The noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, mentioned
the figure of £73 billion, which was floated in the <I>Financial
Times</I> and some other parts of the press. That is a
mischievous number, because of the way in which it is constructed; I
was quite sad to see it in a respectable newspaper. It included things
like VAT, which obviously comes back to the Treasury and is therefore
not a cost to the taxpayer. It also included inflation, although we
look at infrastructure projects using current numbers rather than
inflated numbers because we do not look at the benefits in inflated
numbers. A mischief-making number has, unfortunately, been introduced
into this conversation.</hs_para>

cost, because it is important—and what I have to say about it
will also address some of the other issues that have been raised. The
work that has been done in preparation for High Speed 2, to the point
where it is now ready for phase 1 to appear in a hybrid Bill, is far
more intense than that for any previous hybrid Bill. I think that that
degree of preparation is a good thing, and I am cleared to say that the
hybrid Bill will be introduced in the Commons on Monday. That degree of
detailed examination and preparation gives us far greater confidence in
the actual numbers, particularly for phase 1.</hs_para>

Davies, will know—he has read the strategic case—High
Speed 2 now estimates that, without any contingency, it could bring in
phase 1 at £15.6 billion. The Secretary of State has
said that we need to have a little contingency, but he wants to see
this come in at £17.16 billion or less. That is the pressure
being put on Sir David Higgins, and he feels that it is pressure that
he can accept. That is a much crisper number than the more overarching
number, including contingency, that we have generally been using. I ask
that, as people look at the strategic case, they understand that we are
talking about the overarching budget, but that underneath that there is
huge pressure to ensure that the cost is pushed down, and we can do
that with more and more confidence because of the level of detail that
we now have. I hope that that also explains to the noble Lord, Lord
Adonis, why there is a generous contingency in all this. The
contingency does not reflect the fact that there is very detailed work
going on to push the cost
down.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000096">That
consideration also speaks somewhat to the governance point raised by
the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. Sir David Higgins, when he

<?notus-xml column=949?>comes in, will make governance and driving down cost two of his highest
priorities. The governance programme, which sounds incredibly complex
as it is read out in a paragraph, actually reflects a number of bodies
that have come together to increase the downward pressure on costs.
That is part of the reason why there have been so many parties so
absolutely focused on ensuring that the costs of the project have been
reduced to the greatest extent
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000097">In
the same context, Sir David Higgins has said that he will look at
delivering HS2 faster. There is an underlying question here, which I
picked up from a number of people today—for example, from the
noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh—along the lines of, “Why
don’t we start both phases pretty much at the same time?”
The answer is that we have the detailed work to be able to go ahead
with the hybrid Bill for phase 1, and to hold that up in order to bring
phase 2 to the same degree of preparation would hold back the whole
project. We are in a position to move much faster on phase 1. I have
heard many people in the House today talking about the importance of
going as fast as possible; they compared us unfavourably with France,
and I can understand why. We are doing this in phases so that we can
get into the ground at the earliest possible date.</hs_para>

phase 1 alone. It is true that the maximum benefits will come when
phase 2 is completed, but from phase 1 alone there is already an
advantage, both in capacity going from London through to
Birmingham—on the most congested set of routes that we could
possibly have—and also in terms of starting the time reduction,
which, as others have said, adds to the connectivity and the potential
for development in the north and the Midlands.</hs_para>

Cormack, referred to the Bill as a blank cheque and asked why it does
not have a monetary figure in it. The Bill gives permission for
preparatory expenditure and contains a very vigorous reporting process
under which the Government must report back annually and record any
deviation from budget, and the consequences of that. The wording of the
Bill has been strengthened somewhat in the other place, which has put
in place a very intense scrutiny process around the
budget.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000100">One of
the reasons why there is no monetary figure is because this is not just
the paving Bill for HS2 but allows us to look at extensions. The noble
Lord, Lord Dubs, talked about the importance of going beyond HS2 and
looking at Scotland. I was up in Glasgow and Edinburgh just over a week
ago, announcing formally the initiation of a study which will look at
bringing the benefits of high speed to Scotland. Automatic benefits
come from bringing High Speed 2 as far as Leeds and Manchester. In
fact, Scotland benefits even from the run to Birmingham. However,
taking it beyond that, the study will look at how to maximise high
speed on existing rail lines and at potentially building what some
people have dubbed “High Speed 3”. This paving Bill
creates the context for what in the end will be a high-speed rail
network. The word “network” matters in the context of
some of the questions about economic growth. Dedicated high-speed
trains can run only on high-speed lines. However, in addition, 
<?notus-xml column=950?>these lines can be used by the classic trains which
currently operate on our long-distance services. They can travel part
of their journey on a high-speed line and then deviate off on to the
west coast main line and various other lines, creating a much more
interconnected
network.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111983000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-0003.htm#13111983000101">The
noble Lords, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara and Lord Cormack, and, to some
extent, the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, raised concerns about the
Chilterns and its highly valued landscape. We all value that landscape;
I do not think there is any question about that. However, I think that
we have also always understood that there are circumstances in which we
have to weigh the significance of infrastructure projects against that
value. We must mitigate any effects to the extent that we can. I listed
earlier many of the mitigations. Looking much more narrowly at the
Chilterns, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, that, between
Chalfont St Peter and Hyde Heath, which is a distance of 8.3
miles, of which 5.8 miles lies in the area of outstanding natural
beauty, the route will be in a tunnel. To minimise the visual impact in
the AONB, the following mitigation measures will also be taken: 3.5
miles in cuttings; 1.5 miles in “green
tunnel”; 0.6 miles on viaducts; and 1.4 miles with embankments.
This means that fewer than two miles of the 13 miles of the route
through the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty will be at
surface level or above. The noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, has asked why
we cannot extend the tunnel. Unfortunately, that would require the
construction of ventilation shafts and an emergency access station at
Little Missenden. Weighing that damaging environmental impact against
the current mitigations has led us to the conclusion that we have used
tunnelling to the best
effect.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_19_PT_1/C116A4B2B2B4C22057F9E5119676624039E4635C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 November 2013">Tuesday,

Little Missenden is not what is proposed. The alternative, which I

see how local communities in the areas that will be impacted by HS2

devolution that Whitehall should not always know best how each

many of the schemes and developments that develop, we will look to
capture development gain in various ways. Indeed, the Government have

think he is referring to a Virgin long-distance train. Certainly,
regional and commuter trains are incredibly heavily used. To remove
that Virgin train from the train paths in order to allow expansion of
regional and commuter traffic would be a drastic option, widely opposed
by passengers. There is sometimes no easy trade-off between the issue
of train paths and usage at particular times. I also point out that the
evening peak is a very well spread peak. During the morning peak we are
pretty close to anyone’s definition of being out of capacity as
it is, never mind in the circumstances that we will face as we get to

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally)
(LD):</Member></B> My Lords, these regulations are made in exercise of
the powers conferred on the Secretary of State for Justice by Section 5
of the Defamation Act 2013. Section 5 creates a new defence against an
action for defamation for the operators of websites hosting
user-generated content. Where an action in defamation is brought
against a website operator in respect of such material the operator
will not, however, be able to rely on that defence where the claimant
shows: that he or she did not know who had posted the statement on the
website; that he or she had complained to the operator about the
statement in the proper way; and that the operator had failed to
respond to that complaint in the way set out in these
regulations.</hs_para>

have taken in these regulations aims to support freedom of expression
by allowing operators generally to retain the benefit of the defence
without the need for material to be taken down where the person who has
posted it co-operates with the process and wishes to stand by the
material. In such a case the process will help to enable complainants
to resolve their concerns with, or take action against, the poster of
the allegedly defamatory material. Equally it will ensure that, to rely
on the defence, an operator must remove the material complained about
where the poster cannot be identified or is unwilling to engage in the
process.</hs_para>

Section 5 defence, operators will be required to carry out prescribed
actions within a short fixed time limit. A range of views was expressed
by stakeholders on what time limits were appropriate. We consider that
the approach we have taken strikes the right balance in ensuring that
action is taken as promptly as possible, without placing unreasonable
burdens on operators or denying posters a reasonable opportunity to
engage with the process.</hs_para>

subject to a general discretion, in the event of a defamation action
being brought against the operator, for the court to waive any time
limit if it considers that it is in the interests of justice to do so.
That will ensure that the defence is not lost through, for example, an
inadvertent or unavoidable failure by an operator to comply with a time
limit if the court thinks that this would be unfair. The process is not
compulsory, and operators can still choose either to remove a statement
immediately on receipt of a complaint, or allow it to remain posted. An
operator which takes either course of action can of course seek to rely
on any other defences that may be available against a defamation
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000008">Noble
Lords may find it helpful if I explain the process established by the
regulations in detail. To trigger the process, a person complaining
about a statement posted on an operator’s website must send the
operator a notice of complaint. Regulation 2 and Section 5(6) of the
Act set out the information that must be included in a notice of
complaint.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000009">These
provisions require that the notice must state where on the website the
statement was posted, set out what the statement says and explain why
it is defamatory of the complainant, and explain what meaning the
complainant attributes to the statement and what aspects he or she
believes are factually inaccurate or are opinions not supported by
fact. The notice must also confirm that the complainant does not have
sufficient information about the poster to bring proceedings directly
against him or her.</hs_para>

is said, but the intention is that the poster should have sufficient
information to reach an informed decision on how to respond. The
complainant must also provide his or her name and an e-mail address at
which he or she can be contacted, but can ask the operator not to
provide this to the poster of the statement. These provisions were
supported by a substantial majority of those who provided views on the
content of the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000011">Where<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:35:22"></hs_TimeCode>

the complainant of this in writing within 48 hours of receipt of the
notice of complaint, and must tell the complainant what is required for
a notice to be valid. In common with other instances under the
regulations where an operator is required to take action within 48
hours, this time period excludes non-business days such as weekends.
The operator is not required to specify exactly what it considers is
wrong with the notice that the complainant has sent. This avoids
imposing any obligation on an operator to guide or advise the
complainant. However, the guidance accompanying

so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000012">Paragraphs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:36:24"></hs_TimeCode>
2 to 4 of the Schedule to the regulations explain what an operator

notice of complaint. Paragraph 2 provides that the operator must
contact the poster of the statement complained of within 48 hours and
paragraph 4 provides that it must also inform the complainant that this
has been done. If the operator has no means of contacting the poster by
e-mail or another means of private electronic messaging, paragraph 3 of
the Schedule to the regulations provides that, in order to retain the
defence, the operator must remove the statement within 48 hours and
must inform the complainant that this has been
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000013">Paragraph<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:37:17"></hs_TimeCode>
2 of the Schedule sets out what information the operator has to provide
to the poster to enable the poster to respond to the complaint. This
includes a deadline for the poster to respond of midnight at the end of
the fifth day after the day on which the operator sends the information
to the poster. The operator must specify the calendar date on which the
deadline expires and ask the poster within that time to confirm whether
or not the poster wishes the statement to be removed from the website

5, 6 and 7 of the Schedule deal respectively with situations where the
poster fails to respond within the prescribed time period, where the
poster responds but does not provide all the information requested, or
where the poster agrees to the removal of the statement. In all these
circumstances the operator is then required to remove the statement
within 48 hours and to inform the complainant that this has been done.
If the poster provides a name and postal address that a reasonable
operator would consider to be obviously false, the operator is required
to treat the response as not containing all the required information,
and hence must remove the statement.</hs_para>

relevant contact details, paragraph 8 of the Schedule provides that the
operator must inform the complainant within 48 hours that the statement
has not been removed and, if the poster agrees, pass the
poster’s contact details on to the complainant. If the poster
does not agree to release his contact details, the operator must inform
the complainant of this. Provided it has complied with these

posting of the statement concerned.</hs_para>

not consented to release of his or her contact details to the
complainant, it will be a matter for the complainant to consider what
further 
<?notus-xml column=374?>action he may wish to take. It will, for example, be open to the
complainant to seek a court order, known as a Norwich Pharmacal order,

can be brought against the
poster.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000018">Paragraph
9 of the Schedule provides further protection for complainants in
circumstances where material has been removed following a notice of
complaint, but the poster persists in reposting the same or

occasion, to keep the Section 5 defence the operator must follow the
full process and seek the poster’s views. However, on being
informed by the complainant that the poster has posted the same or
substantially the same statement on two or more previous occasions, the
operator is required to remove the statement within 48 hours of

insisting that the Defamation Bill should cover the difficult subject
of defamation via the internet. That was an important decision taken by
him, however difficult it was to give effect to it. It was important
because we had no proper laws in this country striking a fair balance
between free speech and defamation in relation to the internet. The
regulations are part of the process which, I understand, will come into

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I pay tribute to the noble Lord,
Lord Lester, who was instrumental in securing reform of defamation law
and has campaigned long and hard for that. I also join him in thanking
the Minister for walking us through this rather tangled undergrowth of
regulations. I am bound to say that the Minister reminds me less of
Moses bringing down the tablets than perhaps Daniel exercising
judgment. I should like to think that I was descended from one or
other; I may be remotely connected but I do not think that I am
descended from either of

solicitor, I know something about the law of defamation, although I
would not claim to be an expert. But when it comes to the world of
computers, information technology and social media, I confess to being
an utter novice. At risk of being labelled a Marxist by the right-wing
press or Conservative Central Office, I recall some words of
Marx—Groucho, I hasten to add, and not Karl. In one of his
films, which might have been “A Night at the Opera” but I
would not swear to that, he is seen poring over a map and declares that
a child of five could understand the map. He continues: “Bring
me a child of five”. I am tempted to make the same request when
confronted by matters of the kind encompassed by these
regulations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000028">We
share the Government’s objective to protect freedom of speech,
in which the internet and social media can and do play such an
important part. We welcome the thrust of the regulations, although
perhaps it would have been better if guidance on Section 5 of the
Defamation Act had been available in draft form when the legislation
was under consideration on its 
<?notus-xml column=376?>journey through Parliament. The regulations appear to offer reasonable
protection to the operators of websites but there are perhaps questions
about the extent to which they adequately protect those who claim to be
defamed by material appearing on those
sites<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:48:51"></hs_TimeCode>. Thus, the
website operator will have a defence, as we have heard, to an action if
it can show that it did not post the material in question unless the
claimant can show that he or she did not have sufficient information to
bring legal proceedings against the poster of the statement and that
the operator failed to comply with a notice requiring it to identify
the poster requested by the complainant. Of course, this assumes that
the claimant has the means to pursue that legal remedy, a somewhat
questionable proposition in the light of the matter of costs. We are
not now dealing with conventional media stories with a limited shelf
life and relatively limited audience, although perhaps quite a wide
reach, but with material with a potentially unlimited shelf
life—unless, like the Conservative Party’s once publicly
available material, it can be conveniently hidden—and a
consequently higher risk of damage to a complainant’s
reputation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000029">Part
4 of the guidance explains that the operator will have a defence when
the complainant has sufficient information to bring an action against a
poster but, again, that relies on the claimant having the means to do
so—and what if the poster is outside the jurisdiction? It is all
very well for the guidance to proclaim that disputes should be resolved
directly between the complainant and the poster but, in the event that
the poster does not wish a statement to be removed and his details to
be released to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:50:21"></hs_TimeCode> complainant,
the latter will have to obtain a court order to obtain the details,
again raising the issue of cost. Would it not have been better to have
established for these purposes a less formal and less expensive
mechanism, in which a panel, perhaps financed by the industry itself,
could determine whether the information as to identity should be
released and whether the post should be removed, leaving the question
of financial compensation to be determined by the
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:50:52"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000030">On

Explanatory Memorandum to the regulations sets out the response to
consultation and lays down welcome tighter timetables for action by the
operator and poster following a notice of complaint. However, somewhat
disappointingly, it requires further notices to be given when the
material has been the subject of two or more complaints rather than
immediately. Moreover, paragraph 9 of the Schedule to the regulations
makes it clear that even the more limited protection afforded by this
provision is available only when the same poster is involved. If a
different person posts the same material, the whole process must be
gone through again by the defamed claimant—and the material can
be
identical<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:51:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000032">My

Government’s intention and that such a review would be initiated
within a year of the regulations taking effect and be kept under
regular review thereafter? Will they look again at suggestions made in

operator to post a notice of complaint, should one be received,

both noble Lords. As the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, said, the noble
Lord, Lord Lester, is very much the godfather of this Act, and I have
benefited from his wisdom over the whole three years. As he says, the
end is nigh, in that the Act will come into force on 1 January 2014,
including these regulations. He points to the fact that although the
Act itself will, I hope, give the kind of balance between freedom and
the rights of defamed which will stand the test of time, as he and the

ask for a review within a year. We obviously need an opportunity to see
how these matters will settle down. Parliament has put in place

This Act will be subject to the usual arrangements of parliamentary
scrutiny. However, the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, is quite right. We

there may also be cases where, through the operation of the process set

other question was on the matter of the definition of
“received” in the regulations. While ultimately it will
be for the court to interpret the regulations, we consider that the

that therefore the notice of complaint would be
“received” at the point when it is
delivered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T15:59:36"></hs_TimeCode>. That

both noble Lords indicated, the Act has been broadly welcomed by those
who have campaigned for it. We believe that it will defend free speech
while giving those who are defamed a reasonable opportunity for
redress, and with some protection from the costs of doing so. Section 5
of the Act, and these regulations, represent an important part of the
package of measures designed to reform the law of defamation. The noble
Lord, Lord Lester, is right: given the way the world is
moving from the printed page to electronic communications, it would
have ducked the issue had we not tried to address the matter in the
Act. In so doing, I think we strike a fair balance between freedom of
expression and the protection of reputation, as I said in my opening
remarks. The regulations strike a fair balance between the various
interests involved, and their approval will enable the Act as a whole
to be brought into force on a timely basis at the end of this year. I
hope that noble Lords will agree that this is a proportionate and
sensible
measure.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13111956000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000157">Motion

the Judicial Appointments Order 2008, made under Section 51 of the
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. In practical terms the
order is the final part of the legislative package of reforms that the

potential candidate must have met what is known as the “judicial
appointment eligibility criteria” for at least five years. Under
Sections 50 to 52 of the 2007 Act, this means that they have a relevant
legal qualification and have gained experience in law for five years or
more. In practice, the only people who meet the criteria are solicitors
and barristers. Under Section 51 of the 2007 Act, the Lord Chancellor
may extend the list of relevant qualifications that make someone
eligible for a judicial appointment. The Judicial Appointments Order
2008 exercised that power and provided that CILEx fellows were eligible
for various judicial posts, such as deputy district judge and judge of
the First-tier Tribunal. These posts are set out in Schedule 1 to the

amend the 2008 order simply by adding coroners to the list of roles for

50 to 52 of the 2007 Act and the 2008 order have already removed some
of the old barriers to judicial appointment. Coroners are appointed
slightly differently from those holding other judicial appointments and

increasing diversity of

the Coroners Act 1988, coroners were appointed by their local

assistants. Now, under the 2009 Act, every coroner appointment is made
by the relevant local authority. Every vacancy is advertised and every
proposed appointment requires the consent of the Lord Chancellor and
chief coroner.</hs_para>

new system has only just been put in place. However, this new
advertising and central scrutiny of all posts will increase the
transparency of appointments. It will enable applications from a more
diverse pool of people who may never have heard about a vacancy under
the old system. Although the actual appointment process for coroners is
different from other judicial

changes to the 2008 order are not just the Government’s

Appointments Commission and the Lord Chief Justice. I can report that

proposal, those who did not, and those who expressed no view. CILEx
itself was among those who welcomed the proposal, because of its
potential to increase the diversity of coroners and competition for the

extending eligibility for coronial appointment could lower

to encourage suitable CILEx fellows to apply for coroners’

against the same consistent and transparent criteria as those from

skilled and experienced to, for the first time, apply for a
coroner’s role. They will then be assessed to the same high and
consistent standards as other applicants, to ensure that the best
person gets the job. It is no more than what bereaved people deserve. I
beg to move.</hs_para>

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally)
(LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment provides for the extension
of the current SIAC rules to cover new applications resulting from the
new jurisdiction inserted into the Special Immigration Appeals
Commission Act as a result of the Justice and Security Act 2013. This
enables the Home Secretary to certify that certain exclusion,
naturalisation and citizenship decisions were made in reliance on
sensitive information which should not be made public in the interests
of national security, in the interests of the relationship between the
UK and another country, or otherwise in the public interest.</hs_para>

Appeals Commission, or SIAC, was set up under the Special Immigration
Appeals Commission Act 1997. It hears immigration and asylum appeals
involving national security issues and/or sensitive information which
should not be made public—for instance, cases where intelligence
is part of the evidence and the material cannot be released to the
appellant, or his representatives, for fear of compromising sources or
the national security of the UK. It has heard appeals under the
Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 by persons certified as
suspected international terrorists, and it currently hears appeals
against deprivation of citizenship.</hs_para>

Security Act 2013, which commenced in June this year, contained a
number of provisions designed to control the disclosure, during
litigation, of material which if released could be damaging to our
national security. Section 15 of the Act amends the Special Immigration
Appeals Commission Act 1997 to ensure that, where the Home Secretary
excludes someone from the United Kingdom or refuses to naturalise them
as a British citizen on the basis of sensitive material, the
appropriate place for that decision to be challenged should be the
Special Immigration Appeals Commission.</hs_para>

individual in that situation could apply to the High Court to set aside
the decision. This was a far from satisfactory arrangement for two
reasons. First, prior to the Justice and Security Act 2013, the High
Court had no facility for closed material proceedings, and even now it
has only limited provision for them. Secondly, SIAC is the tribunal
with the greatest expertise in considering sensitive national security
cases, as well as having expertise in immigration matters.</hs_para>

deemed that challenges to exclusions or citizenship decisions would be
best heard by SIAC. In order for SIAC to entertain these new
challenges, its procedure rules must first be amended, and that is what
we must turn our attention to now.</hs_para>

amendments that these rules make simply confirm that all the existing
rules, covering the kinds of appeal that SIAC has heard since its
inception in 1997, now apply to the review of exclusion and
naturalisation decisions. These are purely administrative 
<?notus-xml column=383?>changes which establish the guidelines relating to time limits for
seeking a review, submission of forms and  so on.</hs_para>

a number of substantial effects. First, although SIAC uses closed
material proceedings regularly, the SIAC Act 1997 allows this by
providing that rules may make provision for closed material
proceedings. Therefore, until these rules are passed, it is difficult
for SIAC fully to consider applications for review of exclusion or
citizenship
decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000071">Secondly,
these rules establish the obligations upon the Home Secretary when
disclosing material following an application for a review of an
exclusion or naturalisation decision. These disclosure obligations are
slightly different from those attached to a conventional appeal, and
new Rule 10B makes that distinction. The difference derives from the
fact that applications for review are to be decided on the principles
applicable in an application for judicial review, and therefore the
duty of candour represents the correct approach to disclosure. By
contrast, appeals to SIAC are merits-based. SIAC is not simply
reviewing the Home Secretary’s decision; it is making its own.
Therefore, in appeals, a fuller disclosure process is
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000072">Thirdly,
your Lordships may wish to note Rule 29, which amends 2003’s
Rule 40 to give the commission the power, where appropriate, to
reinstate an appeal or application for review which had previously been
struck out. This, I hope the Committee will agree, will benefit the
interests of justice by ensuring that an appellant or claimant need not
be punished for a failure to comply with SIAC’s rules when the
failure is for a reason outside their control. Indeed, this amendment
results from a judicial suggestion made by the president of SIAC in a
recent judgment in a case known as R1—see paragraph 28 of the
judgment in R1 dated 21 May 2013, which can be found on SIAC’s
website.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000073">There
is a particular need to affirm these rules without delay, as until they
take effect the new cases which SIAC will hear cannot be progressed to
conclusion. That affects the 60 or so claimants whose pre-existing High
Court challenges will be certified and terminated under the Justice and
Security Act’s transitional powers but whose applications to
SIAC cannot be fully considered without these new rules. I beg to

Lester of Herne Hill (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, this course is
important and sensitive. I would like to give a little background to
how SIAC came to be set up and involved in this way in this procedure.
It happened because of a case called Chahal. Mr Chahal was a Sikh and
suspected terrorist being sent back to India. Under the old three wise
men procedure there was no proper judicial process to decide whether he
should be sent back, so he brought a case in Strasbourg. The problem
was how you reconcile justice and the needs of national security. In
the Chahal case, the various NGOs that intervened mentioned that there
was a Canadian process that allowed national security and justice to be
reconciled by a procedure rather similar to what the House is now
considering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:23:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000075">I
then did two cases from the bad old days, one in which the then
Secretary of State prevented women in the Royal Ulster Constabulary
part-time reserve having 
<?notus-xml column=384?>their sex discrimination cases determined in Belfast on the basis that
it involved national security and that in no circumstances could his
certificate be set aside. The second one involved alleged Catholic
discrimination in Northern Ireland, where another Secretary of State
again sought to prevent the applicants having the merits of their cases
reviewed.</hs_para>

SIAC procedure of 1997 was Parliament’s decision at the time to
apply something like the Canadian procedure to enable national security
and justice to be properly weighed. I have one experience of SIAC from
the distant past, when I represented a group of suspected terrorists,
who later won their case—not through me—in Luxembourg. My
experience then was very unhappy. I and they did not consider that the
way it was dealt with by SIAC felt fair. But that was a long time ago
and I am sure that lessons were learnt a long time ago.
For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:24:55"></hs_TimeCode> my part, we
are now concerned with not the controversial matters that plagued the
House for so long when considering the Justice and Security Bill, but a

am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, for his long contribution

Of course, we spent a considerable time debating closed material
procedures when we were engaged in a more recent piece of legislation.
It is perhaps worth remembering that the procedures under SIAC are
rather more stringent in terms of the criteria that a tribunal can
apply, since the Justice and Security Act requirement is to protect
matters of national security, but SIAC’s remit is wider. It has
the potential of ruling out material that is contrary not only to the
interests of national security but the international relations of the
United Kingdom, the detection and prevention of crime or in any other
circumstance where disclosure is likely to harm the public interest.
That is a much wider range, but this is a rather separate case. We are
not at the moment disputing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:27:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000080">However,
the Minister referred to consultation about the proposals. I make it
clear that we are not opposing the proposals. He cited the special
advocates, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the chairman of SIAC as
having been consulted. He did not mention that the Home Office, the
Treasury Solicitor, the security and intelligence agencies and the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office were also consulted, which is perfectly
proper. But can he say if anyone else was consulted? Were 
<?notus-xml column=385?>organisations concerned with representing people in this situation
consulted? Were voluntary organisations such as Liberty or Justice for
All consulted? Were any bodies or organisations working
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:28:19"></hs_TimeCode> those
involved in immigration matters consulted, such as the association of
immigration lawyers? It would be interesting to know whether the
consultation was confined to those who might be expected to have few,
if any, reservations about it as opposed to those who might want to
raise other
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:28:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000081">For
my part, having had some communication from the association of
immigration lawyers, there is one matter that I would be grateful for
some elucidation about. There is a concern that the transitional
provisions in the rules could allow a case currently progressing in the
High Court as a judicial review to be hijacked and taken to the
commission. I have no idea whether there is any substance in that fear.
Will the Minister—perhaps not at this moment—clarify
whether that is a possibility and, if it is a possibility, how likely
it is and how many current cases might be caught? It would be a matter
of concern if it is a possibility, although, of course, it may not be
and I am perfectly content to await the Minister’s response on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:29:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000082">Another
possibility that has been raised is that perhaps some matters have been

of justice and the need to protect national security. It is right that
we agonise. I believe we do because we are of all political
persuasions. This country is still a liberal democracy—with a
small “l” and a small “d”—and
liberal democracies agonise about how to get that balance
right.</hs_para>

does not enjoy the separation of powers that we take for granted in our

political and religious system all in one, which takes its authority

Muslim friends tell us that the jihadists are a misguided minority who
misinterpret the Koran and the holy texts. They point to verses such as
Surah 2, verse
256<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:38:15"></hs_TimeCode>, in which
Muhammad<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:38:17"></hs_TimeCode>
commands that there shall be no compulsion in religion, and to other
verses 
<?notus-xml column=387?>of peace. There are millions of Muslims who live their lives

we come up against part of Islam’s problem, which is the widely
held Muslim tenet of abrogation. This holds that, when verses in the
Koran contradict each other, it is the later verses which cancel out or
abrogate the earlier ones. This is unfortunate because, as Muhammad
went through life, he became steadily more of a conquering warrior, and
the messages that he received and what he said and did became
progressively more bellicose and violent. If abrogation is accepted,
the later verses of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:39:06"></hs_TimeCode> sword, of
which there are many, outweigh the earlier verses of peace, and it is
from these later verses that the jihadists take their inspiration and
authority. I have time to touch on just two of them.
Surah<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:39:20"></hs_TimeCode> 9, verse
5, commands the faithful to kill the unbelievers wherever they find
them, and Surah 9, verse 14,

am not pretending that Christianity has done all that well over the
centuries. Even if the Crusades were a response to 400 years of Muslim
aggression, we still have the Hundred Years War and the facts that

good and evil as balanced in the eternal dimension, beyond and above
all the world’s religions. It seems to me that good and evil are
present in each one of us, and that they can work only through the

from the individual to the collective, as we saw with the Holocaust and
Soviet communism. It is no respecter of any religion, nor of the

consider how our world stands now, today, and I fear that the dark side
is moving strongly within Islam. I understand the defence that Islamist
terror against the West is a reaction to Palestine, Srebrenica, Iraq

shaken hard in north Africa with the tragic conflict between Sunni and
Shia, and we cannot yet see how it will

nonsense—Islam is present in almost every race on earth,

something, but is it unreasonable to fear a religion which has recently
given us 9/11 and 200,000 dead, most of them Muslims, in 18,000 attacks
since then; which has given us the London bombings, Mumbai, the Spanish
train, Bali, Drummer Rigby, Nairobi and Boko Haram; which, in 15 of its

shut us up. However, the hate lies in the heart of the Islamist. We can
stir it up only because it is already there, red hot and seething

closing, I congratulate the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi,
who is to reply to this debate, for the great courage that she showed
in her speech at Georgetown University last Friday. I regret her
support for UN Resolution 16/18, put forward by the Organisation of
Islamic Cooperation, which seeks to criminalise Islamophobia or
“defaming Islam” worldwide. She certainly highlighted,
however, the current plight of Christians in the present world at the
hands of what she calls a new sectarianism. As a Muslim she was

conclude by asking the Minister only two questions. First, does she
agree that nearly all the present violence against Christians is coming
from within Islam—from the jihadists? We have the suffering of
Muslims themselves in Burma and we have the Hindu massacre of
Christians at Orissa, but is not the rest of it almost entirely
jihadist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:37:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111956000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111956000103">The
second question is one I have asked the Minister before. If it is true
that the jihadists are such a small minority in Islam, who misinterpret
the Koran and the holy texts, why does not the great majority do more
to stand up against them? Why for instance do not the leaders of Islam,
the grand muftis and righteous ulema call a massive conference, a sort
of combination of the councils of Nicea and Trent, to issue a fatwa
against the jihadists and to cast them out of Islam?</hs_para>

believe the basis for the Prime Minister’s statement

teaching or scripture that condones causing indiscriminate harm to
others. It is the interpretation of corrupt minds that seek to justify
these actions for themselves and those they

is that ideology that we are facing, not the religion itself.
Terrorists’ motives have time and again been revealed as
political grievances. Terrorists twist these grievances, through the
prism of religion, into an ideology to justify their actions. It must
therefore be clear that these actions were not motivated at root by
religious teachings. The united condemnation of the Woolwich attack
from prominent Muslims illustrated
this.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111964000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111964000005">Let us
look specifically at Islamic teaching. As a Muslim, I was taught that
human life was sacred. It is written in the Holy Koran,</hs_para>

is why I have consistently spoken about Islam as a religion of peace,
and continue to do so. In fact, I even represent that in my coat of
arms, which features  
<?notus-xml column=390?>two doves. I believe that every Muslim should be an ambassador to convey
that message and help to promote peace and harmony with other
religions. I also believe that both the media and politicians must play
their part. Some media circles, in particular, are guilty of vilifying
Islam and portraying us with an unfair
image.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111964000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111964000006">There
are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, and in the United Kingdom, there
are more than 2.6 million. Such large numbers of people and their faith
must not be used as a scapegoat or a political football. It is
important that our politicians of all persuasions act responsibly and
use moderate language. I find the use of the term “Islamic
terrorist” to be improper in the same way that I would the term
“Christian terrorist”. That kind of language stokes fear
and creates a psychological tie between the religion and the
terrorist.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111964000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111964000007">The
opposite is in fact true. A report by Demos in 2011 revealed that 83%
of British Muslims feel proud to be a British citizen, compared with
79% of people across the whole population. That reasserts that our
problem lies with a very small minority. The vast majority of Muslims
enjoy practising their religion peacefully in the United Kingdom. I do
not believe that anybody looking to cause disharmony should be allowed
to come here from a Muslim country or a European country, such as the
Netherlands. If we demonise Islam or any other religion, we are doing a
disservice to the concept of religion as a whole and the societies that
embrace it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:52:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I

course, if I read my own scriptures, as I do every day, and select
various pieces of them, I could easily form myself into some kind of
sect which would be disapproved of, I hope, by most of civil society.
None the less, our activities which are theological, seeking peace, are
often turned into historical disappointments and much less than the

reviewing the Prevent strategy, which came to us in 2011. There we can
find that those who support terrorism obviously reject a cohesive,
integrated society. They often reject parliamentary democracy. Because
polarisation and fragmentation are key conditions for the emergence of
radical views, every effort should be made to understand, to have
dialogue with and to befriend those who are different

the communities of the Church of England, we have a process of presence

Culture and Local Government, engages in four communities across
England. They are asked to make friends, stay friends and change

engagements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:54:59"></hs_TimeCode>. In

one other thing to mention is the process of scriptural reasoning where
the great Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Islam and Christianity are, at
the highest level and local level, examining the scriptures and testing
the realities of things that are captured perhaps by groups who want to
be terrorists. They are put into their proper perspective and
understood, so that the wider community can be taught properly. I also
welcome the work of the Ministry of Justice and the noble Lords, Lord

course, those national and international efforts—the practical
resistance of evil wherever it is found—are necessary. But it is
at the local level in local dialogue and local communication that I
believe these terrible things that we experience can begin to be
resolved. We should sit with one another and listen to the
understanding of our theologies and our scriptures but also debate
vigorously the differences that we find when we do not understand why
someone might feel differently or behave in a different

we are building a new community in a completely unrecognised way in

also are proud—as one Muslim waiter in an Indian restaurant in
Birmingham seeks to do with his Bishop—to stand against those

we have a joint campaign to enable them to be enlightened. In the

Bhatia (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, the statement made by the
Prime Minister on 3 June 2013 is correct and has been echoed by the
leaders of the Labour Party and the Lib Dems. Terrorism and extremism
has existed in people from all faiths and religions. The important
thing to understand is that such terrorists 
<?notus-xml column=392?>form a very small part of the faith groups. If one looks at the Muslim
communities in Britain, there is a huge silent majority who abhor
violence in the name of their religion. They are peace-loving British
citizens who practise their faith and contribute to the welfare of
their own communities, the wider communities and the United Kingdom.
They oppose the attacks on innocent civilians. No religion advocates
violence. Those who commit violence should be dealt with by the police
and other law-enforcing
agencies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111964000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111964000017">One
has to look at the root causes of terrorism in the United Kingdom. Is
it lack of education? Is it lack of understanding of their own faiths?
Is it because the young get influenced by radical preachers? Our
schools should be teaching the messages of peace and law abiding, and
ensuring that only through sound education one becomes successful. It
is perhaps rightly argued that people who are trapped in the vicious
circle of poverty due to lack of jobs and opportunity become victims of
radicalism. The past five years have not been easy for such people
without jobs. The Government need to create more opportunities for the
young who are without
work<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111964000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111964000018">Turning
to Islam as a faith community, I wish to say that Islam, although it is
the fastest-growing faith in the world, is little understood or not
understood at all in the West. There is a deficit of understanding of
Islam. Islam is a peaceful faith and occasionally, like all other
faiths, it is hijacked by a handful of radicalised people for their own
perverted personal or political reasons and ambitions. Islam reveres
all the prophets—Christ, Moses, Abraham and others. Muslims are
shocked when the prophets are ridiculed or abused on the altar of
freedom of speech and
expression<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111964000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111964000019">Freedom
of expression is a democratic right, but it carries responsibility. Our
democracy is based on the rule of law, and those who break the law
should be dealt with in the courts. Our courts are independent and

to the Muslim community in Britain, I ask the Minister whether more
could be done to support newly arrived spouses and partners from
different parts of the world who come to join their families. In order
to integrate them into the wider communities, they need to learn
English. There are thousands of Muslim women who need to learn English
to be able to communicate with the wider community and participate in
civic society. They also need to be able to communicate with their own
children who go to school. I believe that English and the ability to
use a computer with internet connectivity are the two tools that will
bring such isolated groups of women from the margins to the

and computers will enable the mothers to understand what their children
are doing with their computers when they return home from school. Are
they doing their homework, or are they playing computer games or

Hameed (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the holy book of the Muslims begins
with the concept of God as not hurting or harming or as cruel but as
beneficent and merciful. It also talks of Islam as a religion of peace
and not war, for every time a Muslim takes the name of the Prophet
Mohammed, he adds the words, “Peace be upon him”. The
Koran also instructs the believer to be tolerant and compassionate and
to extend a helping hand to the sick and infirm. It also commands the
pursuit of knowledge with respect for scholars, women and minorities in
any land. It also instructs Muslims to respect other faiths and to live
with them as good neighbours in peaceful coexistence. Therefore,
strapping oneself with explosives to kill others in an act of suicide
in search of martyrdom is totally un-Islamic and against the
instructions of the Koran, the holy book that all Muslims must
obey.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111964000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111964000030">As was
explained earlier, the word “phobia” is described in the
<I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> as an extreme and irrational fear or
dislike of a specified thing. Thus, noble Lords may have heard of the
term “Islamophobia” being bandied about against Islam,
leading to prejudice and generalised hatred or fear of Islam and its
followers. The media around the world have their share of blame to bear
in drip-feeding into the minds of the readers of newspapers and
journals, and the viewers of television, regular doses of anti-Muslim
material, not as factual reporting but to create public excitement with
sensationalism to enhance the number of their readers and their viewing
public. The widespread damage this does to society at large is
incalculable. The resultant pressure from this on Muslim families is
anger, confusion and frustration, with the resultant acts of
violence.</hs_para>

a just and compassionate human society remains unfulfilled. This, in

me give your Lordships a glaring example of how selective our principal
source of information, the media, can be. I am pointing out a question
of opportunities. One of the most venerated and respected figures of
the Islamic world is the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, where the most
holy sites for Islam are based. Recently, he delivered the Hajj sermon
for the annual pilgrimage, where nearly 2 million Muslims were
gathered. There, with many in the Muslim world also listening to his
fatwa, or sermon, he underscored the true teachings of Islam through
peace and harmony and declared that Islam has nothing to do with
terrorism or extremism and urged Muslims to unite against the incidence
of suicide bombings. These, he said, were recipes for being transported
to hell rather than a place in paradise. I wish that our wonderful
media worldwide had given more prominence to such a message, rather
than the drip-drip that we see in newspapers every day which leads only
to the poisoning of our minds against each
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111964000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111964000035">Finally,
let us proclaim loudly our intent to defeat those who are bent on
destroying our civilised way of life and resolve our differences

it.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_19_PT_1/E9658ECCF410076AC8EDFA6969C1EAD53846B2E9" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 November 2013">Tuesday,

Ahmed (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, the Prime Minister’s
statement that there is nothing in Islam which justifies acts of terror
was a call for unity at a time when many of us felt frightened. The
Prime Minister was right: we must respond to senseless violence with
all the strength of a united society. When community leaders of all
faiths work together to guide young people away from extremism, they
strengthen our society. That is the kind of constructive action we
need. The spreading of religious prejudice is far from constructive.
Islamophobia and any other kind of religious hatred will only divide
Britain. Religious hatred and the fear-mongering that goes on with it
has no place in a civilised
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111972000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000003">First,
I want to deal with the myth that terrorism is an Islamic phenomenon.
In July 2011, 77 people were murdered and 150 injured in Norway. Acting
on the belief that immigrants were undermining the Christian values of
his country, Anders Breivik identified himself as a Christian crusader.
I do not think that Breivik was a Christian. I do not think that his
actions reflect Christianity or that Christianity has something
fundamentally wrong with it because he claims to be acting in its
name<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T17:14:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111972000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000004">The
noble Baroness, Lady Uddin, mentioned Pavlo Lapshyn, who stabbed an
82-year-old man, Mohammed Saleem, in Birmingham. Pavlo Lapshyn also
planted three bombs outside mosques. Lapshyn cited his desire to stir
up racial tension as the motivation for his crimes. Surely this makes
it our duty to quash any racial tension that this kind of violence
stirs
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T17:14:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Buddhist monks who have been attacking the Rohingya
communities  in Burma, killing thousands of Muslims, and Hindu
nationalists have also bombed in India. They do not represent the
majority of Hindus or Buddhists. From the reign of Bloody Mary and her
burning of hundreds of Protestants to the troubles of Northern Ireland
between Protestants and Catholics, our history illustrates that it is
ignorance, prejudice and the desire for power—not
religion—that fuels

so, some will draw comfort from blaming the Muslim community. In an

me, this dehumanising language echoes the anti-Semitic comments made
about Jews in the 1920s. When the noble Lord says “ten times
faster than us”, what does he mean by “us”? Would
he separate British Muslims from the rest of British
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T17:16:01"></hs_TimeCode>?

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T16:53:18"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
start by doing something that I have not done often, which is simply to
endorse the Prime Minister’s words. It is notable to me that no
noble Lord today has started with the 
<?notus-xml column=397?>convention that we have of congratulating somebody on getting a debate
on the Order Paper. That is probably because most of us, certainly me,
have looked forward to this with some apprehension. I was apprehensive
because I know from the time in November 2009 that the noble Lord, Lord
Pearson, in running for the leadership of his party, UKIP, said that
the political class was complacent about Islamism. He claimed that our
people—again, I do not quite know who the “our”
and “we” are—were strangers in our own land. He
went on to
commend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T17:19:59"></hs_TimeCode> the
right-wing Dutch politician, Geert Wilders, and invited him to screen
his controversial film about Islam

number of speakers in this debate have treated it, understandably, as
though it were a discussion of a religious or theological issue. I do
not believe that it is—I think that it is straightforwardly
political. It is about the potency that is sometimes achieved, at times
of economic crisis, of characterising some people in ways that are
dismissive of them and stereotypes them, speaking about them with a
generality that cannot be justified. I shall have to go back through
<I>Hansard</I> to make sure that I am quoting accurately, but in
introducing this debate the noble Lord talked about the “dark
side” and birth rates of people who are, obviously,
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-19T17:20:28"></hs_TimeCode> quite as
good as us, people stirring up hate and “red hot” people

can—and I make the point about it being political—this is
not simply about the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. I have been going
through quotations from a large number of other people from UKIP, and
there is obviously an attempt to adopt positions on the extreme right
in our country. Cavan Vines, the candidate in south Yorkshire, talked
of people who hide behind women and kill our children. Chris Pain, the

the justification that some people may feel for political objectives

<?notus-xml column=398?>changes that they do not wish to see. They never have been compelled
that way and I do not believe that they ever will be compelled that

constructed in that way—let me be quite clear about it. I prefer
to live in an integrated society in which people share each
other’s cultures and enjoy them. But it is also a truth that if
people live that way within the law and including all laws that protect
equal status of all citizens, there is no reason why those people

happened on the streets of Woolwich shocked and sickened us all. It was
a despicable attack on a British soldier who stood for our country and
our way of life, and it was a betrayal of Islam and of the Muslim
communities who give so much to our country. There is nothing in Islam
that justifies acts of terror, and I welcome the spontaneous
condemnation of the attack from mosques and Muslim community
organisations across our country. We will not be cowed by terror, and
terrorists who seek to divide us will only make us stronger and more
united in our resolve to defeat them”.—[<I>Official

Leviticus 18:22. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I have
you here. I’m interested in selling my youngest daughter into
slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. She’s a Georgetown
sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, always cleared the table when it was
her turn. What would a good price for her be?”. While thinking
about that, can I ask you another question? My Chief of Staff, Leo
McGarry, insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly says he
should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself or is
it okay to call the police? Here’s one that’s really
important because we’ve got a lot of sports fans in this town:
touching the skin of a dead pig makes one unclean. Leviticus 11:7. If
they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins still play
football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town really
have to be together to stone my brother John for planting different
crops side by side?

made from two different threads? Think about those questions, would
you?”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13111972000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000027">I
could not make this point more clearly. These texts from the Old
Testament could so easily be manipulated to cause mischief and indeed
have been manipulated in the past. But being religious means making
choices and understanding the central values of your faith. It also
means considering the context in which that faith was formed. To be an
adherent, one must also be a historian. This is a point that the late
Benazir Bhutto, the first female Prime Minister of a Muslim country,
once put particularly well when speaking of teachings in the Koran. She
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13111972000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000056">“In
an age when no country, no system, no community gave women any rights,
in a society where the birth of a baby girl was regarded as a curse,

individuals”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13111972000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000028">Noble
Lords will be aware that most religions have suffered at one time or
another from extremism. Islam is no exception. The essential lesson
taught by Islamic history is that extremist groups are ejected from the
mainstream of Islam. They are marginalised and seen as heretical
aberrations to the Islamic message. That is why religious leaders such
as countless Muslim scholars have stood tall, not only condemning acts
of violence committed in the name of their faith but issuing clear
Islamic rulings, a fatwa on why terrorism is a rejection of what Islam
stands
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111972000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000029">The noble
Lord, Lord Pearson, has a clear interest in Islamic theology. He makes
a distinction between the Prophet’s life in Mecca and Medina. He
refers to the “sword verses” in the Koran. He joins
critics to demonstrate that Islam is violent in nature. Ironically,
these same verses are also selectively abused by religious extremists
to support their theology of hate and intolerance. It is not surprising
that the Koran, like the Hebrew Scriptures and the Old Testament, has
verses on fighting and the conduct of war but they must be put into
context.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111972000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000030">As
many noble Lords have said in this debate Islam, like all world
religions, neither supports, nor advocates, nor condones terrorism. I
am saying that the values of al-Qaeda and like-minded terrorists are
not only contrary to what we as a country stand for, they are a
distortion of the Islamic tradition itself. Al-Qaeda’s ideology
is fundamentally at odds with both classical and contemporary Islamic
jurisprudence. That is why the majority of Muslims across the globe
reject their
ideology.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111972000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000031">I
believe it is a great shame that the noble Lord has asked this
question. It points, at best, to ignorance about Islam, or, at worst, a
deliberate attempt to perpetuate a distorted image of the faith. It is
particularly sad to see this being done during interfaith week, when we
celebrate the important role that faith plays in British society,
particularly when different faiths come together. This Government
support the role of faith in society. They support people in their
right to manifest their faith, to worship freely and to act in the name
of their faith for the good of society. They support people to share
their faith with others, to change their faith, or, indeed, to have no
faith at all. As well as that, they are committed to
protecting people from intolerance,
discrimination or even persecution 
<?notus-xml column=401?>on the basis of their faith. We have done more than any other Government
to tackle that unacceptable scourge of anti-Muslim hatred. For that, I
am
proud.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111972000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000032">Deep,
entrenched anti-Muslim bigotry goes against everything this great
nation stands for—the idea that Islam is a particularly violent
creed and therefore an irrational reaction to it is somehow
appropriate. I am concerned that the deeper Islamophobia seeps into our
culture, the easier becomes the task of extremists recruiting. I invite
the noble Lord to reflect on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111972000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Pearson of Rannoch" PimsId="136" UID="13111972000067" xid="1385" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000067">Lord

Warsi:</Member></B> I am coming to that now. I will be answering the
noble Lord’s direct questions now. The fact is, British Muslims
play a crucial role in British society. Everyone in this house knows
Muslims in British life—doctors, engineers, scientists,
journalists, MPs, teachers, business people, local councillors and so
on. They are all making strong contributions to our country. The
citizenship survey of 2010-11 asked whether it is possible to fully
belong to Britain and maintain a separate cultural or religious
identity. Some 89% of Muslims agreed with that, as opposed to 72% of
the general population.</hs_para>

Lord’s attention to recent research conducted by ICM, which
showed that Muslims are Britain’s top charity givers, topping a
poll of religious groups. Muslims who donated to charity last year gave
an average of almost £371 each. That is nothing new. The first
recorded Englishman to become Muslim was John Nelson, in the 16th
century. At the time of the union with Scotland in 1707, Muslims were
already in Britain. There are records of Sylhetis working in London
restaurants as early as 1873. Noble Lords may also be aware of the
recent campaign that the Government launched to highlight the
contribution of the nations from the Commonwealth during the First
World War. Hundreds of thousands of the 1.2 million who
served in the British Indian Army were Muslims. They fought and died
for the values and freedoms that we enjoy today.</hs_para>

questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. He asked about the
persecution of Christians and by which particular group and they were
being conducted. I say this simply: one life taken, one life destroyed,
is one life too much. For me, the religion of those communities is
absolutely
irrelevant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111972000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Pearson of Rannoch" PimsId="136" UID="13111972000071" xid="1385" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000071">Lord
Pearson of Rannoch:</Member></B> With respect, that does not answer the
question. The question I put to the noble Baroness was about the
persecution of Christians, to which she so bravely referred in
Georgetown last Friday. Is it or is it not mostly the work of the
jihadists? That was the question I put to
her.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111972000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="13111972000072" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000072">Baroness
Warsi:</Member></B> It was mostly the work of extremists who do not
follow any faith, as far as I am concerned. Collective punishment for
co-religionists is wrong. That is what I said in Georgetown. Collective
requirement of a community to be a constant apologist for its
co-religionists is also wrong. As the UK’s first ever Minister
for Faith and Communities, it is my job to ensure that freedom of
religion and belief remains at the top of the Government’s
agenda both at home and
internationally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111972000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119-gc0001.htm#13111972000041">The
US Congress hearing in 2011 about “Islamist terrorism”
was described as reality TV and a witchhunt. The White House said that
we do not practice guilt by association. The Prime Minister, this
Government and I wholeheartedly agree with that. Values such as
religious tolerance are not just British. They are universal values
that cut across different countries and different faiths. Although, of
course, all faiths contribute to the public good, Islam is my religion
and I am proud of my beliefs.</hs_para>

in building a society characterised by respect and tolerance is not
best served by scare stories stirred up by Parliament or
parliamentarians. Those of us who have the privilege to serve in
Parliament should use this platform to help to build better relations,
to speak not just for those communities and faiths to which we belong
but wherever injustice occurs, as I did just a few days ago in
Georgetown, when I spoke about the persecution of Christians. I thank
the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, for his warm words about the speech, and

should stimulate a formal reconsideration and decision on whether to
proceed further with the GoCo option. Bids were required from the two

the consortia but the second (Portfield, comprising CH2MHill, Serco and

the 2011 white paper on higher education, Students at the Heart of the
System (Cmnd 8122), the Government announced its intention to introduce
a level playing-field for regulating higher education providers of all
types. A number of reforms have since been introduced to deliver
convergence between the rules governing higher education institutions
funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and
others, known as alternative providers (APs). The process of applying
student number controls to APs was subject to a consultation, which was
launched in November 2012 and which closed in January 2013.</hs_para>

introduced a system of recovery of payments from HEFCE-funded providers
that breached their number controls. This regime was not applied to
APs, even though students studying at APs are eligible for maintenance
grants, maintenance loans and tuition fee loans. As the higher
education sector has diversified, the number of applications for 
<?notus-xml column=52?>student support at APs has increased. In
addition, the tuition fee changes
implemented in 2012/13 mean students at APs may borrow up to
£6,000 a year to cover the costs of their tuition. The number of
English and EU students claiming support at APs has grown from 13,000
in 2011/12 to 30,000 in 2012/13, and  the total public
expenditure on these students has  risen from £60m to
£175m. This is 4% of the total student support
budget. Growth has been particularly concentrated among students
studying for Higher National Certificates (HNCs) and the Higher
National Diplomas

controls for 2014/15 academic year based on institutions’
2012/13 entry data. Alternative Providers were asked to submit data to
HEFCE on their recruitment plans. The Department received this data on
5 November and concluded that some of these plans were unaffordable,
given the need to control public spending. We have therefore written to
the 23 APs that are expanding most rapidly to instruct them
to recruit no more students for HNCs and HNDs in the current 2013/14

review reported to the Justice Secretary, Home Secretary and the

the report’s findings, CJS ministers agreed to accept the
recommendations of the review, namely that:</hs_para>
<hs_WAIndent>• The Government should remove the availability
of simple cautions for indictable only offences
unless there are very exceptional circumstances and the caution has
been approved by a chief officer, whilst continuing to allow the use of
the conditional caution for these offences. This can be achieved either
through toughening the guidance or through legislating. We will also
seek to restrict the use of simple cautions for particularly serious
either way offences which would ordinarily attract custodial sentences
or high end community orders if the offender is found guilty following
a trial.</hs_WAIndent> <hs_WAIndent>• We should also restrict
the use of simple cautions for repeat offenders beyond the position as
set out in the
guidance.</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• We
believe there is a compelling case for simplification and consolidation
of the existing guidance. We also recommend further strengthening the
existing guidance regarding cautioning in serious
cases.</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• That there is greater local
accountability and scrutiny of decision making. Each
force should have a senior officer identified as responsible to provide
local leadership and accountability and by making use of local Scrutiny
Panels.</hs_WAIndent>  
<?notus-xml column=54?><hs_WAIndent>• Whilst the imposition of a
caution is an operational policing matter we believe there is a
compelling case for forces to review strategy and usage of cautions and
other out of court disposals on an annual basis. Particular scrutiny
should attach to the question of cautions for serious and repeated
cases. There is clear potential for Police and Crime Commissioners to
play an active role in providing transparency and assurance for the
public on this issue.</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• The
presentation of data on cautions, and any accompanying narrative,
should continue to draw a clear distinction between youth and adult
cautions and simple and conditional cautions, although there is a need
for consistent operating principles between these wherever possible.
More use can be made of police.uk to ensure that the data is easily
accessible to the public.</hs_WAIndent>
<hs_WAIndent>• Whilst this review has limited
itself to adult simple cautions, it has concluded that in view of wider
concerns which have been voiced during the review, there would be a
good case for conducting a wider review of other statutory and informal
out of court disposals for both adults and youths to
ensure  that the framework is rational, understood by all
practitioners, and maintains public confidence, and that there are no
inadvertent effects from any changes to the simple caution regime in
isolation.</hs_WAIndent>

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally) (LD):</Member>
The European Commission’s Impact Assessment concluded that the
proposed Data Protection Regulation would be beneficial for the EU
economy because it reduces the administrative cost that arises from
fragmentation of current law, and gives individuals greater confidence
in using online services. The Commission’s IA concluded that the
proposals would result in a net benefit of €2.3 billion per
annum to the EU economy. The UK has carried out its own Impact
Assessment of the costs and benefits of the proposals. While we agree
that there would be some benefits from the Regulation, such as a
reduction in legal fragmentation, the UK Impact Assessment concluded
that these benefits would be outweighed by the costs of additional
administrative and compliance measures that the Regulation would
introduce. The Impact Assessment concluded that the Regulation as
originally proposed by the Commission could have a net cost to the UK
economy of £100 million to £360 million per annum (in
2012-13 earnings
terms).</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13111952000413" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119w0001.htm#13111952000413">Drones</hs_DebateHeading><hs_DebateType>Questions</hs_DebateType></NewDebate><hs_TabledBy UID="13111952000463" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119w0001.htm#13111952000463">Asked

basis for the Commissioner’s statement, nor indeed of a European
Commission calculation having been done with regard to the percentage
of United Kingdom laws. Neither has this Government carried out any
such analysis. It would in any case be extremely difficult to determine
such a percentage—it would in part depend on the relative weight
placed, for instance, on Acts of Parliament, Statutory Instruments
whether implementing EU legislation or not, and directly effective EU
legislation. The House of Commons Library Research Paper of 2010
entitled <I>How much legislation comes from Europe?</I> also stated
that “there is no totally accurate, rational or useful way of
calculating the percentage of national laws based on or influenced by
the EU”. Such a calculation would also have a limited value as
it would neither give an indication of the effect nor of the impact of
the legislation in the UK. The Balance of Competences Review, currently
underway, seeks to give an overview of the effect and impact of EU
legislation. The first six reports can be found here:

The Government recognises the need to raise awareness amongst criminal
justice professionals and the courts of the importance of identifying
dependants of offenders or defendants who face a custodial sentence or
a remand in custody. Probation staff and the Crown Prosecution Service
continue to play an important role in identifying and drawing attention
to the existence of dependents in advising the court. The court also
has clear guidance, via established case law, on the sentencing of
offenders with dependents. We welcome the important work that other
organisations, such as the Prison Advice and Care Trust, do in raising
awareness of this issue across the criminal justice system and by
encouraging defendants to disclose the existence of dependents so that
practical arrangements can be made for their
care.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13111952000435" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119w0001.htm#13111952000435">Palestine</hs_DebateHeading><hs_DebateType>Question</hs_DebateType></NewDebate><hs_TabledBy UID="13111952000494" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131119w0001.htm#13111952000494">Asked
