No candidates have emerged yet and, as such, we believe that it is too
early to speculate on a successor to Ban Ki-Moon. However, we would
want to see a proven leader who is fully committed to the values of the

unstable bipolarised world, is it not true that the UN has a
potentially more significant role than ever and that the appointment of
the Secretary-General is therefore an absolutely crucial international
appointment? Should not the criteria for that appointment have maximum
possible international agreement and be
transparent—irrespective, of course, of gender? Does the
Minister agree that the days when we can cobble together some sort of
compromise behind closed doors in the Security Council or the P5 are

tribute to the work that he has consistently done with the UN
Association going back many years and for being persistent in relation
to this question. It is important for us to keep focusing on how we can
improve these international appointments and the elections that take
place for them. We continue to focus on the fact that we want the best
candidate for the job, but the candidate must also command the greatest
possible support from the international community as well as that of
the P5. We must conduct the process in a way which does not form
divisions within the international community to ensure that the office
bearer, once elected, has the greatest amount of support rather than
undermining them through the

Falkner of Margravine (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, given that by 2016
it will be nearly 70 years since the establishment of the United
Nations, does my noble friend agree that it would be helpful if we
could see a 
<?notus-xml column=1408?>woman at the helm after all this time? On criteria, does she accept the
general view that the two terms a Secretary-General gets may not be
adequate given the desire for regional representation? Could we
possibly contemplate from the United Kingdom the Canadian proposal for
a longer single term—similar to that recently proposed for the
House of Lords,

Warsi:</Member></B> Of course, I would be delighted to see a woman in
the position of UN Secretary-General. Indeed, this House has produced
some fantastic international appointments in the past—we have
only to look at the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, to see what amazing
work she is doing on the international
scene<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T15:10:08"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
I come back to what I said at the outset: it is important to have a
transparent system and to make sure that we get the best possible
candidate for the job, who may well be a woman. It is important also
that we maintain consensus during the process, because UN reform is a
difficult enough subject without the Secretary-General having to do the
job when he does not command the support of the General
Assembly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T15:10:28"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hannay of Chiswick" PimsId="3746" UID="13112754000785" xid="1625" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000785">Lord
Hannay of Chiswick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, can the noble Baroness
tell the House that the Government will do their best to prevent what
is called regional pre-emption—that is, the presumption being
established ahead of time that a particular region will provide the
next Secretary-General? That, of course, narrows the candidate list
enormously. If the Government were to push hard against that with other
influential members, that would count. Will she also consider the
possibility that, on this occasion, we might try to broker a
gentlemen’s agreement between the five permanent members that
none of them will exercise a veto at the next
election<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T15:11:17"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="13112754000786" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000786">Baroness
Warsi:</Member></B> The process that the noble Lord mentions involving
the concept of a regional rotation has of course happened in practice,
but the UK has never endorsed the idea of a formal rotation.
We believe that every region should have the opportunity to
put forward a candidate—no region should be denied
that. The noble Lord will be aware of the speculation as to
which region that will be next time round. Going back to the issue of
consensus, it is important that the discussions between the P5 take
place in accordance with protocol in a way that builds consensus so
that we do not end up with public splits which could damage the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T15:12:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Dykes" PimsId="3061" UID="13112754000787" xid="1706" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000787">Lord

Council has to be reformed. Many proposals have been put forward for
both its operation and its membership. I think that it needs to go
further than that. As the Minister with responsibility for the UN, I
have been pushing for a United Nations that is much more responsive and
competitive, and that in a

performance management and makes better use of IT. Much could be done

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the CCG target formula recommended by ACRA
this time a year ago was rejected by NHS England for the very reasons
that the noble Lord cites: because it did not include an adjustment for
deprivation and health inequalities. At a recent Health Select
Committee hearing, Paul Baumann, the chief finance officer of NHS
England, indicated that the proposed new formula would have an
adjustment for a health economy’s unmet need—in other
words, an adjustment for deprivation where low life expectancy suggests
that people are not accessing health
services.</hs_para>

formula, the primary driver of an individual’s need for health
services. The very young and elderly, whose populations are not evenly
distributed throughout the country, tend to make more use of health
services than the rest of the population. Having said that, the formula
contains elements relating to unavoidable differences in the costs of
providing services due to location alone—that is, the market
forces factor—and a number of other measures of adjustment. As I
say, we are assured by NHS England that deprivation will feature in the
formula that is published for next year.</hs_para>

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, it would take me
quite a while to answer all those questions properly. However, in the
context of the financial question he asked, there are two aspects to
this—the first is about fair cost-sharing, and the second about
fee levels. Businesses tell us that a major concern is the lack of
transparent and fair cost -sharing when companies are
pooling data on the same substance. As a result, that was
the top recommendation for helping SMEs in the review report. There is
a commitment across the board to sort that out, and we are playing a
major role in it. As regards fee levels—that is, for fees
payable to the European Chemicals Agency—the revised fee levels
were voted through by the UK and other member states and came into
force in March. They mean that the smallest companies are now eligible
for fee discounts of up to 95%, which can mean a one-off registration
fee of as little as €64.</hs_para>

perverse effects of EU overregulation? Thousands of products that have
been with us and fully approved for many decades by our own safety
regulation authorities are now to be banned; and that, in many
instances, will put out of work small businesses which cannot afford
the very high costs of trying to prove that something that is safe, is
safe. Is this really the sort of democratic situation we want to be
in—where our own Ministers can do nothing to put this matter
right except mumble about trying to ease the pain in some way or

our approach to enforcement is to help companies get back into

Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, is the Minister
aware—I have mentioned this to the House before—that
self-employed carers are often paid as little as £3 per hour,
and that there is no control whatever over the self-employed? People
who work officially for care sources are paid the minimum wage per hour
but get nothing for the travel time between jobs. It could be that for
every hour they work as a carer there is another unpaid hour, which
surely makes a nonsense of saying that they are getting that amount per
hour. What does the Minister believe can be done to improve the
situation, because the care service is very

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, if people are paid the minimum wage for
hours when they are working and not being paid for travelling time
between periods of work, that brings down the average amount paid per
time at work to below the minimum wage. Therefore, employers are acting
illegally. One of the principal findings in the study, which is the
subject of this Question, is that the travelling time of people working
in domiciliary care is one of the main reasons for people being paid
below the minimum wage. HMRC operates under a contract from BIS to
manage this process. The system has remained essentially unaltered
since the minimum wage was introduced some 15 years ago, and

by care workers. Obviously, local budgets are constrained. However, to
the extent that local authorities are commissioning care, they have an
obligation to ensure that their commissioning is done in such a way
that the people providing it are not in breach of the conditions on low
pay. One of the key points in this area is the provision by HMRC of a
free pay and work rights helpline for people who feel that they may be
suffering because they are not getting the minimum wage as a result of
things such as the travelling time problem that we discussed earlier.

the matter raised by my noble friend Lord Hunt, this is a very serious
matter. The Scottish Government are proceeding as if this so-called
White Paper is of no concern to the people of the rest of the United
Kingdom—indeed, of no concern to this Parliament—yet
constitutional matters are still reserved to this Parliament. Thanks to
the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, next Thursday we are going to have a
debate of only an hour to discuss an astonishing unilateral declaration
by the Scottish Government of the date of independence, assuming that
this matter is going to go through without any difficulty. Much more is
needed than this and I am glad that, as well as the Chairman of

Member of this House should be provided with a copy of this document.
It is relevant to us and we should be considering it. Further, there
should be a Statement in this House and in the other House of the
implications of this document for the rest of the United Kingdom and,
as well as the one-hour debate that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, has
secured, there ought to be a full day’s debate in government
time so that we can discuss the implications. If not, we are going to
sleep-walk into the break-up of the United Kingdom. If that is what

could just say yes, but let me say a little more. The future of the
United Kingdom is clearly a constitutional matter. The constitution,
under the Scotland Act 1998, is a reserved matter, so the publication
and the contents of the guide are clearly a matter of legitimate
interest to all Members of this House but technically, because it is a
Scottish government publication, the noble Lord is right: it is not
deposited in the Printed Paper Office and the Scottish Government have
not made paper copies of the guide available to the PPO. However,
photocopies of the abstract of the guide have been in the PPO since
yesterday. The PPO will print, on demand, copies of the full 670-page
guide for those Members who need one. Members who would like a copy of
the full guide should accordingly ask for one from the PPO.
However, in the interests of economy, to say nothing of saving quite a
few trees, copies of the full guide will also be available for

Newby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the Government are committed to
bringing payment systems under formal economic regulation to address
deeply rooted failures in the UK’s payments market. In
Committee, the Government tabled amendments to establish the new
Payment Systems Regulator. The Government are now introducing a small
number of further provisions and making amendments to some of the
clauses previously tabled to ensure that the regulator is able to
perform its functions effectively and that the right procedures apply
to powers contained in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000072">First,
these amendments will introduce provisions modelled on measures in the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 which prohibit the regulator
and those working for or on behalf of it from disclosing confidential
information without the consent of the information owner. The
prohibition will be enforced by a new criminal offence. However,
further provisions will permit confidential information to be disclosed
to certain prescribed persons in specific circumstances, including the
provision to the regulator of certain information held by the Bank of
England. This will be an important element of the Payment Systems
Regulator’s regulatory regime. Without a prohibition on the
disclosure of confidential information, people may be dissuaded from
providing to the regulator important information which would assist it
in the discharge of its regulatory
functions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000073">The
Government are bringing forward a number of other amendments which
mirror provisions that already exist for the FCA under the Financial
Services and Markets Act. The FCA will be able to collect levies for
the purpose of maintaining adequate reserves for the regulator, which
will help it to meet any contingencies. Another amendment will require
that the regulator uses a sum equal to its enforcement costs for the
benefit of its regulated population by reducing their levy the
following year. A further amendment will ensure that the FCA does not
have to produce a cost-benefit analysis when drawing up fee-levying
rules to govern the collection of fees to meet the costs of the Payment
Systems Regulator.</hs_para>

tabled today will ensure that the right procedural requirements apply
in respect of certain powers in the regulator clauses. The regulator
will have a power to direct participants to take or not take specified

The consequence will be that more directions fall within the category
to which consultation requirements apply.

amendment will require the Treasury to publish its decisions to
designate payment systems to bring them within the regulator’s

assist the reader of the legislation, as well as some consequential
amendments to other legislation to include references to the
regulator—for example, to ensure that the Freedom of Information

amendment in this group in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes.
In Committee, the Government tabled amendments which included a
provision for the regulator to order banks to give indirect access to
payment systems to other financial institutions. The noble Baroness has
tabled amendments to this power with a view to addressing a concern
that ordering a bank to provide another institution with indirect
access to a payment system would expose the access-providing bank to
additional operational and compliance risks. I should like to reassure
the House that the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness are not
required to address the concerns that have motivated
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000077">This
power was designed to serve as a necessary back-stop in case banks with
direct access to payment systems reacted to being brought within the
regulator’s scope by ceasing to provide indirect access. This
would have left smaller players with no access to the vital systems.
The Government envisage that the regulator will be likely to exercise
this power only in such a situation. It would be used to safeguard the
position of the smaller banks reliant on the larger banks for continued
access to the systems and to prevent the detrimental consequences for
competition in UK retail banking if such access were
denied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000078">The
Government are confident that the regulator will not exercise this
power in any way that results in banks having to take on undue
operational or compliance risks. The power can be exercised only if an
institution applies to the regulator to exercise it. The regulator
would, in practice, inform the bank which it was proposed be ordered to
grant the access and would consider the circumstances of the applicant.
It would be open to the bank that was subject to any order to make
representations to the regulator about the applicant or any other
matter concerning the application. The regulator would consider any
such representations in making its decisions. It would not exercise the
power if it thought to do so would expose the bank, the subject of the
order, to additional risks which it would not be reasonable for it to
bear. The Government would expect the regulator to provide
in industry guidance more detail on the circumstances and manner in
which it would consider using its powers. In the light of that, I would
ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her

this point, I shall deal with the amendments tabled by the noble Lord,
Lord Brennan, to certain of the provisions of the proposed regulatory
system for payment systems. I should like to reassure the noble Lord
that his amendments are not necessary to achieve the end of a
proportionate and balanced regulatory system, which I am sure we share.
The noble Lord has proposed some additional safeguards to the
Treasury’s power to designate payment systems so that they fall
within the regulator’s scope. I should like to reassure the
noble Lord that the power would be exercised by the Treasury only after
proper consideration and where it is genuinely satisfied that the
available evidence indicates the designation criteria are met, and that
the exercise of its discretion to designate is necessary and
proportionate in the circumstances. It is not necessary to make this an
express requirement in the Bill. No such provision was included in the
precedent power, 
<?notus-xml column=1421?>contained in Section 185 of the Banking Act 2009, under which
the Treasury recognises systems for Bank of England oversight. I should
also like to reassure the noble Lord that the additional matters that
he has proposed should be considered by the Treasury when deciding to
designate a system would in any event be considered, and that it is not
necessary to state them in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000080">Under
the procedural provisions, the Treasury must notify operators of
payment systems that it proposes to designate and consider any
representations made, so we do not believe it is necessary to write
into the legislation that the operators must be consulted as that is,
in practice, what the Treasury would do. The drafting of this provision
matches that contained in the precedent—Section 186 of the
Banking Act 2009. In relation to the regulator’s competition
objective, it is important to maintain flexibility as to the matters to
which the regulator may, rather than must, have regard when considering
the effectiveness of competition, particularly given the fast-moving,
high-tech nature of the payments industry. The Government do not think
that it would be right to accept the noble Lord’s
proposal to change this discretion to a duty. The regulator should be
free to consider the factors which it considers relevant at any given
time to its assessment of the effectiveness of competition. The
Government also do not think it is necessary to add to the list of
factors the two proposed by the noble Lord. The consistency of
treatment of payment systems operators and the impact of any past or
proposed regulatory intervention are matters to which the regulator
will generally be obliged to have regard as a matter of good
administration. For the same reason, the Government believe that the
amendments tabled by the noble Lord to the regulatory principles to
which the regulator is to have regard are unnecessary. The regulator,
as a public authority, would need to act fairly and consistently, and
not take action if not necessary or not justified on the basis of the
evidence
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000081">In
relation to the regulator’s innovation objective, the Government
believe that the noble Lord’s suggestion to supplement it with
the objective of promoting the creation and sustaining of a regulatory
environment that is conducive to innovation is unnecessary. It is
implicit that the regulator will consider how its system of regulation
can best support innovation, and it will exercise its regulatory powers
only where it thinks that will serve to promote
innovation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000082">On
the regulator’s power to order a disposal of an interest in an
operator of a payment system and its power to vary certain agreements
relating to payment systems, the Government disagree with the noble
Lord’s proposal that these powers should be exercisable only
where the Competition and Markets Authority has decided that
the interest held in the operator of the system has resulted, or is
likely to result, in a substantial lessening of competition. This is a
power that the Government want the regulator to be able to exercise
independently, given the specific knowledge and expertise it is hoped
the regulator will acquire in relation to the markets in payment
systems and the services provided by them. However, it is important
that the interests of all concerned are adequately protected, so the
use of 
<?notus-xml column=1422?>this power, and the power to vary agreements
concerning payment systems, will be subject to appeal to the
Competition and Markets Authority, which could, on the application of
the appellant, suspend the effect of the regulator’s
decision pending the determination of the appeal. It would
be open to the CMA to quash the regulator’s decision and
substitute its own for that of the

regulatory system hereby created will not be permanently in debt and
bailed out annually by the financial services sector. Rather, it sets a
budget a year ahead and the financial system pays it at the end of the
second year in arrears. That gives the regulators two years of a
relatively fixed budget. So, in determining how much responsibility to
give to the regulators, including the Payment Systems Regulator,
particular regard should be had to their capacity to carry out the job

works whereby you go into a shop and use your own bank card
to acquire goods, the merchant bank and your bank exchange information,
and the transaction is completed. The way it is carried out is that
MasterCard, Visa and Amex act as the intermediate processors. It
involves £140 billion a year of purchases in this country. We
are number one in volume of e-commerce. The vast majority of the
consultation rounds that took place in 2012 and 2013 was directed at
bank lending arrangements such as I have described, CHAPS and so on,
not the card payment system. Indeed, references to that
system in the consultation papers were modest in the extreme and gave
no real cause for any present concern. As a result, no serious
regulatory impact assessment has been made of how these new
powers will affect our card payment system. In the rush to put so much
into this Bill in order to make sure that everything is covered, the

good regulatory principles would suggest that where a regulator is
given the task of managing a sector where at present there is no
significant risk, the task should be circumscribed. Do not create
teams. Do not multiply unless the evidence and the circumstances

commercial importance to ordinary life in this country, make sure that
the evidence is strong enough, be transparent about it and involve all

refers to process—to make sure that everybody is properly
involved and consulted. The third set of amendments aims to promote
competition and innovation. I assume that means that the regulator is
not just a disciplinary entity: it has a range of
disciplines, where required, to improve competition and innovation. Is
the PSR equipped for that? Do we know—I certainly do

hope I can reassure him that the principles that he set out at the end
of his speech are ones that the Government share. There is no sense in
which this regulator is being established with a remit to deal in the
heavy-handed way that he fears. Given that we want to cover all payment

provision, which restricts the ability of suppliers to terminate the
provision of certain listed supplies to an infrastructure company once
the company has entered FMI administration. The supplies that are
currently within the scope of the restriction are: computer hardware or

of superfluity, nothing in the Bill touches on the issue of gaming and
gaming trades of all sorts. I will give a few statistics in a minute to
show just how huge gaming now is in the City of London. Then we have
the issue of the EU. If I may say so, it is slightly premature for the
Government to anticipate the outcome of any recommendations that the
review I am suggesting might come out with. That is a long way down the
line: two and a half years is the time given for the review and heaven
knows what that outcome might be, least of all whether it would be in
any way in breach of EU law, which is in any event changing.</hs_para>

most important ground for rejection was the thought that this proposal
to set up a review to look at the effects of gaming on the wider
culture—social, ethical and cultural as well as economic and
commercial—would be unnecessary and objectively unjustified. If
one considers that these gaming trades now amount to many
trillions—some estimate quadrillions; I had never heard that
word before—it seems bizarre to say that this modest proposal is
disproportionate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000106">The
background to all this is the legislation brought in in 1986 in
anticipation of the big bang. The Financial Services Act 1986 contained
provisions that for the first time ever said that the gaming laws of
the land would not apply to these City gaming contracts. Since then
there has been a staggering explosion of such contracts. They are
simply massive across the world, not just here. Derivatives, which are
the most common form of gaming contracts or trades but not the only
one, are largely below the radar, although steps are being taken to
make them more transparent and measurable. The Bank for International
Settlements has calculated this year that the value of derivatives
alone—the over-the-counter derivatives, as they are
called—is $693 trillion. Others reckon that if you add in the
other form of gaming contracts, that goes up to a figure of $1.2
quadrillion in terms of face value, which may work out in real terms at
some $20 trillion, or 30% of global gross national product—or
gross international product, I should
say<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:20:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000107">Let
us look briefly at the collapse of the world financial centres,
particularly Wall Street and London. Lehman Brothers, had 1.2 million
derivative contracts on its books when it collapsed in 2008, of which
the face value was $39 trillion—that is one bank. It is
calculated that 80% of the income of Lehman Brothers before it
collapsed was from such gaming trades. Bear Sterns’ proportion
of income from gaming was even higher than 80%. The statistics show
capital debts of $384 billion against a capital of $11.8 billion; that
is, 30 times more. If you look at the collapses of AIG, MF Global,
Merrill Lynch, Northern Rock, Countrywide, Wachovia and so on, you will
find in all cases that 
<?notus-xml column=1436?>derivative gaming was absolutely central, usually key, to them. I just
throw that back at my noble friend when he says that a review of all
that, in terms of its cultural outfall, is not objectively

still doing it today and it is creeping up, and I have no doubt that it
will go on and on with its potentially malevolent effects just as
heretofore. Huge profits are made from these types of contract, but on
the other side of the coin they are matched by huge losses,
which was the principal spur to this devastating collapse, a collapse
which, do not let us ever forget, was stemmed internationally only by
Governments moving in with massive sums of money—what was it

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> I will do my best to explain. Let us
consider Merrill Lynch. It cornered, it is estimated, 50% to 80% of the
world’s copper in a series of purchases last year, I think it
was. That was pure gaming. It was not to satisfy any of its customer
needs; it saw potentially vast gains in moving into the world copper
market and simply buying it up. Can you imagine: 50% to 80% of all the
world’s copper was purchased? That was pure gaming. In fact, I
think that it went wrong and was part of the collapse, but I would not
lay my life on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000114">These
are extremely difficult issues. The cultural and ethical aspects are
deep. The vast majority of people engaged in such trading are decent,
good people. They are not all crooks, but the system in which they are
trapped is one which, first, was at the root of the 
<?notus-xml column=1437?>disastrous financial and banking collapse from which
we are still suffering—and there is a long way yet to go. Also,
we should be interested in the wider outfall. The noble Lord, Lord
Lawson, coined a rather vivid phrase last night about the cultural
contamination that can go on when one part of a system loses all

us consider what is happening in our nation at large, and the extent to
which gaming is now spreading rapidly. This week, I heard of one
medium-sized town that has more than 70 betting shops. In my town, they

difficult set of issues to address, but taking a cool, calm look at the

We have had all sorts of them, have we not? That would be a profound

important the potential outcome. This proposal has no pre-judgment.
Some of my remarks in opening the debate on the amendment, and some of

looks at all aspects of these difficult matters, be proved wrong. As I

Eatwell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I confess I was a little puzzled
by the introduction to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips.
He portrayed it as being so broad as to cover virtually all derivatives
trading, whereas I had presumed that he was focusing on those
derivative trades that are classified as gambling—in other
words, financial spread betting. The crucial issue with respect to
financial spread betting is that it is free from capital gains tax and
stamp duty, and that traders are typically free from income tax. This
is a really extraordinary form of tax avoidance within the financial
services industry. If that was what the noble Lord really 
<?notus-xml column=1438?>sought to focus on, a review of such forms of transaction would be very
useful, particularly in light of the fact that the Australian
Government have now declared that those forms of contracts are not
exempt from tax. Indeed, they are subject to both income tax and
capital gains tax under Australian tax law. What is remarkable is that
the number of these contracts being traded in Australia has dropped
dramatically.</hs_para>

Phillips, hopes to reduce the scope of what he referred to, especially
in quoting Keynes, as the financial casino, it would perhaps be

derivative contracts as gambling, which has had these unfortunate

Archbishop of Canterbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my support to
what the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, said in specifying these particular
contracts, not only for their tax avoidance capacity but because
participation in them within the trading community leads to obvious
conflicts of interest between their main work during the day, for their
employer, and any potential gains or losses they have through the
spread betting operations which they are capable of undertaking. In
other words, it is very much a cultural problem and it is specifically
to do with contracts that are considered to come under the purview of
the gaming Acts. That is how I understood this amendment to apply,
rather than more generally. From my point of view, I am not certain
that it needs to be in the Bill, but it would certainly be useful if
the Government were to say that the scope and impact of this should be

require the Treasury to undertake a review of the consequences of
exempting certain gaming contracts from the rule that used to provide
that no gaming contract or wager could be enforced in a court of law.
Such a review would consider the national, commercial and economic
effects, in addition to the social, cultural and ethical effects,
proposed in the equivalent amendment in Committee. I understand my
noble friend’s desire to know more about the consequences of
what appears to have been an extensive gambling culture in the City of

It may be helpful if I provide noble Lords with a short update on what
they are. They include measures to ensure transparency by requiring all

the requirement for all standardised derivatives to be centrally
cleared and, where appropriate, traded on
electronic platforms.

far as the wider effects of gaming in the City are concerned, the PCBS
undertook an extensive and wide-ranging examination of the professional

number of findings on the existing standards and culture in the banking

position. We are seeking to give effect to those recommendations in
this Bill. As the noble Lord will be aware, we will have a debate on
the broader cultural aspects of the PCBS’s report next

circumstances, I am not sure that a formal Treasury review, as proposed
by the noble Lord, is the best way forward. In Committee, I suggested
to him that a more appropriate way forward to address his concerns
might be for him and, possibly, other Members of your Lordships’
House to work with a think tank that specialises in financial services
to undertake such a review. The precedent I had in mind was the review
of the banking sector undertaken in the previous Parliament. The Future
of Banking Commission was chaired by David Davis MP and included not
only my colleague Vince Cable but the noble Lord, Lord McFall. That
report had a major impact at the time in influencing the consideration
of how we should be looking at the banking sector. The advantage of
such a structure over a formal Treasury structure is that it
enables a wide range of individuals, including serving politicians, to
sit on it. That is much more likely to happen if it is done
under the aegis of that sort of think tank than if it is initiated by
the Treasury. As a result, when the report came out, it commanded a
broad degree of public respect.</hs_para>

Marshalled List, Amendment 165 would insert a new clause entitled
“Duty of care”. Over the past several months, we have
seen a variety of scandals which have, let us say, polluted the
relationship between banks and their customers, particularly those
holding household accounts or those which are small or medium-sized
enterprises. We have had the PPI scandal, the scandal over the
mis-selling of interest rate swaps and now newspaper headlines cover
the accusations which come from within the Government that RBS has been
winding up small firms and seizing their assets to its own advantage.
Just yesterday, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr Carney,

addressed directly towards the banking relationship. It is in the best
interests of the banking industry and, indeed, of the UK economy as a
whole, that that relationship is repaired and that trust is
restored between the ordinary customer and his or her bank. The
amendment is carefully drawn. It proposes first that, with respect to
core services, a ring-fenced body will have a fiduciary duty towards
its customers. Not being a lawyer, I went to the law library in my
college to check that I knew exactly what “a fiduciary
duty” actually meant. I quote from a law textbook, which

that in restoring trust to our banking system, which has been so
seriously eroded by the various scandals to which I referred, nothing
could be better than a clear fiduciary duty with respect to the
acceptance of deposits and a duty of care with respect to the other
activities of a ring-fenced bank. Therefore, for example, if a small or
medium-sized enterprise is in trouble, it will be the duty of the bank
to help that enterprise wind up if necessary in a way which best
safeguards the owner of the small or medium-sized company. It would not
be a duty of care if the bank simply forced a small company into
receivership in a way which resulted in financial benefit to that bank.
This amendment would therefore first impose the fiduciary relationship
which I am sure most people thought they had with their bank but did

reply to the discussion of this amendment in Committee, the noble Lord,
Lord Deighton, put forward four objections. He said that, first, the
main thing the Government were doing to protect customers was to
encourage competition. Of course, competition may be helpful and may
help to protect customers. However, we are dealing with an industry in
which there is severe asymmetric information—that is, the
information and the skills that the bank has are not matched on the
other side by the skills of the customer. That is why we need to ensure
that the bank regards its responsibility as a responsibility of trust
with respect to the
customer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:47:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000137">The
noble Lord then said that surely this was covered by contractual
relationships. However, we are not looking at a contractual
relationship—a division of rights and responsibilities
previously agreed and divided between equal partners to a contract. We
are considering simply the deposit of a family’s or of a small
firm’s money within a bank, and the bank’s attitude
towards its responsibility to that family or small business. Therefore
we are not talking about contractual
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:47:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000138">The
noble Lord, Lord Deighton, then said that if bankers were given a
fiduciary responsibility, they would not understand it; they would not
understand the range of their responsibilities. First, since other
professions are perfectly capable of understanding the notion of
fiduciary responsibility, why should bankers not understand it? The
alternative he proposed of 
<?notus-xml column=1442?>listing specific responsibilities always has the
problem that once you have a specific list you leave things out at the
end. In an industry in which there is so much innovation, specific
lists are likely to be
inadequate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:48:35"></hs_TimeCode>.
Finally, the noble Lord said that this is unnecessary because we have
FiSMA rules that already cover it. If those rules already cover the
situation, why are we having this succession of extraordinary scandals,
which are damaging the banking industry so
badly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:48:55"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000139">Therefore,
this is a point in the Bill at which we can really address the issue of
the culture of banking today, by restoring trust in our banking system
with a fiduciary responsibility with respect to deposits, and a duty of
care with respect to other elements in financial activities. If we do
that, we will have performed a major service for the banking industry,
for the British economy, and for ordinary households and small firms
throughout this country. I beg to

upon a time in a muddy field in the Herefordshire area, a man who had
come back from the war bought a caravan in which he lived with his
wife. He hit upon the idea of a much more efficient process for
aerating water for soft drinks and decided to go into production. He
went from very small beginnings, with nothing more than his Army
gratuity from the war, but by 1986 he was making £19 million a
year profit and doing very nicely indeed. However, at that point his
wife found him sleeping with his secretary and thought that that was
pretty poor loyalty for nearly 40 years of dedicated support, so
divorce proceedings were instigated but by this time they had a son.
The son brought an action to prohibit his parents divorcing and
dividing his asset between them. I believe that it is the only such
action that has ever been
brought.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000149">He
won his case so they had a settlement whereby the wife went to live in
Monte Carlo, the husband stayed with the company and the son owned the
company. However, the son now decided that his father had really not
done very well with the company, although he had got it to £19
million a year, and that he could do a great deal better. So he went to
Lloyds Bank. The company had nil borrowings at that time, not a penny.
This is where I disagree with the noble Lord’s analysis, because
it is not a question of what you do with the deposits—there is
no cash being used from a bank at all here. He said, “Give me
£75 million of borrowings and I will create a much bigger and
better company out of this, in which we can all have a vast amount of
earnings”. Lloyds Bank looked at his plan and his options and
said yes. I challenge the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, on this. The first
breach in fiduciary responsibility was that the bank said yes. It was
not a question of what happened with the deposit, but a question of an
ill advised loan, because the company was quite adequate as it
was<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112754000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000150">Lloyds
gave him the £75 million and he went out and bought the plushest
factory and upgraded every bit of engineering he could to put into it.
Finally, after two years he re-opened and immediately found that he was
losing £600,000 a month, at which point Lloyds sent for me. I
found that the company was not losing £600,000 a month. It was
losing more than £1.5 million a month and at that level we would
be way out. All that the bank wanted was to get its money back. One
might say that it did not deserve to get it back—in some
respects I would agree with that—but we got it 
<?notus-xml column=1444?>back in the end because we were able to break the
business up into its various components. The splendid factory could be
sold to Mitsubishi for quite a lot of money, the business streams could
be sold for another £30 million or £40 million, and then
we discovered that the company had the most valuable crop of freshwater
springs in the Lake District of any British company. We sold it for
tens of millions of pounds and got the bank out 100%, whereupon the son
decided that he wanted to sue the bank for failure of fiduciary
responsibility for lending him the £75 million in the first
place. He said that the bank had engineered to bring the company down

is the reality behind what noble Lords are hearing about the Royal Bank
of Scotland at the present time. Banks are pressured into making bad
decisions to lend and they then take appropriate defensive action on
behalf of their shareholders and depositors. That is discharging their
fiduciary responsibility, but they have been put under pressure by
other market forces to invest in businesses which really do not know
what they are doing and when the time comes to dismantle, dismember and
unbundle them, we get the sort of consequence we have had here. This
individual failed in his action against the bank for having stolen his
company, as he put it. He is now very ill, I am sorry to say, and is
unlikely to last long in this world. His family is ruined
completely—it has lost everything. Is that a fiduciary
responsibility? Yes. The bank should have looked much more closely at
the options that were available to the business at the time and should
have looked to see what expertise was going to be brought in, and it
did not. As to whether there is a duty of care, that is a very simple

The bank has a balancing role of looking after the interests of its

across the financial services sector and I think that, in the main, the

Bill will take the process further by strengthening the regime of

Banking Standards. These rules will be specific. They will be precise.

we were to have the general duty of care or fiduciary duty as set out
in the amendment, how would that be enforced? In law a
fiduciary duty is enforced by the person to whom the duty is owed
taking action in the courts. Does the noble Lord really believe that
those people, some of the most vulnerable at the sharp end of bank
practices, are likely to pursue their bank through the courts? Instead,
the Government’s reforms have established a regulator with real
teeth, of whom the banks will genuinely be scared—indeed, I
think they are. Bolstered by a clear and binding set of banking
standards rules, which specify codes of conduct and personal
responsibility through the senior persons regime, this will mean a real
change for consumers. The noble Lord referred to the SEC introducing a
fiduciary duty in the United States. The proposed fiduciary duty in US
securities law is not comparable. The proposal, on which incidentally
the SEC itself has not yet taken any clear position, extends only
to covering activities that involve giving advice. In any
case, in the UK, when a firm provides advice to a customer, a duty of
care already exists under the general law. In that respect, the US is
simply looking to catch

sum up, attempting to add duties of care or fiduciary duties of the

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I regret that the Government seem to
have learnt nothing since Committee stage. We have heard the repetition
of high level principles of the regulator protecting customers. What
has actually happened? There have been successive scandals when
customers were not protected by the regulators and successive scandals
in which treating customers fairly was simply a

referred to a number of specific provisions. That is the great weakness
of the regulatory structure. We have simply specified conditions. As
we all know, that which is not specified is permitted. 
<?notus-xml column=1447?>The whole point of having a fiduciary responsibility and duty
of care in the terms that I set out when I moved the amendment is to
create a general responsibility that will be enforceable in law by
individuals and, indeed, by collective actions. Therefore, it seems to
me that simply saying, “We have made things better by making
them more specific and providing regulators with teeth”, is not
the same as providing protection for the individual, which is exactly
what the amendment would do. Given that the notions of fiduciary duty
and duty of care are successful in other professions, why—the
Government failed to answer this question—can they not be
successful in the banking profession? That question was not answered.
This is so important that I wish to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13112754000324" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0001.htm#13112754000324">5.08

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, in Committee, the Government proposed
that the FCA should be given competition powers, to be exercisable
concurrently with the Competition and Markets Authority, to make sure
that the FCA has the right tools to get the job done. The amendment
that we tabled to achieve this set out the scope of the FCA’s
concurrent competition powers as applying to “financial sector
activities”, defined as relating to,</hs_para>

included a delegated power that would allow the definition of
“financial services activities” to be changed in future.
It was felt that allowing this definition to be amended by order helped
to future-proof the legislation by providing the flexibility to adjust
the scope of the FCA’s competition powers should this be
warranted—for example, because some new activity that arose in
the future did not qualify as the provision of financial
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T17:23:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T17:23:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

concerns over this were raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory

unnecessary, given the breadth of the definition of “financial
sector activities”. I am grateful to the committee for its
efforts in scrutinising the Bill and the Government’s
amendments. In the light of the already very wide definition of
“financial sector activities” and the views of the
committee, the Government have decided to remove this power, along with
procedural provisions concerning its exercise, from the proposed
legislation.</hs_para>

Government have tabled another amendment to ensure that the competition
powers conferred on the FCA are capable of being exercised effectively.
One of the powers conferred on the FCA is the ability to conduct a
market study in the context of markets for the provision of financial
services. If the FCA discovers competition-related concerns, it can
refer the market for investigation by the Competition and Markets
Authority. The amendment we are discussing today serves to ensure that
a legal restriction on the FCA disclosing confidential information
would not prevent the FCA from sharing with the Competition and Markets
Authority confidential information which was relevant to a CMA market
investigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T17:24:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
The amendment would also ensure that the provisions concerning
treatment of confidential information that apply to other regulators

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 172 derives from, and is a
response to, an amendment that the Government successfully moved in
Committee, which 
<?notus-xml column=1452?>gave the PRA a secondary competition objective directly related to
issues of market structure and performance. We have developed in this
Bill, and in the previous Financial Services Bill which we also
considered in this Session, a twin-peaks approach to financial
regulation, with the Financial Conduct Authority looking at conduct of
business and the Prudential Regulation Authority looking at issues
associated with the prudential behaviour of
firms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T17:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000006">Given
that the PRA now has a competition objective, we should not allow the
twin peaks to isolate consumer representation. The FCA consumer panel
has an important role in advising on and responding to FCA proposals
with respect to conduct of business but, with the PRA now having a
competition objective, the issues which affect consumers directly will
involve the competition element of prudential regulation. It is
important, and entirely appropriate, that the PRA at least consider and
respond to representations made by the FCA’s Consumer
Panel—that is all we are asking for—so that decisions
which the PRA makes with respect to market structure and performance
have an appropriate consumer

that there is sufficient regard to consumer concerns at the PRA,
especially where there are specific issues of consumer protection that
the PRA should take into account. I welcome the recognition that it
will not require the creation of a completely new body in order to
achieve this. We need, of course, to be mindful of maintaining
flexibility on the best way for the PRA to take into account
representations from consumers and the need to avoid overly burdensome

the earlier discussions on this issue, the regulators have considered
how best to ensure consumer interests are communicated to the PRA. The
regulators have come to the view that there should be arrangements for
the FCA Consumer Panel to be able to raise concerns with the PRA, and I
believe that it is worth considering putting arrangements on a
statutory basis. We will therefore consider
coming back at Third Reading with amendments, subject to reflection on
the best way to do that without incurring unnecessary costs or burdens
for the regulators or the panel. We would be happy to discuss further
with noble Lords opposite the most effective approach to doing this. In

Archbishop of Canterbury:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment stands
in my name and in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Turnbull, Lord
Lawson and Lord McFall. The issue of leverage ratios may at first sight
be less emotionally gripping than some of the other things that we have
been discussing over the past few days, but it is central to the
recommendations made by the commission. The leverage ratios
that banks employ are a vital backstop in ensuring that they hold
adequate capital, and ensure the safety and security both of individual
banks and the industry as a
whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000012">A
remarkable lecture given by Andy Haldane of the Bank of
England sets out the necessity for this amendment. It is called <I>The
Dog and the Frisbee</I> and I warmly recommend it, not least for its
light humour. Essentially, as the Basel process has gone on through
Basel I, Basel II and Basel III, there has been an exponential increase
in the complexity of the internal 
<?notus-xml column=1454?>measurements of different categories of loan for the
amount of capital that had to be set against them. This opened the way
very effectively to banks using different internal measures and to the
inability of regulators to audit and examine adequately the ways in
which banks were setting aside capital for particular risks.</hs_para>

because it is relatively if not absolutely simple, acts as a backstop
which sets minimum levels of security and safety. The debate around a
similar amendment in Committee was rather confusing. Although, as I
have mentioned previously, I was unfortunately not able to be in the
House that day owing to other duties, I have looked at the <I>Hansard
</I>and<I> </I>concluded that the Government’s position on this
recommendation seems unclear. On the one hand, the House was told that
the amendment was not needed, as the Financial Policy Committee had the
power to set the leverage ratio; on the other, the Minister indicated
that responsibility for setting the leverage ratio would be considered
once the international levels were implemented through Basel III, which
would be some time in 2017 or 2018.</hs_para>

the commission warmly welcomes the clarity of an announcement made
yesterday that the Financial Policy Committee will conduct a review

the banking system and that it is necessary that we
move forward without delay. My commission colleagues and I
are grateful to the Government for their willingness to allow the FPC
to conduct a thorough and wide- ranging review of its
current powers and to make recommendations on further powers it needs.
We would welcome a clear statement that the review will not seek to
establish whether it is right for the FPC to request this power but
that it will have the power and the review will be about how it will
exercise
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000015">We also
welcome warmly the accelerated timetable set out in the
Government’s announcement. It is right that this power should be
available to the FPC as soon as possible and the expectation that the

need. I hope that the Minister can confirm these points. I beg to

expressed by the most reverend Primate, in particular in pointing out
the considerable confusion in the Government’s position in
Committee when they told us, on the one hand, that the FPC had this
power already and, on the other hand, that they proposed to give the
FPC the power in 2018. We were told both things at once and it was not
at all clear that the Government really knew what was happening with
respect to the development of the use of the leverage ratio as an
important element in the FPC’s

the matters have been clarified by the correspondence between the
Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England which was made
available to us yesterday. I would like to hear confirmation from the
Government that this is a case not of whether a leverage ratio will be
available to the FPC, nor of 
<?notus-xml column=1455?>whether the FPC will have that within its macroprudential toolkit, but
simply of when this power will be available—I hope that it is
sooner rather than later—and perhaps how it might be
exercised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T17:36:01"></hs_TimeCode>.

constructing a safe banking system, a number of things are taken into
account, including risk-weighted assets and other matters of that kind,
but there is no doubt that the leverage ratio is the single most
important element in having a strong and robust banking system. This
amendment is not about what number it should be. I mention en passant
that the Government say that we must not interfere with what the
Vickers committee recommended, yet when the Vickers committee
recommended a number which they did not like they disagreed with it.

review is quite unnecessary—although it will probably not do any
harm—because the issue of the leverage ratio is peculiarly
simple. Who will be responsible for setting the leverage ratio, the
Treasury or the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England? The
amendment is important because it would give the Minister the
opportunity to make a clear statement. There has been movement since
Committee. The Governor of the Bank of England, Mr Carney, gave
evidence to the Treasury Committee in another place only yesterday

of the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England. We would like

current law, three bodies are concerned with the leverage ratio: the
Treasury, the FPC and the PRA. Of course, the last two are part of the
Bank of England group. Of those three, one has the direct power to set
a minimum leverage ratio now. That is the PRA. Let me make it
absolutely clear: it can do that not just on a firm-specific basis but
on a system-wide basis. It can do that now; it has that power. It can
set the leverage ratio directly, as it did back in June, or on the
basis of a recommendation from the FPC. When I replied to the noble
Lord, Lord Turnbull, I talked about the June action of the PRA as the
killer fact; it was obviously not as emphatic as I
hoped.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000027">Under
FiSMA, the FPC has two sorts of powers. First, there is a wide power of
recommendation on any issue with regard to financial stability, which
it makes to the PRA to exercise under its powers on a “comply or
explain” basis. For that to work, the PRA must have powers to
apply rules across the whole sector, which, as I have just explained,
it does. It is envisaged that that is how most of the FPC’s
decisions will be enacted. Secondly, the FPC has a narrow set of
macro-prudential tools, which are powers to direct the PRA to act.
There are currently two powers of direction. Currently, they are a
counter-cyclical capital buffer and sectoral capital
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T17:42:08"></hs_TimeCode>.

avoidance of doubt, the Treasury plays no role here. If the PRA wants
to set a leverage ratio either under its own initiative or
under the recommendation of the FPC, it does not have to ask the
Treasury, and the Treasury has no veto. The Treasury is the
only body of the three that does not have the power or
influence to set the leverage ratio. So the debate is essentially about
how and when the Treasury grants the FPC that specific power of
direction over the PRA, rather than the PRA retaining some discretion

given progress internationally—all the transformational change
that we just discussed—there is a case for such powers being
given earlier, or specified in a different form. To settle this debate,
the Chancellor asked the governor, who is the chair of the FPC, to
review the matter and make a recommendation to him that he
could take to Parliament. The Government believe that that is the right
approach to granting the FPC additional powers of direction, for a
number of
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000031">First,
there is an existing process for the FPC being granted such powers,
established under the Financial Services Act, which many in this House
and the other place, including the chair of the PCBS, helped to design.
These are prescribed by the Treasury by order under Section 9L of the
Bank of England Act 1998. Before making an order, the Treasury must
consult the FPC and make an order in Parliament. This is subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure, so must be approved by each House of

helpful if I explained some of the technical issues which are alluded

issue to fix is: at what level should it be set, relative to
risk-weighted requirements? That is not currently settled
internationally, which is why the Basel process and the European
Banking Authority are going through a long process of review and
calibration. We envisage that the FPC would have to consider this too
for the UK and, most importantly, explain the circumstances in which
it would wish to set a higher level for UK banks, if it
believes that necessary. Secondly, if this is a macroprudential tool,
how will it operate? If the tool gives the FPC the power to direct the
PRA to vary the leverage through time, it will need to be clear under
what circumstances it would be varied and how it will interact with
other tools such as the countercyclical capital buffer, which does a
similar thing for the risk-weighting framework. Thirdly, there is the
important question of timing. The international timetable will set a
minimum in 2017-18, so there is a question for the FPC as to what the
right timetable is for the UK and how it should get
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000034">These

Flight</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, I have one
issue to raise with the Minister. The competitive objective,
as I understand it, applies equally to the PRA as to the FCA. As noble
Lords may be aware, one of the immediate issues is that the capital
requirements for banks of different sizes are
dramatically different, such that a small bank’s
capital requirement for certain forms of mortgage lending is
about 30 times the capital requirement for 
<?notus-xml column=1460?>one of the established clearing banks. The PRA has
enthusiastically welcomed changing those arrangements and taking up the
challenge to create a more competitive environment, but when I recently
asked why the huge difference in capital requirements relating to
mortgages had not been addressed, I was told that the PRA could not
move until it was able to get agreement from the EU. I am not sure
whether that is correct, but it is quite important to know whether
meeting the competition objective is not just a question of having our
own powers to do it but that EU requirements impinge upon
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000043"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="13112763000284" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000284"><B>Lord

Turnbull:</Member></B> This amendment is about the future structure of
the Regulatory Decisions Committee. This is avowedly a placeholder
amendment to allow further discussion. The commission originally
proposed that the RDC should be given statutory autonomy within the FCA
and that that new regulatory structure should be reviewed by 2018. On
further reflection, my commission colleagues and I put forward a rather
different proposition, which is that there should be a wider review but
there is no reason why it should not start as soon as
maybe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000046">There
are a number of reasons why a wider review is justified. The first is
obvious. Although we now have two regulators rather than one—the
PRA and the FCA—events where enforcement is justified can arise
from either of these domains and enforcement action taken by one could
help or hinder the work of the other. The enforcement division and the
RDC are embedded in the FCA, and it raises the question of whether the
RDC should be placed, in a sense, more equidistant between the
two.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000047">The
second reason for raising this question is that, in banking at least,
enforcement decisions could be taking on a greater significance than in
the past. Indeed, the past has been characterised by a
surprising absence of enforcement, at least in relation to the events
of the financial crisis. There have been some major enforcement
decisions and some colossal fines around conduct, but virtually none in
relation to events leading up to the financial crash. This therefore
raises the question as to whether the RDC needs to be upgraded in terms
of its chairmanship and membership so that it is capable of handling
bigger and more important
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T17:54:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000048">The
third reason is that, in response to a regulatory infraction or lapse,
there is a balance to be struck between using enforcement as an
instrument and the supervisory instrument. We should not get into the
mode of thinking that enforcement is always the first and best
recourse. Supervisors may take the view that a case is better handled
by what elsewhere might be called “special measures”,
such as seeing that the people who are responsible for the poor
behaviour and decisions are moved on, and possibly even sacked; or by
getting new people in; or by securing undertakings from management
about future conduct. Often, this can produce a quicker and more
effective result, whereas recourse to enforcement can cut across this
so that instead of a bank immediately getting into a constructive
dialogue about what to do next, it begins to dig in and wait for a
long, drawn-out
litigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T17:56:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000049">We
therefore need to ensure that, in any particular case, the
full range of options has been considered and that the interests of
other regulators have been taken into account. In
other words, the RDC should only receive a case 
<?notus-xml column=1462?>after that balancing process has taken
place. It would be helpful if the RDC was able to
question whether all the options and possible responses have
been
explored<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T17:56:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000050">The
fourth reason is that, in many walks of life, there has been a trend
which continues to this day of greater separation between those
investigating a case, those who decide whether a prosecution should be
undertaken and those who reach a verdict. You could go back to the
creation of the Crown Prosecution Service more than two decades ago,
and you can see this in a number of professional bodies covering
medicine, solicitors and accounting. The hot topic of the moment is the
Independent Police Complaints Commission. There is a perception that
the RDC is not as independent of enforcement as it could be. It is
co-located. It is part of the FCA. Would we be able to achieve both

the RDC has to ensure that before any accusation is made in a decision
notice that enforcement has been properly researched, the accused has
been given a proper chance to put their case, and the case has been
gone into thoroughly. This is of particular relevance to smaller
practitioners who can be severely damaged by accusations and are not
able to clear their name until maybe years later. Unlike big firms,
such businesses, such as IFAs, can find that they clear their name but
there is no business left to go back to. All this indicates to me that
there is more than enough material on which to base a review and no
reason to delay that until 2018, which was included in the earlier
amendment. Rather than attempt to legislate now in a process that does
not allow proper consultation with practitioners, and which would be
confined only to banks, I argue that we should have a wider review. I
hope that between now and Third Reading we can have further discussions

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I was a member of the original
regulatory decisions committee at the Financial Services Authority,
which noble Lords may remember was set up after FiSMA ran head first
into the human rights legislation because the regulator was in many
cases judge and jury. The RDC was set up as a filter, to be an
independent assessor of regulatory decisions by the various divisions
of the FSA and to stand as a relatively simple procedure prior to the
final stage of going to a tribunal if agreement could not be reached
between the regulator and the regulated
person<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:00:02"></hs_TimeCode>. In that

for two reasons. First, there was considerable confusion over its
independence. The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, has, in this amendment,
quite rightly emphasised that the RDC should be independent of the
various regulatory authorities. The second reason it did not work very
well is, unfortunately, contained within the amendment, which

on the old RDC, caused us a lot of difficulty. Many of the cases which
were quite complicated, with respect to financial services, took a long
time because people who were very bright and committed but who had had
no previous connection with the industry took a long time to get up to
speed on the relevant issues that were considered. That condition in
the old RDC arose because the FSA was succeeding the self-regulatory
organisations. Therefore that was an overreaction to the role of the
self-regulatory organisations such as the Securities and Futures
Authority, which I also had the honour to serve on. That was abolished
at that time and the reaction was, “Let’s have people
from outside the industry in this particular

the idea of an independent RDC is a good one. That would avoid some of
the very great expense of going to tribunal, where there might be
disagreements, and it would also have the great advantage, which the

various regulators in any particular case. Of course, that was not

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> I will try to be brief; I hope that the
Government can readily accept this. This amendment concerns the need to
have regular meetings between the bank’s supervisors and its
auditors. I use the old-fashioned word “supervisors”
rather than “regulators” because it gives a more accurate
picture. I was very glad that the new Governor of the Bank of England,
in his recent speech at some <I>Financial Times</I> junket or
other—a very good speech indeed—referred throughout to
“banking supervision”, which is a more accurate,
old-fashioned term. It is important that there should be this regular
dialogue. I will briefly go back a little into the history of
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:05:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000060">When
I was Chancellor in the 1980s, I was very concerned to discover that
there was no discussion between the auditors and the supervisors of
banks—which was the Bank of England at that time, as it is now.
I looked into it and discovered that it was because they were prevented
from doing so. Under their duty of confidentiality to their client, the
auditors were not able to speak to anybody about any concerns they
might have had about what was going on in a particular bank. It applied
to other clients, but the important thing was that it applied to the
banks. Therefore, when I greatly strengthened banking supervision in
what became the Banking Act 1987, I included legislation to remove that
legal barrier. In introducing that I made it quite clear that I
expected as a result that there would be a regular dialogue between the
banking supervisors and the bank’s auditors so that each could
compare notes about concerns they might have had about a particular
bank<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:07:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000061">I
now regret that that was not in the Bill, but it was a clear
expectation, stated from the Dispatch Box. These meetings took place
for a number of years. Then, as time went on, fewer and fewer of them
took place. In the run-up to the terrible crisis of 2008 it was
significant—the Economic Affairs Committee of your
Lordships’ House took evidence about this—that the
meetings had virtually ceased. They did not happen at all,
which was a huge mistake. Therefore the Economic Affairs
Committee of your Lordships’ House recommended that there should
be a mandatory requirement for those meetings to take place. That is
all the more important with banks because with other businesses the
auditor can qualify the bank’s accounts if it has a concern
which the board of the client does not address. That is a signal that
everybody can see. However, no auditor ever qualifies a bank’s
accounts, and for a very good reason—because it would lead to a
run on the bank. That is all the more reason for this dialogue to

resisted having that on the statute book. As noble Lords will know,
once bitten, twice shy. We have been through this before: although we
had all the good intentions, it was not on the statute book, and
eventually it did not happen. Therefore, I say to the Minister, the
Government have agreed that this should happen, and I cannot see any
reason why it should not be in the Bill. Furthermore, from the history

McFall of Alcluith (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, as a fellow member of
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, I support the
amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson. The lack of a
relationship with auditors is something that I have noticed since the
beginning of the financial crisis. Indeed, at that time regulators told
me that, when deciding what regulation banks should be subject to, they
sent their less experienced regulators to the smaller banks and their
more experienced regulators to the larger ones. By the way, when the
regulators go to the larger banks they are sometimes taught by the
people working in them because the quality is higher there. So the
relationship between the regulators and the auditors is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:12:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000064">Martin
Wheatley, who is now chairman of the FCA, is on record as saying that
the FSA never looked at banks’ business models. In other words,
it did not look at the profit and loss element of banks because it felt
that it was none of its business. If the FCA is now to adopt the new
policy of looking at business models, which tell you everything about a
company, then the auditor is going to have a central role to play. I
know that the audit profession has been rather taken aback by the
criticism of the Treasury Committee and the Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards, which posed the question, “What is an
audit?”. The profession will have to do an awful lot of work on
that because it has largely believed that audits cover something that
has occurred in the past and not something that will happen in the
future. It has not taken high-risk, low-probability strategies or
low-risk, high-probability strategies into consideration. Auditors are
in the unique position of looking at the business model and so can
assist banks in having a forward look at that. They can also help
regulators to understand what a business model is about. As the noble
Lord, Lord Lawson, said, this measure was not put on the statute book
previously and therefore lapsed by default. In the interests of being
constructive on this issue and wanting to ensure that we have auditors
who keep bank executives on their toes, I agree wholeheartedly with the

mandate the regulators to meet the auditors of all the banks they
supervise at least twice a year. Strengthening the quality of
engagement between auditors and supervisors is an objective that the
Government share. I think that there is absolutely no disagreement
between us about how important that is and how it has not always worked
well in the past. I listened to the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord
Lawson, that voluntary commitments for regulators and auditors to meet
regularly could easily fall into abeyance. However, some lessons have
been learnt from the financial crisis, and the Government have taken
meaningful steps to ensure that the new regulator does not slip into

sets out in detail the principles governing the relationship between
the regulators and bank auditors and must be laid before Parliament
whenever it is changed. This change to the law has greatly improved the
regulators’ engagement with auditors since the crisis, so the
Government have taken action here. The Government believe that the
action they have taken in this respect is in line with changes to

of the criticisms of the old FSA was that its approach did not focus on
the most significant issues and too much resource was taken up by
inflexible processes. Operationally, this new legal framework forces
regulators to be more diligent and allows them to be held accountable.
The essential strength of the new legal framework is that it demands
diligence from the regulators through parliamentary review and
encourages proportionality by allowing them to specify where they will
focus their resources. The result has been that the PRA will meet with
firms which have the potential to cause major economic disruption in
the case of failure at least three to four times per year. The FCA will
meet with the auditors of those firms at least twice a year. This is
exactly what we want—prioritised, high-quality engagement where
it
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000069">The
Government therefore remain unconvinced of the value of changing the
frequency of this dialogue in statute without some reference to
proportionality. Two meetings a year with the auditors of important
firms is too little, while the same number for very small firms may be
too many. The Government favour the current legal framework with its

Deighton:</Member></B> I was just getting to that. The Government
believe that there is a superior approach to strengthening the law in
this area by clarifying the requirements on regulators to meet auditors
enough times to accomplish their objectives. I think we agree that the
periodicity should not be the constraint, although perhaps we could
deal with that by a requirement to disclose the frequency of meetings
with certain types of firm to ensure accountability. Such an approach
would, in the view of the Government, be superior and retain
proportionality and the judgment-based approach while increasing
accountability. If the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment I will be

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> This is one of the most important matters
that we will have to decide, not merely to make the banking system
safer but to address the cultural problem. Proprietary trading is, as
noble Lords will be aware, trading which a bank does entirely on its
own behalf. There is no client at all. It is the 
<?notus-xml column=1469?>furthest from the culture that we expect of banking, which is a culture
of prudence and of servicing clients. Here, there is no client and we
know from experience that, far from there being a culture of prudence,
proprietary trading tends to be of a highly speculative and gambling
nature.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112763000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000078">It
has also, incidentally, been connected with some of the greatest
scandals. The LIBOR scandal, for example, was a proprietary trading
scandal. Even when there is not a scandal, even when it is perfectly
reasonable—I have nothing against speculation as such—in
my judgment it is alien to what the banking culture should be.
Speculation should be left to the hedge funds. It is a hedge fund
activity par excellence and it should not be conducted by
banks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:21:46"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
my view. The view of the commission was slightly different. It was
that, while that is probably so, there are practical difficulties and
therefore there needs to be a full-scale review a few years hence to
see how this is working.</hs_para>

course, there is very little proprietary trading going on in this
country. Before the great crash of 2008, the amount of proprietary
trading that some banks were doing accounted for more than 30% of their
total business; it was as big as that. It has now disappeared, but it
will almost certainly come back. Incidentally, when we had this debate
in Committee my noble friend Lord Deighton said that there was no need
to do anything now because there was no proprietary trading going on.
With the greatest respect, he missed the point. We are saying that we
should review this a few years hence when there may well be something
going on. In fact, there almost certainly will be something going on.
We are not legislating just for the here and now, but for the medium
term and, so far as we can, for the long
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:23:04"></hs_TimeCode>. There will

is one other thing that the review will be able to do. My good friend
Paul Volcker, a very distinguished former chairman of the Federal
Reserve in the United States, has been largely responsible for
introducing what is known as the Volcker rule in the United States,
which attempts to ban proprietary trading. Their system of legislation
is so appalling that the rule has got encrusted with myriad barnacles
which may make it less effective, but, nevertheless, the clear
intention was to ban proprietary trading. He is a very wise observer of
the banking scene over many years and he understands full well the
practical and cultural problems that derive from banks engaging in
proprietary
trading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:24:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000081">A
review a few years hence will be able to take account not merely of
what is happening in the banking world in England at the time but will
be able to see how the Volcker rule has worked in practical terms in

can learn from their experience. Therefore, I urge my noble friend, who
made a remark yesterday, almost en passant, about proprietary
trading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:24:09"></hs_TimeCode> when we

effect of this amendment. I hope that it may result in us taking a
proper look at high-frequency trading, which seems to me to be pretty
close to theft, organised on behalf of stock exchanges at the expense
of the rest of us in mutual funds and pensions. It seems extraordinary
that we allow a certain group of investors privileged access to the
stream of information coming out of an exchange, and allow them
advantages over real investors. Real investors invest in real funds for
long-term real return, performing the function of the market in terms
of the allocation of capital and giving people an opportunity to invest
their money at risk for return in order to enable them to live in
retirement and to prosper from giving other people the use of their
money. These are important functions of the market and high-frequency
trading seems to me to be parasitical on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000083">I have

traders. I think that that is an aspect of proprietary trading to which

Cohen of Pimlico:</Member></hs_speaker> I support the amendment. Most
of what we are legislating to do is prevent banks doing terrible things
to customers. Proprietary trading allows banks to do terrible things to
themselves. They are no good at controlling it. The real horrors and
the things that, more importantly, threaten the financial system are
banks getting proprietary trading horribly wrong. There are examples of
distinguished banks coming completely unglued in this. Deutsche Bank,
UBS and Morgan Stanley all spring to mind. They seem to have a
completely uncontrollable Wild West operation—and if the owners
of the operation cannot control it, is it not a serious risk to the
financial system and something that, as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson,
suggested, should not be taking place inside a

everything is moving so fast, and that traders have the capacity to use

about high-frequency trading. I suspect that in three years’

none of us has even dreamt of. It is very important that this is

Deighton:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, the PCBS did express concern,
very understandably, despite the fact that proprietary trading is not
as big a part of the current challenge as it perhaps was and perhaps
will be. The concern is—just to show that I have grasped the
point—that it will come back and become a major risk 
<?notus-xml column=1471?>in the future. Therefore, the PCBS tabled an amendment that proposed two
reviews. The first is a requirement on the regulator to review the
steps it has taken to bear down on proprietary trading, and the
difficulties it has encountered. The second, following such a review,
would be a review commissioned by the Government into the issue, and
into the case for changing the
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000087">I
reassure noble Lords that at present we have a robust set of safeguards
to deal with risks from proprietary trading. Indeed, as Andrew Bailey
made clear in his response to the PCBS, the PRA thinks that it
currently has the appropriate powers and tools to address risks from
proprietary trading where it endangers the safety and soundness of a
firm. The PRA continually monitors and reviews all risks that banks
take, including those from proprietary trading, and it uses the capital
regime to make these risks

regulator, the FCA, has a similarly wide range of tools, including
sanctions, to ensure that banks adhere to a high standard of conduct in
their business. Finally, ring-fenced banks, which are at the heart of
this new legislation, will already be banned from any proprietary
trading, further shielding them from any risks to which it might give
rise. Therefore, the Government do not believe that there is a case for
reviewing a ban on proprietary trading so shortly after these reviews
and before ring-fencing has been put in
place.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13112763000262" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000262">6.30

while the regulators are currently equipped to deal with risks if and
when they arise, it seems only reasonable that these arrangements

approach recommended by the PCBS on this is the right one. First, it
should be for the PRA and FCA to review the situation, assess their
powers and recommend further action to the Government. However, it also
seems right that we review this matter once ring-fencing is in place
and its effects have been analysed. It would therefore make sense for

it feels equipped to deal with any risks from proprietary trading that

right tools, the Treasury will conduct a review of proprietary trading
and its impacts, including on ring-fenced banks. That review of course

This is about whether there should be a statutory basis for the
existing remuneration code. One can analyse this at three levels.
First, does the current code permit the kind of actions that the
parliamentary commission recommended, such as longer deferrals where
the nature of the risk justifies it, and more extensive clawback?
Secondly, will those powers be used more rigorously than they have been
in the past, particularly for banks? Thirdly, is giving statutory
backing through the Bill necessary in order to ensure the correct

government amendments on CMCs, it is clear that bad practice by certain
claims management companies operating in the financial services sector
has created poor outcomes for both consumers and businesses. As the
scale of potential claims for PPI compensation has become clear, CMCs
have become particularly active in this market. Unfortunately, this
increase in activity has in some cases been accompanied by an
unacceptable fall in standards. CMCs have a legitimate role to play in
helping consumers claim compensation. However, a minority have been
acting irresponsibly. Some CMCs submitted illegitimate claims which
clog up the system. This poor behaviour has led to delays in receiving
compensation for consumers who have legitimate claims and has increased
costs for defendant financial services firms where claims are
unsubstantiated. This issue is most prevalent in, but not limited to,
the financial services sector and the PPI claims market in particular.
Despite the threat of the suspension or cancellation of authorisation,
some CMCs act speculatively which can impose unnecessary costs on
defendant businesses and ultimately on
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:42:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000108">These
amendments enable the Secretary of State to make regulations giving the
claims management regulator the power to impose financial penalties on
those CMCs 
<?notus-xml column=1477?>guilty of misconduct, which will lead to tighter regulation of the
industry and better outcomes for consumers and businesses. They also
make a number of consequential amendments, ensuring that the provisions
of the Bill on secondary legislation, including the power to make
incidental or transitional provision, are extended to apply to the
Secretary of State as well as the Treasury; that the commencement power
applies to these provisions; and that providers of claims management

the claims management regulator’s enforcement toolkit by giving
it a power to fine those engaged in malpractice provides an additional
means to deter speculative activity. Further, a power to fine could
serve as a useful alternative penalty in cases where it can be
disproportionate to vary, suspend or cancel the authorisation of a CMC
despite it not being compliant. Where a CMC’s authorisation is
suspended or cancelled, for example, it can no longer act on behalf of
its clients and this can lead to further consumer detriment. We can
ensure that these CMCs go on to work in the best interests of consumers
by making sure that they adhere to the codes of practice and <I>Conduct
of Authorised Persons Rule</I><I>s</I> issued by the claims management
regulator. These rules require CMCs to conduct themselves with honesty
and integrity, including requirements to not make speculative claims,
to not use misleading advertising, and to not partake in high-pressure
selling. I apologise for that stream of split infinitives.</hs_para>

turn now to the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,

CMCs. The Government are in full agreement with the

Hayter of Kentish Town (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, first, I welcome
the government amendments within this group. As the Minister said, this
is undoubtedly a useful addition to the regulator’s toolkit.
However, although I am of course delighted that the spirit of my
amendment is acknowledged, we cannot wait any longer for this. The
Legal Services Act 2007 envisaged that complaints against claims
management firms would be able to go to the legal services ombudsman.
That was widely welcomed by <I>Which?</I> and everybody else. We know
that in August last year the Government made the formal announcement
that complaints by consumers against claims management firms would be
able to go to the legal services ombudsman. That was agreed on both
sides of the House and was warmly welcomed by
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000113">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:47:43"></hs_TimeCode>,
that was in August last year. Since then we keep hearing,
“Don’t worry about it, don’t worry about
it”. I have raised this issue in other Bills and there was an
exchange of correspondence between me and the noble Lord, Lord McNally,
about the importance of getting this done. Nothing happened—the
last letter was in November. I should explain briefly to the House that
the absolute desire is that these complaints should go to the legal
services ombudsman. The Legal Services Act only enables that procedure
to take money from barristers and not from claims management firms to
pay for the ombudsman. Of course, because the regulator is the MoJ,
that is a form of taxation so the only thing stopping this happening is
the technicality of how we fund
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:48:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000114">That
was accepted by the Government but they did not seem to come up with a
vehicle to do this. I offered to do it for them via a Private
Member’s Bill. That was prepared with the help of <I>Which?</I>,
particularly Mark McLaren who did a lot of work on drafting that
Private Member’s Bill, which we then offered as the vehicle to
solve this. Nothing happened to that, although it was not declined
until 12 November when the Government laid these
amendments—which we were not expecting. The amendments are very
welcome but do not solve the problem for two reasons: first, they do
not allow consumers to get redress; and secondly, they therefore
preclude the intelligence that would come from complaints. Frankly,
people complain against something only if they have a chance of
compensation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:49:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000115">Although
the Government say that they will look at this, that is what they have
said continuously since August last year. That being the case, we will

matter back by Third Reading. Perhaps they could clarify whether that
will be at some time in the future—which basically means another
couple of years—or whether they are willing to do it by Third

Brennan:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment raises an issue of
parliamentary importance well beyond the scope of the Bill. Clause 124
is a Henry VIII clause. Its contents involve the usual provision to
make consequential amendments following the enactment of the Bill. My
amendment is expressly related to the additional power the clause gives
to amend subsequent legislation passed in this House in the same
Session as the present
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:52:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment to that particular subsection, it should not be understood
that I approve of the use of Henry VIII clauses. They are often the
result of a bureaucratic, slipshod approach, whereas years ago statutes
in draft form were dealt with with great care. The more such clauses
are introduced, the more will be eroded the parliamentary sovereignty
that is exercised over primary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:52:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112763000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112763000119">Subsection
(b) contains the power to amend future legislation in this Session of
Parliament. In Committee, I invited the Government to explain the
necessity for this and to note that it was most unusual. In fact, I
have been able to identify only one statute where this phraseology has
been used—the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, a
Treasury Bill. Please note the difference. You can amend an existing
statute under a Henry VIII clause if it is passed, whether it is as a
consequence of this Bill or some Bill that has become an Act in the
past. However, we are talking about this Bill giving a power for
subordinate legislation to amend future legislation. That is an
extraordinary power for Parliament to seek to give, no matter how often
it is declared that it is only for consequential
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:54:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that I can find and occurred in circumstances which are extremely
concerning. The amendment deals with a clause that was introduced in
Committee. It was not considered by the Delegated Powers Committee
because it came subsequent to that committee’s report, and it
was not considered by the Constitution Committee, both of which would
normally consider and report on a Henry VIII clause. The Government
would then respond to that report and the committee would reply. That
process fulfils what the Constitution Committee’s report on the
Public Bodies Bill in 2010 said should occur in respect of these
clauses—they should be clearly limited, exercisable only for
specific purposes and subject to adequate parliamentary scrutiny. That
does not mean only on the Floor of the Chamber: it is the
committee’s report, the Government’s response and that
then informing this Chamber as to whether the Henry VIII power is
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T18:55:51"></hs_TimeCode>.

noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge—who now sits on the Cross

potential injustice, as well as a lack of parliamentary sovereignty.
However, he did not have in mind a Henry VIII clause that allowed
amendment of future legislation. Is this academic? No, it is not.
Within the present Bill and the Government’s commentary on the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standard’s report, I
identified to the committee three issues which the Government were
continuing to consider, each of which would require legislation if they
introduced a change in respect of any one of the three. This could

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Brennan
in his attempt to remove subsection (2)(b) from Clause 124.
As he has clearly told the House, it would enable secondary legislation
to amend future Acts prior to the end of the Session—not this
Act, but other enactments. This is an extraordinary power which was
justified in Committee by using the argument that there are precedents.
No precedents have been produced. It is shocking that the promise of a
letter made over five weeks ago has not actually been kept on something
which raised considerable concern in Committee. I think that the
Government need to take this matter very seriously indeed and not palm
it off with what seem to be entirely unsubstantiated stories of
precedence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:00:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I understand the concerns expressed by
the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, and I assure him again that there is
nothing unusual about the form of the power to make consequential
amendments in Clause 124, and in particular, subsection (2)(b) does not
extend the power unreasonably. My memory of exactly what I have written
to whom, given that I have written to quite a number of people, is
slightly hazy. I think I may have referred to this issue in what was a
sort of portmanteau letter to the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. It covered
a whole raft of issues that had been raised not only by him but by
other noble Lords. If I did not do so, I apologise to the noble Lord,
Lord Brennan. However, in what I am about to say, I think that I can
deal with the main point that he

would limit the power to make consequential amendments to Acts which
are passed before the passing of this Act. That can produce
unpredictable results depending on the progress of Bills and the dates
on which they happen to reach Royal Assent. For this reason,
powers to make consequential amendments to existing legislation often
refer to Acts which are passed in the same Session as the Act in
question. Noble Lords have asked for examples of this, and I can give
them several. Such powers can be found in Section 51 of the
Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, Section 237 of the
Planning Act 2008, Section 28 of the Welfare Reform Act 2007 and
Section 118 of the Financial Services Act 2012—the provision on
which Clause 124 was modelled.</hs_para>

Bills of the same Session are likely to have been prepared by reference
to the existing law at the beginning of the Session, while the Bills of
the next Session would have to take account of the change in the law
produced by the Act in question. Where a Bill is amended significantly
in its passage through the second House, it is particularly unlikely
that Bills passed or made in the same Session will have taken account
of all the provisions of the new Bill. That clearly applies in this
case, as your Lordships know. The need to implement the recommendations
of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards has required very
extensive amendments to the Bill in this House, and therefore it will
not have been possible for the Bills which are being considered by
Parliament in this Session to have taken full account of all the
changes in the law which will be made by this Bill. Nor has there been
time for the Government to consider all the Bills currently before the
House to see if any consequential amendments may be required, or to
follow all the amendments being proposed to these Bills. We have not,
for example, had the opportunity to review the Pensions Bill, which may
have provisions relevant to the subject matter of this Bill, or the
Immigration Bill, which has some provisions on banking.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:03:39"></hs_TimeCode> cannot rule
out the possibility that it may be necessary for the Government to make
consequential amendments to them.</hs_para>

am pleased to announce that the Government are committing a further
£640 million in funding to the post office network for three
years, 2015-16 up to 2017-18. This enables the Post Office to complete
its network transformation programme and to protect and invest in those

committed £1.34 billion to maintain a national post office
network, modernise branches and safeguard the future of post offices
which play a vital role in urban deprived and rural areas. Since then,
the post office network has been at its most stable level in over 20
years, in stark contrast to 7,000 closures under the previous
Government. This Government remain fully committed to maintaining a
network of at least 11,500 post offices, fully compliant with our
access criteria, and with a sustainable long-term future. To achieve
this, the post office network must meet the changing needs of customers
through longer opening hours and more modern premises which are easier
and faster to
use.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000004">Already
more than 1,400 communities have benefited from government investment
into their post offices, with a total of 34,000 extra opening hours per
week across the network. A further 830 post offices are also signed up
to change to the new main or local operating models. In total, this
represents nearly one in five of our post offices, and most honourable
Members have one or more modernised branches in their constituencies.

Office in conjunction with the National Federation of SubPostmasters,

Government do not underestimate the challenges facing the network, the
Post Office centrally and, in particular, individual sub-postmasters.
In recent years, the retail environment on the high street and more
widely has been far from easy for sub-postmasters, and this new
investment recognises that reality. The network needs to build on its
core strengths of unparalleled national reach and the trust and high
regard in which it is rightly held by customers. It must focus on
meeting customers’ needs and expectations in a rapidly changing,
highly competitive retail market. Ease of access, longer opening hours,
shorter queues and modern premises are key to winning new clients and
attracting and retaining
customers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000007">With
more than 1,400 branches modernised to date, independent research is
showing customer satisfaction levels with the new models averaging over
95%. Satisfaction levels among sub-postmasters operating the new models
are similarly impressive, at around

many locations, new operating models are enabling post offices to be
re-established after a significant break in service. At Balnamore in
North Antrim, a new local branch opened in August, re-establishing post
office services some five years after the closure of the previous
branch. The new branch opens seven days a week for a total of 92 hours.
At Oxenhope in West Yorkshire, with no post office since June 2011, a
new local branch opened in the Co-op now offers post 
<?notus-xml column=1485?>office services from 7 am to 10 pm seven days a
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:10:48"></hs_TimeCode>. But it is
not just about new post office operating models. The post office
network is incredibly diverse, and it is just as important to customers
in remote rural areas that their post office stays open, as it is for
busy town centre branches to be open for longer.</hs_para>

post offices for which the new main or local models are not suitable.
These branches predominantly serve small, often remote, communities and
may be the last shop in the village. They are hugely valuable to their
communities. The updated network transformation programme provides, for
the first time in Post Office history, a £20 million investment
fund allocated specifically to this part of the network. This fund will

investments being made by the Post Office are already creating a strong
platform from which it can compete for new work from government and the
private sector. Some customers and sub-postmasters have expressed
understandable concerns about continued access to Post Office card
accounts beyond 2015, when the current contract is due to expire. The
Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office are in discussion
about a long-term successor to the Post Office card account, and I can
confirm today that all options under consideration conclude that access
to pensions and benefits will continue beyond March 2015
across the whole post office network of at least 11,500
branches.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000011">However,
the Post Office is also doing much more for government. Over the past
two years, the Post Office has won every single government contract it
has bid for. It is winning this work competitively, and
winning it because it is such a strong partner for government. And
there is even more that the Post Office can do for government in the
future. For example, under the existing contract with the Passport
Office, the Post Office is discussing the introduction of new in-branch
services which would allow the majority of customers to apply for their
passports digitally, without the need for any supporting paper forms.
The intention is to introduce these services from the middle of
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:13:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000012">Recently,
the Department for Energy and Climate Change announced that it will
work with the Post Office to signpost elderly and vulnerable people to
the 500 volunteers being trained by the Big Energy Saving Network to
help people find ways to cut their bills. These innovations demonstrate
a forward-thinking Post Office, introducing new services, growing new
revenue streams and bringing new customers into post office branches.
With the additional funding in place, we have the basis for building a
thriving and sustainable Post
Office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000013">I
believe that in the next few years, we will see the Post Office
continuing to grow its business, and its network flourish and
potentially expand in due course. Creating a financially sustainable

Significant progress has been made by the Post Office and its
stakeholders already and this will be boosted by the funding committed
by the Government today.

Young of Norwood Green (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the

our local communities and the social fabric of the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:14:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, the job of a sub-postmaster has become much more
difficult in recent years. Research from the National Federation of
SubPostmasters shows that incomes are falling and many work very long
hours for very little
return<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:15:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000015">That
situation has not been assisted by the Government, who in 2010
announced plans to use post offices as the “front office for
government”. The Government have failed to deliver on that
pledge. No new major government services have been awarded to post
offices since May 2010. Indeed, the National Federation of
SubPostmasters has said that the few new services which have been
introduced are one-off transactions available only in a small number of
post offices and many services do not make the post office any revenues
at all. This resulted in the National Federation of SubPostmasters
removing its support for the Postal Services Act. The Government
promised £466 million of government work, but the post offices
are currently gaining only £130 million from government
business. That failure has resulted in the post office network being
under more pressure than ever
before.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000016">On top
of this failure is the abject failure of the network transformation
programme as planned. Consumer Futures wrote to the BIS Select
Committee just last month showing that only 1,100 have converted to the
new models, and the Government require 6,000 by 2015. It shows that the
programme is not working, and that is why a degree of compulsion has
been
introduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:16:28"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:16:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000017">We
can firmly say that today's announcement of additional funding of
£200 million on top of the £420 million
already trailed beyond 2015 is a vote of no confidence in what this
Government are doing to the network. In effect, the Government are
increasing the compensation for people to leave and offering more money
to convert. Of this, £23 million is for completing a retail
survey in order to determine who should be compulsorily converted or
removed from the
network<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:17:00"></hs_TimeCode>. If they
had delivered on their “front office for

true that the National Federation of SubPostmasters voted to approve
this yesterday, as most operators feel that the traditional post office

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> First, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Young of Norwood Green, for his response and agree with his tribute to
the sub-postmasters. As he alluded to, they do a sterling job around
the country, often in quite difficult environments, and I pay tribute
to them for all the work that they do and all the hours that they put
in. I also agree with the noble Lord when he said, I think, that
sub-postmasters have had quite a difficult few years. The past two or
three years have been pretty tricky for everyone, particularly in the
retail sector, and sub-postmasters have been no exception in terms of
the post offices that they

it is not true to say that no new government services have been won. I
can provide evidence that many contracts have been won, including some
government contracts, and am very happy to furnish him with that
information. The past two years, since 2010, have been, in effect, a
success story in terms of the number of new government contracts won,
which is a great testament to the work that the Post Office has

noble Lord also raised the issue of the new model. The £1.34
billion that was announced back in 2010 was of course designed to see
the Post Office through the next few years, up to 2015, with the
objective of renovating 6,000 branches. The noble 
<?notus-xml column=1488?>Lord, I think, agreed that more than 2,000 branches—it is in fact
2,250—have pledged to go forward with renovation. Already, 1,400
have been renovated and those post offices have proved their worth in
terms of customer
satisfaction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:22:05"></hs_TimeCode>. He
made the point that the money to cover all 6,000 had not been spent,
but it is a rolling programme—the extra £640 million is
designed to take us further forward, for the period from 2015 to 2018,
and to extend the 6,000 to 8,000. It is an extremely good success story
and testament to the fact that the money that we spent in 2010 has been

noble Lord said that more than 7,000 branches were closed by the
previous Government, which is true. He said that it was because of the
need to create stability, but there was a huge cost to doing it. We are
now at the stage where we can say that we have created much more
stability for the Post Office. It has never been more stable, and it is
certainly more stable than during the previous

back in 2010, that there would be no office closures, a point I will

than 20 years ago, I was in the Minister’s position speaking for
the Post Office in your Lordships’ House. At the time, I
wondered why sub-postmasters, in particular, were not allowed to hold
passport forms, so I welcome this half-change that the Government have
made in considering allowing the Post Office to digitise the passport
application forms for customers. However, of course, in this day and
age, many of us think too much in terms of computers. A vast number of
people in this country would not dream of either owning a computer or
using somebody else’s computer—for example, the post
office’s. Therefore I maintain my plea from all that time ago
that the post office, sub-postmasters particularly, be allowed to both
issue and receive completed paper passport forms. In my view, that is
long overdue.</hs_para>

like to say is that of course it is not only for the Government to
produce services for the Post Office to offer. For example, you can go

is an arrangement with the banks. If I wanted some Argentinean pesos,
they would probably take only three days to arrive. There are all sorts
of other non-government services that the Post Office should or could
be able to provide. I hope

they can best make their post offices pay and offer the best possible
range of services to customers. These extra activities could include
the opportunity to get online and go on to a computer, and even perhaps
introducing some coffee shops into post offices—who

that those who wish to renew passports will be able to do so, primarily

or some stamps. These issues have been well thought out. Bearing in

of the outer islands. There is no reason why this clarification should
be deferred until the feasibility study has reported, as the

think that it was in early 1982, when I was a Minister of State at the

the Indian Ocean, that I paid my first visit to Mauritius. When we
landed, we were the only aeroplane at the airport. I came down the
steps and the high commissioner whisked me away. At that point, I
noticed that there were some 2,000 people at the airport. I expressed
surprise that for one aeroplane there should be 2,000 people and I
asked him why they were there. He said, “That’s a
demonstration”. I said, “A demonstration against
whom?” He said, “A demonstration against you”. So
I said, “Look, if there’s a demonstration, the important
thing is to meet the leaders. Please lay on the demonstration again and
ask them to demonstrate
again”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000065">They

going back two, three and even four generations, was a really black

regret that, because I decided with the noble Lord, Lord

critical factor is that, under the 1966 exchange of letters between the
United States and the United Kingdom on Diego Garcia and the British
Indian Ocean Territory, the idea was that after the completion of 50
years, renewal for another 20 years from 2016 would be considered. This
is the critical factor in why decisions need to be taken speedily.
There would not be adequate time between the summer of 2015 and the
renewal, if there is to be one, in Diego Garcia in 2016, for a new

should like to mention three aspects of this that are relevant to the
timing. First, there is the feasibility study, which is admirably
broad-ranging. It is imaginative and takes into account every facet of
the issue, looking at all the options, costs, environmental issues,
employment, political and economic issues, the fishing
problem—which is very important to the
Chagossians—ecotourism, and so on. Against that background, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, said, there is the study by the
Foreign Office of the bigger issues to do with the future of the
British Indian Ocean Territory, the future of the marine protection
area, the sovereignty issues, resettlement of the Chagossians and
relations with the United States and
Mauritius<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0002.htm#13112766000070">I
agree that it is very necessary that the feasibility study should be
completed speedily, preferably by mid-2014, to give time for the
Government to have discussions with the United States and Mauritius,
after the completion of the study but before the election. That means

second issue is our relations with the United States and the need, in
my view, for informal discussions, even at this stage, before the study
is completed. Both the United Kingdom and the United States need to
understand the mutual parameters on this issue that we have to live
with. In the past two or three years, during my visits to Washington, I
have called in on the State Department. On all occasions, I have
asked where it stands on Diego Garcia and the British Indian
Ocean Territory. One positive answer that I have always had is that the
United States is prepared seriously to consider the employment of
Chagossians in Diego Garcia itself, if that is what Chagossians
want<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:53:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there may be a problem—this would be for discussion with the
British Government—is over security issues, if there is any
arrangement made by the British Government for the outer islands, 150
miles or so from Diego Garcia, to be settled. Even then, the State
Department says, “If the British Government put a proposition to
us, we would certainly be concerned about security but we
would look at it seriously”. We need to facilitate things by
having informal discussions with the United States now, rather than

point is about Mauritius. I entirely agree with what the noble Lord,
Lord Avebury, said. We need to engage; we need a diplomatic dialogue.
After all, Mauritius is a strong partner of ours in the Commonwealth.
It is a former colony. We therefore have very strong links. It is an
old friend of ours, and we have a common interest in the issues that
have recently been discussed at CHOGM in Sri Lanka about
maintenance of human rights in Sri Lanka itself. That is an important
factor. We have common ground on human rights issues. Relations between
the British Government and Mauritius have soured over the past three or
four years. That is a pity. It is largely due to the imposition of the
marine protection area, just before the previous Government lost
office, without any proper discussion with the Mauritian
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000074">We

dialogue. I hope that the Minister can say something about that. After
all, when we eventually decide—as we will at some
point—that sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory

them. It is essential that they are regarded as a vital player in any
Chagossian solution. Many questions need to be covered, such as the
future of the Chagossians, the possibility of co-management of the
outer islands and sovereignty issues. We are all aware that there is a
legal appeal at the moment against the marine protection area, but it

Anderson of Swansea (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is good that my
noble friend Lady Whitaker has raised the plight and the future of the
Ilois as, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Luce, a considerable
black mark on our late colonial history, which has been revealed in
documents provided for various court cases. Of course, the Ministers
and civil servants involved are now either dead or retired. Most of the
Ilois have no personal knowledge of life on the islands. Things have
moved on remarkably from that black mark in the late 1960s. We should
perhaps partially understand the problems of those decision-makers in
the context of the Cold War. Strategically, our ally, the US, needed a
secure base, and the local population was cleared—indeed,
sacrificed—to provide that. Successive UK Governments have since
ignored the problem, except when forced to take note during
litigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T19:58:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is now given to the case for the islanders, but the strategic
importance of the islands to the US remains: a secure base within easy
distance of that most volatile region, the Middle East. Presumably the
United States will wish to renew the lease in 2016. They will have to
be fully consulted on future plans as, as all colleagues have said,
will the Government of Mauritius. Hence, I ask: have the US authorities
given any clear indication that they are prepared to be helpful not
only in employment of those Ilois who so wish but, for example, in the
use of the airfield to supply those Ilois who choose to
return?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000078">The
complex history is set out very well in last December’s decision
of the European Court of Human Rights, proceedings of which started
almost 10 years ago. There have been many excuses over the years. The
first is that there is no settled population, only migrant workers.
That was shown conclusively to be false. The second was that adequate
compensation was offered and accepted as full and final settlement.
That was confirmed by the courts and, indeed, the European Court.
Global warming and rising sea levels make a return to some of the
islands precarious. Again, there is the excuse that since the
evacuation the Ilois have been given the opportunity to settle in the
UK, with all the benefits of life in a developed country. Will life
under the palm trees be attractive, particularly to the younger
generation who have seen the bright lights of the West? Questions must
be asked about the viability of the old way of life, as described in
another context by Arthur Grimble in <I>A Pattern Of Islands</I>, which
was about his work in the Gilbert and Ellis Islands. Perhaps he
romanticised a rather benign colonial rule, with indigenous people
waiting for the coconuts to fall from the trees and the fish to enter

be supplied by air and by sea? How far will the US be constrained for
security reasons in any help that it can provide? What will be the

that these are all questions for the feasibility study. It is important
that the independent experts be appointed as soon as possible, because
there must be a limited field of experts in this esoteric area of small
island development. Perhaps a staged return is called for, with a small
pilot project. The problem there is that the people who are likely to

came up to me and said, “How nice to meet you. My name’s
Ramgoolam—I am the premier. How nice of you to come. Have you
come to look into sugar? But why don’t you enjoy yourself on
holiday? I’ve made a booking for you in a hotel and
here’s my driver Dypoo, who will take you around and show you
things”. We had a really wonderful time and 10 years later,
Dypoo became one of my international spies—he was driving the
ambassadors in Washington. However, I fell in love with the place. It
was not really the most suitable for sugar but, at that time, tourism
was on the make. 
<?notus-xml column=1499?>The Seychelles had grabbed everything, rather as the Maldives have now,
and Mauritius was a bit flat. However, we happened to own Thomas Cook
and managed to do some help out
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000087">Being
an islander, I have always had affection for islands. I love the sea
and coastlines. One thing I keep citing in your Lordships’ House
is that if you take the coastlines of the Commonwealth, it has 60% of
the total in the world. In the Mauritian area of the Indian Ocean there
are 112,000 kilometres of coastline. What do the seas mean to us? In
fact, they mean fish, which is effectively one of the highest
added-value products in the world at the moment. Your Lordships will be
aware that illegal fishing is now estimated to be at between $10
billion and $24 billion per annum, and that there is worry about the
depletion of fish stocks. Going with that illegal fishing, there is
then the piracy and extortion taking place worldwide. If you take a
view of the islands in that part of the world, it becomes quite a
significant
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000088">I
speak of Mauritius but I do not know the other islands. I have them all
plotted on a map; I have the coastlines and the population of each, the
distances they cover, whether the coral is good or not and whether any
underground cables were laid there. But it is an important place as a
staging post, as the United States reckons. We should not forget that
RAF Gan, as I think it was called, used to be there. As an island
nation, dependent on the sea and with our own large fishing fleet, we
cannot ignore it. At the moment, our own fleet is 21% of the
world’s fleet and has 27% of its gross tonnage. Mauritius has 49
vessels totalling 53,000
tonnes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000089">It is
in the maritime sector that we could attach much importance to our
relationship with this place, which I love and to which I would like to
find a reason to go back again. There was a moment there when I saw
someone on a stick and a bit of board, windsurfing. I had never seen a
windsurfer before. In a short time, I had fallen in again and again but
there was my small son, aged five, windsurfing on the back of some door
or other with a Mauritian boy. I fell in love with that place, as I do
with any islands. When I look at the whole Indian Ocean I say that we
should have a political, economic and commercial strategy of our own.
The Indian Ocean is important. I have not come to piracy yet, which is
a favourite subject, but that will be for another
day.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_27_PT_1/F8C2BAAEE05F364DD54EA84ED5BF5A3E33FF7FE9" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 November 2013">Wednesday,

has always considered itself to be a country where fair play is
important, where the rule of law is respected and where rights are

group of 54 individual tropical islands was home to around 1,500
people—the Chagossians—for more than a century and a
half. The UK Government evicted them in the early 1970s in order to
allow the United States to build a military base on Diego Garcia, the
largest island in the area. This is now the only island which is

only around 700 Chagossians survive, scattered around the globe
following their forced exit from the island. Many are living in
profound poverty and are still reeling and suffering severe
psychological problems from their sense of dislocation and from being
separated from their homeland. This is a complicated story interwoven
with imperialist overtones, environmental concerns, military and

unfolding tragedy of a people
wronged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000094">The

forced evacuation of the island, can be extended for a further 20 years

islanders still yearn for the opportunity to go back to their native
land. I therefore begin by welcoming the fact that the Government will
commission a new feasibility study on the resettlement of the British
Indian Ocean Territory. The draft terms of the study are comprehensive
and thorough. There are some difficult issues to assess in the
feasibility study. The Government will be aware that the Labour
Government in 2000 also commissioned a study to assess to what extent
it would be feasible for the outer islands to be reinhabited. I am
afraid that the report concluded that resettlement was not feasible. As
time has passed, many have concluded that some of the findings, in
particular the scientific predictions relating to climate change, have
proved not to have been accurate. While welcoming the new study, I
first ask the Minister: are there any other significant factors which
have changed since 2000 to make the Government think that this study
will come to a different conclusion from the one commissioned in
2000?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112766000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000096">The
first obstacle to overcome would be the renegotiation of the terms of
the agreement with the US defence authorities, which have an agreed
right to use the island. I am sure it is not beyond the wit of the US
defence force to live alongside, or to protect their base from, the
Chagos Islanders. They seem to manage fairly well in Guantanamo, where
they have lived side by side with the Cubans for decades. Who knows, it
might even be helpful for the US to employ some of the islanders at its
base.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000097">Beyond
that, in theory it would be fairly simple to allow the Chagossians to
return—to simply say, “Yes, home you
go”—but the real question and issue is: what would they
be going home to? What, if any, is our responsibility in the UK to the
islanders and their standard of living, in particular in view of the
fact that successive UK Governments have undertaken to cede the
territory to Mauritius when it is no longer needed for defence
purposes? Will the Minister confirm that the current Government also
agree that the islands should be transferred to Mauritius at
some future date?</hs_para>

the islands. The islanders led a basic existence prior to 1966 with
very little infrastructure in place, just a few schools and clinics.
The marine protection area status which has been granted to the waters
around the islands in recent years would have to be developed and
adjusted to allow artisanal fishing, as already happens outside the
marine protection area around Diego Garcia. The costs of resettlement
and a clear understanding by all sides of what resettlement will entail
must be explored in the feasibility study, and we must be sensitive in
what we ask of the British taxpayer in a time of austerity. However, I
urge the Government to heed the advice given by my noble friend Lady
Whitaker and explore fully the opportunities for the costs of
resettlement to be shared between other interested Governments, the EU
and the
US.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000099">There are
significant risks associated with resettlement, including an
understanding that most of the islanders who left in the late 1960s
will be well over 60 years of age, and there will be very little access
to healthcare. These people may not want to settle on the island; they
may want simply to visit the country of their birth. At the
very least, the opportunity to visit is surely something which should
be explored in the feasibility
study.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112766000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127-0003.htm#13112766000100">It is,
however, also an opportunity to be creative in what could be offered.
Will the Minister say whether the designation of the seas surrounding
the islands as a marine protection area will be seen as a threat or an
opportunity, and who will make the judgment on this? Will
the consultants appointed to make the recommendation be given any kind
of political steer?</hs_para>

noble friend Lady Whitaker’s concerns about the speed of the
process. There is a suggestion that the feasibility study will take at

about the future of the British Indian Ocean Territory are more
difficult. Successive Governments have opposed resettlement on the
grounds of feasibility and defence. Noble Lords will recognise that we

permanently, concluding that it would be precarious and entail
expensive underwriting by the British Government for an open-ended

In December, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary announced

feasibility of resettlement. Officials from the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office consulted extensively with more than 400 members of
the Chagossian community and their supporters on that issue over the

lowered the evidence

and the police to review licences of criminal and irresponsible
premises where this offence is committed. The Government's new

Northover (LD):</Member> At the United Nations (UN) General Assembly,
the UK called for action to implement the UN’s
proposals for unfettered humanitarian access inside Syria. This
resulted in a Presidential Statement on the humanitarian situation in
Syria which called for a humanitarian ceasefire as well as
unhindered humanitarian access, lifting bureaucratic obstacles,
granting visas/permits, assisting cross-border delivery and
demilitarising schools and medical centres. The UK is also seeking
strong action at the UN Security Council, including the option
of a Resolution if necessary to lead to aid and polio
immunisation programmes reaching those in most need in
Syria.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13112750000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127w0001.htm#13112750000110">Young

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member> Effective education is essential in tackling
drug and alcohol misuse, helping young people to make informed, healthy
decisions. Pupils will learn about the effects of drugs on their bodies
as part of the new science national curriculum at key stages two and
three that will be taught in schools from September 2014. Teachers can
also cover the issue through time devoted to personal, social, health
and economic issues, drawing on specialist resources. For example the
Association has issued a revised programme of study which includes
references 
<?notus-xml column=285?>to drug education, and the new drug and alcohol information and advice
service for practitioners delivered by Mentor UK, provides accurate,
up-to-date information and
resources.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112750000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131127w0001.htm#13112750000033">The Home Office ran
