My Lords, the Government recognise the good work of
organisations that redistribute surplus food to those who might
otherwise struggle to access nutritional meals. However, the root
causes of household food insecurity are varied and complex. We are not
proposing to record the number of food banks or the potential number of
people using them or other types of food aid. To do so would place
unnecessary burdens on volunteers trying to help their
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Haskel" PimsId="875" UID="13112646000802" xid="1257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000802">Lord
Haskel (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, yesterday I visited the Trussell
food bank in Richmond—the third wealthiest place in the country.
There the food bank distributes a tonne of food a month, up 60% on the
year, to people referred to it from 40 agencies, many of them
associated with the Minister’s department. Is the Minister
content to leave it to charity to feed thousands of people who fall
through the cracks of his department? Does the Minister agree that this
food poverty must not—cannot—go on? How will the

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, the gist of the noble Lord’s
question was whether the Government think that it is okay to rely on
the voluntary sector. The answer is no. The Government recognise the
good work of charitable organisations that redistribute surplus food,
but the Government also have a role. It is not the Government’s
role to set prices, but we work to promote open and competitive markets
that help to offer the best prices to consumers. Through Healthy Start
and other initiatives, we provide a nutritional safety net in a way
that encourages healthy eating among more than 500,000 pregnant women
and children under four years old in very low-income and disadvantaged
families throughout the UK.</hs_para>

De Mauley:</Member></B> I agree with the noble Lord. Of course we
appreciate that some of the poorest people are struggling. The best way
to help people out of poverty is to help them into work. The latest
labour market statistics show employment up, unemployment down and the
number of workless households down. We operate a number of government
initiatives aimed at helping families with food: Healthy Start,
Change4Life and the school fruit and vegetable scheme; and we are
extending free school meals. In addition, there are a number of other
measures designed to help households in the wider context: the personal
tax allowance up £235 from April 2013, 2.4 million people taken
out of tax altogether, and fuel duty increases cancelled, to name a

the increased use of food banks is at least in part attributable to the
fact that we have a harsher benefits system, a harsher sanctions system
and a harsher hardship system? In the year to June, some 860,000 JSA
claimants were sanctioned; under the new three-year sanction, which we
were told would apply only to a handful of people, more than
700 people were sanctioned. How healthily can you eat on £42 a

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:49:33"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
think it is right to expect claimants who are able to look for or
prepare for work to do so. Claimants will only ever be required to meet
reasonable requirements, taking into account their circumstances and
capability. A sanction will never be imposed if a claimant has good
reason for failing to meet requirements, and sanctions can be
reconsidered or appealed. If claimants demonstrate that they cannot buy
essential items, including food, as a result of their sanction, they
can claim a hardship payment. This means that no claimant should ever
have to go without essentials as a result of their
sanction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:44:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Kennedy of Southwark" PimsId="5762" UID="13112646000816" xid="2042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000816">Lord

that up to $12 million-worth has been spent on corporate social
responsibility, including healthcare centres, schools and water

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:48:30"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, it is
my understanding that Barrick Gold is actually a Canadian company,
although it is listed on the London Stock Exchange. As for the other
matter that the noble Baroness raises, I agree with her: of course it
is important for all companies, including Barrick Gold, to work with
the local people on the ground to ensure that any human rights
violations are addressed. Secondly, I notice that the main
purpose of people being there with Barrick Gold is employment,
to ensure that local people get the opportunity to gain full
employment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:48:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

My Lords, there is, indeed, a debate among
veterinarians on this matter. While the evidence does not provide a
definitive answer, it is important to note that TB has been eradicated
from Scotland and many other countries despite the use of artificial
insemination and, furthermore, that bovine TB was already endemic
throughout Great Britain well before the widespread adoption of AI in
the
1950s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:52:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Dubs" PimsId="3031" UID="13112646000833" xid="1109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000833">Lord

agree. Indeed, our strategy is based on TB being particularly rife in
the south and west and moving northwards and eastwards, but in the part
of the world that the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, comes from it is not yet
endemic in the badger population. What we find in the high-incidence
areas is that it forms a reservoir in that element of wildlife,

gave to the noble Lord. Research by Professor Christl Donnelly
indicates that up to 50% of 
<?notus-xml column=1298?>infections in the high-incidence area are due to badgers. Bovine TB can
affect a wide range of species, including pigs, sheep, goats and
camelids; it can affect wildlife—for example, badgers and wild
deer—and pets, including cats and dogs, and of course humans.
The key thing, however, is that in cattle and badgers the infection is
self-sustaining. It is thought that most other species generally only
act as <hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>spillover

contention, but in response to his question about Durham, this is a
beef-fattening unit, and it will therefore have bought animals in from
elsewhere. That is why we introduced risk-based trading in partnership
with auctioneers and the industry, to provide fuller information about
TB status and history of selling herds to the market. Initially this is
on a voluntary basis, but we will look at it again if necessary. We are
also considering post-movement testing of cattle for those moving from

Developing both an oral badger vaccine—noble Lords will know
that an injectable badger vaccine already exists—and a cattle
vaccine remains a top priority for the Government. Since 1994, more

for judging what the level of need is locally and recruiting
accordingly. Ofsted inspects children’s services and, if an
authority is judged inadequate in its provision, we intervene.
We should not judge the success of local authority children’s
services solely by the size of their workforces. Management is also
very important, as is the quality of social workers. However, since
2010, we have spent nearly £0.25 billion on social work training
programmes and I am delighted to say that one of these, Frontline, has
received more than 5,000 applications from top graduates in just a few
weeks for its first 100 posts. The other, Step Up to Social Work, for
career-changers with good first degrees, has already trained nearly 400
people and has a third cohort of 320 people in 76 local authorities

Howarth of Breckland (CB):</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his
reply, but only last week the Association of Directors of
Children’s Services said that child protection services in
England were under greater pressure than ever. We also heard last week
that, following the Francis report, the number of nurses in hospital
wards is to be monitored. We have a ratio for the number of children to
teachers in education, yet social workers up and down the country are
left to deal with uncontrolled caseloads—when the next case
comes in, someone has to take it.</hs_para>

Nash:</Member></B> The noble Baroness speaks with great experience in
this area and anything she has to say on the subject we should all
listen to very carefully. We all acknowledge that social workers have a
very tough job and, of course, we hear only about the
disasters—there are plenty of Daniel Pelkas or Hamzah Khans whom
they save and whom we never hear about. It can be a question of volume
of cases, but there is evidence that there is no direct correlation
between failure and caseload; indeed, a number of local authorities
have failed with relatively mild caseloads. It is a question of
managing those caseloads and whether the more experienced social
workers get the more difficult cases. The Troubled Families programme,
for which we have just announced an investment of a further £200
million, is undoubtedly helping in this regard, as are innovative ways
of working such as those seen in Hackney. It is also a question of
local authorities recruiting better managers for these
services.</hs_para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:09:36"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, in

the question of whether we should have separation rather than the

speakers we had on the first day in Committee went to the heart of the
issue. The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, a distinguished former head of
the Civil Service, told us that the amendment he moved dealt with the
whole issue. In practice, I hope that my 
<?notus-xml column=1302?>amendment deals with what I said it would deal with. However, given the
problems with drafting amendments to this complex Bill, I had to use
the services of a very excellent person in the Public Bill Office,
Simon Blackburn. Between us we drafted the amendments, which I hope
work. If they do not, and the House agrees, no doubt the Minister will
be able to amend the amendments to make sure that they do what I want
them to do—that is, reconstruction, not

noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, told us at col. 18 —and of course he
knows about these things—that the Government’s response
to the problem here, and what they plan to do, is to “change
banking for good”. Of course, if that could be done, it would be
marvellous. However, the plain fact is, as the noble Lord, Lord
Turnbull, pointed out, that the reality is somewhat different. The
Government have, of course, embraced some recommendations, but the
provisions in the Bill make sure that they are heavily diluted.
Speaking as a senior official, the noble Lord knows about dilution.
Certainly, if you look through the Bill, there are all kinds of
dilutions and provisions that make a nonsense of the original
recommendation. However, with this complex new Bill it is good to have
a former distinguished leader of officials tell us what it will and
will not

noble Lord went on to speak about the vigorous debate the parliamentary

Eatwell, who spoke of the importance of reviews. He said that what is

therefore have my new amendments, which I hope that the House will
eventually approve. However, we are a long way at the moment from
achieving what we all want to see. We started with a Bill of 37 pages;
the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, paid a well deserved tribute to his
staff, who had converted 37 pages to 170
pages—virtually a new Bill. By the time we finish it is likely
to be more than 200 pages long, as he knows from his own amendments
that have been tabled. I certainly share his approbation of his
officials, who have done an incredible job in the most difficult of
circumstances. I have never known a Bill of this kind before in either
House of Parliament. However, I assume that the House of
Commons, which gave us this 37-page Bill, will now have to have a
Second Reading on a new Bill, because it will not be able to cope with
it as it is.</hs_para>

Eatwell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend
for moving his amendment and for pointing out the extraordinary
complexity and confusion about the procedure that the Bill has gone
through to get to this stage. As he pointed out, it came from the
Commons as 35 pages and is now 170 pages. Substantial matters were
introduced in Committee. Substantial errors were identified in
Committee—even, as we shall hear, regarding the definition of a
bank in a Bill on
banking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:28:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

material is now being introduced under the more restrictive

Whips will restrain themselves if the rules are bent somewhat in our
attempt to scrutinise nearly 200 new government amendments
effectively. Yesterday, on the “Today” programme, the
Chancellor announced that further substantial amendments will be
introduced at Third Reading with respect to payday loans. Then the
Treasury was circulating extra material in e-mails after 9
o’clock last night. We have received copies of correspondence
dated today between the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of
England that changes the perspective on leverage. These measures are
relevant to the most important industry in this country, and are
measures to which we are supposed to give our consideration.</hs_para>

(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure for me to resume
our debates on the Bill. We do not believe that there is any need to
recommit it. These are radical and important
reforms—ring-fencing, bail-in, depositor preference, a new
senior person’s regime and new criminal sanctions. The
Government wish to put them in action, move forward and leave the
period of deliberation behind. We wish to end the uncertainty for the
economy, consumers and taxpayers that prolonged reviewing can bring.
Where the reforms can be improved to increase their effectiveness, the
Government have been prepared to listen, and you will see that we have
responded. However, where the Government do not believe the proposals
are backed by evidence, or are unreasonable, we have respectfully
disagreed and set out our reasons. This is the approach that we have
taken to all the
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000089">Specifically
on Amendment 1, from the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, the ICB recommended
that only retail deposits—that is, the deposits of individuals
and small businesses—should be ring-fenced. This amendment would
require all deposits to be ring-fenced. The ICB recommended that large
organisations and wealthy individuals should be able—though,
importantly, not obliged—to deposit with non-ring-fenced banks.
This was because these depositors are sufficiently financially
sophisticated to tolerate an interruption in access to a single bank,
for example because they have multiple banking relationships. These
sophisticated depositors therefore do not need the protection that
being mandated inside the ring-fence provides. They may choose to
deposit in a ring-fenced bank if they wish, of course. It also provides
a little bit more competition. It gives the wealthy individuals and
businesses the opportunity to shop around.</hs_para>

financial institutions also use complex financial products which
ring-fenced banks will rightly be prohibited from selling. To obtain
these products, such as complex derivatives, large companies or
financial institutions will need to go to a non-ring-fenced bank. Given
this, it is reasonable that these customers should be permitted also to
deposit with non-ring-fenced banks, as the ICB recommended. The
Government accepted the ICB’s recommendation. Therefore the Bill
allows the Treasury to specify by order that a non-ring-fenced bank can
accept deposits in certain circumstances.</hs_para>

individuals—other than very wealthy and sophisticated
ones—and small businesses will have to be within the ring-fence.
There is no compulsion for large organisations or wealthy individuals
to deposit outside the ring-fence, only the option for them to do so if
they so choose. This option is provided for in secondary legislation.
The Government published a draft of the relevant order for consultation
in July this 
<?notus-xml column=1307?>year. It is appropriate that detailed provisions
such as this should be made in secondary rather than primary
legislation to allow the legislation to keep pace with future
developments in the market and to keep it fit for purpose. This
approach was endorsed by the PCBS in its first
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000092">It is
also important to highlight that under the Bill the Treasury
does<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:34:25"></hs_TimeCode> not have
unlimited power to determine which deposits do not have to be
ring-fenced. The Treasury may only allow deposits outside the
ring-fence if it is convinced that doing so does not undermine the
ring-fence and that the depositors concerned do not need the protection
of the ring-fence. This is therefore a constrained power that is needed
to implement the recommendations of the ICB. I therefore urge
the noble Lord to withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000093"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:34:22"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Barnett" PimsId="3885" UID="13112646000868" xid="1068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000868">Lord

Flight (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, can I ask the Minister for a
little clarity on ring-fencing in terms of what is in this pot and what
is in the other pot? The point he has made is that the ring-fenced pot
will essentially be individual family deposits while commercial
deposits would be outside the ring-fence; but what about the other side
of the balance sheet in the sense of which part of the loan portfolio
is to be in the ring-fence and which part is to be outside it? My
previous understanding was that the ring-fence was going to be all
deposit-taking and all lending. My reservations, if you like, with
regard to the Glass-Steagall solution are that history has shown it is
lending and not investment banking that has always caused banks
trouble. This time round it was CDO lending and the unwise lending by
HBOS and RBS that actually caused the banks trouble. The idea of
separating absolutely banking and investment banking as a great
protection for the deposits of ordinary citizens is entirely false in
terms of economic
history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:36:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Deighton:</Member></B> The clarification is that the ring-fence
effectively operates on the liabilities side, so we are dealing with
core deposits. Just to correct the point and make it clear, the most
sophisticated investors can be either inside or outside the ring-fence,
and they have the choice. However, the asset side of the bank’s
balance sheet is unconstrained in the
rules<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:37:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Barnett:</Member></B> My Lords, I will withdraw Amendment 1 and then
move Amendment 2, although I spoke to it generally in my first speech
and I do not wish to detain 
<?notus-xml column=1308?>the House for too much longer. But as the noble
Lord, Lord Lawson, said at the time, these are two totally different
coaches and it is going to be virtually impossible to put the two
together—those were his words. I therefore suggest to the
Minister that Glass-Steagall, which worked for 60 years in the United
States, could be made effective here if we had stronger regulations to
make sure that those banking lobbyists could not succeed in stopping
the separation. That was the major point that I made, and will continue
to make. That is also where I would like to leave it so that the
Minister can reply to Amendment 2. I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, this Bill legislates for ring-fencing.
That is the Government’s policy, not Glass-Steagall-style full
separation. The Government support ring-fencing, but not as a
compromise option or a lukewarm version of separation, and not as a
watered-down policy. Rather, the Government have adopted the ring-fence
after careful consideration of the recommendations of the Independent
Commission on Banking. As noble Lords will recall, the ICB was
established in June 2010. It deliberated for 15 months before making
its recommendations in September 2011. As part of its deliberations,
the ICB considered full separation as an alternative to ring-fencing,
but it rejected that alternative and instead recommended ring-fencing.
The Government have accepted the ICB’s recommendation, and the
commission set out its rationale for rejecting full separation in its
final report.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112646000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000100">Let me remind the House
of the ICB’s line of reasoning. The ICB argued that an
effective, robust ring-fence would deliver the same benefits to
financial stability as full separation, on the model of Glass-Steagall.
A robust ring-fence will insulate vital retail banking services from
shocks to global financial markets—for example, reducing the
risk that British high-street banks will be brought down by swings in
the prices of complex securities. Let us recall, too, that retail
banking has its risks and that market discipline demands that badly run
banks must be allowed to fail. If a retail bank fails, a robust
ring-fence will enable the authorities to manage that failure in a
controlled way, with essential services kept running with the core
deposits we were talking about, but without any injection of
taxpayers’  
<?notus-xml column=1309?>money. So, a strong ring-fence will minimise the
chance that a future Government will ever be forced to bail out a
failing bank. The moral hazard that encouraged excessive risk-taking
before the recent crisis would be
removed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000101">The
ICB argued that a robust ring-fence would deliver the same benefits as
full separation, and would avoid some of full separation’s main
disadvantages. In particular, a ring-fenced bank that found
itself in financial difficulties could be supported by other group
members, such as a healthy sister investment bank. Full separation
would not allow this. Essentially the ring-fence is a valve; it does
not let any of the bad stuff get into the ring-fence but allows support
to come in if it needs
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000102">Under
ring-fencing, a banking group could offer a one-stop-shop service to
customers, especially business customers, so there is a strong
marketing advantage to the group. Deposits or simple loans could be
arranged with the group’s ring-fenced bank, while more complex
products are supplied by the group’s investment bank. Full
separation would not allow this. Finally, the ICB estimated that by
denying banks the legitimate benefits of diversification, full
separation would impose higher costs—costs that would likely be
passed on to banks’ customers and to
lending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000103">In
summary, ring-fencing will bring the same benefits as full separation,
but with fewer disadvantages. A rational, sober evaluation of the two
thus brought the ICB to identify ring-fencing as the superior policy. I
would like to use this opportunity to put paid to some myths around
ring-fencing versus full separation. First, some claim that full
separation is simpler to legislate for, and there is no complexity. Any
separation of banks’ business will inevitably involve detailed
rules to specify where the line, whether it is a ring-fence or a
complete separation, is to be drawn, and proscribe which activities
must take place either side of that line. As banks’ business is
complex and involves a wide range of different products and services,
so drawing that line will inevitably be complex. But a line will have
to be drawn and someone will have to decide what is in each separated
type of bank. It is the same problem for ring-fencing and full
separation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000104">Secondly,
either form of separation will, unless vigilantly maintained, be
vulnerable to erosion or bank lobbying. There are plenty of examples of
that through history. I do not, therefore, accept that full separation
is either more simple or more robust than ring-fencing. As I have
already said, the ICB conducted an exhaustive and detailed
investigation of the case for different types of structural reform
before coming to its recommendation in favour of ring-fencing. That
recommendation commanded a wide consensus—including regulators,
industry and the Opposition. Let me quote the shadow Chancellor
speaking in the Commons when the Government first responded to the ICB
in December 2011. He said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13112646000318" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000318">“we,

what the weight of evidence, there will always be some who disagree
with the consensus. But to those who advocate full separation as an
alternative, we need to ask: what is the evidence that supports this 
<?notus-xml column=1310?>alternative policy? Throughout this process so far, the Government have
openly invited others to give their views and present new evidence. We
consulted widely, and submitted this Bill to pre-legislative scrutiny
by the PCBS to seek its input. I do not think that the PCBS produced
hard evidence in favour of full separation. It presented nothing that
compared the two proposals, although it elicited some strong
expressions of scepticism on whether it would work.

reasonable, the Government have accepted changes to the Bill that would
address these concerns about the efficacy of ring-fencing. For example,
Andrew Bailey, head of the PRA, argued for greater clarity over the
regulator’s objectives. Similarly, Andy Haldane of the Bank of
England told the PCBS that:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="13112646000255" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000255">“The following

the Government clarified the regulator’s objectives, and have
specified the parameters for the regulators’ rule-making,
placing the Haldane principles in the Bill. We have thus made the
changes that the regulators—the experts who will police the
ring-fence—said were needed to make the ring-fence work. We have
also taken on other reasonable suggestions made by the PCBS and others
to make the ring-fence more robust. For example, we have accepted the
PCBS’s proposal to electrify the ring-fence by giving the
regulator power to separate a banking group that fails to uphold the
ring-fence. We have agreed to use the affirmative resolution procedure
to deal with changes in secondary legislation to the
ring-fence.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13112646000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000107">Responding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:45:40"></hs_TimeCode>
constructively to suggestions from all sides, we have thus addressed
concerns over the robustness of the ring-fence—the sole argument

deterrent—not to be implemented immediately, as in this
amendment, but triggered following a future review. They will argue
that this is a much more reasonable position than that taken by the
noble Lords, Lord Barnett and Lord Peston. As I will explain, the
Government do not accept that a provision for full separation

it is a different policy, where a reserve provision is an
inappropriate way to legislate. It is at best unhelpful, at worst bad

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, noble Lords will notice that Amendment
3 is identical to Amendment 6, which is in the name of the group of
people who we could perhaps call the commissioners—members of
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards who have considered
these matters with care and at great length. It is interesting that the
noble Lord said just now that no evidence had been provided about
issues associated with separation. The parliamentary commission
provided extensive evidence, to which I would refer the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:52:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000120">In
speaking to Amendment 3, I will argue that the “reserve
power” of full separation, as it was described by the
parliamentary commission, is a logical and coherent part of the entire
strategy of ring-fencing, which consists of three parts. First, there
is the provision of the ring-fence itself. Secondly, there is
electrification of the ring-fence in the case of individual groups that
transgress and are subsequently required to separate. Thirdly, there is
the measure put forward in Amendments 3 and 6, under which
there is full separation where the process has not been followed
successfully or appropriately by the banking
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000121">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:53:36"></hs_TimeCode>
whole thrust of the commission’s report is about the need to
maintain these three stages. Each reinforces the other. The noble Lord
argued just now 
<?notus-xml column=1313?>that the Government had seen no case at all for separation. Why then did
the Government accept the case for the separation of individual groups
should they transgress? That case came from the commission and the case
for full separation came from the commission. If he accepts one, he
should accept the other. It is quite ridiculous to suggest that the
commission’s processes were somehow less rigorous than those of
the ICB. Indeed, the whole package put forward in this group, which
consists of the case for full separation as the final reserve power and
the case for review, is a single coherent package. The case for review
and the case for full separation, if that review should argue that
ring-fencing is not working successfully, is a coherent structure set
out by the commission. The Government are lopping off an essential leg
of a three-legged
stool<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

arguments made against this amendment when it was first put by the
commissioners in Committee. As well as the argument that it was somehow
less rigorous—an argument that I think is almost offensive to
the commission—the Government put forward the suggestion that,
should the ring-fence not work, other options might be considered. The
Minister raised the red herring of the possible introduction of a
Volcker rule. Surely this is spurious, as here we have a coherent,
structured package of three nested sets of measures to ensure the
stability of the banking industry, which rely on and strengthen each
other.</hs_para>

I found most surprising in the Government’s rejection of the
argument for full separation is that they rejected the idea that the
ring-fence will consequently be made stronger by self-policing. The
banks will have a major concern that others do not transgress lest they
be caught in a final decision for full separation. The noble Lord
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13112646000262" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000262">“The

must tell the noble Lord that that is exactly how a competitive market
operates in a capitalist economy—everyone watches each other.
The banking market is no different. Each pursues its own interest. As
Adam Smith put it—the Chancellor of the Exchequer has taken to
quoting him—it is not the benevolence of the butcher or baker
that provides us with meat and bread, but the pursuit of their own
interest. If the banks see it as being in their own interest to avoid
full separation, we can be sure that they will take all necessary
steps, including mutual surveillance, to ensure that full separation
does not take place. That is why the commission’s proposal is
such a strong one. It strengthens the ring-fence by giving those within
it the incentive to ensure that it be maintained and be not
transgressed. That is why this is a coherent

Minister omitted to mention that the proposals for full separation are
predicated on a thorough, independent review of the progress of
ring-fencing. We have not only a nested structure, which strengthens at
each stage, but, in the amendments put forward by the commissioners, a

introduced. That is why, for example, Amendments 15 and 195 are
consequential on Amendment 3 and, with respect to Amendment

Government have moved a very long way—and I am
delighted—but not quite far enough. That is what we are
discussing in this group of amendments. To get to the core of the
issue, what the Vickers commission concluded and what the Government
have accepted is that there is a problem with the relationship and,
indeed, the mixing of commercial and retail banking with
investment banking. The Vickers commission accepted that; that is why
it introduced the ring-fence. The Government accepted that; that is why

have always been in favour of full separation—I came out
publicly in favour of it long before the Vickers commission was even
set up. We know that this works. It worked in the United States for
many, many years under the Glass-Steagall arrangements and it is no
accident that serious problems emerged after the Glass-Steagall Act had
been repealed. Indeed, the Glass-Steagall Act would have worked for a
great deal longer had not successive American Administrations been
lobbied by the banks to introduce loopholes in one place and another.

is the danger? The danger accepted by the Vickers commission and the
Government is twofold. First, although my noble friend Lord Flight is
absolutely right that ordinary, plain, vanilla banking is a very 
<?notus-xml column=1315?>risky business and often goes wrong, there is one particular range of
risks in lending: the bad lending. In investment banking you had a
whole new and very complex range of risks. It is not the case that
nothing has ever gone wrong there; for example, there have been huge
problems with derivatives that are a product of the complexity of
investment banking. So there is first the question of whether
it is sensible—when straightforward, plain, vanilla banking is
risking enough —to add to that a whole new range of risks, a
whole new complexity, which can make it more likely that the retail
deposit-taking banks will get into difficulties. It must be unwise to
do that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000131">The
other problem is about the cultures. The Vickers commission did not
talk about this, or think about it; it did not raise the issue
of culture. But culture is very important. I was glad that when
my right honourable friend the Prime Minister introduced the setting up

problem of governance. The ring-fence is a curious system, because
there is one company with two subsidiaries—the retail bank and
the investment bank—and we are told that they are completely
separate, yet they are together. There is a real question whether that
model of governance is workable. I know of distinguished

is also a problem within the law. Boards of directors are responsible
to the shareholders, so if there is complete separation it is clear
that the board of the retail bank has responsibility to the
shareholders of the retail bank and the board of the investment bank

proposal there are two entities that we are told are completely
separate, yet there is a single group of shareholders to whom they are
responsible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:07:36"></hs_TimeCode>. We

burrowed

what the Government and Parliament decided, it should be obliged to
separate its retail banking and its investment banking. But we also
said that a second kind of review power was vital. The proposed system
is a right idea of the Vickers commission. A number of the Vickers
commission are friends of mine, they are very clever, and I have
nothing against them—but they do not know whether it will work
either. It has never been tried anywhere in the world, whereas complete
separation has been tried, and it has worked. So it is vital that if

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, I have broadly been in support of a
Glass-Steagall separation of investment and banking banks, but there
seems to me something slightly wrong with the concept of having a
review and prejudging the outcome of that review. Playing
devil’s advocate, I make a point on the other side of the coin.
Europe has had universal banking for a long time; that is the banking
tradition in continental Europe and there is still a case for universal
banking to continue, although it is right out of fashion now. I repeat
my point that, to a fair extent, the profits of investment banking have
subsidised ordinary banking and benefited ordinary retail customers;
the losses have generally come from bad lending. So it is slightly
premature to prejudge the review. I cannot see what is wrong with
having a review with the understanding that the Government will act on
the basis of the recommendation of that review at the time. We will
have moved on from the present and other factors may have come to light
as well. I do not see what is gained by prejudging the result of the
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:12:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:11:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000141"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Archbishop of Canterbury" PimsId="2461" UID="13112646000886" xid="1538" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000886">The

Lord Lawson, I begin by expressing my gratitude to the Government that
they have listened to the speeches of many noble Lords and my PCBS
colleagues on the need for a full and independent review of the
ring-fence. I hope that they will realise 
<?notus-xml column=1317?>that the amendments that have been tabled today are
the final pieces of the puzzle in this regard. This work, combined with
the vast improvements that we have seen to the electrification of the
ring-fence—what is officially known as the first reserve
power—is most welcome. The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, put the
case very clearly, not only for them but for the second reserve power.
The Government’s approach to that is so far

Minister said that he believed that a robust ring-fence will work, and
so do we, as the commission. It is just that we do not think that it is

the day if the first one is over a period of years
overwhelmed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000143">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:14:05"></hs_TimeCode>

separation but the whole industry is still gaming the system, then you
have still got the second reserve power. It appears that the

current perception, which appears to be one, as far as the banks are

therefore favour reviews, but—and it is an important

vulgar card-playing metaphor, one must not play with a loaded deck. 
<?notus-xml column=1319?>Listening to some of the arguments so far, I formed
the impression that these amendments could lead to a loaded deck

more important issue in relation to this banking situation than whether
to go with ring-fencing or with separation—we have had that very
clearly debated today. The noble Baroness, Lady Cohen of Pimlico,
raised an issue in relation to that, which my 
<?notus-xml column=1320?>noble friend the Minister placed some emphasis on in
responding earlier, as he did at the last stage of this
debate—namely, to state that the cost of total separation would
be exorbitant. The noble Baroness rightly made the riposte that the
cost of policing the ring-fence will not be a one-off, as the cost of a
separation would be; the cost will be year after year. The task of the
regulators in policing a ring-fencing arrangement will be intensely
difficult. It is easy to jibe at the regulators, but we may
underestimate the extreme difficulty of doing a thorough job in this
field, where you have a single holding company and two companies under
it. I take the point made vividly by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson of

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, before I turn to the substance of
these amendments, I would like briefly to pause and reflect on the
process that has brought us to this point. Throughout the course of
this Bill the Government have consistently tried to adopt the most
constructive approach possible, welcoming contributions from all sides
to help us get this right. I am particularly grateful for the
constructive comments to that effect from my noble friend Lord Lawson

been to get this right. Even before the Bill was introduced to
Parliament, we asked the PCBS to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny. We
considered seriously its recommendations both on the draft Bill and on
banking conduct and standards more generally. Almost a third of the
Bill before us today was either added or heavily amended in response to
its recommendations. We have also showed ourselves to be open to
considering ideas proposed by the Opposition, both in the Commons and
in this House. Where we have been convinced by the points made, we have
been willing to amend the Bill to reflect that. I think that the
sentiment of the House has demonstrated that. That includes changes to
the process of scrutiny of the ring-fencing proposals, introducing the
single bank separation power, putting the so-called Haldane principles
in the Bill and clarifying the regulator’s
objectives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:32:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:29:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13112646000338" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000338">4.30

specific subject of the independent review of the ring-fence, the
Government have never opposed the principle of a future
review. How could we when the ring-fence itself was the product of an
independent review, the ICB? Indeed, my right honourable friend the
Chancellor told the PCBS in February this year that,</hs_para>

we have been more sceptical of the need to legislate for this review.
After all, the ICB itself needed no legislation to conduct its
painstaking research and rigorous, independent analysis. However,
having listened to the arguments made, in particular in this House by
members of the PCBS, we have accepted the case for a statutory review
of the ring-fence in the interests of certainty, to determine, as my
noble friend just pointed out, whether it is as robust as I have
implied we would like it to
be.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13112646000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000168">Government
Amendments 11 and 16 therefore provide for a review of the operation of
the ring-fence, to be conducted by a panel of independent experts once
the ring-fence has come into force. In drawing up these amendments, the
Government have consulted closely with members of the PCBS. My right
honourable friend the Chancellor and I met PCBS representatives to
discuss their concerns. We have made our officials available to them to
clarify any points of technical detail and have shared drafts of our
amendments in advance—which, incidentally, explains why the
drafting of the PCBS’s amendments so closely matches our
own.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000169">Following
those discussions, the Government believe that our amendments address
the substance of the PCBS’s concerns. To reflect that
ring-fencing is a bold new step, the review’s central task will
be to assess how well the ring-fence is working. Its conclusions are
not constrained; it can make any recommendations it sees as
appropriate. If it believes that the ring-fence is in need of
improvement or repair, it will be able to make recommendations as to
what changes in the legislation or rules are required to fix it.
Therefore I can give my noble friend Lord Lawson the unequivocal
commitment which I think he asked for—I will test whether I have
got this right—that if the review concludes that the 
<?notus-xml column=1322?>ring-fence is irreparably broken, it will also have the scope to
recommend an alternative approach altogether. That will, of course,
include full
separation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000170">The
review will be conducted by a panel of experts who are independent of
the Government, the Bank of England and regulators, as well as
financially independent of the industry. Amendment 16 gives it a
statutory power to obtain whatever information it believes is necessary
to complete its work. Despite our approach in developing these
amendments, it appears that some areas of difference remain, which are
reflected in the various alternative amendments that have been tabled
for debate today. I will address those issues now. I think it will go
some way to helping us see how all this will be turned into something

I will address the issue of the review panel membership. The Government
do not believe that requiring pre-approval, as in Amendments 4, 5 and
13, is proportionate or appropriate. At present there is only one
government appointment for which pre-approval is required: the
appointment of the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility. That
arrangement is supported by a strong body of academic literature that
emphasises the essential need for credible and independent fiscal
forecasts and statistics. No comparable evidence base exists in the
case of an independent review of
ring-fencing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000172">I
also note that pre-approval of this sort is not required for the
Governor of the Bank of England or the heads of the regulators, so is
membership of a review really a more weighty responsibility than
any of those posts? Finally, Sir John Vickers and the ICB were
not subjected to any pre-approval requirement, yet their independence
could hardly be questioned. As noble Lords will see from government
Amendment 11, we have already accommodated the PCBS’s desire for
a parliamentary role by requiring consultation with the chair of the
Treasury Committee before review panel members are appointed. I hope
that that is sufficient to satisfy any concerns. I therefore call on
the noble Lords not to press those
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:34:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000173">On
the scope of the review, Amendments 4 and 14 similarly specify
recommendations that the review must consider. As the review
will be able to make recommendations on whatever it sees as
appropriate—including recommended alternatives such as full
separation, or indeed other ideas if they are appropriate—I do
not believe that this is necessary. Indeed, it could even cast doubt on
whether the review had the right to consider matters not specified in
the legislation, which would constrain it, contrary to the
PCBS’s intentions. However, I believe that the
Government’s amendment and the PCBS’s amendment are
sufficiently close in substance that, on the basis of my clear
commitment, this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:34:47"></hs_TimeCode> should

5 and 15 would expressly require the review to consider the case for
full separation as an alternative to ring-fencing. While I believe the
review should be free to recommend what it wishes, the Government do
not, however, believe that it is appropriate to require it to consider
a specific alternative, to privilege in legislation consideration of
one possible conclusion of a review. Let me be very clear: if the
review concludes that the ring-fence has failed beyond repair, it will
be 
<?notus-xml column=1323?>able to propose an alternative policy. That could be full separation, if
the review believed that to be the best alternative course. It could,
however, be other things
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000175">On both
of these points, the Government’s amendments deliver the
substantive objectives of those tabled by the PCBS. Indeed, as the
review will also be able to consider the case for a ban on proprietary
trading—on the model of the US Volcker rule—they also
meet the objectives of Amendment 181, which we will debate later.
Therefore, we can use this device to ensure that, if there are emerging
issues with respect to proprietary trading, the review has the
flexibility to make recommendations in that area too. I therefore hope
that the noble Lords will not press their amendments.</hs_para>

Amendment 12, which would shorten the period between ring-fencing
coming into force and the review being conducted. On this
point, the Government see the force of the arguments made by the
Opposition, and agree that an earlier review than that proposed by the
PCBS could be helpful. Provided that the regulators agree that a review
after just two years is feasible, we would certainly be willing to
consider this change. We are quite open-minded on the timing and I hope
that the various parties will find a way of reaching an agreement on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000177">Finally,
I will address the question of whether the legislation should establish
an independent review as a trigger for a move to full separation, as
provided for by Amendments 5, 6, 15, 195 and 196. The Government
continue to believe that a reserve provision for full separation is at
best otiose, and at worst bad law. As I have already said, a review
that concluded that the ring-fence was irreparably broken could
recommend a shift to full separation instead. It could, however,
recommend a shift to some other option too. If it did, and if the
Government of the day accepted that recommendation, then a reserve
provision for a full separation would not be appropriate in any
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000178">Imagine,
however, that a review did propose full separation, and the Government
of the day accepted that recommendation. Simply enacting a reserve
provision would be a very poor way to implement such a significant
change. It would allow for no detailed scrutiny, no debate, and no
thorough testing of the arguments by Parliament. Yes, there would have
to be a review, but the ICB proposals went through Second and Third
Reading debates and extensive Committee scrutiny. None of that would be
available to the outcome of this review. The Government, therefore,
remain of the view that inserting a reserve provision now would be bad
legislation, so I call on the noble Lords not to press their
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:37:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000179">Some
have argued that a reserve provision of this sort could act as a
deterrent, reinforcing the ring-fence by threatening dire consequences
in the event that banks “game” the rules. Personally, I
do not find this convincing. For a deterrent to work, consequences must
follow from the bad behaviour that it is intended to deter. But the
amendments before us today make no mention of gaming. Under these
amendments, a review could conclude in favour of a switch to full
separation without even having considered whether any gaming had taken
place. How, then, is that a deterrent?</hs_para>

should also remind the House that we have already provided for a
powerful deterrent against gaming, by giving the regulator the power to
force a single group that has gamed the rules to separate. In my own
experience as a banker, I can absolutely make clear that I was much
more concerned about a regulator dealing with my own institution and
threatening to make changes there if I did not behave than considering
what my competitors were doing. The powerful tool is the direct,
specific action against an individual institution. That is what the
existing electrification we have included provides for. For me, that is
the appropriate additional tool for the regulator. By contrast, even if
the review did recommend full separation on the grounds that some firms
had gamed the ring-fence, forcing separation on the entire
sector—the innocent as well as the guilty—would be unjust
and disproportionate. Indeed, if firms are at risk of being split up
whether they game the ring-fence or not, they could conclude that they
might as well game the rules, and cash in while they
can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>. So, far
from deterring gaming, a reserve provision might actually encourage

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments make a number of
minor and technical amendments to the Bill. Amendments 7 and 8 amend
new Section 142W, which gives the Treasury the power to require that
ring-fenced banks make arrangements to ensure that 
<?notus-xml column=1330?>they cannot become liable for the pension liabilities of any
non-ring-fenced entity, and that they minimise such potential
liabilities if they cannot entirely prevent them arising. In the
process of making these arrangements, the pension scheme trustees may
wish to transfer assets or liabilities between schemes. These
amendments clarify that the Treasury can make regulations enabling
trustees or managers to transfer to another pension scheme all the
pension liabilities arising in connection with persons’ service
before the date on which ring-fencing comes into effect, together with
all the scheme’s assets and not just part of those liabilities
and
assets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:01:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

intention is to give banks and trustees flexibility in how they carry

trustees have a duty to act in the best interests of scheme members

9 is a minor and technical amendment which clarifies the definition of

industry to cover the costs of UK participation in certain

England, rather than the definition given in Section 3A of FiSMA, which

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment removes Clause 5 from
the Bill. It will leave the regulators, the PRA and the FCA to decide
among themselves which one of them designates board members of
ring-fenced banks as senior managers and which directors should be
designated. Clause 5 requires that the PRA on its own designates all
directors of a ring-fenced bank as senior managers under the new senior
managers regime. This clause was introduced originally before the
senior managers regime was proposed. It now needs to be updated to
reflect those
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112646000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0001.htm#13112646000197">The
PRA is considering how to implement the PCBS’s recommendation of
focusing the new senior managers regime to strengthen individual
responsibility for actions of the firm. The PRA wants to develop the
new regime in a way that improves its ability to bring enforcement
action against individuals when things go wrong.
To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:04:29"></hs_TimeCode> achieve this,
the PRA thinks that it may be best to limit the number of board members
it designates as senior managers, to narrow the scope of
accountability. Those directors designated senior managers by the PRA
will need to comply with conduct standards that will further the
PRA’s safety and soundness objective.</hs_para>

the PRA to designate all board members of ring-fenced banks as senior
managers. It prejudges the outcome of the regulators’ policy
development and could result in the application of the senior managers
regime to ring-fenced banks being less focused than for the rest of the
sector. A focused regime should improve the ability of the PRA to take
enforcement action against individual directors by making
clearer which senior managers are responsible for different aspects of
the firm’s business. The Government therefore agree with the PRA
that Clause 5 should be removed.</hs_para>

designated as senior managers by the PRA may be more appropriately
designated by the FCA. The precise calibration should be left
to the regulators, who will consult on this next year. The
removal of the clause also brings the application of the senior
managers regime to ring-fenced banks into line with how it will be
applied outside the ring-fence. Outside the ring-fence the PRA or the
FCA can designate directors as senior
managers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:05:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

attained the required professional standards and, of course, not
licensing those who have not. With respect to the conduct and skills of
members of the banking industry, the Bill currently refers to
“rules of conduct”. Amendments from the commissioners use

notion of a licence surely refers to some level of professional
competence or professional standards. The Co-operative Bank may have
obeyed the rules, but we now know it would have failed even the

attainment of professional qualifications, but we cannot be
sure and, as the Government regularly argue, certainty is important in
this legislation. The clause in the Bill as drafted refers to rules of
conduct. The commissioners’ amendment refers

legislation—he is absolutely right about that. We have spent
much of the afternoon talking about separation and ring-fencing, which
is important because there is a theoretical risk that any institution
could be destabilised for example by speculation in high-risk
instruments such as derivatives and that could undermine the rest of
the business. That is a theoretical risk; it is sensible to address it

the much praised Glass-Steagall regime, which existed in America

if an institution could be involved in both underwriting securities and
making loans, and that if the underwriting losses were such as to
compromise the capital of the bank, the deposits of the bank would be
at risk. Again, that is a straightforward, plausible, coherent risk
that it is sensible to address but that was not the reason for the
banking crisis in America in the 1930s. I will not waste time by going
into the reasons for that crisis. Nevertheless, it was a sensible thing

ground, because Amendments 21 and 51, in the names of my noble friend

that we have encountered face to face in this country in the past few

who appeared to be competent, whom the regulators seemed to

rule of financial theory, which is that there is always a positive

this was systematic. It was not just one bad apple, or one bad
individual. In the process of trying to preserve their yields, banks
were putting enormous amounts of their assets into new instruments such
as CDOs—collateralised debt obligations, which were, basically,
securitised mortgages and other loans—without ever investigating
what they actually contained. They acted simply on the basis
of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:29:22"></hs_TimeCode> endorsements
by rating agencies that were themselves incompetent. It is hard to
imagine the state of Denmark being more rotten than the state of the
City at that time. It was an extraordinary systematic problem. People
were, for example, lending on real estate with 5% or less equity. They

entered the legal profession about 40 years ago, the branch
that I joined had no rules of conduct at all, and gradually we
appreciated that the public would not stand for that. The position now
is that the legal profession has rules of conduct, although they are
sometimes called codes rather than rules for 
<?notus-xml column=1341?>the reason that was mentioned. I support the
amendment against that background. I also suspect that, if we do not
take that step now, we will have to take it in five or 10 years’
time when some other crisis emerges. It is an important step and, I
respectfully suggest, an inevitable one, in line with what all the
professions have had to deal with over the past 10 or 20 years in
modernising how they behave and making their behaviour acceptable to
the public. There is a lot to be said for the amendment against that
background<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:34:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:34:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McFall of Alcluith" PimsId="5780" UID="13112667000582" xid="2053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000582">Lord

run away with the idea of codes of conduct because, if you look back

the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, if we heard the

it 10,000 times. We were told that there was new management and a new

staff—and that everything would be better. Since we have taken

lack of individual responsibility at the top is at the core of the
problem. I say this with no understatement: many of the very senior
individuals who came before the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards were economical with the truth. I give an example on PPI,
where we now have a scandal of about £25 billion to £30
billion. There was a “no see, no tell” policy from those
at the top. Why? Because they preferred to be seen as incompetent than
to have any responsibility. There was a hiatus of responsibility from
the top to lower

own view was not accepted by the banking commission, which was fair
enough. I thought that every year there should be an individual meeting
between the chairman and chief executive of a bank and the regulator.
That meeting would be recorded but it would not be made
public—but they would have to attest to the regulator that they
were responsible for their institution and what went on in their
institution was their responsibility. If we implement a code, we will
only repeat the mistakes of the past; there has to be a deeper cultural

with codes. We need to give the regulator authority—and we have

would like first to respond to the concern that the Government’s
Committee stage amendments did not implement the commission’s
recommendations for what it calls the licensing regime. To be
completely clear, the Government are committed to implementing the vast
majority of the commission’s recommendations on the regulation
of individuals in banking, including its recommendations to introduce a
licensing regime. The regulators, in their responses to the commission
published in October, confirmed that they would do

Government’s amendments in Committee put in place all the
essential features of the commission’s licensing regime
proposals in Clauses 22 and 23. These clauses give the regulator power
to make rules of conduct imposing binding standards on employees and
ensure that the regulators can take action when there is any breach of
these rules. The relevant provisions would form part of FiSMA and
confer powers on the regulators in the normal

that this may not be seen as giving the full weight and impetus to the
commission’s proposals, so we are looking to see whether we can 
<?notus-xml column=1343?>bring forward at Third Reading amendments which will
highlight the proposals more and put beyond doubt the determination
which we all share to see real change in this area. In the light of
this, the Government are looking to introduce amendments at Third
Reading to impose obligations on banks and PRA-regulated investment
firms, first, to verify before appointing someone as a senior manager,
an employee in a role that could do significant harm to the firm or
another role requiring regulatory pre-approval, that the person is fit
and proper to perform that role in the

maintain up-to-date lists of such persons which could be made available

and, fourthly, to notify all such persons of the banking standards
rules that apply to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:43:04"></hs_TimeCode>. All these
obligations will be regulatory requirements under FiSMA. Failure to
comply with the obligations will be a breach of regulatory
requirements, and actions could be taken against the bank concerned by
the regulators. In addition, deliberately or recklessly submitting a

Government will also look at tabling amendments requiring, rather than
simply empowering, the regulators to set out those functions for which
a bank must do the above. We anticipate that this class will match the
category of staff defined in the PCBS report as being those whose
actions or behaviour could seriously harm their employer, its
reputation or its customers. I hope that when we produce those
amendments they will satisfy the concerns addressed by the most

are certain detailed respects in which the Government have decided not
to follow the recommendations of the commission. These do not change
the substance of the impact of the regime, but they will ensure its
effectiveness. First, the commission envisages that the licensing
regime provisions would entirely replace the regime of regulators,
giving pre-approval to people below senior management level. That would
mean dropping regulatory pre-approval for all appointments below senior
management level, including in areas such as money laundering, with
which the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, and others were particularly
concerned in
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:44:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:44:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government thought carefully about that but decided it would not be
appropriate to remove entirely the possibility of regulatory
pre-approval below senior management level. There may be critical roles
in banks at lower levels with important responsibilities in relation to
protecting consumers, maintaining market integrity or preventing
financial crime where prior regulatory scrutiny of appointments
continues to be essential. The FCA will therefore also be able to
require prior regulatory approval of appointments of persons who are to
perform control functions designated in their
rules<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:45:15"></hs_TimeCode>. Both the
Government and the FCA support the philosophy behind the
commission’s proposal that regulatory pre-approval should be
required only for 
<?notus-xml column=1344?>senior roles. We expect that for banks the
regulators will over time substantially reduce their pre-approval
requirements for individuals who are not senior management.
Further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:45:28"></hs_TimeCode>, I can
confirm that the PRA will not be able to designate any functions except
senior management functions as requiring regulatory

I am aware that another concern of the members of the parliamentary
commission is the name of the regime. The commission itself has spoken
of a licensing regime, and we are happy to use that term as an informal
title for the new regime. However, we do not believe that it is the
right description for the regime the commission recommended. Anybody
coming across the term “licensing regime” would naturally
assume it meant that a licence would be granted by a regulator or some
other public authority. That is, however, precisely what the
parliamentary commission did not want.</hs_para>

hope that in any case we can all agree that the name given to the
regime is not the most important thing. What matters is what it does.
The regime we have legislated for cannot be called a licensing regime,
but it delivers precisely what the parliamentary commission called for
in its report. There will be a regime of regulatory standards for
employees encapsulated in enforceable banking standards rules. Firms
will inevitably have a role in ensuring their staff comply with those
standards and taking action if they do not, while the regulator will be
able to take action if

the sort of people who can deliver a banking industry of which we in
Britain can once again be proud.</hs_para>

should make it clear that Amendment 21 is not in any way contrary to
Amendments 50 and 51 by the commission; it is complementary. It adds to
the overall structure of the requirements to be met by those who seek
to pursue a banking profession. It is that word
“profession” which we regard as central. It is no
accident that we have labelled our amendment “Professional
standards”. That is what this amendment seeks and that is what I
believe it would achieve in addition to, and complementary to, the
amendments by the commission and, as I hear it, the endeavours by the
Government to develop a framework of rules which ensure that standards
are met. The professional 
<?notus-xml column=1346?>standards must be the bedrock. That is why I have moved
Amendment 21 and why I wish to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13112667000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000130">5.53

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, this group of amendments, and similar
amendments in the previous group, respond to concerns expressed in
Committee that the scope of the reform of the senior managers and
banking standards regime should be extended beyond ordinary banks to
cover what are known, in common parlance, as investment banks. A number
of noble Lords were concerned about this point and I undertook to relay
the feelings of the House to ministerial colleagues. These amendments
are the
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000040">The
definition that we propose is that of the UK investment firms that are
regulated by the PRA as well as by the FCA. This captures all those
investment firms the activities of which—above all, substantial
wholesale market dealing in securities as proprietary
traders—are systemically important. These are the most important
City firms, and consequently would be treated by the senior managers
and standards regime in the same way that banks are. It therefore
excludes all investment firms that are regulated solely by the
FCA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000041">The noble
Lord, Lord Turnbull, tabled an amendment to a different part of the
legislation that would have used the existing definition of
“investment firm” in FiSMA. This would have encompassed
investment firms solely regulated by the FCA. As explained in
Committee, that would cover a wide range of ordinary investment
firms—several thousand, in fact. This would include firms far
outside what most people would think of as investment banks. The
Government have shared this definition with the members of the PCBS and
are hopeful that the scope now captures those firms that the PCBS had
in mind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000042">Noble
Lords who have had the opportunity to read the paper placed in the
Library yesterday know, as the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, has pointed
out, that it covers only nine further firms. They also know also that
it covers the investment banks that everybody has heard of and would
expect to see covered. The small number may be surprising, but the
reason for that is simple. Many firms that would be thought of as
investment banks will already have a deposit-taking permission, so they
will already be covered by the 
<?notus-xml column=1350?>definition in Clause 24. That definition is already broad enough to
catch all retail and wholesale banks, whether ring-fenced or not. It
covers any UK institution which has the permission to take deposits. It
does not cover big City institutions which are not deposit-taking
businesses. These amendments will bring them into the scope of the
senior managers and banking standards regime. I beg to

Money-laundering, in its widest sense, never goes away. By “its

purpose of this group of amendments in my name and that of my noble
friend Lord Watson is to identify as clearly as possible a legislative
framework within which our banks can be regulated and monitored so as
to achieve one of the Financial Conduct Authority’s objectives:
to preserve the integrity of the British banking system. I
will deal with them briefly. Amendment 26 deals with a scope
of responsibility of senior management so as to specify, in a very
broad
phrase,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13112667000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000122">“a

28 deals with two issues: redundancy and specificity.
“Redundancy” is in inverted commas because it was
suggested in Committee that these changes were entirely unnecessary.
Plainly, the Financial Conduct Authority and everybody else have a duty
to obey the law—of course they do. However, equally, legislation
has a component in it that should be designed to relate the existing
law to the specific responsibilities to be carried out. No harm is done
by such identification, and clarity is achieved. Nobody can say that
they did not
know<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:13:30"></hs_TimeCode>. On
specificity, subsection (4)(a) of proposed new Section 59ZA in
Amendment 28 deals with a general provision for dealing with these
schemes that might produce criminal liability. Paragraph (b) sets out
the main statutes under which such activities can arise. Paragraph
(b)(viii) makes clear that the FCA and the PRA themselves can refer to
other relevant statutes, regulations or the like as they think
appropriate and are specified in their
rules<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:14:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000048">Amendment
30 is an attempt, in substance, to achieve the objective of making all
persons responsible who engage in money-laundering activities, so that
there are no loopholes between different levels of staff and
management. Amendments 45 and 47 would provide that the FCA and PRA
should, in the banking standards rules, make rules about
money-laundering similar to the effect of what these amendments seek to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:15:08"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:14:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13112667000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000132">6.15

that the velocity with which this legislation is being managed by
government managers is certainly not matched by the capacity of the
Treasury officials and Ministers to keep up on the days on which they
have to explain what is going on. That certainly makes it extremely
difficult for us, when dealing with matters of such grave importance,
to be able to ensure that debate is comprehensive. Therefore, the noble
Lord, Lord Newby, having stated in Committee a month ago that he would
write to me to explain why my amendments were unnecessary, in a way did
so at 9 pm last night, when an e-mail arrived from a Treasury official
which enclosed a note from the Financial Conduct Authority. I hope that
he has had time, as I have this morning, to read it, if it
represents government policy on the question.</hs_para>

important piece of information from the Financial Conduct Authority
about money-laundering in a moment. However, it refers to the annual

Authority, published in July of this year, which I had not previously
seen. The Financial Conduct Authority was set up with effective powers
on 1 April this year, eight months ago. That is certainly long enough
to find out what the problem is and its scope, but probably not long
enough properly to devise all the measures that are necessary to combat
the problem.

report says that, in seeking to achieve its objective of integrity in
our financial system, the Financial Conduct Authority will issue annual
reports to meet the increasing public interest in this problem.
Finally, they will do everything, in so far as they can, with
transparency. Those are excellent objectives.</hs_parafo>

turn to the note, which I assume is what the Government intend the
Financial Conduct Authority to do. First, it says that combating this
problem is a “priority”. Secondly, it
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13112667000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000120">“Our

it will “take enforcement action”, as it has done against
two banks; one last year, one this year. Finally, it will seek to
intervene early. In the light of this note, as I understand it, it is
the Government’s view that the Financial Conduct Authority
should police this sector without further statutory change. I invite
the Minister to confirm the following: first, that the Government have
no reason to doubt the reliability of the annual report’s
conclusions; and, secondly, that they undertake properly to finance the
anti-money-laundering group in the Financial Conduct Authority. It has
about 100 cases a year and polices 14 major banks and many other firms;
yet the group, by the end of this year, will have increased its
staffing numbers from 17 to 22. That is an extraordinarily low number
of people to combat such complicated and wide-ranging money-laundering
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:21:08"></hs_TimeCode>. Is
there to be a financial
commitment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:21:06"></hs_TimeCode>?
Lastly, on the note itself—put out last night as, I presume, a
summary of the Government’s view of what should be
done—will the Government say clearly whether it is their policy
that that which is set out in this document is what the Government
intend should be done by the Financial Conduct Authority on behalf of
all of us in combating

to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan. Money laundering
affects not only the areas that have been mentioned, but in my 10
years’ experience of dealing with conflict management and
mitigation work in Africa, it was particularly significant in the ways
in which illegal regimes or militias managed to fund and supply
themselves. My experience, particularly in some parts of Africa, has
shown that London, over time, as one of the deepest and most liquid
financial markets on earth has, contrary to the impression given by
many senior bankers, played a significant role—not through their
collusion in any way at all, but because of its size and the complexity
of preventing it. I believe that this amendment and the suggestions put

that any bank has to pay extra-special attention to any of our

mind—and I have great sympathy with the noble Lord’s

armaments, for terrorism and the rest of it, does not particularly come
from an ordinary British family living in a suburb. It comes very much
from parts of the world where such things are more prevalent. There 
<?notus-xml column=1354?>is a case for requiring a more judicious
anti-money-laundering regime for any form of transfer that comes from
such parts of the world in an analogous fashion to a PEP if we really
want to get to grips with the horrific money-laundering that can come
from some parts of the world, causing misery to citizens there. As

Watson of Invergowrie (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to
associate my name with all five amendments in this group, but I also
want to speak to some extent about the FCA note which appeared at about
9 o’clock yesterday evening—typically late in the day,
not just literally, as regards the progress of this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:29:24"></hs_TimeCode>. I
reiterate the point made by my noble friend Lord Brennan that the
Government have provided no grounds for reassurance that their
amendments adequately deal with the serious issue of anti-money
laundering. The fact that the Minister’s promised letter of
comfort has not materialised demonstrates that the House should be
concerned by the absence of any coalition assurances on this crucial
issue. I am not sure whether the FCA note is intended to be in place of
such a letter, and I will come on to that later. However, I
said in Committee that not only were the Government naive to assume
that the amendments we tabled then were unnecessary, they were also
complacent. I very much regret to say that the failure to
produce the letter setting out the Government’s position which
my noble friend Lord Brennan was promised clearly suggests that that
complacency remains
intact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:30:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000064">We
also heard in more general terms in Committee about the devastating
human cost caused by the banks’ failure to comply with
anti-money-laundering laws. That has not been mentioned this evening
but it bears repeating: it is not just a question of what happens in
relation to the financial sector in this country but also of money
laundering that often amounts to the state looting of developing
countries’ aid and haemorrhages billions of pounds from their
national budgets, trapping millions of the world’s poorest
people in extreme poverty. However, as mentioned in the previous
debate, it also threatens the economy of the UK. The integrity of our
financial system is hugely compromised by banks failing to prevent
access by the worst types of criminals from around the world, whether
they be corrupt dictators, drug smugglers, arms dealers or 
<?notus-xml column=1355?>terrorists, as other noble Lords have said. This shows that the stakes
could not be higher. I wish that that were reflected in action taken by
the Government to counter this problem. It makes their lack of
willingness to deal meaningfully with the issue quite unfathomable.
Their continuing naivety is potentially dangerous. I apologise for
using the word “naivety” again but I feel that I have to
do so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000065">As the
noble Lord, Lord Phillips, rightly noted in Committee, should there be
any doubt, following the Minister’s letter, about whether the
Government’s amendments adequately dealt with money laundering
or not, the House should err on the side of caution and choose the
alternative amendments. We now know that no such letter has
materialised. My noble friends and I have taken great care to move new
and refined amendments which reflect the extensive and helpful debate
in Committee. In stark contrast the Government have not even offered
the explanation they promised. This should leave the House in no doubt
as to which set of amendments should be
favoured.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000066">I
turn to the note from the Financial Conduct Authority that appeared
yesterday evening. My noble friend Lord Eatwell said in his opening
remarks on Amendment 3, I think, that everything seemed to be done at
the last minute as far as the Bill is concerned, and that has been very
much the pattern since it first appeared. It is unhelpful in terms of
enabling noble Lords to respond meaningfully to new information or,
indeed, to draft amendments. It is not clear whether the FCA note on
its anti-money-laundering supervision and the new senior managers
regime proposed in the Bill is in lieu of the Minister’s letter
to my noble friend Lord Brennan, as I said earlier. That letter was
intended to outline why the latter’s amendments seeking the
explicit inclusion of anti-money laundering in the new senior persons
regime and other personal liability mechanisms were unnecessary because
the government amendments implicitly did this. However, I submit that
the note does not achieve what is required; namely, a guarantee that
the FCA will include anti-money-laundering compliance as a key risk and
make every bank name a senior banker with personal responsibility for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000067">The
FCA’s note is largely about what it does and has done, and even
refers to what the FSA did. There are just two paragraphs at the end
which focus on the proposed new senior managers regime. As the Bill
stands, this could give the FCA the power to hold named, individual
senior bankers accountable for failures to uphold key standards and
risks. However, it seems to me there is a loophole in the Bill which
means that it will be left open to the FCA’s interpretation as
to whether it uses this power and insists that anti-money-laundering
compliance should be one of the issues covered. The note does not
indicate that the FCA will include this. It uses terminology such as,
“We will consult”, “This will allow firms”,
and it, “will help regulators”. These are key phrases in
any document but I suggest that they are weak, possibly ambiguous and
certainly open to interpretation. I believe that the word
“consult” simply means that the outcome is by definition
not certain. We should require firms to do something, which is a
stronger word than “allowing” them to do
something<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

fundamental to the way we deal with anti-money laundering. Instead of
the phrase, “for example, anti-money laundering systems”,
we should state unequivocally, “including anti-money-laundering
systems”. The language that is used is permissive and uncertain
rather than being mandatory, which is what I and the noble Lord, Lord
Brennan, seek to achieve with these amendments. The content of the note
is disappointing and it would be helpful to have clarification of

money-laundering in financing terrorism has given it an added

Lord, Lord Brennan, seeks to impose. These amendments would expand the
scope of the senior managers regime to include all persons who are
responsible for ensuring that a firm complies with specific obligations

at which they
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112669000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112669000003">No one

amendments would bring subordinate staff with relevant responsibilities

confusion at least and is contrary to the PCBS recommendation to narrow
the senior persons regime to very senior people, and parts of the
regime, such as the reversal of the burden of proof, make sense only
when applied at the senior level. It is not necessary to bring
subordinate staff with specific responsibilities for financial crime
within the senior managers regime in order to ensure that these staff
are subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny. It will still be possible
for the FCA to ensure that appointments of persons to be
money-laundering reporting officers, for example, will be subject to
prior regulatory scrutiny and approval under the approved persons
regime, if that is considered appropriate, and then subject to rules
and standards applicable to their 
<?notus-xml column=1357?>role. This is because the approved persons regime is being retained for
financial services firms that are not banks. It is also being retained
within the banking sector for appointments below senior management
level. The Government have always considered this necessary as there
may be critical roles below senior management level with important
responsibilities for consumer protection, market integrity or
preventing financial crime where prior regulatory scrutiny of
appointments remains
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112669000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112669000005">In
addition, of course, the regulators will have the ability to make rules

persons and senior
managers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112669000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112669000006">There
is also no need to refer explicitly to breaches of the criminal law to
bring senior managers with relevant responsibilities within the scope

a function can be designated as a senior manager function if a person
holding it would be responsible for aspects of the bank’s
business that could involve serious consequences for the bank, or for
business or other interests in the United Kingdom. There is no doubt
that a serious breach of criminal law could have serious consequences
for the firm as well as for other people. So senior managers in this
area would be covered by this new
regime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112669000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112669000007">The

FCA was properly financed to undertake the level of activity required
for it effectively to fulfil its responsibilities under the rules on
money-laundering. The FCA budget, as he will know, is funded by the
sector as a whole. The FCA is therefore unconstrained, in practical
terms, regarding its budget. It is for the authority to determine the
resources that it thinks it requires and it can then get them. So no
budgetary constraint is imposed on the FCA which reduces its ability to
employ as many staff as it feels it wants in this area. Thirdly, he
asked whether the FCA represented government policy. The FCA does
represent government policy. I am sorry that the note was transmitted

be of some minor comfort to know that since Committee I have had a

money-laundering with greater rigour than had been the case in the

concentrated on 
<?notus-xml column=1358?>now, is that the FCA has to do its job properly. As I say, it is putting
more resources in and is being, as it states in its list of objectives,
more intensive and intrusive. Secondly, as we have discussed in
relation to a number of other areas, the banks have to accept that they
must adopt a zero tolerance approach to money-laundering. It is clear
from the evidence which the parliamentary commission received, and from
much other evidence, that this has not always been the case. I believe
that the banks are giving a priority to this that they have not done in
the past. Is it adequate? It is a great improvement, but it will take
some time to be fully clear about whether it is adequate. However there

junior staff and every attempt is made to ensure that senior staff are
not allowed to use the fault of junior staff as an excuse for their own
responsibility. That is what that amendment is plainly directed at. It
makes the senior management’s job crystal clear. It is necessary
to consider what the Minister has said in reply and, for the moment, I
beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13112669000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112669000020">Amendment 26

controlled function in relation to a regulated activity of an

further section to the 2000 Act, Section 64A, which gives the Financial
Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority power to make
rules of conduct for approved persons. Clauses 15 and 22 have given
rise to concern from the Law Society as to how their provisions impact
on the duty of Scottish solicitors to maintain confidentiality in all
their dealings with their clients. As your Lordships will be aware,
solicitors in Scotland are regulated by the Law Society of Scotland.
They are bound to observe their professional obligations and are
liable to be sanctioned at the instigation of the Law Society
if they fail to meet those obligations. The duty of confidentiality is
set out in detail in the Law Society of Scotland’s Rule B1.6. It
places a duty on solicitors not to disclose information about their
clients, including 
<?notus-xml column=1360?>communications between solicitor and client unless permitted by the
client, or compelled by a court or Parliament to do so. This ethical
duty of maintaining confidentiality provides for checks and balances,
as a solicitor is never the final judge as to whether the information
must remain confidential. Legislation and court process, as well as
client consent, provide means by which information might legitimately
be disclosed. The policy considerations behind this rule of
confidentiality are that the rule affords full and open exchange
between clients and their lawyers. It also helps to ensure that full
and frank advice is
provided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000089">Legal
professional privilege, which is also mentioned in the amendments, has
a similar, albeit not identical, effect. It protects from disclosure
confidential communications and evidence of those communications
between a professional legal adviser and their client, provided the
communications are for the purposes of preparing for litigation or the
client seeking and receiving legal advice. For these purposes, the
tendering of legal advice is not confined to informing a client what
the law is; it includes the solicitor or counsel involved giving advice
as to what action the client should prudently and sensibly take in the
relevant legal
context.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000090">The
need for these amendments was, as I have indicated, identified by the
Law Society of Scotland, having consulted a number of its members. It
sent earlier drafts of the amendments to among others, the Treasury and
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, the
Advocate-General for Scotland. The Law Society and I are grateful to
the Treasury and indeed the Advocate-General for responding to that
approach and giving us an indication of the Government’s
thinking on the issues involved. Before saying a few more words about
the details of the amendments, I think it right to note that other
regulatory bodies in the United Kingdom which have members who are
either solicitors or counsel may have similar interests in the subject
matter of these amendments.</hs_para>

support of Amendment 27 to Clause 15 can be put very shortly. They
relate to the terms of the new Section 59 of the 2000 Act. Those
provisions appear to open up the opportunity of legal advice given to a
bank by a solicitor being deemed, whether by the Financial Conduct
Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority, as amounting to the
taking of decisions or
alternatively,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13112667000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000123">“to

a serious management function should be carried on. If such a view
could be taken of the actions of a solicitor, such actions could be
deemed to provide a factual basis for determining, in terms of
new Section 59ZA(1) of the 2000 Act, whether a function within
a bank is a “serious management function”. The Law
Society is concerned that such events might lead to an erosion of the
distinct professional relationship between solicitor and client and the
obligations that solicitors undertake to provide advice to the
client.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13112667000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000092">What
is unclear from new Section 59ZA(3) is whether the Government intend
that such solicitors, advising on legal issues alone, will also be
considered as having participated in the taking of decisions. The Law
Society of Scotland considers they should not be and it believes 
<?notus-xml column=1361?>that that should be made clear in the Bill. That is
what Amendment 27 seeks to achieve. If the Minister takes a different
view, I am sure he will recognise that this issue is a concern to
members of the legal profession in Scotland and I respectfully invite
him to explain to your
Lordships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:59:30"></hs_TimeCode> his
reasons for doing so, so that those lawyers will be made aware of
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112667000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#13112667000093">The need
for Amendment 49 arises out of Clause 22, which was
introduced into the Bill on the second day in Committee. It would
insert a new Section 64A into the 2000 Act, which would grant power to
the regulatory authorities, the FCA and the PRA, to make rules of
conduct for approved persons under Section 59 of the 2000 Act and
persons who are employees of banks. Both categories could include
solicitors, counsel and advocates in different parts of the United
Kingdom. They would be under duties of confidentiality and legal
professional privilege with regard to communication between agent and
client.</hs_para>

seems abundantly clear that the rules of conduct made by the regulatory
authorities could conflict with the duty of confidentiality on
solicitors and with legal professional privilege as they are understood
and apply in Scotland. Amendment 49 is designed to resolve any
potential conflict. In particular it provides in the proposed new
Section 64A(12)(b) that in the application of new Section 64A of the
2000 Act in Scotland, no professional legal adviser, either advocate or
solicitor, could be required, under the rules of conduct made by the
FCA or the PRA, to answer any question that he would be entitled to
refuse to answer by virtue of any rule of law relating to
confidentiality. In that important respect, it adds to the protection
currently afforded to professional legal advisers by Section 413 of the
2000 Act, which severely limits the extent to which a person can be
required under the 2000 Act to produce, disclose or permit the
inspection of protected items. What Section 413 does not do
is make any reference to a lawyer refusing to answer a
question<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:59:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Section 413 of the 2000 Act as currently drafted would not entitle a
solicitor in Scotland to refuse to answer questions posed in terms of
rules of conduct made by either the FCA or the PRA, even though
answering those questions would breach their duty of confidentiality to
their client. The Law Society accordingly seeks to have this issue
clarified. The society’s view, with which I agree, is that it is
important to ensure that rules of conduct made in terms of new Section
64A of the 2000 Act do not place a solicitor who is either a senior
manager or employee of a bank in a position where there would be a
conflict between his or her duties under the rules of conduct and his

amendment is in response to government amendments to the Bill which
amend the Financial Services and Marketing Act 2000. The amendment
would require the Treasury to commission a review to provide an
opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the regulators,
particularly the FCA, in implementing and effectively enforcing new
powers in relation to individual standards rules and the licensing
regime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000005">The
amendment should allow for recommendations that may include the removal
of powers from the current regulators or further separation within the
current body. That would potentially allow for aspects covering
licensing and individual standards rules to be considered for
moving across to an independent professional body, should that be
appropriate. That echoes the amendment that we on the Labour Front

the competing priorities for resources—which have the potential
to be compounded with the inclusion of consumer credit regulation in
2014 and the payments system regulation, if approved—there is
the concern that the FCA may struggle to carry out this challenging
role it faces. Therefore, an independent review can assess the
effectiveness of the FCA and PRA in being able to implement the
recommendations made by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards and, in doing so, provide feedback on how this can be
improved, and whether it is more effective for the oversight and
enforcement of the professional standards to be undertaken by a
genuinely independent professional

more than 150 government amendments alone and just three sittings to
discuss them, it is impossible to give them the amount of scrutiny that
we would have wished. Therefore, it is sensible to ensure that
mechanisms are in place for an independent review of both the
FCA’s and PRA’s implementation of these changes. There
are more than 50 actions, such as reform of the register and
remuneration, with which the Government tasked the FCA and PRA in their
response to the PCBS recommendations that do not require legislative
scrutiny. There are also areas being included in the Bill that empower
the regulator to develop and implement rules and enforce them. Given
that the regulator in its previous incarnation of the FSA failed to
hold anyone responsible for scandals such as the mis-selling of payment
protection insurance, it is prudent to ensure that the reforms work
effectively and that any amendments are made to maximise the protection
of consumers. Indeed, the PCBS in its final report, <I>Changing Banking

practices under review too. I expect also that the Treasury Committee
in the other place, and possibly also the Economic Affairs Committee in
your Lordships’ House, will want to keep such matters under
review. Nothing, of course, stops the Treasury from commissioning
reviews of these and other matters, if it thinks it appropriate. All

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, we now move to a group of government
amendments which pertain to the scope of the offence relating to a
decision that results in bank failure. This offence was introduced
through amendments to the Bill in response to a recommendation by the
PCBS. As tabled in advance of the debates in Committee, and building on
the FiSMA definition of “bank”, the offence would have
applied to retail banks and building societies. This meant that all
deposit takers except credit unions were
covered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000017">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:26:14"></hs_TimeCode>
discussed in earlier debates on the scope of the senior managers
regime, the Committee debate on 15 October has prompted the
Government to reconsider this position. In the light of the persuasive
arguments put forward in that debate, we are amending these clauses so
that the offence may be committed not only by senior managers of a
bank, but by senior managers of relevant authorised persons.
“Relevant authorised person” is defined by government
Amendment 106 to include banks and those investment firms that are
regulated by the PRA as well as the FCA. These are known as systemic
investment firms, because their large size means they have a
significant impact on the wider financial sector.
Smaller<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:26:50"></hs_TimeCode>
investment firms will continue not to be covered by the offence. This
is because, like credit unions, they do not represent a significant
risk to taxpayer funds, or to financial stability, and their failure is
very unlikely to lead to serious harm to customers.</hs_para>

had in mind. I hope that these amendments fully meet the House’s
concerns on the matter.</hs_para>

with that. He gave us a reason that these investment banks, or these
investment institutions, might be a potential liability for the
taxpayer. I hope he will withdraw that. It is very important that there
is no taxpayer liability there. The reason we wanted it expanded is
that we were concerned about banking standards, which was what this
commission was all about: banking standards and culture. That is why it
is necessary that there should be this regime for these banks, not

McDonagh (Lab):</Member></B> It might help the House if I explain why I
have asked for this debate. I live near St Helier and St
George’s Hospitals. The A&amp;E at St Helier
Hospital, which had 80,000 visits last year, may be closed. It is a
regular district hospital. St George’s is not a
regular hospital, but a regional and national trauma centre,
specialising in strokes and coronary care, with very high unit costs.
If St Helier were to shut, we all know locally that the people of that
area would go to the A&amp;E in St George’s—costing more,
blocking beds and destabilising the hospital. That is because hospitals
make money on their elective procedures and tend to lose money on
emergency care. If you change that ratio, you soon put the hospital
into the red. The London Borough of Merton commissioned some
independent research and found the same thing. The researchers said,
“We questioned CCG board members quite closely regarding their
understanding of the baseline financial activity and quality position
in Merton. We did not find a good understanding of the current resource
position, nor how these resources 
<?notus-xml column=1373?>were being used, and how such use would be compared
to other parts of London and England as a whole”. I do not blame
them for that, as they probably cannot get hold of the information in
the rest of London or England. They go on to say, “Without a
thorough assessment of these issues, there is a high risk of taking the
wrong or even counterproductive action. For example, if financial
problems are caused by high unit costs at St George’s, it makes
no sense to close St
Helier”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000023">I
took my local knowledge, together with my understanding of what is
happening to the NHS nationally, particularly around A&amp;E, and put
two Questions down. One Question asked how many A&amp;E departments had
been closed by the Government since they came into office in 2010. The
answer came back, “We don’t know”. I asked how
many A&amp;E closures were currently under consultation. The answer
came back, “We don’t
know”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000024">Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:33:26"></hs_TimeCode>
I could explain tonight to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and to the
Government, why it is important that they know how many A&amp;Es they
have, where those units are and how many are closing. The clue is in
the title: National Health Service. The Government are responsible for
the oversight, costs, management and planning of the health service. To
do that, you need to know where your A&amp;Es are. When A&amp;Es close,
maternity units normally follow. The Government are responsible for
seeing that there are enough beds for mums to have their babies. They
also tell us, because they have the figures, that the population is due
to increase to 70 million—so shutting maternity units is
probably not a good idea. You also need to know where the A&amp;Es are
because, when you shut an A&amp;E, other clinical services close with
them. If you shut St Helier A&amp;E, you will also shut the regional
renal unit. According to the evidence, you also reduce ITU beds and
medical beds; hospitals cannot then meet their elective
targets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000025">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:34:03"></hs_TimeCode>
Government also need to know, because—I do not know if this is
shocking—they are responsible for disaster and emergency
recovery planning, and generally it is a good idea to know where the
A&amp;Es are. They are also responsible for sending out the latest
advice and, again, you cannot do that if you do not know where the
A&amp;Es are. Lastly, the closures of the four A&amp;Es that have
already happened have led to unintended consequences, and you need that
information for forward public policy-making. We are getting worse
results, it is costing more and the care is worse. All in all, it is a
lose-lose situation. Closures are not working, largely because they
have been built on six terrible government reforms, which are resulting
in systemic failure in the NHS. No money announced today or two-tier
A&amp;Es will make a difference to
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:35:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000026">The
first of the reforms that have led to the problems that we now face is
the Government collapsing all targets. Then there is the terrible
reform of giving GPs the NHS budget, which took from front-line
services, and cost the Government, £3 billion. The Government
have also overseen the closure of one-quarter of all walk-in centres,
and Monitor says the future for the rest is dicey. They have also
overseen cuts in the adult social care bill of £1.8 billion and
cuts to aids and 
<?notus-xml column=1374?>adaptations, so that we are seeing record numbers of elderly people go
into hospitals through A&amp;Es, who cannot then get out because the
aids and adaptations have not been made. The fifth and sixth reforms
were shutting NHS Direct and introducing the terrible 111
service. Doctors and nurses are leaving in their droves, and the
Government have spent an extra £120 million on
emergency medical locums compared to before. All these reforms have led
to a threefold increase in attendance at A&amp;Es, and now more than
one in four people who go to A&amp;Es are being admitted. If the
ministerial health team were doctors, they would be struck

I look into this, I cannot decide whether it is incompetence or
ideology that is driving these changes. I fear that it is a dangerous
cocktail of both. For me, it is perfectly legitimate in a democracy to
be against a national health service, but you need to be honest about
that, and it is important to have a debate. I will start that debate by
answering my own questions. Four A&amp;Es have been closed since 2010
and a further 15 face closure, which means one-third of all
A&amp;Es in the M25 area will close. Last week, NHS England announced
that a further 60 A&amp;Es out of 197 will close. Tomorrow, the A&amp;E

Patel (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, in my three minutes, I will
make some brief comments that will lead up to some questions
for the Minister. In my view, the pressures on A&amp;E departments are
but one component of wider pressures in the NHS. There is a disconnect
between A&amp;E and other departments in hospitals, such as diagnostic
and in-patient services, which, in contrast to A&amp;E, are both geared
to a five-day, nine-to-five working schedule. Added to that of course
is the fragmented nature of patient services in the community, which
leads to bedblocking and further pressures on A&amp;E. We will have to
address the problems of A&amp;E, and the Keogh report goes some way to
doing that, but the problems in A&amp;E will not be solved by focusing
on just one aspect of the service. The whole system needs to be
co-ordinated and to work
seamlessly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000030">Figures
show that the main pressures on A&amp;E come from people with long-term
conditions. This in turn leads to pressures on in-patient services.
This is due in part to poor access to primary and community care. What
is needed, as has been discussed on many occasions, is better

tendency to refer someone to A&amp;E immediately rather than to look at
what care might be given closer to the place of the incident or
to a person’s home. In my day we looked to the district nurse,
who seems to have disappeared from real life, or the retired doctor

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my
noble friend Lady McDonagh for initiating this, albeit brief, debate. I
plan to use my three minutes to focus on one point. Before I do so, I
will say that it is hard to look aside from the mounting problems of
A&amp;E departments, spoken to powerfully by my noble friend and
evidenced by the number of patients waiting longer than four hours, the
numbers waiting on trolleys, the increase of bed days lost because of
delayed discharges and staffing problems. A&amp;E departments
undoubtedly are struggling to cope. All of this is exacerbated, as
identified by the Health Select Committee, by the inadequacy of
information about the nature of the demand placed on the
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:45:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000040">There
has been hardly any focus in the wider debate on accident prevention in
the first place. Prevention would be investing to save: to save on pain
and suffering, even death; to prevent days lost at school or work; and
to save costs to the NHS, A&amp;E and the welfare
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:45:39"></hs_TimeCode>. The
current chaos compels us to be radical. At least one-third of the
nation’s A&amp;E attendances are the result of accidental
injuries. There are millions of injuries every year that are 100%
preventable, according to the Office for National Statistics. These
injuries are rising as a significant proportion of the overall pressure
on A&amp;E because we have stopped investing in the tried and tested
antidote. We should not be negligent about the safety of our citizens,
our duty to our health professionals and the very future of our
National Health
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000041">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
country’s longest-standing safety charity, the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Accidents, of which I am delighted to say that I am
now president and in respect of which I declare my interest, has
already shown what can be done. In Liverpool, for example, it ran a
home safety scheme, working with disadvantaged families with children
under five. Equipment such as stair gates, fireguards and blind-cord
shorteners were fitted in the homes of those most at risk. Parents were
given practical advice to help them keep their children safe. This is
not rocket science. The result was that A&amp;E admissions for zero to
five year-olds plummeted by about 50% over two years—against the

is no doubt that increased funding for accident prevention initiatives
and a task force to co-ordinate national action could lead to a major
reduction in the number of deaths and injuries and the call on A&amp;E
departments. The answer is not just more resources or different
approaches to treatment, but an alternative that is staring us full in
the face. Accidents are the main cause of preventable early death for
most of our lives, costing the state £20 billion to £30
billion each year. Given all this, is it not time that we rediscovered
that prevention is always better than

Manzoor (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the first choice of most people
who think that they need urgent medical attention is to go to their
local hospital’s accident and emergency department. I understand
that, as A&amp;E departments are trusted by the public as a place of
expertise and knowledge. However, as we know, our hospitals and A&amp;E
departments are under significant pressure to treat all those who come
through their doors. On top of this, the Royal College of Surgeons
states that A&amp;E departments are understaffed by around 10% and that
in some trusts, such as Barking, Havering and Redbridge University
Hospitals NHS Trust, the figure is as much as 43%. The understaffing of
A&amp;E departments is a serious

the disgraceful events at Mid-Staffordshire hospitals, the Government
have given their total commitment to putting patient care first and
ensuring that patient safety should always be paramount. However, it is
clear that running A&amp;E departments that are under-resourced and
poorly staffed poses a high risk to patient care and patient safety.
This issue needs urgent attention by the Government and the NHS health
board and I look forward to the Minister’s response on the plans
that the Government have to rectify this and the timescales
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0002.htm#1311271000045">I too

also read the July 2013 survey findings from the NHS Confederation,
which found that its members thought three main solutions could lead to
fewer pressures on A&amp;E departments. The first was more money for
primary and community care. To this, I would add more extended primary
care out-of-hours services provided by GPs. These could be sited in
hospitals or perhaps close to A&amp;E departments. This would enable
GPs to work in much greater collaboration with hospital A&amp;E staff
and could provide the patient with much needed seamless care.</hs_para>

pressure money for hospitals should be allocated sooner. I would
further argue that this money should be part of hospitals’
general allocation so that they can plan service delivery for all their
services in a more effective, planned and co-ordinated way. Thirdly,
there should be a public-facing campaign about all the alternatives to
emergency departments, but these alternatives must provide a good

Trust Development Authority and Monitor, on the continuing
design of the interfaces, roles and responsibilities of organisations
in the new system. For example, stroke care in London, which has been
centralised into eight hyper-acute stroke units, now provides 24 hours
a day, seven days a week acute stroke care to patients regardless of
where they live. Stroke mortality is now 20% lower in London than in
the rest of the UK, and survivors, with lower levels of long-term
disability, are experiencing a better quality of life. That is why we
must allow the local NHS to continually challenge the status quo and
look for the best way of serving its
patients<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T20:15:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000094">I
turn specifically to accident and emergency departments and points
raised by a number of noble Lords. The NHS is seeing more than 1
million additional patients in A&amp;E compared to three years ago and,
despite this additional workload, it is generally coping well. I can
say to the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, that we are meeting our four-hour
A&amp;E standard and have done since the end of April. The latest

have heard many noble Lords describe the current situation as a crisis.
I do not share that perception. The NHS is performing well under
pressure. Dealing with an extra 1 million patients in A&amp;E does,
however, mean that we must look at the underlying causes. Providing
urgent and emergency care for people is not just about A&amp;E. It is
about how the NHS works as a whole and how it works with other areas
such as social care, and how it faces up to the challenge of an ageing
population of more people with long-term conditions. Therefore, the

gratified to see so few people in the Chamber. I drafted two amendments
in this area of the Bill and found to my astonishment that the Public
Bill Office had converted them into 10. The excess is not due to lowly
endeavour. Their quantity does not overcome their simplicity, which is
designed to improve the drafting of this section; the section creates a
major new criminal offence in respect of
banking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000110">I
draw the attention of the House to the following facts. First, because
it is a criminal offence in nearly all circumstances it would have had
full attention from both Houses. Secondly, however, in this
Bill’s history, this offence was not in the original Bill before
the other House. It is a criminal offence of a major kind that will
have serious attention only from this House, because, thirdly, if it
goes back to the Commons in a shuttle process it is hardly likely to
receive the appropriate attention that it would otherwise merit. That
is an important
question.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000111">As
the House agreed when this first came up in debate, one of the main
purposes of the draft offence was to phrase it to create a major
deterrent just by its 
<?notus-xml column=1388?>wording. Of course people who transgress can be punished, but one would
devise this kind of offence in order to deter people from thinking of
committing it. Therefore, its wording is extremely
important—more than in most circumstances. Many criminal
offences are the result of spontaneous behaviour. This offence is
directed at what you might call systematic
misconduct.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000112">With

The word “activity” is defined as behaviour or actions of
a particular kind, whereas “way” is much more nebulous.

amendment is straightforward. Amendments 88, 91, 93 and 99
carry on its usage in other parts of the clause. Amendment 105 makes

consequential amendments stand apart from what I shall add. It is a
simple and sensible

Amendment 95, when you are dealing with corporate activity and the
decisions or activity of a group of individuals that lead to a major
event such as the failure of a bank, all that imports a mixture of
events and circumstance. Therefore, with that background, one must be
very careful in a legal context about using just the word
“cause”. You face the inevitable argument from
defendants: “I may have done something wrong, but it
wasn’t the real cause”. Most statutes that deal with this
kind of issue use words like the ones in this amendment or in the
amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips,
“cause”, or “contribute significantly to”.
That wording prevents defendants inviting juries and judges to enter
into philosophical discussions about the extent of causation by virtue
of the acts that were committed. That is extremely important; when it
comes to a trial we deal with juries, and we want language that will
enable them to come to common-sense conclusions. I suggest to the House
that this is a commonsense amendment; the amendment in the name of the
noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is to the same effect but with slightly
different wording. Therefore, that also stands

next issue is recklessness. The noble Lord, Lord Deighton, on opening
at Second Reading, said that this created an offence of
“reckless misconduct”. The terms of the offence do not
use the word “reckless” as we identified it on the
previous occasion. That is extremely important, because at Clause 80(6)
in the same Bill the intended statute creates an offence of
recklessness. It actually uses the word “recklessly” to
describe a certain action. It can be guaranteed that 
<?notus-xml column=1389?>lawyers will argue that if a statute uses the word in one clause but not
in another, then where it was not used it was not intended. How could
Parliament describe two offences as having the same effect, using the
word “reckless” in one but not in the
other<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T20:37:33"></hs_TimeCode>? That

Supreme Court authority on the word “reckless” in this
kind of offence. The appropriate authority to look at is R v G in 2004.

intention of that case was to produce a definitive meaning of the word
“reckless” for general criminal law. Therefore, let us
test that standard set by the Supreme Court against the present
wording, to determine whether it meets the current judicial test and
whether it should match that test or if there is justification for a
different test. This offence differs from R v G in three

“far below” only creates criminal liability for the most
egregious acts or omissions—disastrously bad mistakes which jump
off the page. That is what “far below” imports. This, to
many, would strike one as an extraordinarily lenient way of approaching
people who ruin a bank—that they should only be liable if they
have been guilty of the most stupid and egregious mistake. That

second point, by way of a difference to the case of R v G, is that the
risk to be guarded against by the people involved is the failure of a
bank. Therefore, to favour such conduct with a narrow test—the
most egregious conduct—appears to be unwarranted in social
justice terms. Why should this test be narrow? If, as I understand it,
the offence is intended, despite my suggestion to the contrary that it
does not in Committee, to involve wilful blindness—people
deliberately avoiding looking at the risk— how is a judge or a
jury going to assess somebody who is wilfully blind so as to be totally
unreasonable, compared to somebody who is wilfully blind in the most
egregious of circumstance? It is a complete paradox of terminology. You
are either blind to the risk or you are not. The concept of extensive,
as opposed to minimal, wilful blindness is absurd. It is an invidious
distinction and will produce serious confusion. The fact that it is
used in corporate manslaughter terms is not to the point. As I
indicated in Committee, a corporate manslaughter event is usually an
explosion, a building collapse, or a crane falling

Eatwell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, having listened to my noble
friend Lord Brennan and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, I found this
discussion quite disturbing. The creation of a criminal offence is one
aspect of the Bill that pushes forward the regulatory regime
in the UK and creates an environment more suited to the
somewhat cavalier nature of finance in a global marketplace—in
particular by identifying those activities that have inflicted enormous
harm upon our fellow citizens. What I heard was that, as drafted, the
probability of securing a conviction or even a prosecution, as the
noble Lord, Lord Phillips, put it, is vanishingly small. Unless the
terminology is clarified in a way laid out so clearly by my noble
friend, this part of the Bill will simply bring that aspect of
regulation into disrepute because it will be worthless. That is why I
regard the remarks that I have heard from the two distinguished lawyers
who have just spoken to be very disturbing. It is incumbent upon the
Government not simply to produce a pat answer here this evening but
again to produce a carefully written assessment of the case for an
appropriate criminal regime and its implementation in order that the
whole House has an opportunity to assess this important aspect prior to

Newby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments essentially aim to
make three changes to the criminal offence: first, to allow defendants
to be prosecuted under the offence when a number of decisions taken
together cause the bank to fail; secondly, to enable the offence to be
made out when the decision or decisions in question were a significant
contributory factor to 
<?notus-xml column=1392?>the failure of the bank, rather than its sole cause;
and, thirdly, to include within the definition of bank failure the
systematic failure of the bank to prevent liability with regards to
broader criminal
offences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000130">On
the first two issues, while I understand noble Lords’ concerns,
I assure them that these amendments are not necessary to deliver the
effects they intend. First, I assure noble Lords that, as a matter of
law, under Section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1978 words in the
singular include the plural unless express provision is made otherwise.
The term “decision” includes “decisions”,
plural. Therefore, where appropriate, it will be possible to
prosecute on the basis of the implementation of a number of decisions.
The Interpretation Act 1978 ensures that it is not necessary to repeat
the defined terms or make express provision for the singular to include
the plural in every single statute. The case for abandoning that
practice seems rather minimal in this
instance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000131">Moreover,
in practice we generally expect a prosecution of the offence to focus
on one individual decision in order to maximise the ability of the
prosecution to make its case effectively when asking the jury to
consider what are likely to be very complex events. This would enable
the prosecution to focus on the causal relationship between the
implementation of one decision and the failure of the bank, where that
relationship seems to be most clear. In these cases, any other relevant
decisions would be taken into account by the jury as the circumstances
in which the key decision was taken, when the jury was deciding whether
the defendant’s behaviour fell far below that which reasonably
could be expected of him or her. For example, a decision to take on a
risky acquisition may be more or less reasonable depending on earlier
decisions to strengthen or weaken the bank’s capital
position.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000132">These
amendments also include references to agreeing to the carrying on of
activities by a firm. This would add nothing to the offence as
currently drafted, since the reference to agreeing to the firm carrying
on certain activities assumes that those activities in some way require
authorisation and this must involve taking a decision, or agreeing to
the taking of a decision, by or on behalf of the firm, and is therefore
already included in the offence.</hs_para>

94, 95, 100 and 102, under general principles of criminal law the test
for an action having “caused” an event to occur is that,
had that action not been taken, the event would not have occurred.
Therefore, in this specific offence the test is that, if the decision
or decisions in question had not been implemented, the bank would not
have failed. The implementation of the decision need not be the sole or
even the main cause of the bank’s failure. In practice, because
of the evidential standard that applies to criminal cases, we expect
that cases will be prosecuted only where it is very clear that the
implementation of the decision or decisions in question was a
significant contributing factor to the failure of the
bank.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000134">In
addition to these general points, the Government oppose some aspects of
the amendments in principle. As well as including reference to
“activity”, Amendment 97 would lower the bar of the
reasonableness test for when the offence would be committed. As set out
in Committee, the Government do not think this is 
<?notus-xml column=1393?>appropriate. Referring to conduct which is far below that which would be
expected has precedents in the Law Commission proposal for a statutory
offence of killing by gross carelessness and in legislation creating
the offence of corporate manslaughter. We have used this particular
phrase knowing that it works and can be effectively interpreted by the
courts. There is no precedent in UK criminal law for criminalising
behaviour that is merely unreasonable. To do so would amount to an
indiscriminate diffusion of criminal liability, in a way that made it
hard for individuals to know with sufficient certainty when they might
be committing an offence.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1311271000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000135">Amendment 118 would
expand the definition of institutional failure that would trigger the
offence to include occasions where there was a systematic failure of
the bank to comply with a range of laws imposing criminal liability in
connection with the conduct of financial services business. A similar
amendment was raised in Committee, focused specifically on compliance
with the Fraud Act 2006, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 or the Money
Laundering Regulations 2007. The Government’s position on this
remains unchanged—this offence has been introduced to plug a gap
in existing legislation where there are no criminal powers available to
sanction senior managers who have recklessly caused their banks to
fail. By definition, criminal liability can arise where offences
already exist that individuals can be convicted for and appropriately
punished, depending on the seriousness of the breach. In certain cases,
they can also be charged with consenting to or conniving in such
activities. It is difficult to see how this amendment strengthens the
offence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T20:57:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311271000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000136">The
noble Lord, Lord Brennan, raised the question of the definition of
“way”. The expression includes both the activities in the
business and how those activities are carried out. This makes the
offence broader. The noble Lord also suggested, if I understood him
right, that in some cases the real risk is that people did not know
what risk they were taking or wilfully turned a blind eye. While it
might appear attractive to include incompetence by senior managers in
the offence, doing so could introduce unwelcome and potentially
damaging uncertainty into the sector. Further, to comply with the
European Convention on Human Rights, the offence must be sufficiently
certain to enable individuals to know when they are at risk of
committing the offence. However, this does not mean that it is possible
for a senior manager to simply close their eyes to the risk the bank is
taking. In some cases a court may decide that it can be inferred that a
particular person had knowledge of a risk. In the case of a director,
ignorance of a risk to the bank’s existence may, in some cases,
be to admit to breaches of the duties under the Companies Act 2006.
Accordingly, there are cases in which an argument that a defendant had
no knowledge of a particular risk would carry very little credibility
and could even expose the defendant to criticism for breach of
duty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T20:59:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

extremely seriously as a key part of the new infrastructure that we are
putting in place and we believe that it meets the test we have set out.

what a judge and jury would expect by way of argument. I am sorry to
put it so bluntly, but it really is a clash with the Interpretation Act
that would lead to ribald laughter in most criminal chambers. I am
being serious about this. It is the kind of argument that you would
expect to get from a bright lawyer with no criminal law experience. The
Government must face up to this. I do not understand why they cannot
take advice from a competent independent Treasury counsel on the scope
of the offence in order to make sure that they can prosecute, or at

point by point. First, why should not the statute say decision and/or
decisions—one of the two? Secondly, why, as the noble Lord has
suggested, do we have to get ourselves into the circumstance of having
to identify the key decision? It may be extremely difficult to do that
because it may be a refined banking judgment where a series of acts or
decisions which led to failure may be cumulative and not the result of
the key decision. Thirdly, how the word “cause” in the
criminal law can be construed to be “significantly contributed
to” is not, I think, something that figures in the criminal law

turn next to corporate manslaughter. The argument has to be met. The
fact that you get the same words in another statute is of no importance
until you consider the context in which the words are being used. Far
below that, in the industrial safety context, is the matter of common
sense. In terms of banking behaviour, it is an extremely complex
exercise to expect a jury to carry out, and an unnecessary one. The
answer given in response to the amendments did not include any
explanation of why this statute is taking itself down a
different route from R v G. Wilful blindness is a specific criminal law
phrase designed to embrace the people who deliberately close their eyes

agreement with my noble friend Lord Eatwell, who is known as an

unlikely to be in place before the end of 2016. That would mean
millions of the most financially troubled people continuing to

installing a cap could happen in parallel with the Competition

28% of all borrowers have one or more rollovers, and a full 50% of
payday lending revenue comes from rolled-over loans. Rollovers should
be banned. We should do here what they have been doing in Florida for
the last 11 years. In Florida, no loan may be taken out until any
previous loan has been settled in full; and no new loan may be taken

various allowances but, before they know it, the pressure builds up. So
what starts as a £500 transaction can multiply into
£1,000 fairly quickly. They cannot afford to pay the bill, so
they go to a payday loan company—I will not mention their

facilities at an exorbitant rate of interest. What starts with the wish

“Newsnight” yesterday evening, they would have seen a
disturbing feature concerning Wonga; the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, did
not want to name companies, but this company was named in the

principles defined by the Government, but it is up to the Government to

McFall of Alcluith (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords,
Amendment 178 concerns continuous payment authorities. This
is an issue that I raised during the passage of the Financial Services
Act 2012. Continuous payment authorities are a recurring payment
mechanism involving a debit or credit card where the debtor gives his
or her card to the company and they contact the bank. Unlike direct
debits or standing orders, this allows a firm to take regular payments
from a customer’s bank account without having to seek express
authority for each payment. When I made this point to the Minister, the
noble Lord Lord Newby said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1311271000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000315">“abuse

groups, the Law Society and the OFT have expressed ongoing concerns
about this issue.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T21:23:20"></hs_TimeCode> real issue
is that the debtor—the customer—is not in full charge of
their affairs. The continuous payment authorities do not offer the same
guarantee as direct debits or standing orders. In effect, they give the
company authority about how much is taken from an individual’s
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T21:22:13"></hs_TimeCode> and
when. This is hugely important to those who take out payday loans,
whose financial 
<?notus-xml column=1401?>position is tenuous. Unlike direct debits and
standing orders, there is no written communication between the
individual and the bank. This situation has led to the banks reviewing
up to 30,000 complaints from customers since 2009. According to the
Financial Conduct Authority, quite a number of those will be eligible
for compensation. That authority has said that many of the banks or
providers are not cancelling recurring payments to payday loan
firms.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311271000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-0003.htm#1311271000163">Last

so now. I did not see “Newsnight” but I read about the

two sons in their 20s. I have no idea whether they take out payday
loans but I know that at some point in the next six years one
or both of them might think of getting a mortgage—if they keep
working hard. It does seem demonstrably unfair that someone taking out
50 quid for a payday loan today could be automatically denied a
mortgage in six years’ time. If the noble Lord will permit
me, I propose to draw that to the attention of the

payday loan and paid it off rapidly. I do not know, for example,
whether that rule applies to somebody who has taken out a loan under
the traditional method of door-to-door payday-type loans that we had in

the guidance around the use of CPAs from the outgoing regulator, the
OFT, into binding FCA rules. Several of the provisions set out in the

rules governing regulation of payday loans in the UK reflect our own
unique national characteristics. The FCA will be charged with doing
that, building on the international evidence and examination of the UK
market, and drawing on the Competition Commission’s analysis
among other things. Therefore, while I share the noble Lord’s
commitment to ensuring the UK consumers are protected when they borrow
from high-cost lenders, I hope that he will agree that the best way to

is not simple and is not easy to understand—and it costs three

carefully at Florida and assuming that there is something that we can
really learn here, no matter the differences between the two
jurisdictions. However, I am very grateful for the Government’s

My Lords, the purpose of these regulations is to
implement legislative flexibilities introduced by the EU’s
micros directive, which are now incorporated in the new accounting
directive. This directive sets an important precedent in European
company law. It recognises the need to reduce burdens on our smallest
companies to a more proportionate level and creates a new category of
company, the micro-entity. A micro-entity company is one which, at the
end of the period to which its balance sheet relates, does not exceed
two of the following conditions: having a balance sheet
total—that is, a gross assets total—of £315,000;
having an annual turnover of £632,000; and having an average
number of 10 employees during the financial year.</hs_para>

1.56 million micro-entities in the UK. Many are engaged in business at
a local or regional level. They are significant contributors to the UK
economy, creating employment and developing new economic activities,
but they are burdened by detailed accounting requirements, from
requiring a detailed breakdown of figures in the profit and loss

uninformative information on share capital. In <I>The</I> <I>Plan for

companies must comply with the same financial reporting rules as other
small companies, which may be 20 times bigger. The Government do not
believe that this is necessary for most micro-entities. We should
remember that our current financial reporting requirements are meant to
address the information needs that exist between the shareholders and
the management of the company, where there is a separation between its
ownership and management. For micro-entities, there is often no such
separation of control. That is because many micro-entities are
owner-managed. Indeed, research has indicated that approximately 45% of
these companies have only one shareholder, and that often the owner is
the only employee. Therefore, the statutory financial statements are
not necessary for the communication of the company’s
performance. The burdens associated with comprehensive financial
reporting requirements may be disproportionate and yet offer no real
benefit. Why should they produce pages of financial data when they are
not going to make use of them and no one else is really
interested?</hs_para>

a number of options for member states to consider but it explicitly
recognised that member states would need to assess how these options
complemented their financial reporting regimes. I will put this in
perspective. France and Germany have already adopted lighter-touch
reporting regimes for their smallest companies and others, such as
Denmark and Poland, are considering doing so. The flexibility offered

views on the implementation on the various parts of the exemption and,
as the directive allows, the regulations will, first, enable
micro-entities to prepare and publish simple, highly abridged financial
statements and, secondly, relieve micro-entities of the obligation to
produce the full notes to the accounts, provided that specified notes
are placed at the foot of the balance sheet. These are limited to
information around commitments by way of guarantees, and any advances

consultation identified two issues, however, which prompted significant
concerns. The first was the application of the true and fair principle
in relation to micro-entity accounts. Several respondents noted that
the micros exemption would allow directors to state that the
micro-entity accounts gave a true and fair view of the company’s
financial position, provided the accounts complied with the directive.
Respondents questioned how this could be achieved, given the
much-reduced nature of those accounts. They argued that this would
conflict with the UK approach, where company accounts are considered to
provide a true and fair view only if they are prepared in accordance

certain types of financial and investment bodies, for example credit

micros. Charitable companies are also excluded. This follows discussion
with the Charity commissioners, who wished such companies to remain

retaining the higher level of transparency expected by those who donate
to important causes through charitable

Earl of Erroll (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I will ask a quick
question. This issue occurred in relation to something else where there
were exemptions for small companies, SMEs or micro-companies. It is in
the definition of companies that qualify as micro-entities. The third
criterion that can be applied is the number of employees: not more than
10. It then talks about averaging the number of people in contracts of
service. If you employ two people part-time—for instance, one
who has young children and wants to take them to and pick them up from
school, and the other who is retired, say, and happy to fill in for the
rest of the day—you are employing two people, but you only have
one full-time equivalent. In that kind of situation, or with people
working seasonally or casually, this criterion could discriminate
against small employers who are trying to get several people all doing
a bit of 
<?notus-xml column=500?>part-time work for them, because the number of employees could then
easily exceed 10. Therefore, it should probably be worded as full-time
equivalents in future. I will not suggest anything here, but I want to
flag up the general point to regulation-makers that it would be fairer
on small entities if there was some way to bring it back to full-time
equivalents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000016"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Donaghy" PimsId="5770" UID="13112654000147" xid="2046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000147">Baroness

easier for small businesses. I have often felt that the definition of
small and medium-sized enterprises that fits in with the European

company in the UK, so to recognise micros in this way is more than
welcome.</hs_para>

flexibility of the definitions of turnover, balance and staffing,
referred to by the previous speaker. I hastily looked through both the
impact assessment and the regulations and could not find anywhere how
the updating of the turnovers and balances will take place. What length
of time is considered reasonable? I believe that the issue of part-time

Cope of Berkeley (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I just wanted to welcome
this provision altogether. As my noble friend the Minister said, in
some respects it is a first step that many people—myself
included—have been urging for a very long time. It is
particularly welcome because it flows from work done by the European
Union and in Brussels, where there has long been an initiative to
improve matters for small firms. “Think small” has been
the watchword. It has not produced an awful lot of actual benefit, but
this provision will produce a worthwhile benefit to a lot of very small

I am a director is a charity, and, as my noble friend said, charities
are excluded from these regulations. I think that is correct because,
after all, one has to consider who has an interest in looking at the
accounts. Obviously, those who have an interest, even in very small
companies like this, include the shareholders, the employees and the
others involved, as do those who might be thinking of lending them
money or otherwise advancing credit to them and doing business with
them. In the case of a charity, it is those who give money to the
charity who have the biggest interest in ensuring that the money is
spent on the charitable object that they have in mind when they give
the money. Therefore, I think it is right in this statutory instrument
to exclude charities, and I welcome

welcomes the statutory instrument. I will make one comment and then
pose a number of questions. First, my comment may be slightly
tongue-in-cheek, but this is all about helping very small companies.
The impact assessment identifies transitional costs of, I
believe, 
<?notus-xml column=501?>just below £500,000 for businesses and £200,000 for the
public sector, which is very good as they are very small numbers.
Therefore, it is perhaps a surprise that it took BIS 24 pages to be
able to get to that. I hope that it was not really expecting all those
small companies to be able to read all that and submit views. I should
think that it took up a fair degree of civil servants’ time to
go through the document that I now see arranged in front of

the questions that I should like to pose are quite important, if not
substantial. First, why was the consultation only three weeks long?
That seems to be in breach of Cabinet Office best practice,
particularly given that, in the words of the noble Viscount, Lord
Younger, serious concerns were raised. Indeed, the explanation shows
that the responses were only broadly supportive, so three weeks feels
like an unnecessarily rushed

this instrument builds on a joint BIS/FRC paper of two years ago. It is
not clear to me whether the consultation this year was, similarly,
carried out jointly with the FRC. If it was, that is fine; if it was
not, it would be useful to know the FRC’s views of the

issue of charitable companies, which has already been raised. I am very
content that these companies are finally to be excluded, but it was
slightly worrying that the summary of responses from the March
consultation did not specifically mention whether charities had
submitted their views. I know from some of them that the very short
timescale precluded them from responding. Now that they are to be taken
out, it would be useful if the Minister could outline the views of the
Charity Commission—the regulator—if not of the charities
themselves.</hs_para>

he possibly let us know what the Charities Aid Foundation, the Charity
Finance Group and the NCVO feel about the exclusion of charitable
companies from the regulations? I have no problem with that, but it
would be a bit unfortunate if the charities concerned did not share the
view of either the noble Viscount or the Charity Commission. It would
be helpful if he could assure the Committee that the needs of small
charities have been properly considered. Has the Charity Finance Group
asked the FRC, which obviously has a greater responsibility in the
drawing up of reporting standards, to consider the needs of small
charities? It would be useful to know whether there is a work stream on
this in either BIS or government.</hs_para>

all, it would be helpful if the Minister could explain why, at the same
time as the Government are taking these very welcome steps—and,
as I said, we do welcome them—they are pushing through the
lobbying Bill, which will add extra reporting and accounting
requirements for a swathe of charities. On the one side, there are
small companies, rightly, having fewer 
<?notus-xml column=502?>requirements on their reporting and, at the very same time, we have a
Bill that is going to add reporting and accounting requirements for a
large number of charities, including some which, under this definition,

additional level of bureaucratic reporting and auditing? It will
involve additional systems of checking, as well as additional
reporting, and that will add costs and paperwork for trade unions. This

My Lords, in moving the Renewable Heat Incentive
Scheme (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2013, I start with an apology.
These regulations correct earlier amendments made in April and
September to the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2011, as
after further scrutiny of them some minor corrections proved necessary.
I am, as always, extremely grateful for the opportunity to speak to the
Committee, and am always grateful to your Lordships for helping the
Government deliver a robust set of regulatory controls for the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000042">Before
I expand on the purpose of the regulations and why the corrections they
deliver are now warranted, I reassure noble Lords that I spoke in good
faith 
<?notus-xml column=505?>during the earlier debates and that our policy intent was correctly
reflected in the draft regulations. In ensuring that we were absolutely
sure of policy interest, we ensured greater scrutiny and, in doing so,
recognised that minor corrections were
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000043">The
non-domestic RHI scheme has now been in operation for two years. Over
3,500 applications have been received to date, with around £68
million-worth of RHI payments expected to be paid out in the next year.
Installations that have already been accredited have generated 497
gigawatt hours of renewable heat, and biomass has performed
particularly well under the scheme. My department will shortly publish
details of scheme improvements to drive uptake across the full range of
technologies. This will include the outcomes of a review into existing
tariff levels. Detailed plans have also been announced for a domestic
scheme to open from next spring, which I know has been warmly welcomed
by many. We are on track to deliver this
commitment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000044">The
RHI remains a vital component in the Government’s strategy to
increase the amount of energy delivered from renewable sources by 2020.
It is helping to achieve this by incentivising installations that
produce heat from renewable sources. By doing so, it will help to
reduce the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. The introduction of
the domestic scheme and improvements to the non-domestic scheme next
year will also move us closer towards our goal of working to eliminate
greenhouse gas emissions from our buildings by
2050.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000045">In
earlier debates we focused on two complex yet important changes to the
RHI. Those changes were vital if the scheme was to be successful in its
aims to provide value for money and protect our environment. In March
we debated the mechanism to control spending under the scheme until
March 2015. It is crucial that taxpayers’ money is spent
appropriately. In July we debated the introduction of emissions limits
for biomass boilers, so that the quality of our air is protected, among
other measures intended to reduce the scheme’s complexities. The
House agreed to both sets of
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000046">I
will now speak about the corrections needed to the regulations that
govern these two policy areas. The first of these corrections is to
ensure that the budget management policy—or cost control
mechanism—for the scheme is able to operate as intended. The
policy reduces existing tariff levels if the uptake of renewable heat
technologies is more than expected and the scheme spend is estimated to
be greater than the budget can afford. Tariffs are then
reduced—or degressed—where there is strong market growth
as a way to cool
uptake.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000047">The
Government published the full and correct policy explaining how the
mechanism should work in February of this year. The regulations debated
in March were believed to deliver this policy in full. Subsequently, we
detected a small part of the policy detail that was not accurately
reflected in the regulations. However, I am keen to reassure the House
that where the policy has not been fully reflected in the regulations,
this has not resulted in any adverse impact. This is because the
situation that is incorrectly accommodated in the regulations affects
only a high market growth scenario occurring after an earlier
degression. Such a scenario has not happened to date. There has been no

<?notus-xml column=506?>impact on tariff levels and so all applicants who have successfully
applied to the scheme have received the tariff as intended by the
policy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112654000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000048">The
framework for the financial mechanism is very detailed, which is why
this error occurred. This level of complexity, as noble Lords are only
too aware, is necessary as the regulations must set out exactly how we
will keep spending on the RHI within budgetary limits. Because of this,
it is vitally important that we reduce tariffs by an appropriate amount
where needed, and the regulations must be specific in how we will
calculate what an appropriate amount is.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112654000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000049">The regulations specify
that a reduction is applied where expenditure limits—which are
often called triggers—are hit. To avoid overreducing tariffs,
the level of a first reduction is set at a rate of 5%. The manner in
which this reduction can be applied is correctly set out in the
regulations. Indeed, we applied the regulations in this regard to the
medium biomass tariff in
July.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000050">The
regulations then allow reductions to double in size each quarter from
5% to 10%—and from 10% to 20% if growth rates demand it. It is
this aspect of the policy where the regulations do not reflect the
policy intention. I alluded to the fact that a scenario where the
application of this part of the policy would be needed has not yet
occurred, but because there remains a possibility that it might occur,
it is important to amend the regulations now.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112654000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000051">The policy is
purposefully flexible, and a higher rate of reduction is not automatic.
My department will examine the impact of an earlier reduction applied
to tariffs and ask itself, “Has it had an impact? Has it started
to slow down deployment?” If the answer is no, a further or
higher rate of reduction can subsequently be
applied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000052">The
regulations define the tests to be applied in this assessment of when a
further reduction is needed. It is the tests in Regulation 37D(2)(c) to
(e) that contain the discrepancy with our policy intent, and which we
are now amending. The regulations as they stand require much higher
growth rates in expenditure to occur between two quarters before a
further or higher rate of reduction can be applied to
tariffs.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112654000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000053">As I
said, the rationale for this approach was to build greater flexibility
into the system and also to control spend. If we cannot apply the
correct level of reduction, we risk breaching the budget. We then risk
not being able to support some installations in future, which will
damage the scheme as a whole. I therefore hope that the Committee will
be able to support this minor correction.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112654000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000054">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:06:32"></hs_TimeCode>
second minor correction I will speak about relates to air quality
emission limits for biomass boilers. I have already said that biomass
has performed very well under the RHI, but burning biomass clearly
raises questions for some: for example, how do we ensure that
pollutants from biomass fuels are controlled? Regulations were debated
by this House in July that introduced measures to tackle this issue.
Your Lordships supported those changes, for which I am extremely
grateful.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=507?><hs_para UID="13112654000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000055">Specifically, in
relation to air quality standards, those regulations require applicants
to provide an emissions certificate demonstrating that specified
criteria are met. The certificate provides evidence that the
installation does not exceed the stated emissions limits, that testing
has been carried out by a certified test house and sets standards
following a specified
method.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000056">The
issue with the existing regulations relates to the specified standards
against which testing must be carried out and to the issuing of
compliance certificates. Simply put, certificates cannot be issued for
some biomass boilers, regardless of whether they meet the emissions
limits set out by the policy.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112654000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000057">Paragraph 9 in Schedule
A1 to the regulations sets out standards to which tests must be carried
out for measuring particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. Those
standards are suitable only for some biomass boilers, particularly
those that cannot be tested by standard BS EN 303-5. As worded,
paragraph 9 wrongly requires those standards to be applied to the
testing of all biomass boilers. That makes it impossible to issue
compliance emission certificates for boilers that are unable to be
tested by those alternative standards. The latest regulations correct
this error so that the most suitable standards can be used for
testing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112654000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000058">It
is vital that we amend that, as the issue currently impacts on
approximately 49% of all applicants to non-domestic RHI, given the high
uptake from biomass technologies. We have worked with Ofgem to ensure
minimal disruption to applicants in the light of that error. All
applicants who may be affected are being advised at the point of
application that there could be a small delay to their accreditation
date, due to the air quality requirements. Ofgem has agreed to work
through all applications as normal up to the point of accreditation,
which will be dependent on a valid RHI emissions certificate. Those
that cannot meet this requirement will not be rejected but held until
the regulations are
amended.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000059">Before
I conclude on that issue, I wish to draw the attention of the House to
an additional regulation which will not apply if these changes are made
before 1 January. These regulations offer protection to applicants who
have applied under the current regulations but cannot meet the required
standards through no fault of their own. Their application can be
accredited by Ofgem only once the amending regulations are made. It is
possible that a tariff reduction could be announced by my department
before then, and our next quarterly degression announcement, due to be
published by the end of this month, will confirm that. It would not be
right for those applicants to receive a lower tariff due to this error,
and this addition simply seeks to ensure that it does not
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000060">In
conclusion, the measures contained in these regulations are needed so
that the correct policy can be applied in all instances. These
corrections will ensure that the RHI scheme delivers renewable heat in
the most cost-effective manner, as well as ensuring that emissions from
biomass have minimal impact on air quality. While I am extremely
apologetic for these minor errors, I am confident that the dedicated
work by my department in identifying and correcting any 
<?notus-xml column=508?>areas of uncertainty will help us to maintain our strong relationships
with stakeholders, which is a great strength for us
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000061">I
reassure noble Lords that my department has examined the process it
follows when making regulations and is undertaking changes internally
to ensure an improved quality assurance regime that will help to
minimise the likelihood of such errors in the future.

Worthington (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Baroness for her explanation. We have debated the RHI regulations on a
number of occasions and have all noted that they are very complex in
nature. Therefore, I thank the Minister for her clear articulation of
these two minor amendments. We are grateful for the spirit in which the
regulations have been brought forward and we of course accept that
these minor corrections should be agreed to. However, I will take this
opportunity to ask the noble Baroness some questions in relation to the
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:12:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112654000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000063">We are expecting
announcements in the autumn—I think that that was what was
stated—and I am interpreting that as meaning before Christmas.
It is important to note that the regulations that we have debated have
been very complex and technical in nature, and they have mainly focused
on the Government’s almost paranoiac fascination with trying to
make sure that we limit the amount of money that we pay out through the
scheme. However, the figures show that, overall, we are massively
underspending in relation to this policy. The noble Baroness said that
£68 million was expected to be spent this year. That is against
an annual budget of, I believe, around £251 million. Therefore,
obviously less than a third of the budget is likely to be spent this
year. Why is that? Can the noble Baroness indicate whether perhaps we
have been focusing all our energies and efforts on trying to reduce
incentives? Given the numbers, it seems that this policy is failing to
bring forward sufficient
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:13:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question not just of the money that is spent but of the impact that
that money has. I only have the figures for 2012, but in that year our
renewable heat stood at around 2.3%. We need to get to around 12% in
2020 in order to be compliant with our overall legally binding European
renewables targets. Can the noble Baroness give me any indication of
where we are likely to get to at the end of 2013 after this £68
million has been spent? Are we making inroads into that
target<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:13:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

we are expecting more announcements, and those will be very welcome. We
look forward to what I hope will be good, thorough debates once we have
those announcements. I am sure that that will be when Ministers are
able to outline improvements and we will see an increase and uptake in
this scheme.</hs_para>

announcements are, as has been described, technical corrections. The
explanation that has been given is valid and we agree with it. Air
quality, which is covered in one of these technical amendments, is of
paramount importance. We are pleased that this error has been spotted
and made good. As the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=509?>said, this applies to a number of applicants. I think 49% of applicants
will be caught by it, so it is good that it is being dealt with and
corrected in a timely
fashion.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13112654000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000129">4.15

comment is that the scheme sits on the public accounts. Much has been
made in recent debates in the other place about how different
Governments approach energy policy. The fact that this sits on the
taxpayers’ books does not mean that it never takes off or
delivers. There is a temptation for micromanagement and ever-increasing
levels of complexity, which stem from a wrong assumption that if a
technology or category of technology is going well, that means we are
overpaying and must throttle back. That assumption that success equals
oversubsidy is dangerous. It might well lead to the outcome that
anything that gets going and gets momentum behind it gets cut off at
the knees, and we never successfully allow market forces to be
applied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000068">Those
market forces would, by their very nature, find the most efficient and
profitable solutions, yet because this is being managed out of the
public purse, we are in danger of having too much micromanagement and
not allowing the market to select the most cost-effective solutions
because we are proceeding on a false assumption that popularity and
scale of uptake equals oversubsidy. It might well be that it is a very
popular technology that has fewer non-market barriers to its uptake. I
hope that we can guard against that and that we will see significant
announcements soon on how the scheme will be improved so that we will
see increased uptake and more progress towards our
targets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000069">Finally,
I hope that this does not foreshadow what we are going to see in the
broader market when we discuss contracts for difference and strike
prices. This policy can be very complicated and difficult to
understand, and investors may find it difficult to get their heads
around it to perceive where the supply chain is in the market. If this
is anything in the nature of a foreshadowing, we will need a very
different approach or we will be in danger of seeing underspend there,
too, which would be a very significant outcome

long-term commitment to putting low-carbon energy supply in the system

noble Baroness raised. Given the measures we have taken, we will be
able to see greater competition among the range of technologies. Part
of that will be to see whether we need to put in the same support as we
currently provide. There is no wish prematurely to withdraw the support
we currently provide to any technology if it is giving a constructive,
positive return. However, it is in our interest to ensure that where 
<?notus-xml column=510?>technologies have matured enough not to need as much support, that
support is gradually withdrawn. It means that those technologies are

noble Baroness asked about underspend in the policy. It has been
steadily growing since April. Of course, we have a long way to go, but
we are going in the right direction. The useful thing about a policy
that grows steadily is that we can identify whether a review is needed
and whether it is making progress in the right direction—and, if
not, what more we can do to better the policy. I am not sure that it is
a bad thing for it to grow at a slower pace because, as often as not,
identification of things that are not going as well as they could be

the local elections order and then come on to the European
parliamentary election regulations. The local elections order makes
important changes linked to local government reform in Northern
Ireland, and I have a detailed set of remarks to cover its
extent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000077">As
noble Lords will be aware, local government in Northern Ireland is
undergoing significant reorganisation, part of which involves reducing
the number of local councils from 26 to 11. The Northern Ireland
Executive 
<?notus-xml column=511?>is responsible for the reform programme, but elections to local councils
are excepted, and so are the responsibility of the UK Government. The
Northern Ireland Executive asked the Government to support the reform
by bringing forward the date of the local election by one year and
facilitating a transitional period until 2015, during which councillors
elected to the new councils will serve in parallel with existing
councils.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000078">The
order makes changes in four main areas. First, it delivers a
transitional period; secondly, it makes temporary changes required only
for the 2014 elections; thirdly, it makes consequential changes to
polling districts and places for parliamentary elections; and,
fourthly, it allows the local election poll to be combined with the
European parliamentary
poll.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000079">I will
now briefly explain the changes being made in each of those areas. The
order brings forward the date of the next scheduled local election in
Northern Ireland by one year to 22 May 2014. The transitional period
will run from the fourth day after the election until 31
March 2015. The order provides that the new councils will come into
their full powers on 1 April 2015 but will be able to exercise powers
in relation to limited transitional issues in advance of that date. For
example, that would include taking decisions on the formation of the
new councils in relation to rates, debts and standards of service
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000080">New
councillors will remain in office until 2019, four years after assuming
full powers. Existing councillors will remain in office until 1 April
2015 and continue to exercise powers in relation to the day-to-day
management of council business, but not on transitional issues.
Vacancies in the new councils will be filled by co-option if they arise
during the transitional period, and any vacancies on existing councils
will continue to be filled by co-option until 1 January
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000081">The
order also introduces some temporary changes, required only for the
first election of the new councils in 2014. The first is in relation to
election expenses. The Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland can
normally claim an advance on his local election expenses before the
election from the relevant local council to allow preparations to be
made. Since the new councils will not exist before the election in
2014, this order makes provision for the statutory transition
committees established by the Northern Ireland Executive to provide the
advance of election expenses before the election, and for the new
councils then to pay the balance of election expenses after the
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000082">Secondly,
under usual circumstances the chief executive of each council serves as
the deputy returning officer. However, the open competition being run
for the chief executive positions in the new councils will not be
completed sufficiently far in advance of the election for them to be
appointed as deputy returning officers. The order therefore provides
for the statutory transition committees to appoint deputy returning
officers for the purposes of the 2014 elections, in consultation with
the Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission’s role is to
help ensure that each committee appoints a person with sufficient
experience to fulfil the role of deputy returning officer. For example,
it may provide committees with advice on the role and 
<?notus-xml column=512?>functions of a deputy returning officer and the selection criteria used.
It will not offer views on the merits of particular
candidates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000083">Thirdly,
as noble Lords are aware, the Northern Ireland Assembly agreed new
wards for each local government district. The polling station scheme
for local elections needs to reflect this new ward structure. This
order therefore requires the chief electoral officer to prepare a new
polling station scheme before the elections in 2014. The new scheme
will be published after the Secretary of State lays an order before
Parliament grouping the wards into district electoral
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000084">The
order also makes changes to polling districts and places for elections
to the House of Commons, which are necessary in consequence of the
changes made to local government boundaries. Currently, the polling
districts and places for parliamentary elections are those established
for local elections. When the chief electoral officer designs a polling
station scheme for local elections, it will apply automatically to
parliamentary elections. However, some of the new local government
wards will fall between two parliamentary constituencies. As it will no
longer be appropriate to maintain the link between parliamentary
polling districts and local government wards, this order makes
amendments to allow parliamentary polling districts to instead be
designated by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the
Electoral
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000085">The
chief electoral officer will still designate polling places for
parliamentary elections and will be required to carry out reviews of
the polling places in 2014 and every five years thereafter. Such
reviews will follow the same process as that followed by registration
officers in Great
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:29:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:29:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13112654000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000131">4.30

set of changes being made by this order is to facilitate the
combination of the local election poll with the European parliamentary
election poll, which will be held on the same day in 2014. These are
practical provisions to ensure that the two polls work together and
include changes such as ensuring that differently coloured ballot
papers are used for each election and combining the process for issuing
postal ballot papers. One of the changes being introduced is in
response to a recommendation from the Electoral Commission whereby the
title of the election will be printed on the top of the ballot paper in
combined elections to help prevent voter
confusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:30:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000087">I
now turn briefly to the European Parliamentary Election Regulations
(Northern Ireland) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2013, also before us
today. This short set of regulations make additional amendments to the
European Parliamentary Elections (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2004,
principally to allow for the combination of the European parliamentary
poll with the local poll. The changes being made to these regulations
are equivalent to some of those being made by the Local Elections

Empey (UUP):</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister has little choice but
to bring these regulations before us, but I have to say that the whole
process is a dog’s dinner. Noble Lords will have detected that
in the regulations we are now creating three different classes of
councillor. One class consists of councillors in the existing local
authorities, which will run until 2015; another class consists of
councillors who will be elected in 2014 and who will run in parallel
with the existing ones until 2015; and a third class consists of
members of both the old and the new. On top of that, we have a
statutory transition committee, doing bits and pieces of work, which
will also be populated by councillors from the old regime.

process has taken 14 years, and we are transferring only one meaningful
power to local authorities in addition to the relatively small powers
that they have at present—which is in planning—and they
will have only part of the power at that. Pretty well everything else
has been held back by the government departments that have ground away
for the past 14 years and succeeded in ensuring that the local councils
that will be elected are not much more powerful than the existing
ones<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:33:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000091">I
will put to the Minister just one point about people queuing outside
polling stations and their votes being counted. In the past, there have
been cases where polling stations have been kept open and votes taken
after the deadline had passed; I am sure that the Minister is familiar
with that situation. I just wonder how it is to be policed. At what
point is a line drawn between when people can queue up and when they
cannot? Who will go outside and actually police this? Indeed, will it
be the police? Will it be staff under the control of the chief
electoral officer? Who will do this? I believe that there is potential,
particularly on dark nights, for confusion. Who will decide where the
line is drawn? A queue is outside, staff are inside, and more people
come along to queue. How is that going to be handled? When does that
process actually
end?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000092">When this
process began in 2001, one of the watchwords was coterminosity, which
meant trying to ensure that Westminster, the Assembly and local
councils were as compatible as possible in a boundary sense. Now we
have a system where they are utterly and completely incompatible, which
is another startling outcome of this process. Therefore, not only are
things more chopped up and divided than ever between different
parliamentary Assembly constituencies and local authorities but the
whole context of having local identity taken into account during the
local government reform process was excluded from the Bill. In fact,
the Boundary Commissioner was excluded from taking local identity into
account. Considering that it was local government reform, I just leave
with the Committee the thought that it seems the most bizarre process
to have entered
into<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:35:59"></hs_TimeCode>. There was
the most flagrant political gerrymander of the city of

scheme that the Minister has proposed is required, given that we have
two elections on the same day which involve consequential changes. I
notice it is proposed that the ballot boxes for both elections will be
opened at an early stage when the verification is 
<?notus-xml column=514?>being undertaken. I assume that there are past examples of different
ballot boxes being in the polling stations, with some votes being
placed in the wrong ballot box, either accidentally or deliberately.
However, does that mean that there will be a joint verification process
on the same day or that the ballot boxes will simply have the wrong
ballots taken out of them and the other ballots will not be processed,
doing one verification at a
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:37:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112654000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112654000094">The
first election votes to be counted will relate to local government.
Although the European elections take place on the same day, as most
voting in Europe takes place on a Sunday, those votes will not be
counted until the following Monday. Therefore, when those boxes are

separation of ballots so that the votes end up in the correct

With regard to the Local Elections (Northern Ireland) Order, which

the elections are to be held on 26 May 2014. I welcome that. It is
important that local elections go ahead as, to date, there have been
many co-options on to local councils in order to address the so-called
problem with double-jobbing. Many councils have a high proportion of
councillors who have never received a mandate from the electorate. From
2015, when I understand co-option will stop, councils will be truly

noble Lord to the description of the roles of those councillors. There
are, in strict terms, three different positions, but there is no
duplication of councillor roles, because councillors elected in 2014
can exercise functions only in relation to limited transitional issues
before 1 April 2015. So there will be no duplication of roles, and
statutory transition committees will cease to exist 28 days
after the election. I can tell the noble
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:56:24"></hs_TimeCode>, from my
own experience as a councillor in Wales in 1995—in a
transitional council prior to local government reorganisation in
1996—that the transitional year was of tremendous value. It was
extremely important in establishing the new councils on their road, and
in enabling the old councils to fully wind up their

of who will decide who is in the queue, and where the queue ends. This
will very much be an issue for the Electoral Commission, which has a
key role to play. In particular, it will develop guidance for electoral
administrators, which is will happen in the rest of the UK, although in
most cases it will be obvious who is in the queue and who is not.
However, all these provisions should not make us forget that the
important thing is good electoral planning. The provisions exist
because in the past there have been problems with the closure of
polling stations, such as people being left standing

Empey, raised the issue of two ballot boxes being open and the
potential for confusion. I point out that the change of having the name
on the top of the ballot papers will reduce potential confusion for
electors, but there is always the situation where electors put their
ballot papers in the wrong box. However, it may eventually be decided
that ballot papers should all be put in the same box and sorted
afterwards.</hs_para>

The timing of the verification process is very much an operational
matter. It is a decision for the chief electoral officer. The purpose
of this statutory instrument is to make provision to allow things to
work as well as possible. The noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, is correct: it
will allow those able to view any proceedings for either the local or

pointed to the possibility of confusion. That can always exist when you
have two elections on the same day. Despite the names on top of the

possibility of confusion. However, this is a matter for the Electoral
Commission and the political parties. We encourage them to engage with
electors to explain the situation and make it crystal clear. I take
this opportunity to point out that we are very pleased with voter
registration as a result of this canvass period. The target was to
achieve 85% and they have already achieved 88.3%. In many ways, that is
an all-time record. The completeness of the register suggests that more

Empey:</Member></B> Perhaps I may refer the noble Baroness back to the
issue of queues. A great deal of the problem has to do with the
geography and where a polling station is located. Some are on the
street and others are in more remote areas that have a large amount of
land around them, whether that is in the form of steps, car parks,
schools or

about leaving this sensitive issue to the chief electoral officer.
There was a case in 2001, I think, in Fermanagh in South Tyrone, where
paramilitaries took over the polling station. They were voting well
after the polling station was closed. With the polling station locked
from the inside, they continued to vote. I am not making this

perhaps it is difficult for the police to function, depending on the
geography, I still have an anxiety as to who will decide. Does a
polling clerk, who is taken on for the day, come outside and say,
“Right, mate, you are the last one. That’s it”?
Who stays there to see that that person is the last one? Only the
person who has decided that he should be the last one can verify when
that last person comes into the polling station. I do not understand

thing is to know that if a polling station closes at 10 pm, that is it

Randerson:</Member></B> The noble Lord raises a significant point. He
is right to raise it because the experience of the last general
election showed that there were queues

from one place to another. That is why these regulations were brought
forward. They are intended to address that issue—which has not
been addressed in the past—and are backed up by the fact that
the Electoral Commission will issue guidance relating to these
regulations. It will be for the Electoral Commission, having issued the
guidance, and for the deputy returning officers, having provided

Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 gave the Secretary of State
the power to require all residential letting and property management
agents in 
<?notus-xml column=519?>England to be members of a government-approved or
government-administered redress scheme. This means that tenants and
landlords dealing with agents in the private rented sector, and

from 2.4 million households in 2005 to 3.8 million in 2011
and is still growing. We estimate that there are approximately
2.5 million leasehold properties in England. It is vital
that people living or owning property in these sectors have the ability
to complain if they receive poor service from their agent. This is
supported by good professional agents. The requirement for all letting
and managing agents in England to belong to an approved redress scheme
will weed out the cowboys who give agents a bad name. Just as
importantly, the scheme will drive up standards while imposing the
least regulatory burden. This order is the first step towards
implementing this
requirement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112659000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112659000004">The

makes provision for: applications for approval of schemes; the
conditions that a scheme must meet before they may be approved or
designated as a government-administered redress scheme; and the process
for withdrawing approval or designation where a scheme no longer
complies with those conditions. A government-administered scheme must
meet the same conditions as those for approved schemes, with the
exception of independence, as in a government scheme it is a given that
the scheme is independent from those who could be investigated by it.
These redress schemes will complement and not replace the existing
protection awarded to tenants and leaseholders; for example, the
consumer protection legislation and the duties of local
authorities.</hs_para>

into force, the Secretary of State will invite schemes to come forward
for approval. When the Secretary of State is satisfied that all agents
can join a scheme of the required quality, a second order will be made
that will require agents to belong to such a scheme. Article 4 sets out
the conditions that schemes must meet to be approved. The provisions of
the scheme must include, for example, what types of complaints may be
made, what the ombudsman’s duties and powers are in relation to
investigating complaints and what redress a member of the scheme may be
required to make to a complainant. Types of redress must include
apologies, explanations, compensation and making good. Article 4 also
requires schemes to have procedures in place to ensure that members of
the scheme deliver the redress that has been awarded to claimants. This
may include expulsion from the scheme if a member agent does not
comply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112659000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112659000006">We
know that consumers in the private rented sector are especially
concerned about the fees charged by agents, particularly when they are
mentioned only after tenants have signed a contract or invested

compensation.</hs_para>

to a scheme is introduced, agents who do not belong to a scheme could
be prevented from operating. To help enforcement of the
duty, Article 4 also requires schemes to have arrangements in place to
provide information to other redress schemes and to the regulatory
bodies. This will enable agents who do not belong to a redress scheme
to be identified and, in the longer term, will help drive up
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112659000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112659000008">We
recognise the importance of the redress schemes being seen to be
independent and of their operation being transparent. Article 4
requires scheme administrators to publish an annual report on the
operation of the scheme. Article 7 requires administrators of approved
schemes to provide the Secretary of State with information about the
operation of the scheme, enabling performance to be monitored. In
exceptional circumstances, where a redress scheme no longer meets the
conditions of approval, Article 8 of the order enables the Secretary of
State to withdraw that approval. This will help ensure that the level
of service and standards expected of the redress schemes are
maintained.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112659000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112659000009">It
is also important that there is competition between the schemes to
ensure that costs are competitive and that there is sufficient capacity
for all letting and managing agents in the private rented and
residential leasehold sector to join. However, we also recognise that
having a large number of schemes may cause confusion and that consumers
will need to have clear information on which schemes are authorised and

that this is just a sort of preliminary paper and that we will have to
await the next step before we know what on earth it is about, because
so much here is unclear.

who will make that annual report, and I should like to know what that
is about. Is it is a report by the ombudsman or by each person who
deals with the schemes? It is clear that there could be more than one
scheme. Multiple schemes could be approved by the Government. It is not
clear what exactly you have to do in order to be approved because,
again, everything is shrouded in those wonderful words that now enable

am mystified by the reporting process. Reporting is interesting and

action. They want to know where they stand, and it is only fair and
right that they should. There are currently a lot of cowboy practices,
whereby some invisible person collects insurance from all the
leaseholders, who find that they are paying a grossly inflated amount

takes me to the point that any of your Lordships who read your Sunday
paper must have seen: the story of this man named Jackson, who has just
lost his flat. He went to the leasehold valuation tribunal but was
foolish because he should have paid the £300 which was the
original dispute, as far as I can see, and then gone to the tribunal.
He ended up going to the tribunal when the maximum that he would have
to pay was £500. Your Lordships will all have heard before, and
I know that it is on record in <I>Hansard</I>, that I participated in
Committee when the Bill was passed in 1996 that set a maximum of
£500 that would be payable by any applicant. Now the whole
tribunal system has changed, and however bad and expensive it has been,
that is nothing to what it will be in future.</hs_para>

are asking whether anyone will be able to afford to go to the leasehold
valuation tribunal any more, even to go into the first stage. It was
always acknowledged that if it went on appeal up to the second tier of
the Lands Tribunal, that was where people who had big money would be at
an advantage. No one ever foresaw the point where even if you were only
liable for that £500 maximum, the other party could bring
against you QCs and enormously  
<?notus-xml column=522?>expensive people who would charge the earth and then you, as a
leaseholder, would find that it was billed back to you. The bill was
not being taken on by the head lessee or the freeholder but came back
on the person who had the cause for complaint. Will the
redress schemes set out here cover that sort of issue, or will the
situation be simply as it was for people such as that man?</hs_para>

happened to him. It started off as a minor dispute and he thought that
he would be paying just £500. Eventually, after it had moved on,
his legal bill was £76,000. I presume that everyone else in the
block of flats had a share of that bill, too. He waited for the work to
happen. A new company took over; again, that is rather typical of what
happens. Indeed, I have had what I describe as wonderful whitewash
letters saying, “We have been bad in the past but we are angels

there. She claims to have had a whitewash and was very much in favour
of the redress scheme. Perhaps the companies are reformed but we must
wait and see. The problem is where it may end up. This man received
bills to meet all these charges for three years, but no work was done
in that time. That is very unsatisfactory and I feel very sympathetic
towards him. For anyone to think that they are going into a minor
thing, designed for ordinary people, only to find instead that they
lose their home over it is a tragic situation.</hs_para>

back to the battles we fought in 1996 against all these prohibitive
charges. It will be very worrying for many people who now will not dare

believer—as I am sure everyone knows—in commonhold, the
system we have in Australia. There, no one is dependent on an
intermediate landlord and you all share the rights to your own
property. Here, the law demands that if you want to change to that
system, you need 100% of the leaseholders of the block of flats to
agree. Everyone knows that all you need is one crooked landlord willing
to pay someone to be the 1% that will not pass something and that will
never happen. The Government should—and I believe will in
future—look at changing that law so that it could be either a
simple majority or a possible one. There are people living overseas,
not resident in the place and not even knowing what is going on or
caring—sometimes they have so much money it does not matter to
them. Unless we can really change this and make it fair, it will remain
a great injustice that people living in a place will find that they do
not have the rights and control to which they should be entitled. I

Lady Gardner that it seems terribly short on detail as to
implementation. I am not much reassured by the fact that I am not sure
whether what I have here is an Explanatory Note or just guidance on how
the scheme will be carried out. I am not very reassured by the idea
that there will have to be a board for each of these schemes. It is not
at all clear of whom such a board would be made up. The board is there
to appoint the scheme administrator, but there is nothing else about
what the board is meant to do. The only thing it says is that if you
are under a complaint investigation you can sit on this board although
you cannot particularly make up the majority of it.</hs_para>

Gardner, who has been absolutely remorseless in getting all this right,

will happen is that we will talk about the ombudsman. There is nothing

still do not understand why the Government are reinventing the wheel.
There are already two established, OFT-approved schemes that deal with
letting and managing agents. Indeed, 60% of letting agents and all the
managing agents that belong to ARMA are already members of one of those
schemes. However, this order requires that the existing schemes must be
reapproved, on slightly different criteria from those upon which they
are already approved, and allows a plethora of others to apply, which
will be confusing and not in the interests of consumers. I have never
believed that there should be more than one ombudsman per industry. I
lost that argument with my Government, but there should not be more
than two per industry. Perhaps I can argue that. The idea of there
being four, eight or 15 per industry will only add to the confusion and
costs—and or course, it is not the consumer but the provider who
will choose which to go

expelled. Will they simply move over to one of the other redress
schemes, and will that scheme then have to accept them? If not, can I
be clear that they would have to cease trading? Obviously, we want to
get rid of people who, having been found to provide redress, do not. I
am in favour of that, but we need the Minister to clarify that that
would happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:36:28"></hs_TimeCode>.
This morning, in the Commons Delegated Legislation Committee, the
suggestion was made that a redress scheme could expel a member and that
it would therefore cease trading. We need to be absolutely sure that
there is the legal power to do that. Perhaps the noble Baroness can
confirm
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:36:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000010">Related
to that, the Government will obviously need to have an appropriate
sanction for agents who refuse to sign up to a redress scheme, and it
must be strong enough to be a deterrent. It probably has to mean that
they cannot continue to trade. Otherwise, it would always be in their
interests not to join an ombudsman scheme. Perhaps we could have
clarification on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:37:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000011">Fourthly,
there is the really important issue of client money protection, which
is a major cause of consumer detriment. There is a recent case,
different from the one that has been mentioned, of a letting agent that
went bust in Hastings and lost all its clients’ deposits. 
<?notus-xml column=526?>It cost landlords and tenants an enormous amount of money. At the
moment, there is nothing to ensure that that does not happen
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:37:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000012">Client
money protection is the only way to ensure that deposits, forward
rents, payments for repairs, and so on, are kept safe. The
Government’s words on this are a bit unclear. I think that it
should be a condition of belonging to a redress scheme that there is
client money protection, but the draft conditions that were published
earlier this month state that in making a judgment, the ombudsman
scheme would have to take account of whether the letting or management
agents
were:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13112671000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000088">“Treating

fifth question is: what are the Government’s plans for ensuring
that the other 40% of letting agents—I am less sure of the other
figures—are signed up to a redress system, and what will be the
penalty if they do not join? We hope that it will be that they have to
cease to trade. But who will be responsible for that compliance? Who
will go around identifying letting or managing agents who are not
members of a scheme? I hope that consumers will not be expected to do
it, and that plans are in place to deal with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:39:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000014">The
Government seem to want ombudsmen to run a sort of two-tier scheme.
They are very keen for agents to join, but they say they should be able
to do so without signing up to a code of practice. So they envisage a
two-tier scheme where agents can choose whether or not to adhere to a
code of conduct or practice, which seems absurd. The very least we can
do is to say that any scheme must make it clear that when an ombudsman
comes to a judgment it will be not—in the woolly phrase of the
moment—on generally accepted principles of best practice, but
according to a code. I assume the Government share our concern to raise
standards, but if we are not going to enforce a code by taking
ombudsmen’s judgments in line with it, we cannot do that. I do
not see how the requirements for transparency proposed by the noble
Baroness, Lady Gardner, are going to be enforced if there is no code
that requires transparency and against which the ombudsman can take
decisions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:41:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000015">My
sixth question is: what are the Government going to do to inform
consumers about their rights to redress? There were comments about
making information from the scheme available to other schemes, and to
anyone who regulates letting agency work, despite the
Government’s refusal to set up a regulator for letting agencies,
as I had wanted—but never mind. However, there does not seem to
be a requirement for the list to be made available to the public,
although surely it is the public who need to know which redress scheme

expect to be able to answer some of the points raised today when we get

which sets out the criteria and process for approving schemes. The next
stage is for schemes to come forward, and the third and final stage is
to lay an order which would bring into force the legal requirement for

whether there is a risk of too many schemes coming into force—a
point raised by my noble friends Lady Gardner and Lady Hanham—as
I said in moving the regulations, Article 6 makes it clear that the
Secretary of State should have regard to the number of schemes that
are, or are likely to become, approved schemes or
government-administered redress schemes when deciding whether it is in
the best interests of complainants and members to approve a scheme.
This would require the Secretary of State to look at any scheme brought
forward—other than the two I have just mentioned—but the
power is there for the Secretary of State to conclude that there are
adequate schemes already in place and that there might be a detrimental
effect if more schemes were approved. We have considered and taken

someone can join a scheme after being expelled from another scheme. We

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, the millennium development goals, or
MDGs, helped to channel political commitment and investment to bring
about reductions in poverty and child mortality and improvements in
health and education. They expire in 2015. This presents me with an
opportunity to advocate today the inclusion of an integrated early
childhood development target in the post-2015 agenda. In this debate, I
hope to demonstrate that we need a measurable and actionable ECD goal
to reduce by half the number of children under five who fail to reach
their potential. This will not only strengthen progress towards the
health and well-being of all children but also help reduce the
intergenerational transmission of poverty and
inequality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000031">My
right honourable friend David Cameron, our Prime Minister, is one of
three co-chairs of the high-level panel appointed by the United
Nations. This panel is one of the elements which, working together with
others, will craft the new goals. It is intended that the post-2015
goals will be more inclusive of various stakeholders than before and
have an agenda that builds on the strengths of the MDGs but also
addresses their shortfalls. They should be implemented by all
countries, not just those in the developing
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000032">Why are
we talking about early childhood development today? It is because focus
on early childhood holds the long-term solutions to solving the
economic and social problems of intergenerational poverty, and to
achieving world peace and our environmental survival. That may sound
like a very big claim, but mountains of evidence from almost every
discipline come to one conclusion: the earliest years of life can give
us the strongest foundation for individual, societal, national and
global sustainable development. Research has shown that the key to the
survival of our species is our long early childhood. This is the period
of our lives when we are at our most vulnerable but, because we take so
many years to develop to maturity, there is time for our brains to
develop into much more complex organs, capable of more complex thought
and action than any other
species.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000033">Evidence
from neuroscience has shown that when a baby is born, its billions of
brain cells are mostly unconnected. To function properly, these cells
must be connected to each other, and these connections develop in
response to the baby’s experiences. These early connections form
the basis of personality and the lifelong capacity to learn, adapt to
change and have resilience in case of unexpected circumstances, as well
as physical and mental health. We develop these foundations at great
speed in the first few years of life and we never again learn so fast.
We also know that the quality of early care-giving can alter the
brain’s 
<?notus-xml column=530?>chemistry and structure. That is why we need to pay attention to the
early experiences of the world’s children, from before birth and
right through
childhood.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000034">Economic
studies have provided evidence that the largest returns on investment
are realised in programmes for children prior to primary school.
Therefore, although the MDGs have ensured that most children now attend
primary school, we have to ask ourselves how well they are learning
when they get there. Do they have the capacity to make the best use of
that education and of the best instrument with which to learn—in
other words, their brain? It is a bit like having all the parts of the
engine of a very fast Formula 1 car. If you do not put it together in
the right way and connect all the parts and tune them carefully, the
car will not go very fast. It may limp along, but it will not beat
Sebastian Vettel or Jenson
Button.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000035">Therefore,
I should like to highlight something very rare: experts from many
different disciplines are all coming to the conclusion that early
childhood matters enormously. At a time like this, when money is scarce
and needs are great, we must spend money smartly. The smart way is
early, because it works in two ways. Not only does it produce better
results, it will avoid the cost of putting things right when they go
wrong. Therefore, I argue that an early childhood development target in
the post-2015 goals will help us to achieve some of the other targets.
The MDGs have achieved a lot, but the targets have not been fully
achieved, so business as usual is no longer an option. Transformative
and holistic solutions are required, addressing the root causes of
problems rather than applying an Elastoplast to the
symptoms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000036">Let
us look at the role of early childhood programmes in achieving the
UN’s aims. Let us take peace, for example. There is
neurobiological evidence to show that in early childhood, we develop
the capacity to love, empathise and show compassion. Through early
childhood programmes, we teach children social skills and develop their
decision-making capability. Those are carried forward into adulthood,
resulting in better co-operation, aggression control and a reduction in
violence. Wars are not instigated by armies; they are started by
individuals who feel that aggression is the answer to their problems.
It is not very clever. Wars contribute to poverty and environmental
degradation, as well as suffering and
death.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000037">Let us
take sustainability. In early life, we have an innate capacity to love
nature. One has only to watch a young child with animals or in a
garden. It is very clear: if we nurture that innate tendency, we can
leave the world a generation of people who believe in sustainability
and care for the environment.</hs_para>

inclusive development. Here, again, when children are very young we
have a window of opportunity to provide good nutrition and care in a
responsive and safe environment. Early child development programmes
promote an equitable start to a healthy life, especially if they start
when babies are still in the womb. One of the greatest challenges for
the next generation is the inexorable rise of non-communicable
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung
disease and cancer. Although the symptoms of  
<?notus-xml column=531?>these diseases develop in adulthood, the foundations are laid in early
childhood. That is when we need to lay the foundations for lifelong
good

outcomes for the girl child herself and often also for other female
members of her family. Evidence shows that disadvantaged girl students
are the ones making the most dramatic gains from such programmes. In
Brazil, for example, girls from low-income families who attend
pre-school are twice as likely to reach grade 5 and three times more
likely to reach grade 8 as those who do not attend. In poor families,
when the mother is at work, it is often older girls who have to look
after the young children. If the toddlers are at pre-school, the older
girls, too, can attend
school.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000040">However,

the foundations for a generation that eschews violence, cares for the

Hodgson of Abinger (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by thanking my
noble friend Lady Walmsley for raising this issue today, because it is
one of the utmost importance. The millennium development goals were
undoubtedly the single biggest push to combat world poverty in our
history. Although they have succeeded in reducing poverty and child
mortality, unfortunately, there is still much to do. In that respect,
the post-2015 development agenda has a vital role to
play<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:12:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000046">Early
childhood generally refers to the period of a child’s life
between nought and eight when, as my noble friend Lady
Walmsley mentioned, critical development occurs—physical,
cognitive, linguistic and socio-emotional. I argue that this debate
should have a broader scope, because what happens in utero is also
critical<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:12:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000047">Research
into brain development and early childhood development has shown that
in utero development and the first three to four years are critical for
the development of sensory pathways for social and emotional
development. During the early years, the brain develops most rapidly so
that children can acquire the habits and skills needed for social and
educational success and self-protection. If that development does not
occur, children are at risk of mental health, learning and behavioural
disorders. Thus, those children will fail to reach their full potential
and may also become a challenge to their
societies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000048">MDG
5 focuses on maternal health and is one of the MDGs on which more
progress needs to be made. Although maternal mortality has nearly
halved since 1990, an estimated 287,000 maternal deaths still occurred
in 2010, with the maternal mortality ratio in developing regions being
15 times higher than in developed regions. Having a baby at a very
young age also increases the risk and it is estimated that 70,000
adolescents in developing countries die each year from complications
during pregnancy and childbirth. Thus, early forced marriage is a
factor, and FGM also increases birth risk. In those maternal deaths,
many of the babies will also
die.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000049">Although
more women today receive antenatal care, only half of women in
developing regions receive the recommended amount of healthcare that
they need. Still, today, nearly 50 million babies are delivered without
skilled care. The figures that are never produced are for those births
which go wrong and result in live babies that are damaged. Very minor
damage or slight oxygen deprivation can mean that a child will never
reach his or her full potential.</hs_para>

spite of four out of five children now getting vaccinated for a range
of diseases and deaths from malaria having fallen by a quarter, around
29,000 children under the age of five still die each day, mainly from
preventable causes. Although the death rate has nearly halved since
1990, these deaths mainly occur in developing countries. In sub-Saharan
Africa, one in nine children die before the age of five, while an
Ethiopian child is 30 times more likely to die before his fifth
birthday than a child in western 
<?notus-xml column=533?>Europe. Children born into poverty are almost twice as likely to die
before the age of five as those from wealthier families. The majority
of those living in extreme poverty are female, and they are the ones
who will struggle most to raise their children.</hs_para>

the development of a baby and very young child, and of course the
mother plays a vital role. To provide good care to her child, the
mother’s health and well-being are essential. It is estimated
that one in seven women in the UK experience some degree of depression
after giving birth, but in developing countries there are simply no
statistics about this. Yet we know that when mothers have depression,
it can affect the bonding process and thus the child’s
development, so postnatal care is extremely important. However, such
healthcare may be scarce in many developing countries.</hs_para>

child’s early life are formative and play a critical role in
shaping the way a child develops, and thus in building human capital
and promoting economic productivity in later life. Yesterday was the
International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Nearly
a third of women who have been in a relationship have experienced
physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of a partner. For a young
child, seeing his or her mother being beaten up is a terrifying
experience and one which will affect them for the rest of their
lives.</hs_para>

and violence is the most fundamental human entitlement. War tears
children’s lives apart and has a devastating effect on their
development. Young children who live in war zones or who are refugees
will be severely affected by what they have seen and experienced.
Today, it is said to more dangerous to be a woman or a child in war
than a soldier. Not only is there imminent physical danger but,
usually, a lack of food, an interruption of education and enormous
stress. A UNICEF report estimates that during the past decade, through
conflict: 2 million children have been killed; 4 million to 5 million
have been disabled; 12 million left homeless; more than 1
million left orphaned or separated from their parents; and some 10
million have been psychologically traumatised.</hs_para>

visited Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Meeting some of the families
camping in the Bekaa valley gave me some understanding on how hard it
was to look after children under such circumstances. I met a
woman trying to care for her eight children in a small tent. Having
insufficient sanitation and very little clean water meant that
maintaining hygiene was especially difficult in those conditions.
Diarrhoea was already starting to spread through the camp, which can be
fatal for very small and vulnerable children. While the women were
trying to look after the children, the men who were there had nothing
to do and were frustrated by their situation. We heard that domestic
violence was rising. Trying to resolve conflict and promoting peace are
also essential for ensuring good childhood
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000055">Today,
in spite of relatively improved nutrition, it is estimated that more
than 200 million under-fives in low and middle-income countries will
not reach their  
<?notus-xml column=534?>developmental potential. Children are central to sustainable
development. Current and future global development goals, including
education goals, will be met only with attention to the overall
development of young children, which will involve the rolling out of
global and localised maternal and children’s healthcare.
Dedicated political support is now required to ensure that there is a
focus on guaranteeing that every child around the world is given the
very best chance for the very best start in
life.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_26_PT_1/2480DD1F83A172BB0BD28324194B259E20975E1E" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 November 2013">Tuesday,

Tyler of Enfield (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the inclusion of an early
childhood development target in the post-2015 UN millennium development
goals would be a hugely important action on behalf of children around
the world. I agree with my noble friend Lady Walmsley—I
congratulate her on securing this debate—that a global focus on
early childhood development is essential as we move into a post-2015
global agenda. I also agree that the UK should be playing a
leadership role in this crucial issue. However, if we are to take the
lead on early childhood development we need to look long and hard at
our own domestic policies to ensure that we truly are a world leader in
our policies on early childhood. We must be seen to practice what we
preach. That will be part of my focus
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000057">There
is no escaping the unfortunate fact that of the children born around
the UK today each will be born with different life chances. Sadly these
chances will depend not on innate ability but, in large measure, upon
the economic and social conditions into which these children are born.
Of course, this inequality is magnified many times over for children
living in countries with high levels of absolute
poverty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000058">As
policy makers, the natural question to ask ourselves is this: what can
be done to improve the life chances of children, both in this country
and around the world? To draw an analogy, last year the All-Party Group
on Social Mobility, of which I am vice-chair, published a report
entitled <I>Seven Key Truths about Social Mobility</I>. The first of
those key truths—the one highlighted by my noble friend Lady
Walmsley in her speech—is that the point of greatest leverage is
what happens to a person between birth and the age of three. Basic
cost-effective interventions in the first few years of life can pay big
dividends later on in a person’s overall chances of a healthy
and fulfilling
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000059">In the
light of these conclusions, early childhood development emerges as one
of the key issues for any policy maker or legislator who is seriously
concerned about a fair chance in life for all our children. It is my
hope that in the coming years the UK will lead the push, both
internationally and at home, to put a strong emphasis on ensuring that
all young children have that fair chance for a fulfilling
life.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112671000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000060">In
addition to the benefits of early years intervention, the <I>Seven Key
Truths</I> <I>about Social Mobility</I> report identified another key
causal factor in improving life chances, and that is developing what is
called character and resilience among children and young people. By
that term “character and resilience”, I mean those habits
of mind such as perseverance in the face of setbacks, sticking with it
when the going gets really 
<?notus-xml column=535?>tough, high expectations, confidence, self-esteem and belief that your
life is heading in a positive direction and that you can improve things
by your own efforts. These habits of mind are even more crucial for
children from far less privileged nations than our own. The inclusion
of specific targets for early childhood development in the UN’s
post-2015 millennium development goals should help to ensure that young
children across the world are in an environment that will promote the
development of these crucial characteristics that can make such a
difference to their later
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000061">So what
concrete interventions can Governments make in those early years that
might lead to the development of the resilience that I was talking
about? Given that most early years development takes place in the home,
the most important thing that Governments can do is to put policies in
place that support parents during the first few years of their
child’s life. Clearly a secure and nurturing home life during
those early years is crucial for a child’s development. Of
course, sadly, as we have already heard in the debate, in too many
countries that simply is not possible because of the social and
economic conditions, as well as war and
conflict.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000062">Many
reports, in this country and abroad, have pointed to the fact that one
of the most unhelpful assumptions is that people know instinctively how
to parent. Of course, all parents want to provide a nurturing
environment for their young children, but those from more privileged
backgrounds tend to take for granted both the resources and the strong
support networks that allow them to parent effectively. For those
without those networks, the prospect of parenting on a low income can
be extremely daunting. These challenges begin in the prenatal period
and continue throughout early childhood and, of course, the quality of
parenting varies hugely in both rich and poor households and rich and
poor nations. However, clearly, having less time, money worries and
fewer resources makes the job of consistent and attentive parenting far
harder. While what goes on in the home is, first and foremost, a matter
for families, Governments can do more to provide the resources to
ensure that mothers and fathers have the degree of physical and mental
health, financial security and overall preparedness necessary for
raising a
child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000063">As the
United Nations develops a plan for global action on early childhood
development, we need to look around the world for examples of
successful policies that really help parents. I believe that one model
for these efforts can be found in Sweden, where expectant mothers and
fathers are invited to join local groups run by a trained midwife to
prepare them for the birthing process. These groups do not disband at
birth but continue to meet throughout the first few years of the
child’s life to offer advice and support throughout the
parenting process. The data available so far suggest that parents find
these programmes helpful, as more than half the parents who join prior
to birth are still involved at the time of their child’s third
birthday.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112671000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000064">In
addition to positive parenting, we know that education plays such a
large role in enabling young children to develop into capable learners.
Although 
<?notus-xml column=536?>the UK is above the average for OECD countries in overall participation
in early-years education, a gap still exists between the more affluent
and the less affluent in terms of both participation and effectiveness
of early-years education, particularly in preparing children to be
ready to enter primary school. In its report entitled <I>Greater
Expectations: Raising Aspirations for our Children</I>, the National
Children’s Bureau—of which I am president—notes
that, while two-thirds of children overall experience good development
during early-years education, only half of children on free school
meals in the UK experience that good
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000065">So
what can be done? I suggest that there are three key components. First,
we need a strategy for ensuring that success in early-years education,
both in this country and elsewhere, is not tied to income. The first
step must be to ensure that parents of underprivileged children have
easy access to early-years education that is of good quality and
promotes good child development, both intellectual and
emotional.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112671000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000066">Secondly, we need good
practice guidance for early-years educators, which can be shared
internationally, in order to ensure that early-years education is
preparing young children to succeed when they enter school. This also
means ensuring that early-years education facilities are staffed with
qualified educational professionals, regardless of the affluence of the
communities they serve. We need to think critically about the nature of
the curriculum in the early years. In my view, early-years education
should have a distinct emphasis on educating the whole
person.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000067">Finally,
we need to understand and organise the way that we address the
interests of children and young people at the level of public policy.
This is what is so important about the specific inclusion of early
childhood development in the UN’s post-2015 goals. Currently, in
far too many countries the interests of children and young people are
addressed in a decidedly fractured way. Some issues fall under the
umbrella of education and others of health—physical, mental and
so on. As Dr Nurper Ulkuer, formerly a senior adviser at UNICEF,
remarked at a reception in Parliament on early childhood development
earlier this month, a unified, holistic approach is needed in order to
ensure that our children are physically healthy, mentally healthy,
socially engaged, and ready to
learn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000068">The
importance of this holistic approach is at the core of the push to
include specific benchmarks for early childhood development in the
UN’s post-2015 development goals. However, this shift in how
children’s issues are addressed can also happen at the national
level. In the UK, the National Children’s Bureau makes two key
recommendations in its report on how to organise policy-making, which I
think are equally applicable in other countries. The first is the
creation of a government children and young people’s board with
full ministerial representation. This board can help set the agenda on
policy that affects children across all levels and dimensions of
government.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112671000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000069">The second
recommendation is to look—in this country it could be through
the independent Office for Budget Responsibility—at the impact
of each Budget on child poverty and inequality among children. Both
these recommendations could help ensure that children’s 
<?notus-xml column=537?>issues are placed at the centre of all policy decisions and could be
used as a model in other countries. Of course, that is ultimately the
heart of the matter. Every Government around the world has to be held
accountable for the way in which their actions promote the well-being
and development of the youngest children. That is why I believe that
the UK should use its international profile to push strongly for the
inclusion of an early childhood development target in the post-2015
development goals to promote the interests of young children around the
world.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_26_PT_1/5BF416DBE545ACD69CB5F5722236DBE62F57D73D" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 November 2013">Tuesday,

report based its analysis on five transformative shifts, including the
idea of leaving no one behind. I welcome many of the recommendations in
the panel’s report, especially the objective to end
extreme poverty by 2030 and the bringing together of the sustainability
and poverty reduction agendas. The report is an important contribution
to the debate about a new covenant for development, but there is still
a lot of work to be done to ensure that the new goals and partnerships
drive the radical change which is essential if we are to be the
generation that ends poverty and safeguards scarce planetary
resources.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000072">Many
questions still remain on content, financing and accountability, but
the principles set out in the outcome document represent a good
starting point. Having said that, my hope is that the more ambitious
parts of the report, including its call for a stand-alone goal on
gender equality and women’s empowerment, will be built on as the
negotiations now move
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000073">The
five shifts I have described are only part of the equation. They help
to build momentum to meet our aspirations. However, goals with
effective monitoring will ensure that the international community moves
in the same direction. As we have heard in this debate, the benefits of
investment in early childhood development are strong, but the cost of
inaction is also very
clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000074">Science
has demonstrated that early childhood interventions are important
because they help to mitigate the impact of adverse early experiences
which, if not addressed, lead to poor health, poor educational
attainment, economic dependency, increased violence and crime, all of
which add to the costs and burdens on society. UNICEF and Save the
Children operational research published in 2003 revealed the
significant improvement in primary education grade promotion,
repetition and drop-out rates attributable to school readiness and ECD
programmes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000075">As
the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, children are central to
sustainable development. Decreased child mortality, relatively improved
nutrition and school enrolment may give a picture that the world is on
track on its promises for children. However, many of the children who
are surviving now are not achieving their full developmental potential.
According to an estimate, 200 million children around the world are not
achieving their potential because they suffer from the negative
consequences of poverty, nutritional deficiencies and 
<?notus-xml column=538?>inadequate learning opportunities. Moreover, 61 million children around
the world are out of school and thus at risk. If one digs deeper,
beyond national averages, there are widening disparities among regions
and countries and within countries based on wealth, gender and
geographic location. In the face of increasing conflict,
early childhood development is also considered an entry point for
peacebuilding in communities. Furthermore, as we have heard, good early
learning programmes can help to build the resilience of children and
families in emergency and fragile
situations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000076">Each
year, about 19 million children in developing countries are born
underweight because of poor growth in the womb. More than 200 million
children below the age of five living in low and middle-income
countries fail to reach their developmental potential. This failure to
ensure that children have access to early childhood development has
significant consequences for eradicating global poverty and achieving
sustainable development. These twin objectives cannot be achieved when
significant numbers of children start life at a disadvantage, one that
continues to widen as they grow and develop, and becomes an
intergenerational transfer of poverty. Eradicating poverty and
achieving sustainable development therefore require that significant
attention is paid to early childhood development and that strategies to
ensure adequate health, nutrition, stimulation and early learning are
part of all programmes to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:35:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000077">On
22 October in a supplementary Oral Question to the Minister, I referred
to evidence that investing in children’s earliest years makes
the biggest difference to their lives and to the country’s
social and economic fortune. I asked the noble Baroness then whether
she would support calls to put early childhood development at the heart
of the new post-2015 development framework. In response, the Minister
correctly pointed to the illustrative universal goals in the high-level
panel report, which highlight the new emphasis on, for example, good
nutrition, which is so important in the first 1,000 days of a
child’s life, as well as education—not just primary
education but a wider scope of education. The noble Baroness suggested
that, as concerns for young children are built into a number of the
goals, the early childhood development approach can be assumed to be
there.</hs_para>

goals to provide quality education and to ensure a healthy life, food
security and good nutrition are strong component parts of a
comprehensive approach to early childhood development. However, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Tyler,
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:36:56"></hs_TimeCode>, policies
and programmes need to be fully comprehensive if the approach is to be
carried through. They must also include parenting support,
developmental monitoring with early intervention, and
childcare<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:37:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000079">It
is important that we do not let up on making a strong case for these
important points of principle at events and debates in the General
Assembly throughout 2014. These will set the scene for member state
negotiations, which will culminate in the summit in 2015. Will the
noble Baroness give us some indication of how the Government plan to
highlight these issues leading up to 2015? I, too, would like to see
the good examples being highlighted. Can the noble Baroness 
<?notus-xml column=539?>highlight some of the programmes that the department is currently
engaged in to support the provision of a comprehensive approach to
early childhood
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:38:14"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112671000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112671000080">Children
are key stakeholders in the future. The evidence shows clearly that
investing in children’s earliest years makes the biggest
difference to their lives and to a country’s social and economic
fortunes. Straying slightly off my remit, I am only sorry that since
2010 many of the Sure Start centres in this country have been
closed.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_26_PT_1/71369655C0BFB599B026AEFF137A71C5AF432121" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 November 2013">Tuesday,

for the MDGs approaches, it is very important that we seek to ensure
that we build on what has already been achieved and move forwards in
seeking the MDGs’ replacements, having learnt from what worked
in the current set and where we need to head in the future. The MDGs
seek the relief of poverty internationally and they use various means
to do that. As my noble friend Lady Hodgson emphasised, much has been
achieved but much still needs to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:39:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

goals, there is the aim to eradicate extreme poverty and to ensure that
no one is left behind, and that clearly includes children. I welcome
the opportunity to explore the core issues surrounding progress on
early child development globally and how those issues can best be
reflected in the post-2015 development framework.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112675000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000004">As my noble friend Lady
Walmsley stated, the case for a major global effort on early childhood
development is compelling. As she indicated, evidence from multiple
disciplines, including neuroscience and epigenetics, and across the
social sciences tells a similar story: that early childhood matters.
When everyone gets a good start in life, we are more likely to see
better education and health outcomes, and higher earnings with more
inclusive economic and sustainable development for
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:40:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000005">We
know that we need to emphasise child development, support for parents
and education in the United Kingdom, as my noble friend Lady Tyler
noted. Internationally, we are some way off our aims. Of those children
who survive birth, globally it is estimated that in low and
middle-income countries more than 200 million under-fives are failing
to reach their true cognitive development potential and that 165
million are stunted. However, of course, millions never even reach
their first birthday. Four overlapping constraints are at the root of
these challenges, and noble Lords have referred to them: poverty,
nutritional deficiencies, poor healthcare and inadequate learning
opportunities. The noble Lord, Lord Collins, crossed over all
those.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112675000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000006">The UK
Government have a long-standing tradition of engagement in development
and they work hard to improve early childhood outcomes globally. The
noble Lord, Lord Collins, and others have shown how desperate is the
situation of many children around the world, and he rightly emphasised
the significance of intergenerational poverty.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=540?><hs_para UID="13112675000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000007">To achieve their full
potential, it is essential that children have a healthy and nutritious
start to life, as my noble friend Lady Hodgson and the noble Lord, Lord
Collins, emphasised, and that they should be supported by mothers who
are in good health themselves. DfID funding for family planning is
helping to avert 2.6 million unwanted pregnancies and prevent 70,000
deaths during pregnancy, childbirth and infancy. The benefits of family
planning go well beyond the health sector. Evidence shows that when
families are able to choose the number of children they have, they
choose to have fewer children and do more for them. They particularly
choose to invest in their children’s education. As my noble
friend Lady Hodgson pointed out, paternal health is critical before,
during and after
birth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:43:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112675000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000008">My noble friend also
pointed out the importance of good nutrition, as did the noble Lord,
Lord Collins. We recognise that good nutrition is essential,
particularly in a child’s first 1,000 days—from
conception to their second birthday—to ensure that they reach
their full physical and cognitive potential. Noble Lords will no doubt
remember the Nutrition for Growth event that we held on 8 June. That
brought together partner Governments, civil society, business and
science to try to address the neglect of undernutrition. DfID also
supports efforts here to increase vaccine coverage and reduce avoidable
child deaths, illness and disability. Between 2011 and 2015, UK funding
for GAVI—formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunisation—will help to vaccinate more than 80 million
children.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112675000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000009">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T18:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is estimated that diarrhoeal diseases are now a leading cause of child
deaths in Africa and the second leading cause of child deaths globally.
After pneumonia, they are the biggest killer of children under five in
the world. DfID is committed to reaching 60 million people with
improved water, sanitation and hygiene—WASH—by December
2015. Through partnership with UNICEF, this includes WASH in schools
and WASH in health units. Globally, DfID is assisting pre-primary
education through core support to UNICEF—an organisation that I
know my noble friend Lady Walmsley strongly supports—the World
Bank and international NGOs, such as Save the Children, and through our
work directly with partner Governments. Ensuring quality early-years
provision for all when education budgets are already stretched is
key.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000010">While the
evidence base on the impact of early childhood development on life
chances for all is strong, the capacity and resources needed to
implement cost-effective, sustainable and quality programmes that reach
the poorest, which is what noble Lords have been emphasising, remain a
cause for concern. I hope I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Collins,
and my noble friend Lady Tyler that this is why DfID is stepping up
efforts with its partners, such as the World Bank, UNICEF and the
Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, to scale up programming
in this area. We are working with these partners to explore ways to
improve the cross-sectoral links between health, education, water and
sanitation and social protection, which is key here, in the provision
of services that target children from birth to eight years old. I can
tell the noble Lord, Lord Collins, that innovative cross-sectoral
programmes have already been developed in Zimbabwe and
Bangladesh.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=541?><hs_para UID="13112675000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000011">The UK is also currently
engaged in a range of research activities to fill gaps in our knowledge
of the impacts of early interventions and how they can best be
delivered. For example, DfID currently supports the young lives study
of childhood poverty, involving 12,000 children in Ethiopia, India,
Peru and Vietnam over 15 years. We also recently commissioned a
multi-disciplinary team to undertake a rigorous literature review on
early childhood development and cognitive development. That report will
be published soon and used to inform future research and policy
direction. I hope my noble friends are pleased to hear that.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112675000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000012">My noble friend Lady
Tyler spoke of confidence and self-esteem. I think she should stay and
participate in the following debate in the name of the noble Baroness,
Lady Grey-Thompson, which addresses such issues and which I shall also
be answering. I reassure my noble friend that in the UK we recognise
the importance of early years development. There is an overwhelming
evidence base from the UK and around the world that shows that
high-quality early education has long-lasting benefits for children. By
the time that children reach the age of five, there is already a 12%
achievement gap between those from lower-income households and the
rest. That is unacceptable to us, as a Government who believe in
opportunities for all children. The evidence shows that there are
social and cognitive benefits for children who receive good quality
pre-school provision between the ages of two and two and a half,
compared with children who started at the age of three or more. My
noble friend will know the details of the provision that the United
Kingdom Government are putting in place.</hs_para>

Walmsley asked how the UK Government can lead on the post-2015
development settlement. She referred to my right honourable friend the
Prime Minister’s role in co-chairing the high-level panel.
Through that, we were able to ensure that a commitment to leave no one
behind is at the heart of the final report. That is the key to all
this. The report, published in May 2013, recognises the importance of
early childhood development with illustrative targets on the provision
of pre-primary schooling, reduced stunting and wasting among the
under-fives and ending preventable infant and under-five
deaths.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112675000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000014">The
high-level panel gave us an excellent starting point for the next two
years of discussions on the framework to replace the MDGs. It is
extremely important that we focus hard on trying to deliver something
that is as comprehensive and deep-rooted as the proposals before us at
the moment. We will continue to work hard and actively with others to
highlight the important issues raised on early childhood development as
part of the ongoing dialogue on a post-2015 development framework. I
can assure my noble friend that outreach to civil society, businesses
and other key stakeholders, both in the UK and internationally, will
continue to be a key part of the UK Government’s work on
post-2015. I am pretty sure that my honourable friend the Minister of
State in DfID is having a meeting with parliamentarians in the CPA as
part of that. It was during the Prime Minister’s tenure as
co-chair of the high-level panel reports that those issues were brought

worrying that body image has become more important than health; that
the majority of young people would rather be thin than healthy. In the

to eating disorders, and girls who diet are 12 times more likely to
binge eat. However, a positive body image can help with academic
attainment, cutting down on smoking and teenage

need to understand that the relationship between body image and
physical activity can be both positive and negative. The reality is
that young women are 
<?notus-xml column=543?>facing pressure from many directions. For many women, a poor body image
and lack of self-confidence is the biggest barrier that prevents them
being active and it is easy to understand why. Bizarrely it is one of
the things that could help them. If you put “Jessica
Ennis” and “abs” in to a search engine, there are
pages that show how you can look like Jess in just two minutes a day.

through some of the other comments over the weekend, I noticed that
Chantelle Houghton—described as a former reality TV star, which
is a whole other debate in itself—was heavily criticised for
going out jogging in a pair of running tights and a cropped top. The
obsession with how quickly celebrities lose their baby weight and get
back into their pair of jeans puts undue pressure on others. Many of
the women's magazines are full of pictures of bodies which are either
beach-ready or not. It is hard to find many that do not contain some
diet that will help you to look like your chosen celebrity. I cannot
even begin to add up the number of women who get more coverage for the
colour they have dyed their hair than they do for their
achievements.</hs_para>

data that the YMCA presents is compelling: more than half the UK
population suffers from body image anxiety. Media, advertising and

society; and 95% of the population cannot physically achieve the
typical “body ideal” presented in media and

activity in schools is not going to right all those wrongs, but the
right PE will help. For most women and girls, we know that once they
become physically active, their body image and self-confidence
improves, leading to greater academic success and job prospects.

need to define a new language around sport. People often say
“sport” when they mean “physical
activity”—physical literacy as well as competitive sport.
You have only to mention PE to most women and they shudder. We need to
be clear in thinking about a health agenda and getting more people
active. Getting girls to be active will lead to more of them playing
competitive sport, which would be great. However, if the starting focus
is on competition, it is likely to lead to fewer girls being
active.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112675000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000027">Since
the Olympics and Paralympics, the Department for Education has
suggested that there will be an increased focus on competitive sport in
schools. That is fine for many. It would have suited me fine at the age
of 20 but not when I was 13. So why do we need to find a new way of
doing PE in schools? Evidence from the Women’s Sport and Fitness
Foundation shows that 46% of the least active girls say that they do
not like the activities they do in PE; 45% of girls agree that
“sport is too competitive”; and over a third of the least
active girls do not think that they have the skills to do well in
sport, so it is obvious that we need to do more to build confidence.
Some 75% of girls agreed 
<?notus-xml column=544?>that girls are self-conscious of their bodies and 59% of the least
active girls do not think that it is important to be good at physical
activity. In many schools it is okay to be a sporty boy but not to be a
sporty
girl.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000028">On
average, female athletes are more likely to have a positive body image,
and less likely to consider themselves overweight, than female
non-athletes. Earlier this year, I chaired a Task and Finish Group for
the Welsh Assembly Government, looking at the role of PE in schools. We
recommended that it became a core subject, and that was picked up by
the Select Committee on Olympic and Paralympic Legacy, which the noble
Lord, Lord Addington, sat on.</hs_para>

Sport and Fitness Foundation’s <I>Changing the Games for

Allenby MBE, an Olympian who is now a PE teacher, said that girls need
good role models. Keith Kendrick, who wrote on the website Parentdish,
said that he desperately needed Becky Adlington to be a strong role
model for his stepdaughter. Many women have written to me to express

now worry about their size and appearance, that body image is the

girls do sport, 29% said that they did it to keep fit, 46% said that it
was to lose weight or control their weight, but 44 % said that it

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for
bringing this subject before us. My point, as the token man in the
debate, is that although there is conclusive evidence that body image
is a problem that may bite harder on women, it still bites
men—and for virtually the same
reasons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:01:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:01:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

problem starts to manifest itself and where physical activity might
provide an answer. If you are doing a sport, the starting point is not
what your body looks like but what it does, and suddenly a change will
be there through physical activity. As an athlete it does not matter
whether you look like Adonis or like Venus rising from the sea if you
come last consistently. We have a little input there, a point where
physical activity and sport put in a reality
check<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:02:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000037">As
the noble Baroness said, what someone decides in a magazine is the
fashionable and desirable size and shape, or the best shape to hang
clothes on, often bears little resemblance to what most people look
like. The fact that tall, thin people are easy to dress and can model
the clothes, and thus become the style, does not change the fact that
to sell those clothes you will have to be adapt them to what people
look like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:02:42"></hs_TimeCode>. We
could go on in this vein forever—I admit that I have never been
able to buy an off-the-peg suit—but we have to try to insert a

reality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:02:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the language of weight. We talk about weight all the time and imply
from it that we are referring to fat. However, if you become more
physically active it is possible that you will gain weight because
muscle is heavier than fat. You can reduce all your measurements and
gain weight—that is quiet easy to do. Anyone who plays a sport
or takes a reasonable degree of physical activity will, at the very
least, increase the density of their muscles. So the language we use
and the way in which we approach this issue has to
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:03:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000039">I
have ranted against the body mass index, which was clearly designed for
an inactive person in the 1950s. I have been dead for 20 years
according to the BMI, as has every other rugby player on the planet.
Yet it is still actively used despite the fact that it has been proven
again and again not to imply anything. We cannot counter it because
people go, “Oh, that weight is not right”. We must have a
better degree of 
<?notus-xml column=546?>education about what is required in that, with an awareness that if you
are doing physical activities your body will change. For example, how
many tennis players look like models? Not many. Indeed, somebody
commented that the last female Wimbledon champion did not look like
that, and they got their knuckles severely rapped for saying it. We
must do something about that because this is a person at the top of an
area of very competitive
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000040">If

Looking at the same information as the noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson, used earlier, I note that it talks about people lacking
the skills to do well in sport but not liking the activities in PE.
That is not uncommon, because we do not invest in basic physical
literacy and good introductory skills. Traditionally it has been far
too easy to concentrate on the person who does sport naturally and
well—they get the attention, not the person below them. If you
do that, you allow for the idea of casual—use sport—I do
not like the term “non-competitive”. The fact is
we do not have that idea of sport. What you get is a long
structured list, and you are expected to turn up every week to complete
a series of activities. Being able to take on a casual, non-organised,
occasional type of activity with a degree of confidence means that you
will have greater enthusiasm for it. If, for instance, you know how to
hold a tennis racquet properly and can hit a shot that enables someone
to rally with you, then that becomes available, it is easier to do.
Racquet sports provide us with excellent casual-use sports activity.
You only need two or four of you to do it. My own sport, rugby union,
needs
31<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:06:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000041">We
need to get the skill levels, and the educational levels, right. Most
introductory-level types of education, even if they are based on one
sport, open you up to other sports: you learn the language of movement
and how to be instructed, and when somebody tells you to move your body
you get an idea why you have to move your body in order to be better at
it. For instance, in racquet sports you learn how to move your feet in
order to make a shot. This type of education has to be instilled fairly
early if we are to have easy access throughout. We can of course go
back later, but it is easier this way. We must try to get into this
structure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000042">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:07:47"></hs_TimeCode>
of the ways to improve the situation is to encourage more women to get
involved in coaching. At the moment it is quite common for men to coach
women; at senior level it is expected. The reverse is very
unusual<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:07:47"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is no great difference in the way a woman throws her foot to kick a
ball in the right direction to the way a man does it. I have not heard
that said and cannot see why it should be true. Yet professional
coaching at all levels, including high-level sport, seems to be
dominated by men. When we cut into this, and those sports involved make
it no longer noteworthy for a woman to coach men, we will have taken a
step forward. I do not aim for parity yet, because we must take one
step at a time, but we are encouraging women into some of the
traditionally male-dominated sports. Surely it is time coaching
followed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:08:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000043">To
conclude, if we encourage people to be active, and they see their
bodies as functional, rather than as clothes-horses, or something seen
as an image in itself, 
<?notus-xml column=547?>then we stand a chance of giving people a better body image, so that
they see themselves as individuals who do something as opposed to
someone who just stands there. Take the preparation of a male model
before a modelling job; it is described as being like the process a
bodybuilder goes through before a competition. After amassing the
muscle you go on a crash diet, strip away fluid then pump yourself full
of sugar to have your photo shoot. That sounds rather more painful than
Photoshop, and apparently it is about as sustainable in real life.
Across the board, we must get people more used to the idea that their
body is a functional thing that will allow them to do various forms of
activity. In this way we will start to attack this neurosis and
possibly take a step
forward.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_26_PT_1/189E6798FF603DDCA791DF4948AA455FEB2E5501" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 November 2013">Tuesday,

Kidron (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, given that both the previous
speakers are sportspeople of considerable stature, I will just add to
the very powerful speech of my noble friend Lady Grey-Thompson by
talking a little about the landscape in which young women grow up.
Unless we look at the entire landscape, we really cannot address the
problem of sport, and we will never get beyond the rather shameful
statistic that only 12% of 14 year-old girls are doing the recommended
amount of exercise. That statistic promises a multitude of future
problems for their health and probably for the public
purse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:10:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0001.htm#13112675000045">Adolescence
is a time of extreme self-consciousness as the body makes the crucial
developmental journey from childhood to adulthood. It is a journey
fraught with hormonal changes, where the relative anonymity of being
camouflaged in a group of little people suddenly changes when
differences in shape and image become very manifest. Clifford Nass, who
was a professor of communications at Stanford University, did a lot of
work on investigating the way that young people see themselves as a
reflection of how they see others. He found that the narrow definitions
of social success and desirability that are fed to young women distort
their self-image, and that heavy users of social media are measurably
more negative about their own image and emotional state as they seek to
emulate the unachievable. The message of that is almost identical in
the Government’s report on body confidence, led by the Minister
for Women and Equalities, Jo Swinson. It is in this context that we ask
young women to make mature choices about their
bodies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T19:12:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the biggest obstacles to participating is the question of what their
friends are prioritising. What we increasingly understand from the data
that we are collecting is that they are prioritising their bodies for
the way they look and not for what they can do, as the noble Lord said.
In this context, it is hugely important that young girls have safe and
secure opportunities to talk about their fears and anxieties around
their bodies, for example in high-quality PHSE, in addition to the
opportunities they may or may not have within their own families. It is
important that they see women celebrated for qualities other than their
ability to wear a dress, and it is essential for them to be invited
into the sports arena in a participatory way. There is some dispute
about competition, but I 
<?notus-xml column=548?>would say that in team sports you learn not only the limits of your own
body but the strengths and limits of other people’s
contributions. That is a social skill and a skill for life way beyond
that of an individual’s fitness.</hs_para>

England take a much stronger position on gender and make their funding

important is it for the young women whom we are discussing in this Room
that the vilification and objectification of sportswomen, such as
Rebecca Adlington or Marion Bartoli, to name just two, should be simply
unacceptable? Those women, both talented and triumphant in reaching
their aspirations—and ours for them—are a crucial part of
the solution. John Inverdale and Derek McGovern today are part of the

sports bodies—should speak publicly and loudly against this kind

delivers physical confidence and competence. It is essential for
health, and it plays an important part in rehearsing social

DCMS, the Department for Education and the Department of Health publish
report after report, all of which we were sent by the Library, yet we

begins to address the statistic that only 12% of girls undertake the

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, for initiating this debate today,
contributing in a thoughtful way and raising some important and
complicated issues, as did the other speakers. We have had a very wise
and well informed debate, and I am conscious that I may not be able to
live up to it because, rather like the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, I
can talk about sport more than I can do it. I occasionally put my
running shoes on—not often enough, I am
sure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000055">The fact
is that we have been faced with some pretty depressing statistics about
young women’s alienation from sport and exercise. If we are not
careful, this will develop—we can already see it
developing—into on the one hand an epidemic of obesity among
young girls and on the other a whole strata of young women with eating
disorders or who resort to cosmetic surgery as a solution. That cannot
be right and it shows a real distortion in the minds of young people
that that is thought to be the solution to having a beautiful body. If
we allow those trends to carry on, it is predicted, for the first time
since records began, that the next generation will have a lower life
expectancy that the previous one—and that when we have so much
good food and capacity for healthy living. It is a real challenge to
us. Meanwhile, as noble Lords said, an inquiry by the All-Party
Parliamentary Group on Body Image heard evidence that more than half
the public had a negative body image, and girls as young as five worry
about how they
look.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000056">We can
place clear responsibility for this at the door of the media. We have
heard some examples of that this evening. But that is an easy cop-out
because, in a sense, we all bear some responsibility for what has
happened. All of us, to a greater or lesser degree, have subliminally
absorbed some of those messages. Even people who should be more
intelligent and knowledgeable seek to improve their body shape and
allow their self-confidence to be damaged by images of people with a
more perfect body. For example, I think I have been on a diet for most
of my adult life. I am probably still on one. I am not quite sure when
the last one finished and the new one started. I would like to think I
am a sensible grown-up but I still allow myself to be trapped by those
sorts of quick fixes about how to get my body back in
shape.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000057">As
noble Lords have said, although exercise has a crucial role to play,
nutrition and the whole concept of food—understanding it and a
healthy relationship to it—are equally important in this whole
debate. For example, schoolgirls often oscillate between skipping meals
and snacking on calories at fast-food outlets. 
<?notus-xml column=550?>They get into a cycle of unhealthy eating and body rejection. The noble
Lord, Lord Addington, made the point that this is not just about girls
but about all young people, yet there is a particular problem about
girls. A research project by University College London showed that only
38% of girls had an hour’s exercise a day compared to 68% of
boys. We can probably all identify with that: it feels about
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000058">How do
we address this problem? We have to start with the school experience.
Regrettably, we are still picking up the pieces from the early decision
of the coalition to pull the funds from the school sports partnerships.
For the first time, we had a successful model of school activities for
all ages, combined with targets for every child to do at least two
hours’ PE a week. We were well on the way to achieving that goal
when the funding was withdrawn. Although some of the money has been
reinstated following massive protest, it no longer has the same
coverage, co-ordination or clout. In retrospect, that decision was a
disaster for sport in schools, particularly as it coincided with the
Olympics. It is not surprising that the recent Lords Select Committee
on the Olympic and Paralympic Legacy was so critical of what had
happened in school sports over that period. What steps are being taken
to retrieve the situation and ensure that, going forward, we provide a
comprehensive PE programme in
schools?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000059">There
is another aspect of school sports policy, one that has already been
touched upon, where the Government have been equally misguided.
Unfortunately, Michael Gove’s decision to focus on competitive
team sports has been a complete turn-off for many girls. This has been
compounded by the Prime Minister’s disparaging comments about
Indian dance. Sadly, both examples illustrate that the Government do
not really understand the psychology of teenage girls. We have heard
some examples of the problems of teenage girls and how anxious they
feel about being expected to join in some school sports activities. Can
the Minister reassure us that the Government have now got the message
that we need a range of exercise options to ensure the widespread
participation of girls in school sports?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112675000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000060">Surely, the strategy
has to be to start addressing the issue in early years. We have to find
ways of making sport fun; anything, I would say, to keep girls moving
so that they get to the point where they feel the natural high that you
get from exercise. If you have not had it once or only have it
occasionally, you do not crave it any more, but we all know that when
you are exercising well and properly it is both physically and, in the
same way, mentally rewarding. We somehow need to get them on that loop
of progressive physical and mental benefit. We obviously welcome the
money that the Government recently invested in primary school sports
but, again, we are concerned that it has a two-year limit. I am anxious
that that is not enough to ingrain a new sports ethos. Perhaps the
Minister can also address that point.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112675000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000061">If we are to be
effective, we have to create a “sport for all” policy
which is not just about the achievement of the most talented and able.
Sport in schools should be about establishing healthy lifestyles that
can lead to a healthy body weight in adulthood as well. As the 
<?notus-xml column=551?>noble Baroness pointed out, we need to break the cycle whereby young
girls are so embarrassed about their bodies that they refuse to wear
sports clothes, which they feel would expose them to ridicule. For
example, a recent study found that 41% of women avoid exercise
altogether because they are worried about their appearance and the
clothes that they would be expected to wear. A survey by the beauty
product brand Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty showed that 22% of
girls would never go to a beach or a pool for similar
reasons—because they are concerned about the clothes that they
would have to wear in their circumstances—and that is just very
depressing.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112675000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000062">We will not break these
cycles of the lack of exercise and body loathing unless we educate
young women to rise above the advertising and social media hype, and
love their bodies for what they are. There is a role for role models,
particularly sporting icons, but it is wrong to place too much emphasis
on them. What we need are images of women being active in all sorts of
aspects of their lives—as second nature and as an essential part
of their lives. Media coverage of women’s sports could also do a
great deal to spark interest and participation. We could also do a
great deal more to invest not only in women coaches but in local
women’s sports clubs.</hs_para>

Body Confidence campaign is a good initiative but it needs to be rolled
out as part of a comprehensive PSHE curriculum. Perhaps the Minister
could update us on the plans for the roll-out of this campaign. At the
same time, we have to accept that health professionals need better
training, so that they are better able, particularly in schools, to
address the issues of obesity and body image when they talk to young
people.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112675000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000064">I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that the use of the body
mass index as an indicator of health is very limiting. Perhaps we
should be looking at replacing it, or supplementing it with more
accurate measures of overall health, such as cardiovascular fitness,
waist circumference and body fat composition. There is a debate to be
had about that. Can the Minister confirm whether such a move is being
considered? Ultimately, I believe that we will only improve young
women’s body image and physical health if we can find a way of
making sport enjoyable again at all ages. That is our real challenge
and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on the
issue.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_26_PT_1/0C17FA96FED44E22B46DD21F38E3EA1807C1B8CF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 November 2013">Tuesday,

Northover (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson for tabling this important debate and opening it so
effectively. The debate has been wide-ranging, as was the previous
debate, and I may need to write to cover anything that I do not have
time to
address.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000066">The
noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, and other noble Lords are right.
There is no doubt that sport and physical fitness play a significant
role in promoting a positive body image among young women. Similarly,
women with good body confidence are far more likely to participate in
sport. Participation in sport does not just get women fitter, it
improves their 
<?notus-xml column=552?>resilience, confidence and self-belief, as noble Lords have said. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Jones, said, it is physically and mentally
beneficial. Noble Lords will be familiar with my honourable friend Jo
Swinson’s work on body confidence. I thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Jones, for her tribute to it and the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron,
for her reference to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000067">We know
that girls and women, in particular, but also boys, can have low body
confidence which affects their very sense of self. Low body image can
contribute to poor mental well-being, eating disorders and a number of
risky behaviours. As the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, made clear, the
media’s focus on an unrealistic image can be very damaging; my
noble friend Lord Addington also took up that point. It is not just
girls who are affected. Studies show that one-third of adolescent boys
have been on a diet to change their body shape. That is
chilling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000068">We
have been working with the media, advertising, retail and fashion
industries to encourage a more diverse and realistic representation of
human bodies. I note what my noble friend Lord Addington said about
what bodies are for, as opposed to what they might look like. Clearly,
the way that the media represent bodies affects involvement in sport.
Almost a quarter of girls aged seven to 21 do not participate in
exercise because they are unhappy with their body image. I was struck
by what the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, said about changing for PE and
games.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000069">More
than half of the bullying experienced by young people focuses on
appearance, so the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, and others are
right: poor body confidence can block people from involvement in sport;
yet involvement in sport can promote better body confidence. Sport has
the potential to show young people that they can master new skills and
increase their self-esteem, whether individually or in teams. There has
been some discussion of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000070">Physical
activity helps children developmentally and can often promote a sense
of well-being. My noble friend Lord Addington is clearly alive and well
despite whatever his BMI might be, which is clearly made up of some
weighty muscles. I can vouch for that by his effectiveness when it
comes to the annual parliamentary tug-of-war. You want to have him on
your side.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000071">The
point has been made to me that we need to help not just young women but
middle-aged and older women to tackle negative messages. We have packs
for parents and teachers of primary school children, which have been
developed with the Media Smart trust. They have been downloaded 35,000
times, so they are obviously being used. They will include a guide for
parents of teenagers during 2014. I hope that the noble Baronesses,
Lady Kidron and Lady Jones, will be pleased to hear about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000072">Obviously,
we recognise that competition is not for everyone—a point made
by the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron. Just as people are diverse, sports
in schools need to be diverse. We share the goals of noble Lords in
trying both to address body image and to encourage children, young
people and everyone to keep themselves fit through various physical
activities or through involvement in competitive sport.</hs_para>

that the Government remain committed to delivering a lasting sports
participation legacy from London 2012. The long-term trends show that
we are on track; 1.4 million more people are playing sport regularly
since we won the bid in 2005. We are committed to building on that and
are delighted that there are good underlying trends in the number of
young people, women and disabled people playing sport regularly. Recent
data show that 6.8 million women do sport at least once a week, every
week. This demonstrates an increase of half a million from 2005.
However, we are not sanguine about this and realise that it needs to go
a great deal
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112675000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-gc0002.htm#13112675000074">There
is still a gender gap in sports participation, but it is shrinking and
our ambition is to close it by 2022. That is why, through Sport
England, we have put in place a strong programme of different
approaches designed to get more women playing sport each week. These
include investing £2.3 million of lottery funding in the I Will
If You Will project, a year-long pilot in Bury that began earlier this
year. This project focuses on listening to why women are not attracted
to sport and exploring ways to give them the fitness opportunities they
want. There is scope to roll out the emerging solutions across the
country so that others can share in the programme’s insights.
There are now 100 girl-only satellite clubs in secondary schools which
offer opportunities to take up a variety of sports, including netball
and football.</hs_para>

Addington referred to coaching. Some 31% of sports coaches in the UK
are women and Sport England is investing £5 million to improve
the standard and availability of coaching. That includes a pilot
project to recruit and retain 500 new female coaches in the south-east.
The aim is to roll this out nationally from 2015 and to recruit up to
5,000 new female coaches. We recognise the importance of what the noble
Lord is saying.</hs_para>

activities, we recognise that we need to focus on the involvement of
women in sport at the highest level. That is why my right honourable
friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport recently set
up a women and sport advisory board. It has some impressive people
serving on it and they are already providing new ideas and support to
take the programme forward. We are determined to increase
women’s participation in sport, to raise the profile of
women’s sport in the media and to get more women into senior
roles within sports bodies.</hs_para>

this group will examine is how to raise the profile of women’s
sports coverage. In many ways it is encouraging to hear the noise that
is being made, not least by women journalists, about this and to see it
being pushed forward. Having been familiar with this field for many
years, it is good to hear different voices coming in and arguing the
same case. The Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation 
<?notus-xml column=554?>estimates that before the 2012 Games, only 5% of sports coverage was
dedicated to women’s sport. While broadcasters, in particular,
have improved things recently, we are always looking at ways of
boosting the media profile of women’s sport.</hs_para>

help make sports boards more balanced and representative bodies, and
Sport England and UK Sport are leading by example on this with women in
senior management positions within the organisations at board and CEO
level. I should tell the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, that we expect
all national governing bodies for sport to have at least 25% of women
on their boards by 2017, and 24 out of 57 national governing bodies
already meet this target.</hs_para>

Lady Jones, asked me about school sports. She will be aware that
despite the previous Government’s no doubt admirable efforts to
try to improve them in their time in government, and despite a
£2.4 billion investment, only two out of five pupils were
competing regularly, which did not seem to be the most effective way of
moving the issue forward. Schools obviously remain free to work in
partnership if they wish, and a £300 million fund has gone into
school sports, which is in the hands of head teachers. We are seeking
above all to increase participation for everybody right across the age
range. I recognise what the previous Government did and hope that we
can take forward that further and wider participation.</hs_para>

Lady Grey-Thompson, asked about working across departments. Sometimes I
think that we Lords Whips are joined-up government. I used to deputise
in health and DCMS matters, and I now lead for GEO and various other
things. From my time working across all these departments, I know that
these issues come up in every department and I assure the noble
Baroness that there is discussion between them. GEO is currently housed
within the DCMS, so Helen Grant is in both, and Jo Swinson is working
across departments from BIS to GEO and the DCMS.</hs_para>

about to run out of time. In conclusion, it is enough to make me weep
to hear about Rebecca Adlington. I know, tangentially, as it were, how
much she has put in to reach this point. My kids trained at the same
swimming club as her fiancé, Harry Needs, and I know about the
early mornings, the late nights, the galas and the falling into bed
absolutely exhausted. That is what she has done, and much more, to get
to where she is. She should be proud of what she has achieved, and we
should be proud of what she has achieved. As we celebrate
people’s diversity and encourage girls, as well as boys, to have

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My hon Friend the Minister for Crime
Prevention (Norman Baker) has today made the following Written
Ministerial Statement:</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112652000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-wms0001.htm#13112652000004">We have taken the
opportunity of the G8 presidency to galvanise international partners

Psychoactive Substances.</hs_para>

developed a consensus to share more information on the emergence of new
substances, their impact on public health and the supply routes. The
United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has launched its global Early
Warning Advisory to facilitate this exchange and the UK Government will
continue to work with partners to ensure it is used
effectively.</hs_para>

States agreed to work with the UN and the International Narcotics
Control Board to develop mechanisms to facilitate more systematic
engagement with source countries of New Psychoactive Substances. We
identified a need to speak with one voice to source countries, creating
a space for dialogue about substances of concern and pressing for
domestic controls in source countries and law enforcement
cooperation.</hs_para>

partners recognised the central importance of reducing the demand for
New Psychoactive Substances. The UK shared its experience of targeted
communications activity carried out over the summer and there was a
consensus that G8 and UN channels should be used to continue to share
expertise.</hs_para>

clear support for the reinvigoration of existing international controls
of New Psychoactive Substances via engagement with the United Nations
Office on Drug and Crime and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The
WHO has since initiated a consultation on re-energising the drug
control process, proposing initiating risk assessments on a number of
priority substances. We will continue to engage with G8 and UN partners
to support a robust and timely framework for international controls
which are fit for the challenges of the 21st century.</hs_para>

discussion on enforcement best practice. We identified real challenges
in terms of the paucity of the intelligence picture; diversity and pace
of change within the market place; and the global nature of the market
place and supply chain. Nonetheless, there was appetite for future
information-sharing and collaboration through the G8
mechanism.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112652000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126-wms0001.htm#13112652000010">We

follows the Commission’s Green Paper on convergence and will be

Its aim is to discuss whether and how quickly a revision of the
Audiovisual Media Services Directive is needed. In the debate, the UK
will emphasise its position that we are not yet living in a converged
world and that issues arising from convergence should therefore be
dealt with at national level. The UK Government has examined the
situation of the media and telecoms industries, drawn its conclusions
and published its strategy. We consider that the framework for this

a joint session, Foreign and Defence Ministers welcomed the High
Representative’s report on Common Security and Defence Policy
(CSDP) ahead of the December European Council discussion on defence,
spanning the three agenda items: increasing the effectiveness,
visibility and impact of the CSDP; enhancing the development of defence
capabilities; and strengthening Europe's defence industry. Member
States set out their priorities for December Council discussion. The UK
highlighted the importance of CSDP playing to its strengths as part of
a comprehensive approach to crisis management operating in partnership
with others, principally NATO. The European Council was an opportunity
to demonstrate political will to develop capabilities and to act: but
the package of proposed measures on the defence industry should not
impinge  
<?notus-xml column=85?>on national sovereignty, nor should the Commission develop or own dual
use capabilities. Ministers were unable to agree draft Conclusions on
CSDP at the Foreign Affairs Council, but following further discussions
in Brussels working groups, they were subsequently approved by the

respect of England and Wales, statistics on judicial reviews only began
to be gathered in April 2009 at which point a retrospective
analysis was undertaken. We can, therefore, provide data on judicial
reviews of unsuccessful applications made under section 133 of the
Criminal Justice Act 1988 in England and Wales since 2001.
30 applicants lodged judicial review proceedings. Of these
only 1 applicant has so far received a favourable judgment, although 16

demonstrates that local authorities will be held to account for the
education that they arrange for pupils outside of mainstream schools.
The quality of education provided in pupil referral units, alternative
provision academies, alternative provision free schools, maintained
special schools and independent schools that offer alternative
provision is subject to direct inspection. In addition, the inspection
of mainstream schools now places a specific emphasis on the use of
alternative provision. This accountability will be strengthened by
Ofsted’s increased focus on children in alternative provision
within the revised framework for inspection of local authority
children’s services, introduced in November
2013.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13112662000381" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131126w0001.htm#13112662000381">Schools:
